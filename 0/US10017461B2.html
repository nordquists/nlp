<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to ligand-functionalized substrates, and methods for preparing the same. The functionalized substrates are useful in selectively binding and removing biological materials, such as viruses, from biological samples.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Detection, quantification, isolation and purification of target biomaterials, such as viruses and biomacromolecules (including constituents or products of living cells, for example, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids) have long been objectives of investigators. Detection and quantification are important diagnostically, for example, as indicators of various physiological conditions such as diseases. Isolation and purification of biomacromolecules are important for therapeutic and in biomedical research. Biomacromolecules such as enzymes which are a special class of proteins capable of catalyzing chemical reactions are also useful industrially; enzymes have been isolated, purified, and then utilized for the production of sweeteners, antibiotics, and a variety of organic compounds such as ethanol, acetic acid, lysine, aspartic acid, and biologically useful products such as antibodies and steroids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In their native state in vivo, structures and corresponding biological activities of these biomacromolecules are maintained generally within fairly narrow ranges of pH and ionic strength. Consequently, any separation and purification operation must take such factors into account in order for the resultant, processed biomacromolecule to have potency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Chromatographic separation and purification operations can be performed on biological product mixtures, based on the interchange of a solute between a moving phase, which can be a gas or liquid, and a stationary phase. Separation of various solutes of the solution mixture is accomplished because of varying binding interactions of each solute with the stationary phase; stronger binding interactions generally result in longer retention times when subjected to the dissociation or displacement effects of a mobile phase compared to solutes which interact less strongly and, in this fashion, separation and purification can be effected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Most current capture or purification chromatography is done via conventional column techniques. These techniques have severe bottlenecking issues in downstream purification, as the throughput using this technology is low. Attempts to alleviate these issues include increasing the diameter of the chromatography column, but this in turn creates challenges due to difficulties of packing the columns effectively and reproducibly. Larger column diameters also increase the occurrence of problematic channeling. Also, in a conventional chromatographic column, the absorption operation is shut down when a breakthrough of the desired product above a specific level is detected. This causes the dynamic or effective capacity of the adsorption media to be significantly less than the overall or static capacity. This reduction in effectiveness has severe economic consequences, given the high cost of some chromatographic resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Polymeric resins are widely used for the separation and purification of various target compounds. For example, polymeric resins can be used to purify or separate a target compound based on the presence of an ionic group, based on the size of the target compound, based on a hydrophobic interaction, based on an affinity interaction, or based on the formation of a covalent bond. There is a need in the art for polymeric substrates having enhanced affinity for viruses to allow selective removal from a biological sample. There is further need in the art for ligand functionalized membranes that overcome limitations in diffusion and binding, and that may be operated at high throughput and at lower pressure drops.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In the article and methods of this invention, ligand-functionalized articles are provided by a two-step process of grafting of monomers (such as by e-beam grafting) and subsequent UV crosslinking of free, ungrafted ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable groups. Compared to the porous base substrate before surface modification, the ligand functionalized substrate typically has enhanced affinity for neutral or negatively charged biological materials such as host cell proteins, DNA, RNA and viruses. The affinity for such biomaterials allows positively charged materials, such as antibodies to be purified, as they are not bound to the ligand functional groups. The ligand functionalized substrate allows the selective capture or binding of target biomaterials by the ligand groups, while other materials, lacking the affinity for the ligand groups are passed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The ligand functionalized substrate comprises a number of components including, but not limited to, (1) a base substrate and (2) the UV initiated reaction product of a) a grafted photoinitiator group extending from the surfaces of the base substrate, with (b) one or more ligand monomers of Formula II, c) optionally one or more monomers having at least one acryloyl group and at least one additional free-radically polymerizable group and (d) optionally one or more hydrophilic monomers. Preferably the base substrate is a porous base substrate having interstitial and outer surfaces. As used herein, the term “acryloyl” refers to acrylate and acrylamide groups, and the term “(meth)acryloyl” refers to acryloyl and methacryloyl groups</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The base substrate may be formed from any suitable thermoplastic polymeric material. Suitable polymeric materials include, but are not limited to, polyolefins, poly(isoprenes), poly(butadienes), fluorinated polymers, chlorinated polymers, polyamides, polyimides, polyethers, poly(ether sulfones), poly(sulfones), poly(vinyl acetates), copolymers of vinyl acetate, such as poly(ethylene)-co-poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(phosphazenes), poly(vinyl esters), poly(vinyl ethers), poly(vinyl alcohols), and poly(carbonates).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Suitable polyolefins include, but are not limited to, poly(ethylene), poly(propylene), poly(1-butene), copolymers of ethylene and propylene, alpha olefin copolymers (such as copolymers of ethylene or propylene with 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, and 1-decene), poly(ethylene-co-1-butene) and poly(ethylene-co-1-butene-co-1-hexene).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Suitable fluorinated polymers include, but are not limited to, poly(vinyl fluoride), poly(vinylidene fluoride), copolymers of vinylidene fluoride (such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene), and copolymers of chlorotrifluoroethylene (such as poly(ethylene-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Suitable polyamides include, but are not limited to, poly(iminoadipoyliminohexamethylene), poly(iminoadipoyliminodecamethylene), and polycaprolactam. Suitable polyimides include, but are not limited to, poly(pyromellitimide).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Suitable poly(ether sulfones) include, but are not limited to, poly(diphenylether sulfone) and poly(diphenylsulfone-co-diphenylene oxide sulfone).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Suitable copolymers of vinyl acetate include, but are not limited to, poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) and such copolymers in which at least some of the acetate groups have been hydrolyzed to afford various poly(vinyl alcohols).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The base substrate may be in any form such as films or sheets. Preferably the base substrate is porous. Suitable porous base substrates include, but are not limited to, porous membranes, porous nonwoven webs, and porous fibers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the porous base substrate is formed from a propylene homo- or copolymers, most preferably propylene homopolymers. Polypropylene polymers are often a material of choice for porous articles, such as nonwovens and microporous films, due to properties such as non-toxicity, inertness, low cost, and the ease with which it can be extruded, molded, and formed into articles. However, polypropylene is hydrophobic. While it is desirable to render polymers such as polypropylene ligand functionalized, polypropylene treated with ionizing radiation is subject to degradation, e.g., embrittlement, discoloration, and thermal sensitivity, during or subsequent to irradiation, which therefore limits the ability to render such thermoplastic polymers ligand functionalized by e-beam grafting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">For radiation sensitive substrates, such as polypropylene, the present invention overcomes such polymer degradation by using a low dose of ionizing radiation preferably e-beam or gamma radiation, to graft photoinitiator groups and optionally grafting other monomers on a portion of the surface, then polymerizing or crosslinking any ungrafted, unreacted ethylenically unsaturated groups by UV radiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In many embodiments, the porous base substrate has an average pore size that is typically greater than about 0.2 micrometers in order to minimize size exclusion separations, minimize diffusion constraints and maximize surface area and separation based on binding of a target molecule. Generally, the pore size is in the range of 0.1 to 10 micrometers, preferably 0.5 to 3 micrometers and most preferably 0.8 to 2 micrometers when used for binding of viruses. The efficiency of binding other target molecules may confer different optimal ranges.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Suitable porous base substrates include, but are not limited to, porous and microporous membranes, nonwoven webs, and fibers. In some embodiments, the porous base substrate is a microporous membrane such as a thermally-induced phase separation (TIPS) membrane. TIPS membranes are often prepared by forming a homogenous solution of a thermoplastic material and a second material above the melting point of the thermoplastic material. Upon cooling, the thermoplastic material crystallizes and phase separates from the second material. The crystallized thermoplastic material is often stretched. The second material is optionally removed either before or after stretching. Microporous membrane are further disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,539,256 (Shipman), U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,989 (Mrozinski), U.S. Pat. No. 4,867,881 (Kinzer), U.S. Pat. No. 5,120,594 (Mrozinski), U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,360 (Mrozinski et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,544 (Waller), all of which are assigned to 3M Company (St. Paul, Minn.). Further, the microporous film can be prepared from ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,544 (Waller).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Some exemplary TIPS membrane comprise poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), polyolefins such as polyethylene homo- or copolymers or polypropylene homo- or copolymers, vinyl-containing polymers or copolymers such as ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers and butadiene-containing polymers or copolymers, and acrylate-containing polymers or copolymers. For some applications, a TIPS membrane comprising PVDF is particularly desirable. TIPS membranes comprising PVDF are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,338,692 (Smith et al.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In another exemplary embodiment the porous bases substrate comprises a nylon microporous film or sheet, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,056,529 (Meyering et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 6,267,916 (Meyering et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 6,413,070 (Meyering et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 6,776,940 (Meyering et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 3,876,738 (Marinacchio et al.), U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,928,517, 4,707,265 (Knight et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,782 (Hou et al.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In other embodiments, the porous base substrate is a nonwoven web which may include nonwoven webs manufactured by any of the commonly known processes for producing nonwoven webs. As used herein, the term “nonwoven web” refers to a fabric that has a structure of individual fibers or filaments which are randomly and/or unidirectionally interlaid in a mat-like fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the fibrous nonwoven web can be made by carded, air laid, spunlaced, spunbonding or melt-blowing techniques or combinations thereof. Spunbonded fibers are typically small diameter fibers that are formed by extruding molten thermoplastic polymer as filaments from a plurality of fine, usually circular capillaries of a spinneret with the diameter of the extruded fibers being rapidly reduced. Meltblown fibers are typically formed by extruding the molten thermoplastic material through a plurality of fine, usually circular, die capillaries as molten threads or filaments into a high velocity, usually heated gas (e.g. air) stream which attenuates the filaments of molten thermoplastic material to reduce their diameter. Thereafter, the meltblown fibers are carried by the high velocity gas stream and are deposited on a collecting surface to from a web of randomly disbursed meltblown fibers. Any of the non-woven webs may be made from a single type of fiber or two or more fibers that differ in the type of thermoplastic polymer and/or thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Further details on the manufacturing method of non-woven webs of this invention may be found in Wente, Superfine Thermoplastic Fibers, 48 INDUS. ENG. CHEM. 1342(1956), or in Wente et al., Manufacture Of Superfine Organic Fibers, (Naval Research Laboratories Report No. 4364, 1954).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The functionalized substrate has grafted groups attached to the surfaces of the base substrate which includes a) at least one photoinitiator group (or the reaction product thereof), with (b) one or more ligand monomers, c) optionally one or more monomers having at least one acryloyl group and at least one additional free-radically polymerizable group and (d) optionally one or more hydrophilic monomers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The monomers that are grafted to the surface of the base substrates usually have both (a) an acryloyl group for grafting by e-beam and b) at least one additional function group thereon, which includes a) a photoinitiator group to initiate the polymerization on exposure to UV radiation, b) a ligand group derived from monomers of Formula II, optionally c) a (meth)acryloyl or a non-(meth)acryloyl, free-radically polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated group for subsequent polymerization derived from the “c)” monomers and optionally d) a hydrophilic group, including ionic groups derived from the “d)” monomers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Acryloyl groups, including acrylate and acrylamide groups are preferred for direct grafting of the monomer to the substrate surface due to the greater reactivity of such acryloyl groups on exposure to ionizing radiation, such as e-beam irradiation. However, not all such acryloyl groups may be “directly grafted”, i.e. forming a covalent bond with the substrate surface. Some may remain free, and are subsequently “indirectly grafted” by incorporation into the polymer chain on exposure to UV radiation. Other ethylenically unsaturated groups, such as methacrylamides, methacrylates, vinyl and vinyloxy groups, allyl and allyloxy groups, and acetylenic groups are less reactive during e-beam grafting, and are less likely to be directly grafted to the base substrate. Therefore a portion of such non-acryloyl groups may be directly grafted, but largely remain unreacted, and are indirectly grafted to the substrate by incorporation into the polymer chain during UV initiated polymerization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The photoinitiator “a)” monomers may be directly grafted onto surface of the base substrate, including the interstitial and outer surfaces of the porous base substrate to provide the requisite grafted photoinitiator group via the acryloyl group. The ligand “b)” monomers (of Formula I) may have an acryloyl group for direct grafting or a non-acryloyl group, such as a methacrylate group, for subsequent incorporation (indirect grafting) into the polymer chain during UV initiated polymerization. In addition to an acryloyl group, the free-radically polymerizable groups of monomer “c)” are typically other ethylenically unsaturated groups such as a methacrylamides, methacrylates, vinyl groups and acetylenic groups having reduced reactivity during grafting, and are therefore free and unreacted for the subsequent UV initiated polymerization and crosslinking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The acryloyl group of the “c)” monomers typically can directly graft (i.e. forming a covalent bond) to the surface of the base substrate when exposed to an ionizing radiation preferably e-beam or gamma radiation. That is, reaction of acryloyl groups of the c) monomers with the surface of the porous base substrate in the presence of the electron beam results in the reaction of ethylenically unsaturated free-radically polymerizable groups directly grafted to the base substrate via the acrylate group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">A fourth grafting hydrophilic monomer “d)” may also be grafted via an acryloyl group, and may provide hydrophilic groups or ionic groups to the surfaces of the base substrate. In some embodiments, hydrophilic monomers having an ionic group may be directly or indirectly grafted to the substrate surface to provide secondary ionic interaction of the functionalized substrate. For example, ionic groups may be selected to have a positive charge (at a selected pH) to retard or repel various biomaterials from the substrate surface.

PI* is the residue of a photoinitiator grafted to the substrate surface. For example a grafting photoinitator monomer such as 2-propenoylaminoethanoic acid; 2-(4-(2-hydroxy-2 methylpropanoyl)phenoxy)ethyl ester may be grafted to a substrate surface using ionizing radiation such as e-beam energy. In the presence of UV, the photoinitiator undergoes alpha cleavage to two radicals. In the presence of the ligand monomer, or other monomers, the radical may add to the ethylenically unsaturated group (such as the depicted acryloyl group) to indirectly graft the ligand monomer to the substrate surface via the residue of the photoinitator as shown in formula VI and illustrated in Scheme I below. It will be further understood that the radical addition to product of the ligand monomer may further copolymerize with additional ligand monomers and the other optional monomers to produce a grafted polymer having ligand groups pendent therefrom.

4) coating the base substrate (preferably imbibing the porous substrate) having grafted photoinitiator groups with a second solution comprising (b) one or more of said ligand monomers, (c) optionally one or more monomers having at least one acryloyl group and at least one additional ethylenically unsaturated, free-radically polymerizable group; and (d) optionally one or more hydrophilic monomers;

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The methods of the present disclosure involve the irradiation of porous or nonporous substrate surfaces with ionizing radiation to prepare free radical reaction sites on such surfaces upon which the monomers are grafted. “Ionizing radiation” means radiation of a sufficient dosage and energy to cause the formation of free radical reaction sites on the surface(s) of the base substrate. Ionizing radiation may include beta, gamma, electron-beam, x-ray and other electromagnetic radiation. In some instances, corona radiation can be sufficiently high energy radiation. The radiation is sufficiently high energy, that when absorbed by the surfaces of the base substrate, sufficient energy is transferred to that support to result in the cleavage of chemical bonds in that support and the resultant formation of a free radical site on the support.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">High energy radiation dosages are measured in kilograys (kGy), expressing an absorbed does of 1 Joule per gram. Doses can be administered in a single dose of the desired level or in multiple doses which accumulate to the desired level. Dosages can range cumulatively from about 1 kGy to about 100 kGy. Preferably, the cumulative dosage exceeds 30 kGys for substrate resistant to radiation damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Electron beam and gamma radiation are preferred for this method of grafting due to the ready-availability of commercial sources. Electron beam generators are commercially available from a variety of sources, including the ESI “ELECTROCURE” EB SYSTEM from Energy Sciences, Inc. (Wilmington, Mass.), and the BROADBEAM EB PROCESSOR from PCT Engineered Systems, LLC (Davenport, Iowa). Sources of gamma irradiation are commercially available from MDS Nordion using a cobalt-60 high-energy source. For any given piece of equipment and irradiation sample location, the dosage delivered can be measured in accordance with ASTM E-1275 entitled “Practice for Use of a Radiochromic Film Dosimetry System.” By altering extractor grid voltage, beam diameter and/or distance to the source, various dose rates can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The base substrate may be nonporous or porous. Some of the porous base substrates used in this embodiment can be porous, microporous, nonwoven, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">One exemplary method for making functionalized substrates is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, exemplary method <b>10</b> comprises the following steps: an imbibing step <b>100</b>, a sandwiching step <b>200</b>, an irradiation step <b>300</b>, a UV initiated polymerization step <b>400</b>, a peeling step <b>500</b>, a wash/rinse step <b>600</b>, a drying step <b>700</b>, and a take-up step <b>800</b>. Each of these exemplary steps is described in further detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Methods of making functionalized substrates of the present invention may comprise one or more of the following steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">Imbibing Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a roll <b>11</b> comprising a base substrate, preferably a porous base substrate <b>12</b> may be unwound so that porous base substrate <b>12</b> enters into imbibing step <b>100</b>. In imbibing step <b>100</b>, base substrate <b>12</b> is brought into contact or into proximity with applicator <b>14</b> that is connected to a reservoir of solution <b>13</b> containing one or more grafting monomers. Rollers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> guide base substrate <b>12</b> past applicator <b>14</b> so that base substrate <b>12</b> is exposed to solution <b>13</b> for a desired amount of time. Typically, the exposure time of the porous base substrate <b>12</b> to solution <b>13</b> is up to about 1.0 minutes, more typically, less than about 15 seconds. Base substrate <b>12</b> usually proceeds through imbibing step <b>100</b> and to irradiation step <b>300</b> in less than 1 minute. In some imbibing steps, the base substrate <b>12</b> is saturated with the solution <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">As discussed above, solution <b>13</b> may comprise one or more grafting monomers suitable for grafting onto surfaces or the base substrate, preferably the interstitial and outer surfaces of porous base substrate <b>12</b>. Any of the exemplary grafting monomers described above can be included in solution <b>13</b>. In addition to grafting monomers, solution <b>13</b> can contain other materials such as, for example, one or more other non-grafting monomers for UV curing, and solvents. The concentration of each grafting monomer in solution <b>13</b> may vary depending on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the grafting monomer or monomers in solution <b>13</b>, the extent of grafting desired, the reactivity of the grafting monomer(s), and the solvent used. Typically, the concentration of each monomer in solution <b>13</b> ranges from about 1 wt % to about 100 wt %, desirably, from about 5 wt % to about 30 wt %, and more desirably from about 10 wt % to about 20 wt % based on a total weight of solution <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Once base substrate <b>12</b> has been imbibed in solution <b>13</b> for a desired period of time, the base substrate <b>12</b> is directed toward sandwiching step <b>200</b> via guide roller <b>17</b>. Guide roller <b>17</b> may be used to meter excess solution <b>13</b> from the imbibed base substrate <b>12</b> if so desired. Alternately, rollers (not shown) could be used to squeeze air bubbles and excess solution <b>13</b> from the imbibed base substrate <b>12</b>. Typically, base substrate <b>12</b> enters sandwiching step <b>200</b> in a substantially saturated condition (i.e., base substrate <b>12</b> contains a maximum amount of solution <b>13</b> or close to a maximum amount) wherein substantially all the surface(s), preferably all the interstitial and outer surfaces of porous base substrate <b>12</b> are coated with solution <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">It should be noted that imbibing step <b>100</b> is only one possible method of introducing solution <b>13</b> into porous base substrate <b>12</b>. Other suitable methods include, but are not limited to, a spray coating, flood coating, knife coating, Meyer bar coating, dip coating, and gravure coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">Sandwiching Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">In sandwiching step <b>200</b>, imbibed base substrate <b>12</b> is sandwiched (i.e., positioned) between a removable carrier layer <b>22</b> and a removable cover layer <b>19</b> to form multilayer sandwich structure <b>24</b>. As shown in exemplary method <b>10</b>, removable cover layer <b>19</b> may be unwound from roll <b>18</b> and brought into contact with an outer surface of imbibed base substrate <b>12</b> via roller <b>20</b>, while removable carrier layer <b>22</b> may be unwound from roll <b>21</b> and brought into contact with an opposite outer surface of imbibed base substrate <b>12</b> via roller <b>23</b>. Rollers <b>20</b> and <b>23</b> form a gap that may be used to regulate the amount of imbibing solution <b>13</b> imparted to the porous substrate. The removable cover layers <b>19</b> and <b>22</b> serve to exclude oxygen from the subsequent radical processes and also to prevent draining of the imbibing solution <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">Removable cover layer <b>19</b> and removable carrier layer <b>22</b> may comprise any inert sheet material that is capable of providing temporary protection to functionalized substrate <b>30</b> (i.e., grafted base substrate <b>12</b>) from direct exposure to oxygen upon exiting chamber <b>25</b>. Suitable inert sheet materials for forming removable cover layer <b>19</b> and removable carrier layer <b>22</b> include, but are not limited to, polyethylene terephthalate film material, other aromatic polymer film materials, and any other non-reactive polymer film material. In some embodiments, removable carrier layer <b>22</b> may be selected from materials that are transparent to UV radiation. Once assembled, multilayer sandwich structure <b>24</b> proceeds to irradiation step <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">In irradiation step <b>300</b>, multilayer sandwich structure <b>24</b> is exposed to a sufficient quantity of ionizing radiation (preferably e-beam or gamma radiation), so as to graft one or more monomers within solution <b>13</b> onto surfaces of base substrate <b>12</b> so as to form multilayer sandwich structure <b>27</b> comprising functionalized substrate <b>30</b> sandwiched between removable carrier layer <b>22</b> and removable cover layer <b>19</b>. As shown in exemplary method <b>10</b>, multilayer sandwich structure <b>24</b> proceeds through chamber <b>25</b>, which contains at least one device <b>26</b> capable of providing a sufficient dose of radiation. A single device <b>26</b> is capable of providing a sufficient dose of radiation, although two or more devices <b>26</b> may be used especially for relatively thick porous base substrates <b>12</b>. Typically, chamber <b>25</b> comprises an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, argon, etc. with a minimal amount of oxygen, which is known to inhibit free-radical polymerization. In embodiments wherein base substrate <b>12</b> is irradiated without removable cover layer <b>19</b>, the amount of oxygen within chamber <b>25</b> can be more of a concern. When removable carrier layer <b>22</b> and removable cover layer <b>19</b> cover the porous base substrate <b>12</b>, exposure to oxygen within chamber <b>25</b> is minimal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The irradiation step <b>300</b> provides the further advantage of converting any dissolved oxygen to peroxy compounds, which would interfere with the subsequent UV initiated polymerization. Therefore the e-beam irradiation step <b>300</b> facilitates the subsequent UV initiation <b>400</b> by the removal of oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">Although other sources of irradiation may be used, desirably device <b>26</b> comprises an electron beam source. Electron beams (e-beams) are generally produced by applying high voltage to tungsten wire filaments retained between a repeller plate and an extractor grid within a vacuum chamber maintained at about 10<sup>−6 </sup>Torr. The filaments are heated at high current to produce electrons. The electrons are guided and accelerated by the repeller plate and extractor grid towards a thin window of metal foil. The accelerated electrons, traveling at speeds in excess of 10<sup>7 </sup>meters/second (m/sec) and possessing about 100 to 300 kilo-electron volts (keV), pass out of the vacuum chamber through the foil window and penetrate whatever material is positioned immediately beyond the foil window.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The quantity of electrons generated is directly related to the current. As extractor grid voltage is increased, the acceleration or speed of electrons drawn from the tungsten wire filaments increase. E-beam processing can be extremely precise when under computer control, such that an exact dose and dose rate of electrons can be directed against multilayer sandwich structure <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The temperature within chamber <b>25</b> is desirably maintained at an ambient temperature by conventional means. Without intending to be limited to any particular mechanism, it is believed that the exposure of the imbibed porous base substrate to an electron beam results in free radical initiation on the substrate which can then react with monomers having a double bond such as monomers having an ethylenically unsaturated group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The total dose received by multilayer sandwich structure <b>24</b> primarily affects the extent to which the grafting monomer is grafted onto the porous base substrate. In general, it is desirable and typical to convert at least 10 wt %, desirably 20 wt %, even more desirably greater than 50 wt % of the grafting monomers added during the imbibing step to directly grafted species. Further, it is desirable and typical to graft as much as about 5 wt %, desirably as much as about 10 wt %, more desirably as much as about 20 wt % (or as much as about 100 wt %) of one or more grafting monomers added during the imbibing step onto base substrate <b>12</b>, based on a total weight of porous base substrate <b>12</b>. Dose is dependent upon a number of processing parameters, including voltage, speed and beam current. Dose can be conveniently regulated by controlling line speed (i.e., the speed with which multilayer sandwich structure <b>24</b> passes under device <b>26</b>), and the current supplied to the extractor grid. A target dose (e.g., &lt;10 kGy) can be conveniently calculated by multiplying an experimentally measured coefficient (a machine constant) by the beam current and dividing by the web speed to determine the exposure. The machine constant varies as a function of beam voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">While the controlled amount of electron beam radiation exposure is dependent upon the residence time, as a general matter, the monomers imbibed on the base substrate <b>12</b> that is part of multilayer sandwich structure <b>24</b> will generally be significantly grafted upon receiving a controlled amount of dosage ranging from a minimum dosage of about 1 kilogray (kGy) to a maximum dosage of less than about 100 kGy, depending on the particular polymer. For radiation sensitive polymers such as propylene polymers the amount typically ranges from a minimum dosage of about 1 kilogray (kGy) to a maximum dosage of less than about 10 kGy. Typically, the total controlled amount of dosage ranges from less than about 9 kGy to about 7 kGy for propylene polymers to avoid degradation. Less radiation sensitive polymers such as nylons or PVDF may be subjected to higher dosages, typically 10 to 70 kGy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">While low dose rates and longer residence times are preferred for radiation grafting, practical operation may necessitate speeds that force higher dose rates and shorter residence. Exclusion of oxygen in a multilayer sandwich allows free radical chemistry to continue after ionizing radiation exposure for duration sufficient to improve the grafting yield. Although not depicted, in some embodiments the method may comprise additional imbibing and grafting steps, followed by a UV curing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">UV Curing Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">In UV irradiation step <b>400</b>, multilayer sandwich structure <b>24</b> is exposed to a sufficient quantity of ultraviolet radiation so as to initiate free radical polymerization between the grafted photoinitiator groups and any free, unreacted acryloyl groups and/or other ethylenically unsaturated groups. The polymerization of the unreacted ethylenically unsaturated groups onto the grafted surfaces of base substrate <b>12</b> forms multilayer sandwich structure <b>27</b> comprising functionalized substrate <b>30</b> sandwiched between removable carrier layer <b>22</b> and removable cover layer <b>19</b>. As shown in exemplary method <b>10</b>, multilayer sandwich structure <b>24</b> proceeds through chamber <b>40</b>, which contains at least one device <b>41</b> capable of providing a sufficient dose of UV radiation. A single device <b>41</b> is capable of providing a sufficient dose of radiation, although two or more devices <b>41</b> may be used especially for relatively thick base substrates <b>12</b> or to double the lamp output. Upon UV irradiation, essentially all remaining acryloyl and non-acryloyl groups are incorporated into a polymer coating on the surfaces of the base substrate <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Typically, chamber <b>40</b> comprises an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, argon, etc. with a minimal amount of oxygen, which is known to inhibit free-radical polymerization. In embodiments wherein base substrate <b>12</b> is irradiated without removable cover layer <b>19</b>, the amount of oxygen within chamber <b>25</b> can be more of a concern. When removable carrier layer <b>22</b> and removable cover layer <b>19</b> cover the base substrate <b>12</b>, exposure to oxygen within chamber <b>25</b> is minimal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">UV light sources can be relatively low light intensity sources such as blacklights which provide generally 10 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less (as measured in accordance with procedures approved by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology as, for example, with a UVIMAP™ UM 365 L-S radiometer manufactured by Electronic Instrumentation &amp; Technology, Inc., in Sterling, Va.) over a wavelength range of 280 to 400 nanometers, or relatively high light intensity sources such as medium pressure mercury lamps which provide intensities generally greater than 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, preferably between 15 and 450 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Where UV radiation is used to fully or partially polymerize the composition, moderate intensities and longer exposure times are preferred. For example, an intensity of about 10 to 50 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>and an exposure time of about 1 to 5 seconds may be used successfully. A preferred UV source is the Quant48™ UV Curing System from Quantum Technologies, Irvine, Calif.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">Peeling Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Upon exiting chamber <b>25</b>, multilayer sandwich structure <b>27</b> proceeds toward peeling step <b>500</b>. In peeling step <b>500</b>, multilayer sandwich structure <b>27</b> is disassembled by separating removable carrier layer <b>22</b> and removable cover layer <b>19</b> from functionalized substrate <b>30</b>. As shown in exemplary method <b>10</b>, removable cover layer <b>19</b> is separated from an outer surface of functionalized substrate <b>30</b> and taken-up as roll <b>28</b>, while removable carrier layer <b>22</b> is separated from an opposite outer surface of functionalized substrate <b>30</b> and taken-up as roll <b>29</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">In one desired embodiment, after exposure to an electron beam, UV curing, and exiting chamber <b>40</b>, removable carrier layer <b>22</b> and removable cover layer <b>19</b> are allowed to remain on functionalized substrate <b>30</b> for a period of time prior to peeling step <b>400</b> so as to provide prolonged protection of functionalized substrate <b>30</b> from exposure to oxygen. Desirably, removable carrier layer <b>22</b> and removable cover layer <b>19</b> remain on functionalized substrate <b>30</b> for at least 15 seconds, more desirably, for about 30 to about 60 seconds after exiting chamber <b>25</b>. However, there is no upper time limit that will reduce grafting quality and multilayer sandwich structure <b>27</b> can remain intact for an extended time period as would be the case if batch processing rolls of multilayer sandwich structure <b>27</b> are prepared. Once multilayer sandwich structure <b>27</b> is disassembled, functionalized substrate <b>30</b> can proceed to an optional washing/rinsing step <b>600</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">In optional washing/rinsing step <b>600</b>, functionalized substrate <b>30</b> is washed or rinsed one or more times in rinse chamber <b>31</b> to remove any unreacted monomers, solvent or other reaction by-products from functionalized substrate <b>30</b>. Typically, functionalized substrate <b>30</b> is washed or rinsed up to three times using a water rinse, an alcohol rinse, a combination of water and alcohol rinses, and/or a solvent rinse (e.g., acetone, MEK, etc). When an alcohol rinse is used, the rinse may include one or more alcohols including, but not limited to, isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, or any other alcohol that is practical to use and an effective solvent for any residual monomer. In each rinse step, functionalized substrate <b>30</b> may pass through a rinse bath or a rinse spray.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">In optional drying step <b>700</b>, functionalized substrate <b>30</b> is dried to remove any rinse solution from functionalized substrate <b>30</b>. Typically, functionalized substrate <b>30</b> is dried in oven <b>32</b> having a relatively low oven temperature for a desired period of time (referred to herein as “oven dwell time”). Oven temperatures typically range from about 60° C. to about 120° C., while oven dwell times typically range from about 120 to about 600 seconds. Any conventional oven may be used in optional drying step <b>700</b> of the present invention. Suitable ovens include, but are not limited to, a convection oven.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">It should also be noted that in other embodiments drying step <b>700</b> can proceed before washing/rinsing step <b>600</b> eliminating volatile components before extraction of non-grafted residue.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">It should be noted that the methods of making ligand functionalized substrates of the present invention may be performed using a continuous process, such as exemplary method <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or alternatively, using a batch process wherein one or more of the above-described process steps are performed separate from one another.

Care should be taken when determining the amount of tension to apply in order to prevent shrinkage and/or tearing of porous base substrate <b>12</b> or functionalized substrate <b>30</b> during processing. If a stronger carrier web (e.g., removable carrier layer <b>22</b>) is used to convey base substrate <b>12</b> or functionalized substrate <b>30</b>, then the tension load is easier to adjust without transmitting the tension load through the substrate itself.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">In the exemplary continuous grafting process of the present invention, the one or more drive rolls typically operate in a range of 5 to 40 lbs (22 to 178 Newtons) of tension on a (12 inch) 30 cm wide web of porous base substrate <b>12</b> or functionalized substrate <b>30</b> in order to move porous base substrate <b>12</b> or functionalized substrate <b>30</b> through a given apparatus, resulting in a tension of 0.7 to 5.9 Newtons per lineal centimeter of porous base substrate <b>12</b> or functionalized substrate <b>30</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">The disclosed methods may be used to prepare a variety of ligand functionalized substrates. The ligand functionalized substrates have a polymerized coating derived from grafting followed by UV initiated polymerization from the grafted photoinitiator a), the ligand monomer b) and optionally one or more monomers having at least one acryloyl group and at least one additional ethylenically unsaturated, free-radically polymerizable group (c); and (d) optionally one or more hydrophilic monomers that may be directly or indirectly grafted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">In any of the above-described methods of making a functionalized substrate, any of the above-mentioned porous base substrates, grafting monomers, and reactants may be used to form a given functionalized substrate. The porous base substrate is often in the form of a porous membrane such as a microporous membrane, a nonwoven web, or porous fibers. In some embodiment, the porous base substrate comprises a microporous membrane formed by a thermally-induced phase separation (TIPS) method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">In one embodiment, the methods provide an article having a ligand functionalized coating on the surface thereof, the ligand functionalized coating comprising the UV polymerization reaction product of a grafted photoinitiator group and one or more ligand monomers, one or more ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable monomers and one or more hydrophilic monomers, which may be ungrafted acryloyl groups or other non-acryloyl ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable groups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">The method of making a ligand functionalized substrate alters the original nature of the porous base substrate, as the grafted and UV polymerized species include a ligand group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">The present invention enables the formation of ligand functionalized substrates having many of the advantages of a porous bases substrate (e.g., mechanical and thermal stability, porosity), but with enhanced affinity for biomolecules such as viruses, resulting from the monomers and steps used to form a given functionalized substrate. The present invention reduces or eliminates many of the known problems associated with porous bases substrates formed from hydrophilic polymers including, but not limited to, hygroexpansive issues; brittleness without humidification problems; mechanical strength weakness; and poor solvent, caustic and/or acidic resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">In one embodiment, the grafting monomer having a first grafting acrylate group and a second non-grafting ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group may comprise hydrophilic groups, as illustrated in Formulas VII, VIII, X and/or XI (supra). For example, poly(alkylene oxide) compounds of Formulas VIII and/or XI can be used to impart a hydrophilic character to a hydrophobic base substrate, such as a PVDF substrate. These grafting monomers may have a hydrophilic poly(alkylene oxide) group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Alternatively grafting monomers of Formulas IX or X may be used which do contain an ionic group. In these instances, hydrophilicity is imparted using a fourth monomer, which may contain a grafting acrylate group or a non-acrylate polymerizable group, and a hydrophilic group, such as a quaternary ammonium group. Such ionic groups may further impart enhanced selectivity to the functionalized substrate by repelling biological species having a like charge as the ionic group, at the appropriate pH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">The ligand-functionalized porous substrates are particularly suited as filter media, for the selective binding and removal of viruses from biological samples. As the ligand is grafted to the base substrate (either directly or indirectly), the ligand functionalized substrate is durable. The present disclosure then further provides a method for the removal of viruses from a virus-containing sample, such as a biological sample comprising contacting a sample with the ligand functionalized substrate as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">The sample is contacted with the virus-trapping membrane for a time sufficient to a yield log-reduction value (LRV) of at least 1.0 for neutral viruses disposed in the solution when the solution comprises from 0 to about 50 mM salt, and more preferably still to a yield log-reduction value (LRV) of at least 1.0 for neutral viruses disposed in the solution when the solution comprises from 0 to about 150 mM salt. It is still more preferred that the solution is contacted with the virus-trapping membrane for a time sufficient to a yield log-reduction value (LRV) of at least 5.0 for neutral viruses disposed in the solution when the solution comprises from 0 to about 50 mM salt, and more preferably still to a yield log-reduction value (LRV) of at least 5.0 for neutral viruses disposed in the solution when the solution comprises from 0 to about 150 mM salt. The term neutral virus is used to denote any virus that has an isoelectric point (pI) around 7, or optionally, nominally between 6 and 8. The sample solution may a pH that is such that the virus is negatively charged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">This importance of viral clearance in the presence of salt, “salt tolerance”, is that many process solutions used in biopharmaceutical manufacture have conductivities in the range of 15-30 mS/cm. Salt tolerance is measured in comparison to the conventional Q ligand (AETMA, 2-aminoethyltrimethylammonium chloride), which rapidly loses capacity for some viruses (e.g., φX174) at conductivities three- to six-fold less than the target range, e.g. dropping viral clearance from a six log-reduction value (LRV) to a one (1) LRV in going from 0 to 50 mM NaCl. Viruses such as φX174 have pIs close to 7, and are neutral or near-neutral.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">In many embodiments the substrate may be functionalized so that other proteins are excluded or repelled from the ligand functionalized substrate, while viruses bind to the ligand functional group of Formulas V or VI. In addition, as previously described, the substrate may be directly or indirectly grafted with one or more ionic monomers. In particular, the porous substrate may comprise grafted ionic groups that are positively charged at the selected pH of the biological sample solution to cause electrostatic charge repulsion of proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, many of which are charged positive at neutral pH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Preventing protein binding, such as mAb binding, can be accomplished by increasing the pKa of the ligand, or grafting an additional positively charged functional group, so that the mAb and ligand are both charged positive during loading. This causes electrostatic charge repulsion of the mAb from the ligand and substrate surface. The virus, in contrast, is either negatively charged or is neutral, and binds to the ligand. Most therapeutic mAbs tend to have pI's between 8 and 10. Thus, mAbs are positively charged at neutral pH, which prevents their binding to substrate surface. Viruses, on the other hand, can have a variety of pI's and many have negative pI's. Therefore the pH of the sample solution is below the isoelectic point of the protein of interest (such as a mAb) and above the isoelectric point of the virus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">The ligands and grafted functional groups herein are selected based on the above criteria and outcomes, i.e., it is salt tolerant and has a high pKa (e.g., &gt;10) causing electrostatic charge repulsion of the mAb. The ligand is immobilized on a porous membrane and the virus-containing fluid flows through the membrane while the virus is trapped by the ligand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">In some embodiments the grafted article containing the bound virus is disposable. In such embodiments, the binding of the virus to the filter medium is preferably essentially irreversible because there is no need to recover the bound virus. Nonetheless, one can reverse the binding of viruses by increasing the ionic strength of an eluting solution. In contrast, in protein binding, the binding phenomenon must necessarily be reversible or the desired protein cannot be eluted from the column.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">The substrate for viral capture may be any previously described, but is preferably a microporous membrane. The membrane pore size desired is from 0.1 to 10 μm, preferably 0.5 to 3 micrometers and most preferably 0.8 to 2 micrometers. A membrane with a high surface area for the internal pore structure is desired, which typically corresponds to fine pore sizes. However, if the pore size is too small, then the membrane tends to plug with fine particulates present in the sample solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">If desired, efficiency of viral binding and capture may be improved by using a plurality of stacked, ligand-functionalized porous membranes as a filter element. Thus the present disclosure provides a filter element comprising one or more layers of the porous, ligand functionalized substrate. The individual layers may be the same or different, and may have layers of different porosity, and degree of grafting by the aforementioned grafting monomers. The filter element may further comprise an upstream prefilter layer and downstream support layer. The individual filter elements may be planar or pleated as desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">Examples of suitable prefilter and support layer materials include any suitable porous membranes of polypropylene, polyester, polyamide, resin-bonded or binder-free fibers (e.g., glass fibers), and other synthetics (woven and non-woven fleece structures); sintered materials such as polyolefins, metals, and ceramics; yarns; special filter papers (e.g., mixtures of fibers, cellulose, polyolefins, and binders); polymer membranes; and others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">In another embodiment, there is provided a filter cartridge including the above-described filter element. In yet another embodiment there is provided a filter assembly comprising the filter elements and a filter housing. In a further embodiment, this invention relates to a method of viral capture comprising the steps of:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">Agmatine sulphate (9.12 g, 40 mmol) was dissolved in distilled water (20 mL) in a round-bottom flask (100 mL) equipped with a magnetic stirrer. K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>(16.56 g, 100 mmol), dissolved in water (20 mL), was added to the round-bottom flask. The reaction mixture was cooled down on an ice bath and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at 5° C. Acryloyl chloride (7.24 g, 6.50 mL, 80 mmol), dissolved in acetone (20 mL) was added drop wise to the flask using a Pasteur-pipette. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 5° C. for 1 h.

The aqueous phase was then extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK, 2×100 mL) to remove excess acrylic acid formed during the reaction. The pH of the aqueous phase was then fixed to pH 7 by addition of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>and the final clear solution was utilized for grafting.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">The acrylamidoagmatine was grafted onto hydrophilic PVDF membranes by electron beam radiation. Two different approaches were used:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0033" num="0000">2a: Direct:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">The hydrophilic PVDF membrane was imbibed with the acrylamidoagmatine solution using a plastic pipette and a squeezing roller for uniformity. The wetted membrane was then placed into a sandwich with 2 layers of PET and subjected to electron beam radiation at 40 kGy.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0034" num="0000">2b: Indirect:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">The hydrophilic PVDF membrane was sandwiched between 2 layers of PET liner and exposed to electron beam at a dose of 40 kGy to get a substrate rich in free radicals. This sandwich was then transferred to an inert atmosphere in a glove box.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">The N,N′-dimethyl guanidinium derivative of agmatine having essentially the same pKa values as agmatine was synthesized. The ligand provided 5 log reduction with no salt present comparable to the commercially available Mustang Q™ membrane (a porous polyethersulfone membrane functionalized so as to have quaternary ammonium groups on the surface available from Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, Mich.) but failed completely at 50 mM NaCl. The acrylamide derivative above was synthesized and suggests that a hydrogen bonding affinity interaction (possibly with peripheral amide groups on the virus) may be required and is available only with unsubstituted guanidinium groups.</div>

Procedure:
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">Arginine monohydrochloride (4.17 g, 20 mmol) was dissolved in distilled water (10 mL) in a round-bottom flask (100 mL) equipped with a magnetic stirrer. K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>(8.28 g, 50 mmol), dissolved in water (10 mL), was added to the round-bottom flask. The reaction mixture was cooled down on an ice bath and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at 5° C. Acryloyl chloride (3.62 g, 3.25 mL, 40 mmol), dissolved in acetone (10 mL) was added drop wise to the flask using a Pasteur-pipette. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 5° C. for 1 h. The stirring was then stopped. The aqueous phase was then fixed to pH 2.3 with concentrated sulfuric acid and then filtered on a glass filter. The aqueous phase was then extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK, 2×100 mL) to remove excess acrylic acid formed during the reaction. The pH of the aqueous phase was then fixed to pH 7 by addition of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, cooled with liquid nitrogen and the water removed by freeze-drying. The final white fluffy solid was then dissolved in MeOH, filtered, and the MeOH was removed by rotoevaporation at 40° C. The film was taken up in H<sub>2</sub>O and freeze dried to afford a white fluffy solid</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">When the positive charge of the guanidinium group was neutralized by the negative charge of the carboxylate (at pH 7.4), no bacteriophage binding (even with no additional salt added) was observed clearly indicating that a positive charge on the overall ligand assembly is desired. In this case two positive charges, one for the α-amine group and the other with the guanidine group, will be present along with an unsubstituted guanidinium unit.</div>

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">42 g agmatine sulfate (AGM; 184 mmol) was stirred in a mixture of distilled water (300 ml) and acetone (300 ml). Diisopropylethylamine (DIEA; 32 ml, 184 mmol) was added to the solution, followed by drop-wise addition of isocyanatoethylmethacrylate (IEM; 32 ml, 206 mmol) over 15 minutes. The solution became clear as the addition of IEM. The reaction was stirred for 4 hours. NMR of the crude reaction solution indicated clean conversion. The volatile components of the reaction, acetone and excess DIEA, was removed under vacuum. The remaining aqueous solution was frozen, and freeze-dried under high vacuum. After 48 hours of lyophilization, 94 g of white powder was obtained. The total mass collected, 94 grams, contained the desired IEM-AGM, but also other side-products: sulfuric acid and DIEA. The w/w percentage of the active ingredient, the methacrylate monomer, is 53.5% (w/w) of the total mass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0039" num="0000">Grafting of the IEM-Agmatine Adduct</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">The IEM-agmatine adduct was grafted onto hydrophilized PVDF and nylon membranes by procedures similar to that used in Example 2 for acrylamidoagmatine. In addition, a two-stage process was employed as described hereunder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0040" num="0000">6a: Direct:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">The hydrophilized PVDF membrane was imbibed with a 16% IEM-agmatine solution in methanol using a plastic pipette and a squeezing roller for uniformity. The wetted membrane was then placed into a sandwich with 2 layers of PET and subjected to electron beam radiation at 40 kGy. The membrane was then released from the sandwich and then washed 3 times with water and dried. The procedure was repeated on a nylon substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0041" num="0000">6b: Indirect:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">The hydrophilized PVDF membrane was sandwiched between 2 layers of PET liner and exposed to electron beam at a dose of 40 kGy to get a substrate rich in free radicals. This sandwich was then transferred to an inert atmosphere in a glove box. The 10% IEM-agmatine solution in methanol was imbibed into the membrane and the wetted membrane was transferred to a glove box and stored overnight. The membrane was then washed three times in a water bath and then dried in ambient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0042" num="0000">6c: Two Stage Process:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">The first functionalizing E-beam irradiation process was done with a dose of 40 kGy set at a voltage of 300 keV. The coating solution contained 5.0% 2% 3-(Acryloxy)-2-hydroxypropylmethacrylate with 1.0% VAZPIA in methanol. The coating solution was imbibed into the hydrophilic TIPS PVDF microporous membrane. The sample was conveyed through the beam on a web carrier and was sandwiched ‘wet’ between layers of 4 mil PET in order to delay the diffusion of oxygen back into the membrane when it exited the beam chamber. After three minutes the sandwich was opened and the membrane was allowed to dry. (Any unreacted monomers from this step were allowed to remain.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">In the second functionalizing step, the molecule used was IEM-agmatine. The coating solution contained 10.0% IEM-AGM in methanol. The coating solution was imbibed into the coated TIPS PVDF microporous membrane and the sandwich was closed with any trapped air removed with a roller. The samples were then UV irradiated using Quant48™ Quantum Technologies system using UVA lamps and run under the UV processor at a speed of about one foot per minute (4 feet exposure length, single side at 31 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). The sample sandwich was turned over and run again at the same speed. The grafted porous membrane was removed from the sandwich and was washed clean by soaking it in a tray of water and exchanging it with clean water three times. The functionalized membrane was allowed to air dry. The procedure was repeated on a nylon substrate.</div>
