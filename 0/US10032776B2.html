<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to semiconductor memory technology. More specifically, the present invention relates to methods of maintaining the state of semiconductor memory device/array of devices having an electrically floating body transistor.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Semiconductor memory devices are used extensively to store data. Static and Dynamic Random Access Memory (SRAM and DRAM, respectively) are widely used in many applications. SRAM typically consists of six transistors and hence has a large cell size. However, unlike DRAM, it does not require periodic refresh operations to maintain its memory state. Conventional DRAM cells consist of a one-transistor and one-capacitor (1T/1C) structure. As the 1T/1C memory cell feature is being scaled, difficulties arise due to the necessity of maintaining the capacitance value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">DRAM based on the electrically floating body effect has been proposed (see for example “A Capacitor-less 1T-DRAM Cell”, S. Okhonin et al., pp. 85-87, IEEE Electron Device Letters, vol. 23, no. 2, February 2002 and “Memory Design Using One-Transistor Gain Cell on SOI”, T. Ohsawa et al., pp. 152-153, Tech. Digest, 2002 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, February 2002). Such memory eliminates the capacitor used in the conventional 1T/1C memory cell, and thus is easier to scale to smaller feature size. In addition, such memory allows for a smaller cell size compared to the conventional 1T/1C memory cell. However, unlike SRAM, such DRAM memory cell still requires refresh operation, since the stored charge leaks over time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">A conventional 1T/1C DRAM refresh operation involves first reading the state of the memory cell, followed by re-writing the memory cell with the same data. Thus this read-then-write refresh requires two operations: read and write. The memory cell cannot be accessed while being refreshed. An “automatic refresh” method”, which does not require first reading the memory cell state, has been described in Fazan et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,170,807. However, such operation still interrupts access to the memory cells being refreshed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, the charge in a floating body DRAM memory cell decreases over repeated read operations. This reduction in floating body charge is due to charge pumping, where the floating body charge is attracted to the surface and trapped at the interface (see for example “Principles of Transient Charge Pumping on Partially Depleted SOI MOSFETs”, S. Okhonin, et al., pp. 279-281, IEEE Electron Device Letters, vol. 23, no. 5, May 2002).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus there is a continuing need for semiconductor memory devices and methods of operating such devices such that the states of the memory cells of the semiconductor memory device are maintained without interrupting the memory cell access.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">There is also a need for semiconductor memory devices and methods of operating the same such that the states of the memory cells are maintained upon repeated read operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention meets the above needs and more as described in detail below.</div>

<heading id="h-0008">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a memory cell <b>50</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The cell <b>50</b> includes a substrate <b>12</b> of a first conductivity type, such as n-type conductivity type, for example. Substrate <b>12</b> is typically made of silicon, but may comprise germanium, silicon germanium, gallium arsenide, carbon nanotubes, or other semiconductor materials known in the art. The substrate <b>12</b> has a surface <b>14</b>. A first region <b>16</b> having a first conductivity type, such as n-type, for example, is provided in substrate <b>12</b> and which is exposed at surface <b>14</b>. A second region <b>18</b> having the first conductivity type is also provided in substrate <b>12</b>, which is exposed at surface <b>14</b> and which is spaced apart from the first region <b>16</b>. First and second regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are formed by an implantation process formed on the material making up substrate <b>12</b>, according to any of implantation processes known and typically used in the art. Alternatively, a solid state diffusion process can be used to form first and second regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">A floating body region <b>24</b> having a second conductivity type different from the first conductivity type, such as p-type conductivity type when the first conductivity type is n-type conductivity type, is bounded by surface <b>14</b>, first and second regions <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, insulating layers <b>26</b>, and substrate <b>12</b>. The floating body region <b>24</b> can be formed by an implantation process formed on the material making up substrate <b>12</b>, or can be grown epitaxially. Insulating layers <b>26</b> (e.g. shallow trench isolation (STI)), may be made of silicon oxide, for example. Insulating layers <b>26</b> insulate cell <b>50</b> from neighboring cells <b>50</b> when multiple cells <b>50</b> are joined in an array <b>80</b> to make a memory device as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A gate <b>60</b> is positioned in between the regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, and above the surface <b>14</b>. The gate <b>60</b> is insulated from surface <b>14</b> by an insulating layer <b>62</b>. Insulating layer <b>62</b> may be made of silicon oxide and/or other dielectric materials, including high-K dielectric materials, such as, but not limited to, tantalum peroxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, and/or aluminum oxide. The gate <b>60</b> may be made of polysilicon material or metal gate electrode, such as tungsten, tantalum, titanium and their nitrides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Cell <b>50</b> further includes word line (WL) terminal <b>70</b> electrically connected to gate <b>60</b>, source line (SL) terminal <b>72</b> electrically connected to one of regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> (connected to <b>16</b> as shown, but could, alternatively, be connected to <b>18</b>), bit line (BL) terminal <b>74</b> electrically connected to the other of regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> (connected to <b>18</b> as shown, but could, alternatively, be connected to <b>16</b> when <b>72</b> is connected to <b>18</b>), and substrate terminal <b>78</b> electrically connected to substrate <b>12</b>. Contact to substrate region can alternatively be made through region <b>20</b> having a first conductivity type, and which is electrically connected to substrate region <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">In another embodiment, the memory cell <b>50</b> has a p-type conductivity type as the first conductivity type and n-type conductivity type as the second conductivity type, as noted above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">The operation of a memory cell <b>50</b> has been described for example in “Scaled 1T-Bulk Devices Built with CMOS 90 nm Technology for Low-cost eDRAM Applications”, R. Ranica, et al., pp. 38-41, Tech. Digest, Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2005, which is hereby incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference thereto. The memory cell states are represented by the charge in the floating body <b>24</b>. If cell <b>50</b> has holes stored in the floating body region <b>24</b>, then the memory cell <b>50</b> will have a lower threshold voltage (gate voltage where transistor is turned on) compared to when cell <b>50</b> does not store holes in floating body region <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The positive charge stored in the floating body region <b>24</b> will decrease over time due to the p-n diode leakage formed by floating body <b>24</b> and regions <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and substrate <b>12</b> and due to charge recombination. A unique capability of the invention is the ability to perform the holding operation in parallel to all memory cells <b>50</b> of the array <b>80</b>. The holding operation can be performed by applying a positive back bias to the substrate terminal <b>78</b> while grounding terminal <b>72</b> and/or terminal <b>74</b>. The positive back bias applied to the substrate terminal will maintain the state of the memory cells <b>50</b> that it is connected to. The holding operation is relatively independent of the voltage applied to terminal <b>70</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, inherent in the memory cell <b>50</b> are n-p-n bipolar devices <b>30</b> <i>a </i>and <b>30</b> <i>b </i>formed by substrate region <b>12</b>, floating body <b>24</b>, and SL and BL regions <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. If floating body <b>24</b> is positively charged (i.e. in a state “1”), the bipolar transistor <b>30</b> <i>a </i>formed by SL region <b>16</b>, floating body <b>24</b>, and substrate region <b>12</b> and bipolar transistor <b>30</b> <i>b </i>formed by BL region <b>18</b>, floating body <b>24</b>, and substrate region <b>12</b> will be turned on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">A fraction of the bipolar transistor current will then flow into floating region <b>24</b> (usually referred to as the base current) and maintain the state “1” data. The efficiency of the holding operation can be enhanced by designing the bipolar device formed by substrate <b>12</b>, floating region <b>24</b>, and regions <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> to be a low-gain bipolar device, where the bipolar gain is defined as the ratio of the collector current flowing out of substrate terminal <b>78</b> to the base current flowing into the floating region <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">For memory cells in state “0” data, the bipolar devices <b>30</b> <i>a</i>, <b>30</b> <i>b </i>will not be turned on, and consequently no base hole current will flow into floating region <b>24</b>. Therefore, memory cells in state “0” will remain in state “0”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">As can be seen, the holding operation can be performed in mass, parallel manner as the substrate terminal <b>78</b> (e.g., <b>78</b> <i>a</i>, <b>78</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>78</b> <i>n</i>) is typically shared by all the cells <b>50</b> in the memory array <b>80</b>. The substrate terminal <b>78</b> can also be segmented to allow independent control of the applied bias on the selected portion of the memory array as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, where substrate terminal <b>78</b> <i>a</i>, <b>78</b> <i>b </i>is shown segmented from substrate terminal <b>78</b> <i>m</i>, <b>78</b> <i>n</i>, for example. Also, because substrate terminal <b>78</b> is not used for memory address selection, no memory cell access interruption occurs due to the holding operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">In another embodiment, a periodic pulse of positive voltage can be applied to substrate terminal <b>78</b>, as opposed to applying a constant positive bias, in order to reduce the power consumption of the memory cell <b>50</b>. The state of the memory cell <b>50</b> can be maintained by refreshing the charge stored in floating body <b>24</b> during the period over which the positive voltage pulse is applied to the back bias terminal (i.e., substrate terminal <b>78</b>). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> further shows multiplexers <b>40</b> that determine the bias applied to substrate terminal <b>78</b> where the control signal could be the clock signal <b>42</b> or as will be described later, determined by different operating modes. The positive input signals could be the power supply voltage Vcc (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) or a different positive bias could be generated by voltage generator circuitry <b>44</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">The holding/standby operation also results in a larger memory window by increasing the amount of charge that can be stored in the floating body <b>24</b>. Without the holding/standby operation, the maximum potential that can be stored in the floating body <b>24</b> is limited to the flat band voltage V<sub>FB </sub>as the junction leakage current to regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> increases exponentially at floating body potential greater than V<sub>FB</sub>. However, by applying a positive voltage to substrate terminal <b>78</b>, the bipolar action results in a hole current flowing into the floating body <b>24</b>, compensating for the junction leakage current between floating body <b>24</b> and regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. As a result, the maximum charge V<sub>MC </sub>stored in floating body <b>24</b> can be increased by applying a positive bias to the substrate terminal <b>78</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The increase in the maximum charge stored in the floating body <b>24</b> results in a larger memory window.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">The holding/standby operation can also be used for multi-bit operations in memory cell <b>50</b>. To increase the memory density without increasing the area occupied by the memory cell <b>50</b>, a multi-level operation is typically used. This is done by dividing the overall memory window into different levels. In floating body memory, the different memory states are represented by different charges in the floating body <b>24</b>, as described for example in “The Multistable Charge-Controlled Memory Effect in SOI Transistors at Low Temperatures”, Tack et al., pp. 1373-1382, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, vol. 37, May 1990 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,542,345 “Multi-bit memory cell having electrically floating body transistor, and method of programming and reading same”, each of which is hereby incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference thereto. However, since the state with zero charge in the floating body <b>24</b> is the most stable state, the floating body <b>24</b> will, over time, lose its charge until it reaches the most stable state. In multi-level operations, the difference of charge representing different states is smaller than that for a single-level operation. As a result, a multi-level memory cell is more sensitive to charge loss, as less charge loss is required to change states.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the floating body <b>24</b> relative net current for different floating body <b>24</b> potentials as a function of the voltage applied to substrate terminal <b>78</b> with BL, SL, and WL terminals <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>70</b>, grounded. When zero voltage is applied to substrate terminal <b>78</b>, no bipolar current is flowing into the floating body <b>24</b> and as a result, the stored charge will leak over time. When a positive voltage is applied to substrate terminal <b>78</b>, hole current will flow into floating body <b>24</b> and balance the junction leakage current to regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. The junction leakage current is determined by the potential difference between the floating body <b>24</b> and regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, while the bipolar current flowing into floating body <b>24</b> is determined by both the substrate terminal <b>78</b> potential and the floating body <b>24</b> potential. As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for different floating body potentials, at a certain substrate terminal <b>78</b> potential V<sub>HOLD</sub>, the current flowing into floating body <b>24</b> is balanced by the junction leakage between floating body <b>24</b> and regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. The different floating body <b>24</b> potentials represent different charges used to represent different states of memory cell <b>50</b>. This shows that different memory states can be maintained by using the holding/standby operation described here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">An example of the bias condition for the holding operation is hereby provided: zero voltage is applied to BL terminal <b>74</b>, zero voltage is applied to SL terminal <b>72</b>, zero or negative voltage is applied to WL terminal <b>70</b>, and a positive voltage is applied to the substrate terminal <b>78</b>. In one particular non-limiting embodiment, about 0.0 volts is applied to terminal <b>72</b>, about 0.0 volts is applied to terminal <b>74</b>, about 0.0 volts is applied to terminal <b>70</b>, and about +1.2 volts is applied to terminal <b>78</b>. However, these voltage levels may vary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">The charge stored in the floating body <b>24</b> can be sensed by monitoring the cell current of the memory cell <b>50</b>. If cell <b>50</b> is in a state “1” having holes in the floating body region <b>24</b>, then the memory cell will have a lower threshold voltage (gate voltage where the transistor is turned on), and consequently a higher cell current, compared to if cell <b>50</b> is in a state “0” having no holes in floating body region <b>24</b>.

The floating body <b>24</b> potential of these cells will also increase due to capacitive coupling from the WL terminal <b>70</b>. For memory cells in state “1”, the increase in the floating body <b>24</b> potential is not sustainable as the forward bias current of the p-n diodes formed by floating body <b>24</b> and junctions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> is greater than the base hole current generated by the n-p-n bipolar device <b>30</b> formed by substrate <b>12</b>, floating body <b>24</b>, and junctions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. As a result, the floating body <b>24</b> potential will return to the initial state “1” equilibrium potential. For memory cells in state “0”, if the increase in floating body <b>24</b> potential is sufficiently high (i.e., at least V<sub>FB</sub>/3, see below), then both n-p-n bipolar devices <b>30</b> <i>a </i>and <b>30</b> <i>b </i>are turned on, and as a result the floating body <b>24</b> reaches a new equilibrium potential, between that of state “0” and state “1”. Therefore, the WL potential needs to be optimized so that the n-p-n bipolar devices <b>30</b> <i>a</i>, <b>30</b> <i>b </i>will not be turned on or that the base hole current is low enough that it does not result in an increase of the floating body <b>24</b> potential over the time during which the write operation is carried out (write operation time). It has been determined by the present inventor that a floating body <b>24</b> potential increase of V<sub>FB</sub>/3 is low enough to suppress the floating body <b>24</b> potential increase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Accordingly, with careful design concerning the voltage applied to WL terminal <b>70</b>, the states of the unselected memory cells sharing the same WL terminal (i.e. the same row) as the selected memory cells will be maintained.</div>

As a result a higher forward bias current between floating body <b>24</b> and junction <b>18</b> occurs. For memory cells in state “0”, the potential difference between floating body <b>24</b> and junction <b>18</b> is still sufficiently low that the p-n diode formed by floating body <b>24</b> and junction <b>18</b> is still not forward biased. Thus those memory cells will remain in state “0”. For memory cells in state “1”, junction leakage caused by forward bias current will increase. However, the hole current of the n-p-n bipolar device <b>30</b> <i>b </i>formed by substrate <b>12</b>, floating body <b>24</b>, and region <b>18</b> will also increase as a result of the increase in potential difference between the substrate <b>12</b> and region <b>18</b> (the collector and emitter terminals, respectively).

If the read verify operation indicates that the cell current has reached the desired state (i.e., cell current corresponding to whichever of 00, 01, 10 or 11 is desired is achieved), then the multi write operation is commenced.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">The write-then-verify algorithm is inherently slow since it requires multiple write and read operations.

During the period when the substrate terminal <b>78</b> is grounded, the memory cells <b>50</b> connected to a ground substrate terminal <b>78</b> are no longer in holding mode. Therefore the period during which the substrate terminal is grounded must be shorter than the charge retention time period of the floating body, to prevent the state of the floating body from changing when the substrate terminal is grounded. The charge lifetime (i.e., charge retention time period) of the floating body <b>24</b> without use of a holding mode has been shown to be on the order of milliseconds, for example, see “A Scaled Floating Body Cell (FBC) Memory with High-k+Metal Gate on Thin-Silicon and Thin-BOX for 16-nm Technology Node and Beyond”, Ban et al., pp. 92-92, Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2008, which is hereby incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference thereto.

Because the read operation is carried out over a time period on the order of nanoseconds, it is of a much shorter duration than the charge lifetime (charge retention time period) of the floating body <b>24</b> unassisted by a holding operation.

To reduce undesired write “0” disturb to other memory cells in the memory array sharing the same row or column as the selected memory cell, the applied potential can be optimized as follows: if the floating body <b>24</b> potential of state “1” is referred to as V<sub>FB1</sub>, then the voltage applied to the WL terminal <b>70</b> is configured to increase the floating body <b>24</b> potential by V<sub>FB1</sub>/2 while −V<sub>FB1</sub>/2 is applied to BL terminal <b>74</b>.

As a result of the bias conditions applied as described, the unselected memory cells (<b>150</b> <i>b</i>, <b>150</b> <i>c </i>and <b>150</b> <i>d</i>) will be at holding mode, maintaining the states of the respective floating bodies <b>24</b> thereof. Furthermore, the holding operation does not interrupt the read operation of the selected memory cell <b>150</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">To write “0” to cell <b>150</b>, a negative bias is applied to SL terminal <b>72</b>, zero or negative voltage is applied to WL terminal <b>70</b>, zero or positive voltage is applied to BW terminal <b>76</b>, and zero voltage is applied to substrate terminal <b>78</b>. The SL terminal <b>72</b> for the unselected cells <b>150</b> that are not commonly connected to the selected cell <b>150</b> <i>a </i>will remain grounded. Under these conditions, the p-n junctions (junction between 24 and 16 and between 24 and 18) are forward-biased, evacuating any holes from the floating body <b>24</b>. In one particular non-limiting embodiment, about −2.0 volts is applied to terminal <b>72</b>, about −1.2 volts is applied to terminal <b>70</b>, about +1.2 volts is applied to terminal <b>76</b>, and about 0.0 volts is applied to terminal <b>78</b>. However, these voltage levels may vary, while maintaining the relative relationships between the charges applied, as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">The bias conditions for all the unselected cells are the same since the write “0” operation only involves applying a negative voltage to the SL terminal <b>72</b> (thus to the entire row). As can be seen, the unselected memory cells will be in holding operation, with both BL and SL terminals at about 0.0 volts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">Thus, the holding operation does not interrupt the write “0” operation of the memory cells. Furthermore, the unselected memory cells will remain in holding operation during a write “0” operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">An alternative write “0” operation, which, unlike the previous write “0” operation described above, allows for individual bit write, can be performed by applying a positive voltage to WL terminal <b>70</b>, a negative voltage to BL terminal <b>74</b>, zero or positive voltage to SL terminal <b>72</b>, zero or positive voltage to BW terminal <b>76</b>, and zero voltage to substrate terminal <b>78</b>. Under these conditions, the floating body <b>24</b> potential will increase through capacitive coupling from the positive voltage applied to the WL terminal <b>70</b>. As a result of the floating body <b>24</b> potential increase and the negative voltage applied to the BL terminal <b>74</b>, the p-n junction (junction between 24 and 16) is forward-biased, evacuating any holes from the floating body <b>24</b>. The applied bias to selected WL terminal <b>70</b> and selected BL terminal <b>74</b> can potentially affect the states of the unselected memory cells <b>150</b> sharing the same WL or BL terminal as the selected memory cell <b>150</b>. To reduce undesired write “0” disturb to other memory cells <b>150</b> in the memory array <b>180</b>, the applied potential can be optimized as follows: If the floating body <b>24</b> potential of state “1” is referred to as V<sub>FB1</sub>, then the voltage applied to the WL terminal <b>70</b> is configured to increase the floating body <b>24</b> potential by V<sub>FB1</sub>/2 while −V<sub>FB1</sub>/2 is applied to BL terminal <b>74</b>. This will minimize the floating body <b>24</b> potential change in the unselected cells <b>150</b> in state “1” sharing the same BL terminal as the selected cell <b>150</b> from V<sub>FB1 </sub>at to V<sub>FB1</sub>/2. For memory cells <b>150</b> in state “0” sharing the same WL terminal as the selected cell <b>150</b>, if the increase in floating body <b>24</b> potential is sufficiently high (i.e., at least V<sub>FB</sub>/3, see below), then both n-p-n bipolar devices <b>130</b> <i>a </i>and <b>130</b> <i>b </i>will not be turned on or so that the base hold current is low enough that it does not result in an increase of the floating body <b>24</b> potential over the time during which the write operation is carried out (write operation time). It has been determined according to the present invention that a floating body <b>24</b> potential increase of V<sub>FB</sub>/3 is low enough to suppress the floating body <b>24</b> potential increase. A positive voltage can be applied to SL terminal <b>72</b> to further reduce the undesired write “0” disturb on other memory cells <b>150</b> in the memory array. The unselected cells will remain at holding state, i.e. zero or negative voltage applied to WL terminal <b>70</b> and zero voltage applied to BL terminal <b>74</b>. The unselected cells <b>150</b> not sharing the same WL or BL terminal as the selected cell <b>150</b> will remain at holding state, i.e., with zero or negative voltage applied to unselected WL terminal and zero voltage applied to unselected BL terminal <b>74</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">In one particular non-limiting embodiment, for the selected cell <b>150</b> a potential of about 0.0 volts is applied to terminal <b>72</b>, a potential of about −0.2 volts is applied to terminal <b>74</b>, a potential of about +0.5 volts is applied to terminal <b>70</b>, about +1.2 volts is applied to terminal <b>76</b>, and about 0.0 volts is applied to terminal <b>78</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">A write “1” operation can be performed on memory cell <b>150</b> through an impact ionization mechanism or a band-to-band tunneling mechanism, as described for example in “A Design of a Capacitorless 1T-DRAM Cell Using Gate-Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL) Current for Low-power and High-speed Embedded Memory”, Yoshida et al., pp. 913-918, International Electron Devices Meeting, 2003, which was incorporated by reference above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">An example of bias conditions applied to selected memory cell <b>150</b> <i>a </i>under a band-to-band tunneling write “1” operation is further elaborated and is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The negative bias applied to the WL terminal <b>70</b> <i>a </i>and the positive bias applied to the BL terminal <b>74</b> <i>a </i>will result in hole injection to the floating body <b>24</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">A multi-level operation can also be performed on memory cell <b>150</b>. A holding operation to maintain the multi-level states of memory cell <b>50</b> is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The relationship between the floating body <b>24</b> current for different floating body <b>24</b> potentials as a function of the BW terminal <b>76</b> potential (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) is similar to that of floating body <b>24</b> current as a function of the substrate terminal <b>78</b> potential (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, for different floating body potentials, at a certain BW terminal <b>76</b> potential V<sub>HOLD</sub>, the current flowing into floating body <b>24</b> is balanced by the junction leakage between floating body <b>24</b> and regions <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. The different floating body <b>24</b> potentials represent different charges used to represent different states of memory cell <b>150</b>. This shows that different memory states can be maintained by using the holding/standby operation described here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">A multi-level write operation without alternate write and read operations on memory cell <b>150</b> is now described. To perform this operation, zero voltage is applied to SL terminal <b>72</b>, a positive voltage is applied to WL terminal <b>70</b>, a positive voltage (back bias) is applied to BW terminal <b>76</b>, and zero voltage is applied to substrate terminal <b>78</b>, while the voltage of BL terminal <b>74</b> is ramped up. These bias conditions will result in a hole injection to the floating body <b>24</b> through an impact ionization mechanism. The state of the memory cell <b>150</b> can be simultaneously read for example by monitoring the change in the cell current through a read circuitry <b>90</b> coupled to the source line <b>72</b>. The cell current measured in the source line direction (where source line current equals bit line current plus BW current and the currents are measured in the directions from buried well to source line and from bit line to source line) is a cumulative cell current of all memory cells <b>150</b> which share the same source line <b>72</b> (e.g. see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A-16C</figref> for examples of monitoring cell current in the source line direction. The same monitoring scheme can be applied to memory array <b>80</b> as well as memory array <b>180</b>). As a result, only one memory cell <b>150</b> sharing the same source line <b>72</b> can be written. This ensures that the change in the cumulative cell current is a result of the write operation on the selected memory cell <b>150</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">The applied bias conditions will result in hole injection to floating body <b>24</b> through an impact ionization mechanism. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the resulting increase of the floating body potential <b>24</b> over time. Once the change in cell current reaches the desired level associated with a state of the memory cell <b>150</b> (levels are schematically represented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), the voltage applied to BL terminal <b>74</b> can be removed. By applying a positive voltage to BW terminal <b>76</b>, the resulting floating body <b>24</b> potential is maintained through base hole current flowing into floating body <b>24</b>. In this manner, the multi-level write operation can be performed without alternate write and read operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">In a similar manner, the multi-level write operation using impact ionization mechanism can also be performed by ramping the write current applied to BL terminal <b>74</b> instead of ramping the BL terminal <b>74</b> voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">In yet another embodiment, a multi-level write operation can be performed through a band-to-band tunneling mechanism by ramping the voltage applied to BL terminal <b>74</b>, while applying zero voltage to SL terminal <b>72</b>, a negative voltage to WL terminal <b>70</b>, a positive voltage to BW terminal <b>76</b>, and zero voltage to substrate terminal <b>78</b>. The potential of the floating body <b>24</b> will increase as a result of the band-to-band tunneling mechanism. The state of the memory cell <b>50</b> can be simultaneously read for example by monitoring the change in the cell current through a read circuitry <b>90</b> coupled to the source line <b>72</b>. Once the change in the cell current reaches the desired level associated with a state of the memory cell, the voltage applied to BL terminal <b>74</b> can be removed. If positive voltage is applied to substrate terminal <b>78</b>, the resulting floating body <b>24</b> potential is maintained through base hole current flowing into floating body <b>24</b>. In this manner, the multi-level write operation can be performed without alternate write and read operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">Similarly, the multi-level write operation using band-to-band tunneling mechanism can also be performed by ramping the write current applied to BL terminal <b>74</b> instead of ramping the voltage applied to BL terminal <b>74</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">Similarly, a read while programming operation can be performed by monitoring the change in cell current in the bit line <b>74</b> direction (where bit line current equals SL current plus BW current) through a reading circuitry <b>90</b> coupled to the bit line <b>74</b>, for example as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>. For the current ramp operation, the voltage at the bit line <b>74</b> can be sensed, rather than sensing the cell current. The bit line voltage can be sensed, for example, using a voltage sensing circuitry, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>.</div>
