<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/CN2014/072259, filed on Feb. 19, 2014, which claims priority to International Application No. PCT/CN2013/085099, filed on Oct. 12, 2013, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</div>
<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of communications technologies, and in particular, to a method and an apparatus for paging user equipment UE by a base station.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In a Long Term Evolution (LTE for short) system of mobile communications system technologies, a paging message is carried by a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH for short). A process of receiving, by user equipment (UE for short), a paging message in a discontinuous reception (DRX for short) manner is as follows: broadcasting, by a base station, a system parameter to all UEs; obtaining, by each UE on the basis of the system parameter, a paging frame (PF for short) and a paging occasion (PO for short) occupied by a corresponding paging message on a PDSCH; listening to, by the UE starting from a PO subframe of the PF, whether a paging-radio network temporary identifier (P-RNTI for short) exists in a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH for short); if yes, acquiring, by the UE, information about a time-frequency resource occupied by the paging message from the PDCCH; and finally, receiving, by the UE, the paging message on the time-frequency resource of the PDSCH. Because some UEs may be machine-type UEs such as a power meter and a water meter located in a coverage area with poor signal quality, for example, placed in a building, a basement or an iron box, and a signal may have a maximum loss of 20 dB, UE located in a coverage area with poor signal quality needs to be enabled to receive a paging message normally.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Usually, a base station repeatedly sends a paging message by using a PDSCH and a PDCCH to ensure that UE located in a coverage area with poor signal quality normally receives the paging message. However, different quantities of times of repetition may be required for different physical channels, for example, repetition of 100 to 200 times may be required for a PDCCH; therefore, such a manner obviously increases resources occupied by a paging message on a PDSCH and a PDCCH and increases paging delay.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a flowchart of a paging method according to an embodiment. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the paging method mainly includes the following steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Step <b>110</b>: UE receives a system message broadcast by a base station, where the system message carries a system parameter and configuration information of a paging message, and the configuration information includes time-frequency information of the paging message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Specifically, user equipment (UE for short) may receive a system message broadcast by a base station on a physical broadcast channel (PBCH for short). The system message includes a system parameter and configuration information of a paging message sent by the base station to each UE. The system parameter includes default DRX parameter and paging density nB and is used to instruct the UE to determine a paging cycle, a paging frame (PF for short), and a PO subframe that are occupied by the paging message on a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH for short) according to the system parameter. The configuration information includes time-frequency information of the paging message, and the time-frequency information is used to instruct the UE to determine, according to the time-frequency information, a time-frequency resource occupied by the paging message in the PO subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Step <b>120</b>: The UE determines a paging cycle, a PF and a PO subframe according to the system parameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Specifically, the UE may obtain, according to the default DRX parameter and paging density nB in the system parameter, a paging cycle, a PF and a PO subframe that are occupied by the paging message on the PDSCH. The PF corresponds to an LTE radio frame, and the PO subframe corresponds to a subframe in an LTE radio frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Step <b>130</b>: The UE determines, according to the configuration information, a time-frequency resource occupied by the paging message in the PO subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Specifically, the time-frequency information indicates a time-frequency resource occupied by the paging message in the PO subframe. The UE may obtain, according to the time-frequency information in the configuration information, a time-frequency resource occupied by the paging message in the PO subframe. One PO subframe may include multiple time-frequency resources, and one time-frequency resource corresponds to a data block in the PO subframe. In a same PO subframe, time-frequency resources of different channels may carry different data, where a time-frequency resource of a PDSCH is used to carry a paging message, so that the UE detects whether there is the paging message on the time-frequency resource.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Because the UE may acquire time-frequency information of the paging message by receiving the system message broadcast by the base station, and the system message may be broadcast by using an existing broadcasting manner, such as a PBCH, of a system, the UE can detect whether a paging message exists in the PDSCH without parsing a PDCCH, thereby reducing PDCCH overheads and saving channel resources of the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Step <b>140</b>: The UE detects, within the paging cycle according to the PF, PO subframe, and time-frequency resource, whether a paging message exists in the PDSCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Specifically, within the paging cycle, the UE starting from the PO subframe of the PF detects whether there is a paging message on the time-frequency resource of the PO subframe. If yes, the UE receives the paging message; if not, within a next paging cycle, the UE continues detecting whether there is a paging message on the time-frequency resource.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In order to enable UE in a coverage area with poor signal quality to normally receive a paging message, a base station needs to repeatedly send the paging message in a subsequent paging cycle. A quantity of times for which the sending is repeated depends on a signal receiving level of the UE. According to a quantity N of times of repetition determined by the base station, within N successive paging cycles, the UE repeatedly detects whether there is a paging message until the UE detects that there is a paging message or a quantity of times of repetition is reached. The base station may page only one UE in one PO subframe, and then, a quantity of times for which the sending is repeated depends on a signal receiving level of the UE; or the base station may page multiple UEs in one PO subframe, and then a quantity of times for which the sending is repeated depends on a signal receiving level of UE with the worst coverage of the UEs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">It should be noted that, usually, if the UE detects that there is a paging message on the time-frequency resource, a process of processing, by the UE, the paging message is as follows: receiving, by the UE, the paging message; determining, according to a destination device identifier carried in the paging message, whether a user equipment identifier UE_ID of the UE is consistent with the destination device identifier; and if yes, parsing, by the UE, the paging message and sending uplink data or signaling on an uplink resource randomly accessed by the UE to the base station, so as to respond to this paging of the base station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In the paging method of this embodiment, UE may receive a system message broadcast by a base station, where the system message includes a system parameter and configuration information of a paging message, and may determine a time-frequency resource occupied by the paging message. Because the system message may be broadcast by using an existing broadcasting manner, such as a PBCH, of a system, channel resources of the system are saved without occupying a PDCCH; in particular, when the base station needs to repeatedly send a paging message to the UE, channel resources of the system occupied for repeatedly sending the paging message are reduced, so that the UE located in a coverage area with poor signal quality can normally and efficiently receive the paging message.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Embodiment 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a flowchart of a paging method according to another embodiment. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, components having reference signs the same as those of components in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> have functions the same as those of the components in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For brevity, detailed descriptions of the components are omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the paging method shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> differs from the paging method shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> mainly in that UE may determine a paging cycle, a PF, a PO subframe, and a time-frequency resource according to information, such as time-frequency information, in configuration information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Specifically, step <b>120</b> may specifically include the following steps:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Step <b>210</b>: The UE determines the paging cycle according to the system parameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Specifically, the UE may select a smaller value from a system default DRX parameter included in the system parameter and a specific DRX parameter of the UE to obtain a paging cycle T occupied by the paging message. For example, if the system default DRX parameter is 128 frames, and the specific DRX parameter of the UE is 256 frames, T is 128 frames.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In a possible implementation manner, besides determining a paging cycle according to system parameter, the UE may also determine a paging cycle according to a system parameter and configuration information together. The configuration information may further include an extension coefficient of the paging cycle. The UE may determine the paging cycle according to the system parameter and the extension coefficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Specifically, the UE may use a product of the default DRX parameter included in the system parameter and the extension coefficient as a paging cycle T, so that duration of the paging cycle T is greater than default duration, and the default duration is duration determined according to the system default DRX parameter. For example, if the system default DRX parameter is 128 frames, and the extension coefficient is 2, T is 256 frames. If the configuration information includes the extension coefficient of the paging cycle, the base station sends the paging message by using the extended paging cycle T; accordingly, the UE may determine a PF and a PO subframe according to the extended paging cycle T.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">If the base station needs to perform a large quantity of times of repeated sending to the UE, time-frequency resources occupied by paging messages of different UEs may overlap with each other, which increases a probability that a paging collision occurs between different UEs. An interval between paging cycles of different UEs may be increased by extending the paging cycle, which increases a probability that a paging collision occurs between different UEs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">It should be noted that the configuration information may include one or more extension coefficients. Different extension coefficients may correspond to signal receiving levels of different UEs. If the configuration information includes multiple extension coefficients, the UE may determine a corresponding extension coefficient according to a signal receiving level of the UE and obtain a paging cycle T according to the extension coefficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Step <b>220</b>: The UE determines the PF according to the system parameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Specifically, the UE may select a smaller value from the paging density nB obtained in step <b>110</b> and the paging cycle T obtained in step <b>210</b> to obtain a quantity N of PFs in one paging cycle T; obtain a user equipment identifier UE_ID according to UE_ID=IMSI mod 1024; and according to the user equipment identifier UE_ID, obtain that a frame number of the PF is a value of an SFN that satisfies SFN mod T=(T div N)*(UE_ID mod N). The IMSI is a unique international mobile subscriber identity (English: international mobile subscriber identity, IMSI for short) of the UE. For example, if T is 128 frames, nB equals T, that is, 128 frames, and UE_ID is 132, then N is 128, and it is obtained that the PF is a frame satisfying SFN=4+128*n (n is a natural number).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Step <b>230</b>: The UE determines the PO subframe according to the system parameter and configuration information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">The configuration information may include one or more types of information such as time-frequency information, mode information, multiplexing information, and an extension coefficient of a paging cycle.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Manner <b>1</b>: If the configuration information includes only time-frequency information, the UE determines the PO subframe according to the PF and the system parameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Specifically, the UE gets a maximum value from 1 and nB/T according to the paging density nB obtained in step <b>110</b> and the paging cycle T obtained in step <b>210</b>, to obtain a quantity Ns of PO subframes in the PF; obtains i_s=floor(UE_ID/N) mod Ns according to the quantity N of PFs in one paging cycle T obtained in step <b>210</b>, a user equipment identifier UE_ID and Ns; and obtains a PO subframe (namely, an initial PO subframe) according to correspondences between i_s and a PO subframe in different LTE network modes, for example, a correspondence between i_s and a PO subframe in frequency division duplex Long Term Evolution (FDD-LTE for short) mode shown in Table 1.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">It should be noted that the UE may further listen to a paging message in a corresponding PO subframe only when i_s is 0. For example, according to Table 1, it could be obtained by calculation that when Ns is 0, PO subframes corresponding to UE<b>1</b> when i_s is 0, 1, 2, and 3 are the 0<sup>th</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 9<sup>th </sup>subframes respectively, and in this case, the base station may send the paging message of UE<b>1</b> in the corresponding PO subframe, namely, the 0<sup>th </sup>subframe, only when i_s is 0. Such a manner can reduce a total quantity of PO subframes occupied by a paging message of the UE and improve flexibility and efficiency of paging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Manner <b>2</b>: If the configuration information includes mode information of a PO subframe, the UE determines the PO subframe according to the PF and mode information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Specifically, the mode information is used to specify a PO subframe occupied by the base station each time for sending the paging message to the UE. If the base station needs to repeatedly send the paging message to the UE, the base station may send the paging message in sequence in PO subframes specified in the mode information and in different paging cycles, so that the UE detects whether there is a paging message in the corresponding PO subframe. The first PO subframe in the mode information may be the initial PO subframe determined according to the manner <b>1</b>, and the rest PO subframes may be determined according to a requirement of repeatedly sending the paging message. For example, if the mode information is (0, 1, 2), indicating that the PO subframes are the 0<sup>th</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup>, and 2<sup>nd </sup>subframes, the base station may send the paging message to the UE separately in the 0<sup>th </sup>subframe of the first PF, the 1<sup>st </sup>subframe of the second PF, and the 2<sup>nd </sup>subframe of the third PF within three successive paging cycles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">If the base station needs to repeatedly send the paging message to the UE, the manner <b>2</b> prevents the paging message of the UE from occupying one PO subframe for a long time, thereby reducing paging delay of another UE, reducing paging collisions between different UEs, and improving flexibility and efficiency of paging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">It should be noted that the mode information may be preset in the base station and UE; alternatively, after the UE receives the system message broadcast by the base station, the mode information is obtained from the system message, and PO subframes occupied by all paging messages sent subsequently by the base station to the UE are determined according to the mode information, so that the system message each time broadcast by the base station does not need to always include mode information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In a possible implementation manner, if the configuration information includes multiple pieces of mode information, the UE may select corresponding mode information according to a coverage enhancement level of the UE, and then determine a PO subframe according to the manner <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Specifically, in a same coverage area, according to different signal receiving levels of UEs, different UEs need different coverage enhancement levels. The base station may configure different paging resources for different UEs accordingly, and set different mode information for different paging resources, so that UE detects whether there is a paging message only in a PO subframe corresponding to the UE. For example, in a same coverage area, if losses of UE<b>1</b> and UE<b>2</b> when receiving a signal are separately 20 dB and 15 dB, it may be obtained accordingly that quantities of times of repetition needed by UE<b>1</b> and UE<b>2</b> are separately, for example, 5 and 3, that is, the coverage enhancement level to which UE<b>1</b> belongs is higher than that to which UE<b>2</b> belongs, and mode information configured by the base station for UE<b>1</b> and mode information configured by the base station for UE<b>2</b> are (0, 3, 4, 5, 6) and (0, 1, 2) respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">If the base station needs to repeatedly send the paging message to multiple UEs, such as manner reduces a total quantity of PO subframes occupied by the paging message sent by the base station to UEs of a same coverage enhancement level, thereby improving flexibility and efficiency of paging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">It should be noted that the coverage enhancement level to which the UE belongs and a corresponding paging resource of the UE may be preset in the base station; alternatively, the UE detects a signal receiving level of the UE, determines a coverage enhancement level of the UE, obtains, after the UE receives the system message broadcast by the base station, a correspondence between the coverage enhancement level and a paging resource from the system message, and determines the paging resource corresponding to the UE according to the correspondence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Because the UE determines a PO subframe according to the foregoing multiple types of information included in the configuration information, flexibility and efficiency of paging are improved; in particular, when the base station needs to repeatedly send the paging message to the UE, PO subframes occupied by the paging message are reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">In the paging method of this embodiment, PO subframes occupied by the paging message are reduced by determining, by the UE according to different information in the configuration information, a paging cycle, a PF, a PO subframe, and a time-frequency resource, and in particular, when the base station repeatedly sends the paging message to the UE, PO subframes occupied by the repeatedly sent paging message are reduced, thereby improving flexibility and efficiency of paging.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Specifically, if the UE detects that there is a paging message for the UE on the time-frequency resource, a process of processing, by the UE, the paging message is as follows: receiving, by the UE, the paging message; determining, according to a destination device identifier carried in the paging message, whether a user equipment identifier UE_ID of the UE is consistent with the destination device identifier; if yes, parsing, by the UE, the paging message and obtaining, allocation information of an uplink resource from the paging message to determine the uplink resource; and sending, by the UE, uplink data or signaling on the uplink resource to the base station, so as to respond to this paging of the base station.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">Because the base station can broadcast the system message to the UE, so as to enable the UE to obtain time-frequency information of the paging message, and the system message may be broadcast by using an existing broadcasting manner, such as a PBCH, of a system, the UE can detect whether a paging message exists in a PDSCH without parsing a PDCCH, thereby reducing PDCCH overheads and saving channel resources of the system; in particular, when the base station needs to repeatedly send the paging message to the UE, channel resources of the system occupied for repeatedly sending the paging message are reduced.</div>
