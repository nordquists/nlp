Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a manufacturing method of the semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Note that one embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the above technical field. The technical field of one embodiment of the invention disclosed in this specification and the like relates to an object, a method, or a manufacturing method. In addition, the present invention relates to a process, a machine, manufacture, or a composition of matter. In particular, the present invention relates to a semiconductor device, a display device, a light-emitting device, a power storage device, a storage device, a driving method thereof, or a manufacturing method thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In this specification and the like, a semiconductor device generally means a device that can function by utilizing semiconductor characteristics. A semiconductor element such as a transistor, a semiconductor circuit, an arithmetic device, and a memory device are each an embodiment of a semiconductor device. An imaging device, a display device, a liquid crystal display device, a light-emitting device, an electro-optical device, a power generation device (including a thin film solar cell, an organic thin film solar cell, and the like), and an electronic device may each include a semiconductor device.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Attention has been focused on a technique for forming a transistor using a semiconductor thin film formed over a substrate having an insulating surface (also referred to as a field-effect transistor (FET) or a thin film transistor (TFT)). Such transistors are applied to a wide range of electronic devices such as an integrated circuit (IC) and an image display device (display device). A semiconductor material typified by silicon is widely known as a material for a semiconductor thin film that can be used for a transistor. As another material, an oxide semiconductor has been attracting attention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A reliable semiconductor device in which stable electrical characteristics are applied to a transistor using an oxide semiconductor is disclosed (e.g., see Patent Document 1). In the semiconductor device, oxide semiconductor films with different compositions are stacked so that an oxide semiconductor film containing many In is provided on the channel side and an oxide semiconductor film containing many stabilizers such as Ga is provided on the back-channel side.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The oxide semiconductor film containing many In might have a small energy band gap (Eg) (for example, smaller than 3.0 eV). In this case, an oxide semiconductor film with larger Eg (for example, 3.0 eV or more and 3.5 eV or less) is more influenced by light than an oxide semiconductor film with smaller Eg. As a result of a bias-temperature stress test with application of a negative bias voltage and light irradiation (negative gate bias temperature (GBT) test with light), reliability of a transistor including the oxide semiconductor film with smaller Eg is sometimes reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The negative GBT stress test with light irradiation is one kind of accelerated test and can evaluate, in a short time, change in characteristics of transistors, which is caused by long-term use. In particular, the amount of shift in threshold voltage (ΔVth) of the transistor between before and after a negative GBT stress test with light irradiation is an important indicator for examining reliability. The smaller the shift in the threshold voltage (ΔVth) between before and after a negative GBT stress test with light irradiation is, the higher the reliability of the transistor is.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the problems, an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to suppress a change in electrical characteristics and to improve reliability in a semiconductor device including a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film containing many In. Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device with low power consumption. Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a novel semiconductor device. Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a novel semiconductor device. Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a novel display device.</div>

<heading id="h-0009">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described with reference to drawings. The embodiments can be implemented with various modes. It will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that modes and details can be changed in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to the following description of the embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">In the drawings, the size, the layer thickness, or the region is exaggerated for clarity in some cases. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to such a scale. Note that the drawings are schematic views showing ideal examples, and embodiments of the present invention are not limited to shapes or values shown in the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Note that in this specification, ordinal numbers such as “first”, “second”, and “third” are used in order to avoid confusion among components, and the terms do not limit the components numerically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Note that in this specification, terms for describing arrangement, such as “over” “above”, “under”, and “below”, are used for convenience in describing a positional relation between components with reference to drawings. The positional relation between components is changed as appropriate in accordance with a direction in which each component is described. Thus, there is no limitation on terms used in this specification, and description can be made appropriately depending on the situation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In this specification and the like, a transistor is an element having at least three terminals of a gate, a drain, and a source. In addition, the transistor has a channel region between a drain (a drain terminal, a drain region, or a drain electrode) and a source (a source terminal, a source region, or a source electrode), and current can flow through the drain region, the channel region, and the source region. Note that in this specification and the like, a channel region refers to a region through which current mainly flows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Functions of a source and a drain might be switched when transistors having different polarities are employed or a direction of current flow is changed in circuit operation, for example. Therefore, the terms “source” and “drain” can be switched in this specification and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Note that in this specification and the like, the expression “electrically connected” includes the case where components are connected through an “object having any electric function”. There is no particular limitation on an “object having any electric function” as long as electric signals can be transmitted and received between components that are connected through the object. Examples of an “object having any electric function” are a switching element such as a transistor, a resistor, an inductor, a capacitor, and elements with a variety of functions as well as an electrode and a wiring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Note that in this specification and the like, a “silicon oxynitride film” refers to a film that includes oxygen at a higher proportion than nitrogen, and a “silicon nitride oxide film” refers to a film that includes nitrogen at a higher proportion than oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In describing structures of the invention with reference to the drawings in this specification and the like, common reference numerals are used for the same portions in different drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In this specification and the like, the term “parallel” indicates that the angle formed between two straight lines is greater than or equal to −10° and less than or equal to 10°, and thus includes the angle greater than or equal to −5° and less than or equal to 5°. The term “perpendicular” indicates that the angle formed between two straight lines is greater than or equal to 80° and less than or equal to 100°, and thus includes the angle greater than or equal to □5° and less than or equal to 95°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In this specification and the like, the terms “film” and “layer” can be interchanged with each other depending on the case or circumstances. For example, the term “conductive layer” can be changed into the term “conductive film” in some cases. The term “insulating film” can be changed into the term “insulating layer” in some cases.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">In the case where hafnium oxide is used for the insulating film <b>107</b>, the following effect is attained. Hafnium oxide has a higher dielectric constant than silicon oxide and silicon oxynitride. Therefore, by using hafnium oxide, the thickness of the insulating film <b>107</b> can be made large as compared with the case where silicon oxide is used; thus, leakage current due to tunnel current can be low. That is, it is possible to provide a transistor with a low off-state current. Moreover, hafnium oxide with a crystalline structure has higher dielectric constant than hafnium oxide with an amorphous structure. Therefore, it is preferable to use hafnium oxide with a crystalline structure in order to provide a transistor with a low off-state current. Examples of the crystalline structure include a monoclinic crystal structure and a cubic crystal structure. Note that one embodiment of the present invention is not limited thereto.</div>

In the case where the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is formed of In-M-Zn oxide, it is preferable to use a target including polycrystalline In-M-Zn oxide as the sputtering target.

A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has few carrier generation sources, and thus can have a low carrier density. Thus, a transistor in which a channel region is formed in the oxide semiconductor film rarely has a negative threshold voltage (is rarely normally on). A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has a low density of defect states and accordingly has few carrier traps in some cases. Further, the highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has an extremely low off-state current; even when an element has a channel width W of 1×10<sup>6 </sup>μm and a channel length L of 10 μm, the off-state current can be less than or equal to the measurement limit of a semiconductor parameter analyzer, that is, less than or equal to 1×10<sup>−13 </sup>A, at a voltage (drain voltage) between a source electrode and a drain electrode of from 1 V to 10 V.</div>

This is because if the density of defects in the insulating film <b>114</b> is high, oxygen is bonded to the defects and the amount of oxygen that transmits the insulating film <b>114</b> is decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Note that all oxygen entering the insulating film <b>114</b> from the outside does not move to the outside of the insulating film <b>114</b> and some oxygen remains in the insulating film <b>114</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Deposition by an ALD method may be performed in such a manner that the pressure in a chamber is set to an atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure, source gases for reaction are sequentially introduced into the chamber, and then the sequence of the gas introduction is repeated. For example, two or more kinds of source gases are sequentially supplied to the chamber by switching respective switching valves (also referred to as high-speed valves). For example, a first source gas is introduced, an inert gas (e.g., argon or nitrogen) or the like is introduced at the same time as or after the introduction of the first gas so that the source gases are not mixed, and then a second source gas is introduced. Note that in the case where the first source gas and the inert gas are introduced at a time, the inert gas serves as a carrier gas, and the inert gas may also be introduced at the same time as the introduction of the second source gas. Alternatively, the first source gas may be exhausted by vacuum evacuation instead of the introduction of the inert gas, and then the second source gas may be introduced. The first source gas is adsorbed on the surface of the substrate to form a first layer; then the second source gas is introduced to react with the first layer; as a result, a second layer is stacked over the first layer, so that a thin film is formed. The sequence of the gas introduction is repeated plural times until a desired thickness is obtained, whereby a thin film with excellent step coverage can be formed. The thickness of the thin film can be adjusted by the number of repetition times of the sequence of the gas introduction; therefore, an ALD method makes it possible to accurately adjust a thickness and thus is suitable for manufacturing a minute FET.</div>

A device structure of a transistor, like that of the transistor <b>170</b>, in which electric fields of a gate electrode and a second gate electrode electrically surround an oxide semiconductor film where a channel region is formed can be referred to as a surrounded channel (s-channel) structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">Since the transistor <b>170</b> has the s-channel structure, an electric field for inducing a channel can be effectively applied to the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> by the conductive film <b>104</b> functioning as a gate electrode; therefore, the current drive capability of the transistor <b>170</b> can be improved and high on-state current characteristics can be obtained. Since the on-state current can be increased, it is possible to reduce the size of the transistor <b>170</b>. In addition, since the transistor <b>170</b> is surrounded by the conductive film <b>104</b> functioning as a gate electrode and the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>b </i>functioning as a second gate electrode, the mechanical strength of the transistor <b>170</b> can be increased.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">Next, a method for manufacturing the transistor <b>100</b>, which is a semiconductor device of one embodiment of the present invention, is described below in detail using <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4D</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5D</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4D</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5D</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Note that the films included in the transistor <b>100</b> (i.e., the insulating film, the oxide semiconductor film, the conductive film, and the like) can be formed by any of a sputtering method, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, a vacuum evaporation method, and a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. Alternatively, a coating method or a printing method can be used. Although the sputtering method and a PECVD method are typical examples of the film formation method, a thermal CVD method may be used. As the thermal CVD method, an MOCVD method may be used, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">Deposition by the thermal CVD method may be performed in such a manner that the pressure in a chamber is set to an atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure, and a source gas and an oxidizer are supplied to the chamber at a time and react with each other in the vicinity of the substrate or over the substrate. Thus, no plasma is generated in the deposition; therefore, the thermal CVD method has an advantage that no defect due to plasma damage is caused.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Deposition by an ALD method is performed in such a manner that the pressure in a chamber is set to an atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure, source gases for reaction are sequentially introduced into the chamber, and then the sequence of the gas introduction is repeated. For example, two or more kinds of source gases are sequentially supplied to the chamber by switching respective switching valves (also referred to as high-speed valves). For example, a first source gas is introduced, an inert gas (e.g., argon or nitrogen) or the like is introduced at the same time as or after the introduction of the first gas so that the source gases are not mixed, and then a second source gas is introduced. Note that in the case where the first source gas and the inert gas are introduced at a time, the inert gas serves as a carrier gas, and the inert gas may also be introduced at the same time as the introduction of the second source gas. Alternatively, the first source gas may be exhausted by vacuum evacuation instead of the introduction of the inert gas, and then the second source gas may be introduced. The first source gas is adsorbed on the surface of the substrate to form a first single-atomic layer; then the second source gas is introduced to react with the first single-atomic layer; as a result, a second single-atomic layer is stacked over the first single-atomic layer, so that a thin film is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">The sequence of the gas introduction is repeated plural times until a desired thickness is obtained, whereby a thin film with excellent step coverage can be formed. The thickness of the thin film can be adjusted by the number of repetition times of the sequence of the gas introduction; therefore, an ALD method makes it possible to accurately adjust a thickness and thus is suitable for manufacturing a minute transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">First, a conductive film is formed over the substrate <b>102</b> and processed through a lithography process and an etching process, whereby the conductive film <b>104</b> functioning as a first gate electrode is formed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">As a method for adding the oxygen <b>139</b> to the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> through the oxide conductive film <b>131</b>, an ion doping method, an ion implantation method, plasma treatment, or the like is given. By the bias application to the substrate side when the oxygen <b>139</b> is added, the oxygen <b>139</b> can be effectively added to the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">For example, in the case where a silicon nitride film is formed by a PECVD method as the insulating film <b>118</b>, a deposition gas containing silicon, nitrogen, and ammonia are preferably used as a source gas. A small amount of ammonia compared to the amount of nitrogen is used, whereby ammonia is dissociated in the plasma and activated species are generated. The activated species break a bond between silicon and hydrogen that are contained in a deposition gas containing silicon and a triple bond between nitrogen molecules. As a result, a dense silicon nitride film having few defects, in which bonds between silicon and nitrogen are promoted and bonds between silicon and hydrogen is few, can be formed. On the other hand, when the amount of ammonia with respect to nitrogen is large, decomposition of a deposition gas containing silicon and decomposition of nitrogen are not promoted, so that a sparse silicon nitride film in which bonds between silicon and hydrogen remain and defects are increased is formed. Therefore, in the source gas, a flow rate ratio of the nitrogen to the ammonia is set to be greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 50, preferably greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 50.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0222">In this embodiment, the structure of an oxide semiconductor included in a semiconductor device of one embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0021" num="0000">&lt;Structure of Oxide Semiconductor&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0223">An oxide semiconductor is classified into a single crystal oxide semiconductor and a non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor. Examples of a non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor include a c-axis aligned crystalline oxide semiconductor (CAAC-OS), a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor, a nanocrystalline oxide semiconductor (nc-OS), an amorphous-like oxide semiconductor (a-like OS), and an amorphous oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0224">From another perspective, an oxide semiconductor is classified into an amorphous oxide semiconductor and a crystalline oxide semiconductor. Examples of a crystalline oxide semiconductor include a single crystal oxide semiconductor, a CAAC-OS, a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor, and an nc-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0225">It is known that an amorphous structure is generally defined as being metastable and unfixed, and being isotropic and having no non-uniform structure. In other words, an amorphous structure has a flexible bond angle and a short-range order but does not have a long-range order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0226">This means that an inherently stable oxide semiconductor cannot be regarded as a completely amorphous oxide semiconductor. Moreover, an oxide semiconductor that is not isotropic (e.g., an oxide semiconductor that has a periodic structure in a microscopic region) cannot be regarded as a completely amorphous oxide semiconductor. Note that an a-like OS has a periodic structure in a microscopic region, but at the same time has a void and has an unstable structure. For this reason, an a-like OS has physical properties similar to those of an amorphous oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0022" num="0000">&lt;CAAC-OS&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0227">First, a CAAC-OS will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0228">The CAAC-OS is one of oxide semiconductors having a plurality of c-axis aligned crystal parts (also referred to as pellets).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0229">In a combined analysis image (also referred to as a high-resolution TEM image) of a bright-field image and a diffraction pattern of a CAAC-OS, which is obtained using a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a plurality of pellets can be observed. However, in the high-resolution TEM image, a boundary between pellets, that is, a grain boundary is not clearly observed. Thus, in the CAAC-OS, a reduction in electron mobility due to the grain boundary is less likely to occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0230">A CAAC-OS observed with TEM will be described below. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref> shows a high-resolution TEM image of a cross section of the CAAC-OS which is observed from a direction substantially parallel to the sample surface. The high-resolution TEM image is obtained with a spherical aberration corrector function. The high-resolution TEM image obtained with a spherical aberration corrector function is particularly referred to as a Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM image. The Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM image can be obtained with, for example, an atomic resolution analytical electron microscope JEM-ARM200F manufactured by JEOL Ltd.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0231"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref> is an enlarged Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM image of a region (1) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref> shows that metal atoms are arranged in a layered manner in a pellet. Each metal atom layer has a configuration reflecting unevenness of a surface over which a CAAC-OS film is formed (hereinafter, the surface is referred to as a formation surface) or a top surface of the CAAC-OS film, and is arranged parallel to the formation surface or the top surface of the CAAC-OS film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref>, the CAAC-OS has a characteristic atomic arrangement. The characteristic atomic arrangement is denoted by an auxiliary line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34C</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34B and 34C</figref> prove that the size of a pellet is greater than or equal to 1 nm or greater than or equal to 3 nm, and the size of a space caused by tilt of the pellets is approximately 0.8 nm. Therefore, the pellet can also be referred to as a nanocrystal (nc). Furthermore, the CAAC-OS can also be referred to as an oxide semiconductor including c-axis aligned nanocrystals (CANC).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0233">Here, according to the Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM images, the schematic arrangement of pellets <b>5100</b> of a CAAC-OS over a substrate <b>5120</b> is illustrated by such a structure in which bricks or blocks are stacked (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34D</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref> shows a Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM image of a plane of the CAAC-OS observed from a direction substantially perpendicular to the sample surface. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35B, 35C</figref>, and <b>35</b>D are enlarged Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM images of regions (1), (2), and (3) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref>, respectively. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35B, 35C, and 35D</figref> indicate that metal atoms are arranged in a triangular, quadrangular, or hexagonal configuration in a pellet. However, there is no regularity of arrangement of metal atoms between different pellets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">Next, a CAAC-OS analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) will be described. For example, when the structure of a CAAC-OS including an InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal is analyzed by an out-of-plane method, a peak appears at a diffraction angle (2θ) of around 31° as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</figref>. This peak is derived from the (009) plane of the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal, which indicates that crystals in the CAAC-OS have c-axis alignment, and that the c-axes are aligned in a direction substantially perpendicular to the formation surface or the top surface of the CAAC-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236">Note that in structural analysis of the CAAC-OS by an out-of-plane method, another peak may appear when 2θ is around 36°, in addition to the peak at 2θ of around 31°. The peak at 2θ of around 36° indicates that a crystal having no c-axis alignment is included in part of the CAAC-OS. It is preferable that in the CAAC-OS analyzed by an out-of-plane method, a peak appear when 2θ is around 31° and that a peak not appear when 2θ is around 36°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0237">On the other hand, in structural analysis of the CAAC-OS by an in-plane method in which an X-ray beam is incident on a sample in a direction substantially perpendicular to the c-axis, a peak appears when 2θ is around 56°. This peak is attributed to the (110) plane of the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal. In the case of the CAAC-OS, when analysis (ϕ scan) is performed with 2θ fixed at around 56° and with the sample rotated using a normal vector of the sample surface as an axis (ϕ axis), as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>, a peak is not clearly observed. In contrast, in the case of a single crystal oxide semiconductor of InGaZnO<sub>4</sub>, when ϕ scan is performed with 2θ fixed at around 56°, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36C</figref>, six peaks which are derived from crystal planes equivalent to the (110) plane are observed. Accordingly, the structural analysis using XRD shows that the directions of a-axes and b-axes are irregularly oriented in the CAAC-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">Next, a CAAC-OS analyzed by electron diffraction will be described. For example, when an electron beam with a probe diameter of 300 nm is incident on a CAAC-OS including an InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal in a direction parallel to the sample surface, a diffraction pattern (also referred to as a selected-area transmission electron diffraction pattern) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</figref> can be obtained. In this diffraction pattern, spots derived from the (009) plane of an InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal are included. Thus, the electron diffraction also indicates that pellets included in the CAAC-OS have c-axis alignment and that the c-axes are aligned in a direction substantially perpendicular to the formation surface or the top surface of the CAAC-OS. Meanwhile, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref> shows a diffraction pattern obtained in such a manner that an electron beam with a probe diameter of 300 nm is incident on the same sample in a direction perpendicular to the sample surface. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref>, a ring-like diffraction pattern is observed. Thus, the electron diffraction also indicates that the a-axes and b-axes of the pellets included in the CAAC-OS do not have regular alignment. The first ring in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref> is considered to be derived from the (010) plane, the (100) plane, and the like of the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal. The second ring in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref> is considered to be derived from the (110) plane and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0239">As described above, the CAAC-OS is an oxide semiconductor with high crystallinity. Entry of impurities, formation of defects, or the like might decrease the crystallinity of an oxide semiconductor. This means that the CAAC-OS has small amounts of impurities and defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0240">Note that the impurity means an element other than the main components of the oxide semiconductor, such as hydrogen, carbon, silicon, or a transition metal element. For example, an element (specifically, silicon or the like) having higher strength of bonding to oxygen than a metal element included in an oxide semiconductor extracts oxygen from the oxide semiconductor, which results in disorder of the atomic arrangement and reduced crystallinity of the oxide semiconductor. A heavy metal such as iron or nickel, argon, carbon dioxide, or the like has a large atomic radius (or molecular radius), and thus disturbs the atomic arrangement of the oxide semiconductor and decreases crystallinity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0241">The characteristics of an oxide semiconductor having impurities or defects might be changed by light, heat, or the like. For example, impurities contained in the oxide semiconductor might serve as carrier traps or carrier generation sources. Furthermore, oxygen vacancies in the oxide semiconductor serve as carrier traps or serve as carrier generation sources when hydrogen is captured therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0242">The CAAC-OS having small amounts of impurities and oxygen vacancies is an oxide semiconductor with a low carrier density. Such an oxide semiconductor is referred to as a highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor. A CAAC-OS has a low impurity concentration and a low density of defect states. Thus, the CAAC-OS can be referred to as an oxide semiconductor having stable characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0023" num="0000">&lt;nc-OS&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">Next, an nc-OS will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">An nc-OS has a region in which a crystal part is observed and a region in which a crystal part is not clearly observed in a high-resolution TEM image. In most cases, the size of a crystal part included in the nc-OS is greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, or greater than or equal to 1 nm. Note that an oxide semiconductor including a crystal part whose size is greater than 10 nm and less than or equal to 100 nm is sometimes referred to as a microcrystalline oxide semiconductor. In a high-resolution TEM image of the nc-OS, for example, a grain boundary is not clearly observed in some cases. Note that there is a possibility that the origin of the nanocrystal is the same as that of a pellet in a CAAC-OS. Therefore, a crystal part of the nc-OS may be referred to as a pellet in the following description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">In the nc-OS, a microscopic region (for example, a region with a size greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, in particular, a region with a size greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm) has a periodic atomic arrangement. There is no regularity of crystal orientation between different pellets in the nc-OS. Thus, the orientation of the whole film is not observed. Accordingly, the nc-OS cannot be distinguished from an a-like OS or an amorphous oxide semiconductor, depending on an analysis method. For example, when the nc-OS is analyzed by an out-of-plane method using an X-ray beam having a diameter larger than the size of a pellet, a peak which shows a crystal plane does not appear. Furthermore, a diffraction pattern like a halo pattern is observed when the nc-OS is subjected to electron diffraction using an electron beam with a probe diameter (e.g., 50 nm or larger) that is larger than the size of a pellet. Meanwhile, spots appear in a nanobeam electron diffraction pattern of the nc-OS when an electron beam having a probe diameter close to or smaller than the size of a pellet is applied. Moreover, in a nanobeam electron diffraction pattern of the nc-OS, bright regions in a circular (ring) pattern are shown in some cases. Also in a nanobeam electron diffraction pattern of the nc-OS, a plurality of spots are shown in a ring-like region in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">Since there is no regularity of crystal orientation between the pellets (nanocrystals) as mentioned above, the nc-OS can also be referred to as an oxide semiconductor including random aligned nanocrystals (RANC) or an oxide semiconductor including non-aligned nanocrystals (NANC).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">The nc-OS is an oxide semiconductor that has high regularity as compared with an amorphous oxide semiconductor. Therefore, the nc-OS is likely to have a lower density of defect states than an a-like OS and an amorphous oxide semiconductor. Note that there is no regularity of crystal orientation between different pellets in the nc-OS. Therefore, the nc-OS has a higher density of defect states than the CAAC-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0024" num="0000">&lt;a-Like OS&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">An a-like OS has a structure intermediate between those of the nc-OS and the amorphous oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">In a high-resolution TEM image of the a-like OS, a void may be observed. Furthermore, in the high-resolution TEM image, there are a region where a crystal part is clearly observed and a region where a crystal part is not observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">The a-like OS has an unstable structure because it includes a void. To verify that an a-like OS has an unstable structure as compared with a CAAC-OS and an nc-OS, a change in structure caused by electron irradiation is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">An a-like OS (referred to as Sample A), an nc-OS (referred to as Sample B), and a CAAC-OS (referred to as Sample C) are prepared as samples subjected to electron irradiation. Each of the samples is an In—Ga—Zn oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">First, a high-resolution cross-sectional TEM image of each sample is obtained. The high-resolution cross-sectional TEM images show that all the samples have crystal parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">Note that which part is regarded as a crystal part is determined as follows. It is known that a unit cell of an InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal has a structure in which nine layers including three In—O layers and six Ga—Zn—O layers are stacked in the c-axis direction. The distance between the adjacent layers is equivalent to the lattice spacing on the (009) plane (also referred to as d value). The value is calculated to be 0.29 nm from crystal structural analysis. Accordingly, a portion where the lattice spacing between lattice fringes is greater than or equal to 0.28 nm and less than or equal to 0.30 nm is regarded as a crystal part of InGaZnO<sub>4</sub>. Each of lattice fringes corresponds to the a-b plane of the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> shows change in the average size of crystal parts (at 22 points to 45 points) in each sample. Note that the crystal part size corresponds to the length of a lattice fringe. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> indicates that the crystal part size in the a-like OS increases with an increase in the cumulative electron dose. Specifically, as shown by (1) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, a crystal part of approximately 1.2 nm (also referred to as an initial nucleus) at the start of TEM observation grows to a size of approximately 2.6 nm at a cumulative electron dose of 4.2×10<sup>8 </sup>e<sup>−</sup>/nm<sup>2</sup>. In contrast, the crystal part size in the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS shows little change from the start of electron irradiation to a cumulative electron dose of 4.2×10<sup>8 </sup>e<sup>−</sup>/nm<sup>2</sup>. Specifically, as shown by (2) and (3) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the average crystal sizes in an nc-OS and a CAAC-OS are approximately 1.4 nm and approximately 2.1 nm, respectively, regardless of the cumulative electron dose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">In this manner, growth of the crystal part in the a-like OS is induced by electron irradiation. In contrast, in the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS, growth of the crystal part is hardly induced by electron irradiation. Therefore, the a-like OS has an unstable structure as compared with the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">The a-like OS has a lower density than the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS because it includes a void. Specifically, the density of the a-like OS is higher than or equal to 78.6% and lower than 92.3% of the density of the single crystal oxide semiconductor having the same composition. The density of each of the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS is higher than or equal to 92.3% and lower than 100% of the density of the single crystal oxide semiconductor having the same composition. It is difficult to deposit an oxide semiconductor having a density of lower than 78% of the density of the single crystal oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">For example, in the case of an oxide semiconductor having an atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1, the density of single crystal InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>with a rhombohedral crystal structure is 6.357 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Accordingly, in the case of the oxide semiconductor having an atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1, the density of the a-like OS is higher than or equal to 5.0 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and lower than 5.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. For example, in the case of the oxide semiconductor having an atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1, the density of each of the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS is higher than or equal to 5.9 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and lower than 6.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">Note that there is a possibility that an oxide semiconductor having a certain composition cannot exist in a single crystal structure. In that case, single crystal oxide semiconductors with different compositions are combined at an adequate ratio, which makes it possible to calculate density equivalent to that of a single crystal oxide semiconductor with the desired composition. The density of a single crystal oxide semiconductor having the desired composition can be calculated using a weighted average according to the combination ratio of the single crystal oxide semiconductors with different compositions. Note that it is preferable to use as few kinds of single crystal oxide semiconductors as possible to calculate the density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">As described above, oxide semiconductors have various structures and various properties. Note that an oxide semiconductor may be a stacked layer including two or more films of an amorphous oxide semiconductor, an a-like OS, an nc-OS, and a CAAC-OS, for example.</div>

The oxygen atoms have negative charge, whereby the two Ga—Zn—O layers repel each other. As a result, the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal has a cleavage plane between the two adjacent Ga—Zn—O layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">The substrate <b>5120</b> is placed to face the target <b>5130</b>, and the distance d (also referred to as a target-substrate distance (T-S distance)) is greater than or equal to 0.01 m and less than or equal to 1 m, preferably greater than or equal to 0.02 m and less than or equal to 0.5 m. The deposition chamber is mostly filled with a deposition gas (e.g., an oxygen gas, an argon gas, or a mixed gas containing oxygen at 5 vol % or higher) and the pressure in the deposition chamber is controlled to be higher than or equal to 0.01 Pa and lower than or equal to 100 Pa, preferably higher than or equal to 0.1 Pa and lower than or equal to 10 Pa. Here, discharge starts by application of a voltage at a certain value or higher to the target <b>5130</b>, and plasma is observed. The magnetic field forms a high-density plasma region in the vicinity of the target <b>5130</b>. In the high-density plasma region, the deposition gas is ionized, so that an ion <b>5101</b> is generated. Examples of the ion <b>5101</b> include an oxygen cation (O<sup>+</sup>) and an argon cation (Ar<sup>+</sup>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0267">The ion <b>5101</b> is accelerated toward the target <b>5130</b> side by an electric field, and then collides with the target <b>5130</b>. At this time, a pellet <b>5100</b> <i>a </i>and a pellet <b>5100</b> <i>b </i>which are flat-plate-like (pellet-like) sputtered particles are separated and sputtered from the cleavage plane. Note that structures of the pellet <b>5100</b> <i>a </i>and the pellet <b>5100</b> <i>b </i>may be distorted by an impact of collision of the ion <b>5101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">The pellet <b>5100</b> <i>a </i>is a flat-plate-like (pellet-like) sputtered particle having a triangle plane, e.g., regular triangle plane. The pellet <b>5100</b> <i>b </i>is a flat-plate-like (pellet-like) sputtered particle having a hexagon plane, e.g., regular hexagon plane. Note that flat-plate-like (pellet-like) sputtered particles such as the pellet <b>5100</b> <i>a </i>and the pellet <b>5100</b> <i>b </i>are collectively called pellets <b>5100</b>. The shape of a flat plane of the pellet <b>5100</b> is not limited to a triangle or a hexagon. For example, the flat plane may have a shape formed by combining two or more triangles. For example, a quadrangle (e.g., rhombus) may be formed by combining two triangles (e.g., regular triangles).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">The thickness of the pellet <b>5100</b> is determined depending on the kind of deposition gas and the like. The thicknesses of the pellets <b>5100</b> are preferably uniform; the reason for this is described later. In addition, the sputtered particle preferably has a pellet shape with a small thickness as compared to a dice shape with a large thickness. For example, the thickness of the pellet <b>5100</b> is greater than or equal to 0.4 nm and less than or equal to 1 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 0.6 nm and less than or equal to 0.8 nm. In addition, for example, the width of the pellet <b>5100</b> is greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 1.2 nm and less than or equal to 2.5 nm. The pellet <b>5100</b> corresponds to the initial nucleus in the description of (1) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. For example, in the case where the ion <b>5101</b> collides with the target <b>5130</b> including an In—Ga—Zn oxide, the pellet <b>5100</b> that includes three layers of a Ga—Zn—O layer, an In—O layer, and a Ga—Zn—O layer as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40B</figref> is ejected. Note that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40C</figref> shows the structure of the pellet <b>5100</b> observed from a direction parallel to the c-axis. Therefore, the pellet <b>5100</b> has a nanometer-sized sandwich structure including two Ga—Zn—O layers (pieces of bread) and an In—O layer (filling).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0270">The pellet <b>5100</b> may receive a charge when passing through the plasma, so that side surfaces thereof are negatively or positively charged. The pellet <b>5100</b> includes an oxygen atom on its side surface, and the oxygen atom may be negatively charged. In this manner, when the side surfaces are charged with the same polarity, charges repel each other, and accordingly, the pellet <b>5100</b> can maintain a flat-plate shape. In the case where a CAAC-OS is an In—Ga—Zn oxide, there is a possibility that an oxygen atom bonded to an indium atom is negatively charged. There is another possibility that an oxygen atom bonded to an indium atom, a gallium atom, or a zinc atom is negatively charged. In addition, the pellet <b>5100</b> may grow by being bonded with an indium atom, a gallium atom, a zinc atom, an oxygen atom, or the like when passing through plasma. This is a cause of a difference in size between (2) and (1) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. Here, in the case where the temperature of the substrate <b>5120</b> is at around room temperature, the pellet <b>5100</b> does not grow anymore; thus, an nc-OS is formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39B</figref>). An nc-OS can be deposited when the substrate <b>5120</b> has a large size because a temperature at which the deposition of an nc-OS is carried out is approximately room temperature. Note that in order that the pellet <b>5100</b> grows in plasma, it is effective to increase deposition power in sputtering. High deposition power can stabilize the structure of the pellet <b>5100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0271">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A and 39B</figref>, the pellet <b>5100</b> flies like a kite in plasma and flutters up to the substrate <b>5120</b>. Since the pellets <b>5100</b> are charged, when the pellet <b>5100</b> gets close to a region where another pellet <b>5100</b> has already been deposited, repulsion is generated. Here, above the substrate <b>5120</b>, a magnetic field in a direction parallel to the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b> (also referred to as a horizontal magnetic field) is generated. A potential difference is given between the substrate <b>5120</b> and the target <b>5130</b>, and accordingly, current flows from the substrate <b>5120</b> toward the target <b>5130</b>. Thus, the pellet <b>5100</b> is given a force (Lorentz force) on the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b> by an effect of the magnetic field and the current. This is explainable with Fleming's left-hand rule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0272">The mass of the pellet <b>5100</b> is larger than that of an atom. Therefore, to move the pellet <b>5100</b> over the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b>, it is important to apply some force to the pellet <b>5100</b> from the outside. One kind of the force may be force which is generated by the action of a magnetic field and current. In order to increase a force applied to the pellet <b>5100</b>, it is preferable to provide, on the top surface, a region where the magnetic field in a direction parallel to the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b> is 10 G or higher, preferably 20 G or higher, further preferably 30 G or higher, still further preferably 50 G or higher. Alternatively, it is preferable to provide, on the top surface, a region where the magnetic field in a direction parallel to the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b> is 1.5 times or higher, preferably twice or higher, further preferably 3 times or higher, still further preferably 5 times or higher as high as the magnetic field in a direction perpendicular to the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0273">At this time, magnet units and/or the substrate <b>5120</b> are moved or rotated relatively, whereby the direction of the horizontal magnetic field on the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b> continues to change. Therefore, the pellet <b>5100</b> can be moved in various directions on the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b> by receiving forces in various directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0274">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</figref>, when the substrate <b>5120</b> is heated, resistance between the pellet <b>5100</b> and the substrate <b>5120</b> due to friction or the like is low. As a result, the pellet <b>5100</b> glides above the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b>. The glide of the pellet <b>5100</b> is caused in a state where its flat plane faces the substrate <b>5120</b>. Then, when the pellet <b>5100</b> reaches the side surface of another pellet <b>5100</b> that has been already deposited, the side surfaces of the pellets <b>5100</b> are bonded. At this time, the oxygen atom on the side surface of the pellet <b>5100</b> is released. With the released oxygen atom, oxygen vacancies in a CAAC-OS might be filled; thus, the CAAC-OS has a low density of defect states. Note that the temperature of the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b> is, for example, higher than or equal to 100° C. and lower than 500° C., higher than or equal to 150° C. and lower than 450° C., or higher than or equal to 170° C. and lower than 400° C. Hence, even when the substrate <b>5120</b> has a large size, it is possible to deposit a CAAC-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">Furthermore, the pellet <b>5100</b> is heated on the substrate <b>5120</b>, whereby atoms are rearranged, and the structure distortion caused by the collision of the ion <b>5101</b> can be reduced. The pellet <b>5100</b> whose structure distortion is reduced is substantially single crystal. Even when the pellets <b>5100</b> are heated after being bonded, expansion and contraction of the pellet <b>5100</b> itself hardly occur, which is caused by turning the pellet <b>5100</b> into substantially single crystal. Thus, formation of defects such as a grain boundary due to expansion of a space between the pellets <b>5100</b> can be prevented, and accordingly, generation of crevasses can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0276">The CAAC-OS does not have a structure like a board of a single crystal oxide semiconductor but has arrangement with a group of pellets <b>5100</b> (nanocrystals) like stacked bricks or blocks. Furthermore, a grain boundary does not exist therebetween. Therefore, even when deformation such as shrink occurs in the CAAC-OS owing to heating during deposition, heating or bending after deposition, it is possible to relieve local stress or release distortion. Therefore, this structure is suitable for a flexible semiconductor device. Note that the nc-OS has arrangement in which pellets <b>5100</b> (nanocrystals) are randomly stacked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0278" num="0277">When the target is sputtered with an ion, in addition to the pellets, zinc oxide or the like may be ejected. The zinc oxide is lighter than the pellet and thus reaches the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b> before the pellet. As a result, the zinc oxide forms a zinc oxide layer <b>5102</b> with a thickness greater than or equal to 0.1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, greater than or equal to 0.2 nm and less than or equal to 5 nm, or greater than or equal to 0.5 nm and less than or equal to 2 nm. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A to 41D</figref> are cross-sectional schematic views.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0279" num="0278">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref>, a pellet <b>5105</b> <i>a </i>and a pellet <b>5105</b> <i>b </i>are deposited over the zinc oxide layer <b>5102</b>. Here, side surfaces of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>a </i>and the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>b </i>are in contact with each other. In addition, a pellet <b>5105</b> <i>c </i>is deposited over the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>b</i>, and then glides over the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>b</i>. Furthermore, a plurality of particles <b>5103</b> ejected from the target together with the zinc oxide is crystallized by heating of the substrate <b>5120</b> to form a region <b>5105</b> <i>a</i> <b>1</b> on another side surface of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>a</i>. Note that the plurality of particles <b>5103</b> may contain oxygen, zinc, indium, gallium, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0279">Then, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref>, the region <b>5105</b> <i>a</i> <b>1</b> grows to part of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>a </i>to form a pellet <b>5105</b> <i>a</i> <b>2</b>. In addition, a side surface of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>c </i>is in contact with another side surface of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0280">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41C</figref>, a pellet <b>5105</b> <i>d </i>is deposited over the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>a</i> <b>2</b> and the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>b</i>, and then glides over the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>a</i> <b>2</b> and the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>b</i>. Furthermore, a pellet <b>5105</b> <i>e </i>glides toward another side surface of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>c </i>over the zinc oxide layer <b>5102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0282" num="0281">Then, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41D</figref>, the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>d </i>is placed so that a side surface of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>d </i>is in contact with a side surface of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>a</i> <b>2</b>. Furthermore, a side surface of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>e </i>is in contact with another side surface of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>c</i>. A plurality of particles <b>5103</b> ejected from the target together with the zinc oxide is crystallized by heating of the substrate <b>5120</b> to form a region <b>5105</b> <i>d</i> <b>1</b> on another side surface of the pellet <b>5105</b> <i>d. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0282">As described above, deposited pellets are placed to be in contact with each other and then growth is caused at side surfaces of the pellets, whereby a CAAC-OS is formed over the substrate <b>5120</b>. Therefore, each pellet of the CAAC-OS is larger than that of the nc-OS. A difference in size between (3) and (2) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> corresponds to the amount of growth after deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0283">When spaces between pellets <b>5100</b> are extremely small, the pellets may form a large pellet. The large pellet has a single crystal structure. For example, the size of the large pellet may be greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 200 nm, greater than or equal to 15 nm and less than or equal to 100 nm, or greater than or equal to 20 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm, when seen from the above. Therefore, when a channel formation region of a transistor is smaller than the large pellet, the region having a single crystal structure can be used as the channel formation region. Furthermore, when the size of the pellet is increased, the region having a single crystal structure can be used as the channel formation region, the source region, and the drain region of the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0284">In this manner, when the channel formation region or the like of the transistor is formed in a region having a single crystal structure, the frequency characteristics of the transistor can be increased in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0285">As shown in such a model, the pellets <b>5100</b> are considered to be deposited on the substrate <b>5120</b>. Thus, a CAAC-OS can be deposited even when a formation surface does not have a crystal structure, which is different from film deposition by epitaxial growth. For example, even when the top surface (formation surface) of the substrate <b>5120</b> has an amorphous structure (e.g., the top surface is formed of amorphous silicon oxide), a CAAC-OS can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0287" num="0286">In addition, it is found that in formation of the CAAC-OS, the pellets <b>5100</b> are arranged in accordance with the top surface shape of the substrate <b>5120</b> that is the formation surface even when the formation surface has unevenness. For example, in the case where the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b> is flat at the atomic level, the pellets <b>5100</b> are arranged so that flat planes parallel to the a-b plane face downwards. By stacking n layers (n is a natural number), the CAAC-OS can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0287">In the case where the top surface of the substrate <b>5120</b> has unevenness, a CAAC-OS in which n layers (n is a natural number) in each of which the pellets <b>5100</b> are arranged along the unevenness are stacked is formed. Since the substrate <b>5120</b> has unevenness, a gap is easily generated between the pellets <b>5100</b> in the CAAC-OS in some cases. Note that owing to intermolecular force, the pellets <b>5100</b> are arranged so that a gap between the pellets is as small as possible even on the unevenness surface. Therefore, even when the formation surface has unevenness, a CAAC-OS with high crystallinity can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0288">As a result, laser crystallization is not needed for formation of a CAAC-OS, and a uniform film can be formed even over a large-sized glass substrate or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0289">Since a CAAC-OS is deposited in accordance with such a model, the sputtered particle preferably has a pellet shape with a small thickness. Note that when the sputtered particles have a dice shape with a large thickness, planes facing the substrate <b>5120</b> vary; thus, the thicknesses and orientations of the crystals cannot be uniform in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0290">According to the deposition model described above, a CAAC-OS with high crystallinity can be formed even on a formation surface with an amorphous structure.</div>

As the plurality of transistors, any of the transistors that are the semiconductor devices of embodiments of the present invention can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0298" num="0297">The display device <b>700</b> can include any of a variety of elements. The element includes, for example, at least one of a liquid crystal element, an electroluminescence (EL) element (e.g., an EL element including organic and inorganic materials, an organic EL element, or an inorganic EL element), an LED (e.g., a white LED, a red LED, a green LED, or a blue LED), a transistor (a transistor that emits light depending on current), an electron emitter, electronic ink, an electrophoretic element, a grating light valve (GLV), a plasma display panel (PDP), a display element using micro electro mechanical system (MEMS), a digital micromirror device (DMD), a digital micro shutter (DMS), MIRASOL (registered trademark), an interferometric modulator display (IMOD) element, a MEMS shutter display element, an optical-interference-type MEMS display element, an electrowetting element, a piezoelectric ceramic display, and a display element including a carbon nanotube. Other than the above elements, display media whose contrast, luminance, reflectivity, transmittance, or the like is changed by an electrical or magnetic effect may be included. Examples of display devices having EL elements include an EL display. Examples of display devices including electron emitters include a field emission display (FED) and an SED-type flat panel display (SED: surface-conduction electron-emitter display). Examples of display devices including liquid crystal elements include a liquid crystal display (e.g., a transmissive liquid crystal display, a transflective liquid crystal display, a reflective liquid crystal display, a direct-view liquid crystal display, or a projection liquid crystal display). An example of a display device including electronic ink or electrophoretic elements is electronic paper. In the case of a transflective liquid crystal display or a reflective liquid crystal display, some of or all of pixel electrodes function as reflective electrodes. For example, some or all of pixel electrodes are formed to include aluminum, silver, or the like. In such a case, a memory circuit such as an SRAM can be provided under the reflective electrodes, leading to lower power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0299" num="0298">As a display method in the display device <b>700</b>, a progressive method, an interlace method, or the like can be employed. Furthermore, color elements controlled in a pixel at the time of color display are not limited to three colors: R, G and B (R, G and B correspond to red, green, and blue, respectively). For example, four pixels of the R pixel, the G pixel, the B pixel, and a W (white) pixel may be included. Alternatively, a color element may be composed of two colors among R, G and B as in PenTile layout. The two colors may differ among color elements. Alternatively, one or more colors of yellow, cyan, magenta, and the like may be added to RGB. Furthermore, the size of a display region may be different depending on respective dots of the color components. Embodiments of the disclosed invention are not limited to a display device for color display; the disclosed invention can also be applied to a display device for monochrome display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0300" num="0299">A coloring layer (also referred to as a color filter) may be used in order to obtain a full-color display device in which white light (W) for a backlight (e.g., an organic EL element, an inorganic EL element, an LED, or a fluorescent lamp) is used. As the coloring layer, red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), or the like may be combined as appropriate, for example. With the use of the coloring layer, higher color reproducibility can be obtained than in the case without the coloring layer. In this case, by providing a region with the coloring layer and a region without the coloring layer, white light in the region without the coloring layer may be directly utilized for display. By partly providing the region without the coloring layer, a decrease in luminance due to the coloring layer can be suppressed, and 20% to 30% of power consumption can be reduced in some cases when an image is displayed brightly. Note that in the case where full-color display is performed using a self-luminous element such as an organic EL element or an inorganic EL element, elements may emit light of their respective colors R, G; B, Y, and W. By using a self-luminous element, power consumption can be further reduced as compared with the case of using the coloring layer in some cases.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0303">Any of the transistors described above can be used as the transistors <b>750</b> and <b>752</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0304">The transistors used in this embodiment each include an oxide semiconductor film which is highly purified and in which formation of oxygen vacancy is suppressed. In the transistor, the current in an off state (off-state current) can be made small. Accordingly, an electrical signal such as an image signal can be held for a longer period, and a writing interval can be set longer in an on state. Accordingly, frequency of refresh operation can be reduced, which leads to an effect of suppressing power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0306" num="0305">In addition, the transistor used in this embodiment can have relatively high field-effect mobility and thus is capable of high speed operation. For example, with such a transistor which can operate at high speed used for a liquid crystal display device, a switching transistor in a pixel portion and a driver transistor in a driver circuit portion can be formed over one substrate. That is, a semiconductor device formed using a silicon wafer or the like is not additionally needed as a driver circuit, whereby the number of components of the semiconductor device can be reduced. In addition, the transistor which can operate at high speed can be used also in the pixel portion, whereby a high-quality image can be provided.</div>

The oxide semiconductor film <b>767</b> can be formed using a material and a method similar to those of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> described in the above embodiment. The planarization insulating film <b>770</b> can be formed using a heat-resistant organic material, such as a polyimide resin, an acrylic resin, a polyimide amide resin, a benzocyclobutene resin, a polyamide resin, or an epoxy resin.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0028" num="0000">&lt;Structure Example of Display Device Using Liquid Crystal Element as Display Element&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0315" num="0314">The display device <b>700</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> includes a liquid crystal element <b>775</b>. The liquid crystal element <b>775</b> includes a conductive film <b>772</b>, a conductive film <b>774</b>, and a liquid crystal layer <b>776</b>. The conductive film <b>774</b> is provided on the second substrate <b>705</b> side and functions as a counter electrode. The display device <b>700</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is capable of displaying an image in such a manner that transmission or non-transmission is controlled by change in the alignment state of the liquid crystal layer <b>776</b> depending on a voltage applied to the conductive film <b>772</b> and the conductive film <b>774</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0316" num="0315">The conductive film <b>772</b> is connected to the conductive film functioning as a source and drain electrode included in the transistor <b>750</b>. The conductive film <b>772</b> is formed over the planarization insulating film <b>770</b> to function as a pixel electrode, that is, one electrode of the display element. The conductive film <b>772</b> functions as a reflective electrode. The display device <b>700</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is what is called a reflective color liquid crystal display device in which external light is reflected by the conductive film <b>772</b> to display an image through the coloring film <b>736</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0317" num="0316">A conductive film that transmits visible light or a conductive film that reflects visible light can be used as the conductive film <b>772</b>. For example, a material including one of indium (In), zinc (Zn), and tin (Sn) is preferably used for the conductive film that transmits visible light. For example, a material including aluminum or silver may be used for the conductive film that reflects visible light. In this embodiment, the conductive film that reflects visible light is used as the conductive film <b>772</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0318" num="0317">In the case where a conductive film which reflects visible light is used as the conductive film <b>772</b>, the conductive film may have a stacked-layer structure. For example, a 100-nm-thick aluminum film is formed as the bottom layer, and a 30-nm-thick silver alloy film (e.g., an alloy film including silver, palladium, and copper) is formed as the top layer. Such a structure makes it possible to obtain the following effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0318">(1) Adhesion between the base film and the conductive film <b>772</b> can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0319">(2) The aluminum film and the silver alloy film can be collectively etched depending on a chemical solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0321" num="0320">(3) The conductive film <b>772</b> can have a favorable cross-sectional shape (e.g., a tapered shape).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0322" num="0321">The reason for (3) is as follows: the etching rate of the aluminum film with the chemical solution is lower than that of the silver alloy film, or etching of the aluminum film that is the bottom layer is developed faster than that of the silver alloy film because, when the aluminum film that is the bottom layer is exposed after the etching of the silver alloy film that is the top layer, electrons are extracted from metal that is less noble than the silver alloy film, that is, aluminum that is metal having a high ionization tendency, and thus etching of the silver alloy film is suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0323" num="0322">Note that projections and depressions are provided in part of the planarization insulating film <b>770</b> of the pixel portion <b>702</b> in the display device <b>700</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The projections and depressions can be formed in such a manner that the planarization insulating film <b>770</b> is formed using an organic resin film or the like, and projections and depressions are formed on the surface of the organic resin film. The conductive film <b>772</b> functioning as a reflective electrode is formed along the projections and depressions. Therefore, when external light is incident on the conductive film <b>772</b>, the light is reflected diffusely at the surface of the conductive film <b>772</b>, whereby visibility can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0324" num="0323">Note that the display device <b>700</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a reflective color liquid crystal display device given as an example, but a display type is not limited thereto. For example, a transmissive color liquid crystal display device in which a conductive film that transmits visible light is used as the conductive film <b>772</b> may be used. In the case of a transmissive color liquid crystal display device, projections and depressions are not necessarily provided on the planarization insulating film <b>770</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0325" num="0324">Although not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an alignment film may be provided on a side of the conductive film <b>772</b> in contact with the liquid crystal layer <b>776</b> and on a side of the conductive film <b>774</b> in contact with the liquid crystal layer <b>776</b>. Although not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an optical member (an optical substrate) and the like such as a polarizing member, a retardation member, or an anti-reflection member may be provided as appropriate. For example, circular polarization may be employed by using a polarizing substrate and a retardation substrate. In addition, a backlight, a sidelight, or the like may be used as a light source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0326" num="0325">In the case where a liquid crystal element is used as the display element, a thermotropic liquid crystal, a low-molecular liquid crystal, a high-molecular liquid crystal, a polymer-dispersed liquid crystal, a ferroelectric liquid crystal, an anti-ferroelectric liquid crystal, or the like can be used. Such a liquid crystal material exhibits a cholesteric phase, a smectic phase, a cubic phase, a chiral nematic phase, an isotropic phase, or the like depending on conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0327" num="0326">Alternatively, in the case of employing a horizontal electric field mode, a liquid crystal exhibiting a blue phase for which an alignment film is unnecessary may be used. A blue phase is one of liquid crystal phases, which is generated just before a cholesteric phase changes into an isotropic phase while temperature of cholesteric liquid crystal is increased. Since the blue phase appears only in a narrow temperature range, a liquid crystal composition in which several weight percent or more of a chiral material is mixed is used for the liquid crystal layer in order to improve the temperature range. The liquid crystal composition which includes liquid crystal exhibiting a blue phase and a chiral material has a short response time and optical isotropy, which makes the alignment process unneeded. In addition, the liquid crystal composition which includes liquid crystal exhibiting a blue phase and a chiral material has a small viewing angle dependence. An alignment film does not need to be provided and rubbing treatment is thus not necessary; accordingly, electrostatic discharge damage caused by the rubbing treatment can be prevented and defects and damage of the liquid crystal display device in the manufacturing process can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0328" num="0327">In the case where a liquid crystal element is used as the display element, a twisted nematic (TN) mode, an in-plane-switching (IPS) mode, a fringe field switching (FFS) mode, an axially symmetric aligned micro-cell (ASM) mode, an optical compensated birefringence (OCB) mode, a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) mode, an antiferroelectric liquid crystal (AFLC) mode, or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0328">Furthermore, a normally black liquid crystal display device such as a transmissive liquid crystal display device utilizing a vertical alignment (VA) mode may also be used. There are some examples of a vertical alignment mode; for example, a multi-domain vertical alignment (MVA) mode, a patterned vertical alignment (PVA) mode, an ASV mode, or the like can be employed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0509" num="0508">Next, reliability tests were performed on the manufactured samples E1 and E2. As the reliability evaluation, GBT tests were used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0510" num="0509">The GBT tests in this example were performed under the conditions where the gate voltage (VG) was ±30 V; the drain voltage (VD) and the source voltage (VS) were 0 V (COMMON); the stress temperature was 60° C.; the time for stress application was 1 hour; and two kinds of measurement environments, a dark environment and a photo environment (irradiation with light having approximately 10000 lx with a white LED), were employed. In other words, the source electrode and the drain electrode of the transistor were set at the same potential, and a potential different from that of the source and drain electrodes was applied to the gate electrode for a certain time (one hour, here). A case where the potential applied to the gate electrode is higher than that of the source and drain electrodes is called positive stress, and a case where the potential applied to the gate electrode is lower than that of the source and drain electrodes is called negative stress. Thus, the reliability evaluation was performed under four conditions in total, i.e., positive GBT stress (Dark), negative GBT stress (Dark), positive GBT stress (Light irradiation), and negative GBT stress (Light irradiation). Note that positive GBT stress (Dark) can be referred to as PBTS (Positive Bias Temperature Stress), negative GBT stress (Dark) as NBTS (Negative Bias Temperature Stress), positive GBT stress (Light irradiation) as PBITS (Positive Bias Illuminations Temperature Stress), negative GBT stress (Light irradiation) as NBITS (Negative Bias Illuminations Temperature Stress).</div>

Each of the gate BT stress tests was performed at a stress temperature of 60° C. at a stress time of 3600 seconds.
