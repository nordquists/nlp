<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/469,135, filed Aug. 26, 2014, which is a continuation of U.S. patent Ser. No. 12/956,963, filed Nov. 30, 2010, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,825,428, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Continuous non-invasive blood pressure (CNIBP) monitoring systems allow a patient's blood pressure to be tracked continuously, unlike standard occlusion cuff techniques, and without the hazards of invasive arterial lines. In some embodiments, multiple pulse oximetry type sensors may be placed at multiple body sites on a patient to measure photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals. The resulting multiple PPG signals may be compared against each other to estimate the patient's blood pressure. When the locations of two sensors are at different distances from the heart or along different paths from the heart (e.g., at the finger and forehead), a differential pulse transit time (DPTT) may be determined. A DPTT may represent the difference in the arrival times of a portion of a cardiac wave between the two locations, and may be determined by comparing corresponding fiducial points in the two PPG signals (e.g., a maximum, minimum, or a notch). In some techniques, two DPTTs are determined in order to calculate multiple physiological parameters, such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These DPTTs may be determined during different phases of the PPG signal representing different physiological occurrences. For example, one DPTT may be determined when the cardiovascular system is in a systolic state and a second DPTT may be determined when the cardiovascular system is in a diastolic state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">During physiological monitoring of a patient with a patient monitoring system, recalibration of the patient monitoring system may be desired. For example, a CNIBP system may be periodically calibrated with a NIBP system. It may be desirous in some instances to reduce the number of calibrations that are performed. For example, an inflatable cuff type NIBP system may be used to calibrate a PPG-based CNIBP system, and a reduction in the number of cuff inflations may be desirous. In some circumstances, performing a calibration is likely to result in calibration parameters similar to those of a previous calibration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems and methods are provided herein for calibrating a patient monitoring system with stored calibration parameters. Calibration parameters may be stored in a suitable memory device, and recalled during suitable calibration conditions. Values of one or more metrics associated with one or more physiological signals (e.g., PPG signals) may be monitored by a patient monitoring system and compared with stored metric values. If it is determined by the patient monitoring system that the value of the monitored metric corresponds to a stored metric value, the patient monitoring system may recall calibration parameters associated with the stored value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, for example, metrics may be stored in any suitable database. Calibration parameters associated with the stored metrics may also be stored in any suitable database (e.g., the same database where the metrics are stored). Metrics may include signal morphology parameters such as, for example, pulse wave area, pulse wave skew, derivatives of a signal, heart rate, length of a pulse upstroke, any other suitable metric or any combination thereof. Metrics derived from a physiological signal may change due to, for example, effects of vasoactive drugs, patient movement, or other factors which may change arterial compliance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a patient monitoring system may monitor one or more metrics derived from a physiological signal. One or more metrics of the physiological signal may change over time due to any suitable cause or combination of causes. In some circumstances, following the temporal change in the one or more metrics, the values of the one or more metrics may return to or about their past values as computed prior to the change. The patient monitoring system may then recall stored calibration parameters associated with the past values rather than performing an actual recalibration. For example, a CNIBP device calibrated with initial calibration parameters may be used to monitor a physiological metric associated with a patient. At a particular time, a vasoactive drug may be administered, and the value of the metric may change. At a particular time after the drug was administered, the value of the metric may return to the metric's value prior to the drug administration. The patient monitoring system may, in response to the return of the metric's value, revert to the stored initial calibration parameters rather than initiating a new NIBP (e.g., cuff device) calibration to determine new calibration parameters.</div>

However, it will be understood that the disclosure is not limited to monitoring physiological signals and is usefully applied within a number of signal monitoring settings.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">An oximeter is a medical device that may determine the oxygen saturation of the blood. One common type of oximeter is a pulse oximeter, which may indirectly measure the oxygen saturation of a patient's blood (as opposed to measuring oxygen saturation directly by analyzing a blood sample taken from the patient). Pulse oximeters may be included in patient monitoring systems that measure and display various blood flow characteristics including, but not limited to, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood. Such patient monitoring systems may also measure and display additional physiological parameters, such as a patient's pulse rate and blood pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">An oximeter may include a light sensor that is placed at a site on a patient, typically a fingertip, toe, forehead or earlobe, or in the case of a neonate, across a foot. The oximeter may use a light source to pass light through blood perfused tissue and photoelectrically sense the absorption of the light in the tissue. In addition, locations which are not typically understood to be optimal for pulse oximetry serve as suitable sensor locations for the blood pressure monitoring processes described herein, including any location on the body that has a strong pulsatile arterial flow. For example, additional suitable sensor locations include, without limitation, the neck to monitor carotid artery pulsatile flow, the wrist to monitor radial artery pulsatile flow, the inside of a patient's thigh to monitor femoral artery pulsatile flow, the ankle to monitor tibial artery pulsatile flow, and around or in front of the ear. Suitable sensors for these locations may include sensors for sensing absorbed light based on detecting reflected light. In all suitable locations, for example, the oximeter may measure the intensity of light that is received at the light sensor as a function of time. The oximeter may also include sensors at multiple locations. A signal representing light intensity versus time or a mathematical manipulation of this signal (e.g., a scaled version thereof, a log taken thereof, a scaled version of a log taken thereof, etc.) may be referred to as the photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal. In addition, the term “PPG signal,” as used herein, may also refer to an absorption signal (i.e., representing the amount of light absorbed by the tissue) or any suitable mathematical manipulation thereof. The light intensity or the amount of light absorbed may then be used to calculate any of a number of physiological parameters, including an amount of a blood constituent (e.g., oxyhemoglobin) being measured as well as a pulse rate and when each individual pulse occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In some applications, the light passed through the tissue is selected to be of one or more wavelengths that are absorbed by the blood in an amount representative of the amount of the blood constituent present in the blood. The amount of light passed through the tissue varies in accordance with the changing amount of blood constituent in the tissue and the related light absorption. Red and infrared (IR) wavelengths may be used because it has been observed that highly oxygenated blood will absorb relatively less Red light and more IR light than blood with a lower oxygen saturation. By comparing the intensities of two wavelengths at different points in the pulse cycle, it is possible to estimate the blood oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">When the measured blood parameter is the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, a convenient starting point assumes a saturation calculation based at least in part on Lambert-Beer's law. The following notation will be used herein:
<br/>
<i>I</i>(λ,<i>t</i>)=<i>I</i> <sub>O</sub>(λ)exp(−(<i>sβ</i> <sub>O</sub>(λ)+(1−<i>s</i>)β<sub>r</sub>(λ))<i>l</i>(<i>t</i>))  (1)

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0053">It will be understood that, as used herein, the term “light” may refer to energy produced by radiation sources and may include one or more of ultrasound, radio, microwave, millimeter wave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, gamma ray or X-ray electromagnetic radiation. As used herein, light may also include electromagnetic radiation having any wavelength within the radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, or X-ray spectra, and that any suitable wavelength of electromagnetic radiation may be appropriate for use with the present techniques. Detector <b>18</b> may be chosen to be specifically sensitive to the chosen targeted energy spectrum of the emitter <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0054">In an embodiment, detector <b>18</b> may be configured to detect the intensity of light at the Red and IR wavelengths. Alternatively, each sensor in the array may be configured to detect an intensity of a single wavelength. In operation, light may enter detector <b>18</b> after passing through the patient's tissue <b>40</b>. Detector <b>18</b> may convert the intensity of the received light into an electrical signal. The light intensity is directly related to the absorbance and/or reflectance of light in the tissue <b>40</b>. That is, when more light at a certain wavelength is absorbed or reflected, less light of that wavelength is received from the tissue by the detector <b>18</b>. After converting the received light to an electrical signal, detector <b>18</b> may send the signal to monitor <b>14</b>, where physiological parameters may be calculated based on the absorption of the Red and IR wavelengths in the patient's tissue <b>40</b>.</div>

This information may be used by monitor <b>14</b> to select appropriate algorithms, lookup tables and/or calibration coefficients stored in monitor <b>14</b> for calculating the patient's physiological parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0056">Encoder <b>42</b> may contain information specific to patient <b>40</b>, such as, for example, the patient's age, weight, and diagnosis. This information about a patient's characteristics may allow monitor <b>14</b> to determine, for example, patient-specific threshold ranges in which the patient's physiological parameter measurements should fall and to enable or disable additional physiological parameter algorithms. This information may also be used to select and provide coefficients for equations from which, for example, blood pressure and other measurements may be determined based at least in part on the signal or signals received at sensor unit <b>12</b>. For example, some pulse oximetry sensors rely on equations to relate an area under a portion of a photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal corresponding to a physiological pulse to determine blood pressure. These equations may contain coefficients that depend upon a patient's physiological characteristics as stored in encoder <b>42</b>. Encoder <b>42</b> may, for instance, be a coded resistor which stores values corresponding to the type of sensor unit <b>12</b> or the type of each sensor in the sensor array, the wavelengths of light emitted by emitter <b>16</b> on each sensor of the sensor array, and/or the patient's characteristics.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0063">The optical signal through the tissue can be degraded by noise, among other sources. One source of noise is ambient light that reaches the light detector. Another source of noise is electromagnetic coupling from other electronic instruments. Movement of the patient also introduces noise and affects the signal. For example, the contact between the detector and the skin, or the emitter and the skin, can be temporarily disrupted when movement causes either to move away from the skin. In addition, because blood is a fluid, it responds differently than the surrounding tissue to inertial effects, thus resulting in momentary changes in volume at the point to which the oximeter probe is attached.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0064">Noise (e.g., from patient movement) can degrade a sensor signal relied upon by a care provider, without the care provider's awareness. This is especially true if the monitoring of the patient is remote, the motion is too small to be observed, or the care provider is watching the instrument or other parts of the patient, and not the sensor site. Processing sensor signals (e.g., PPG signals) may involve operations that reduce the amount of noise present in the signals or otherwise identify noise components in order to prevent them from affecting measurements of physiological parameters derived from the sensor signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0065">Pulse oximeters, in addition to providing other information, can be utilized for continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring.

For example, processor <b>312</b> may pair points <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> to identify one segment, points <b>412</b> and <b>420</b> to identify a second segment, points <b>420</b> and <b>422</b> to identify a third segment and points <b>422</b> and <b>430</b> to identify a fourth segment. The slope of each segment may be measured to determine whether the segment corresponds to an upstroke portion of the pulse (e.g., a positive slope) or a downstroke portion of the pulse (e.g., a negative slope) portion of the pulse. A pulse may be defined as a combination of at least one upstroke and one downstroke. For example, the segment identified by points <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> and the segment identified by points <b>412</b> and <b>430</b> may define a pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0086">According to an embodiment, PPG signal <b>400</b> may include a dichrotic notch <b>450</b> or other notches (not shown) in different sections of the pulse (e.g., at the beginning (referred to as an ankle notch), in the middle (referred to as a dichrotic notch), or near the top (referred to as a shoulder notch)). Notches (e.g., dichrotic notches) may refer to secondary turning points of pulse waves as well as inflection points of pulse waves. Processor <b>312</b> may identify notches and either utilize or ignore them when detecting the pulse locations. In some embodiments, processor <b>312</b> may compute the second derivative of the PPG signal to find the local minima and maxima points and may use this information to determine a location of, for example, a dichrotic notch. Additionally, processor <b>312</b> may interpolate between points in signal <b>316</b> or between points in a processed signal using any interpolation technique (e.g., zero-order hold, linear interpolation, and/or higher-order interpolation techniques). Some pulse detection techniques that may be performed by processor <b>312</b> are described in more detail in co-pending, commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/242,908, filed Sep. 30, 2008 and entitled “SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETECTING PULSES IN A PPG SIGNAL,” which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0087">Metrics may be used to characterize or otherwise describe a physiological signal. Metrics may include suitable signal values, signal morphologies, output values from suitable operations performed on a signal or other metric, any other suitable mathematical characterizations, or any suitable combinations thereof. For example, metrics may include pulse wave area (PWA), rate of change computed at one or more points of a time series (e.g., derivative of any suitable order of a signal), statistics of a signal (e.g., mean, moment of any suitable order, regression parameters), offset of a signal from a baseline, interval of portion of a signal (e.g., length of upstroke), relative position of a fiducial point of a signal (e.g., dichrotic notch position), any other suitable metric or change thereof, or any suitable combinations thereof. For example, in some embodiments, the skewness (e.g., the standardized third central moment) of a pulse wave may be monitored.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0088">Metrics may include mathematical manipulations of other metrics such as, for example, the value of an integral of a portion of a blood pressure measurement time series, the skewness of a derivative of a PPG signal, or any other suitable mathematical manipulations. In some embodiments, metrics may be computed from averaged, filtered, scaled, or otherwise processed physiological signals. For example, a derivative may be computed from a suitable ensemble average of pulse waves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0089">The term “pulse wave” as used herein refers to a portion of a PPG signal corresponding to a physiological pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0090">A patient monitoring system may determine that values of one or more metrics associated with a physiological signal correspond to stored values. The determination may be based at least in part on a comparison of metric values to stored values by, for example, computing a difference. For example, a patient monitoring system may compute a current PWA of a current PPG signal by integrating a suitable portion of the PPG signal. The patient monitoring system may search among stored values of PWA associated with previous PPG signals. The patient monitoring system may compute a difference between the current PWA value and at least one of the stored PWA values. If the patient monitoring system determines that the difference in the current and stored PWA values is below a threshold, then the patient monitoring system may determine that the PWAs correspond to each other. Thresholds may be predetermined, dynamic, constant, or any other suitable type of value, or any suitable combination thereof. For example, in some embodiments, a threshold may be ten percent of a metric value such that if the difference between a value of a monitored metric and a stored value is less than ten percent of the monitored metric, the values are determined to correspond. The selection of this threshold may be determined through consideration of previously acquired empirical data and the required accuracy. In some embodiments, the required accuracy may change with currently reported blood pressure. For example, if a current blood pressure measurement is outside normal physiological ranges, the required accuracy may be tighter and the threshold may be set to encourage a cuff inflation, or true recalibration, rather than rely on an estimate calculated using historical data. In some embodiments, a threshold may be set with respect to a historical variation of the monitored metric, for example, at a fraction (e.g., 0.5) of one standard deviation of the historic values of the monitored metric over a period of time. Any suitable threshold may be used to aid in determining whether values correspond to each other. In some embodiments, the patient monitoring system may determine whether a value of a monitored metric and a stored value to not correspond to one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0091">In some embodiments, a difference vector including differences between values of monitored metrics and stored values may be computed by the patient monitoring system. The Euclidean norm, or “norm”, of such a vector may provide an indication of how closely the collective values of monitored metrics correspond to stored values. For example, a patient monitoring system may compute differences between monitored values and a set of stored values of PWA, pulse wave skew, and length of pulse wave upstroke, and arrange the difference in each metric value in a difference vector. The patient monitoring system may compute the norm of the difference vector. If the norm is below a threshold value, the patient monitoring system may determine that the current metrics correspond to the stored metrics. Any suitable combination of differences or other comparisons (e.g., norms, conditional probabilities) may be used by a patient monitoring system to determine whether values correspond.</div>

For example, a patient monitoring system may have particular calibration parameters at a time corresponding to point <b>512</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(<i>a</i>)</figref>. Changes in arterial compliance, for example, may cause a change in blood pressure represented by the transition from point <b>512</b> to point <b>514</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(<i>a</i>)</figref>. The transition from point <b>514</b> to point <b>516</b> may, in some embodiments, represent a return by the patient to a similar physiological state as that of point <b>512</b>, indicated by the similar blood pressure values displayed at points <b>512</b> and <b>516</b>.</div>

For example, the patient monitoring system may compare the difference between the blood pressure values of points <b>512</b> and <b>516</b> to a threshold. If the difference is less than the threshold, the patient monitoring system may determine that the values correspond. The patient monitoring system may determine that the physiological states correspond based at least in part on the determination that the values correspond.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0098">In some embodiments, metrics associated with the blood pressure pattern from point <b>512</b> to point <b>514</b> to point <b>516</b> may be stored for later reference. For example, administration of a particular drug to a patient may cause the blood pressure change from point <b>512</b> to point <b>514</b>, and then to point <b>516</b>. Metrics associated with this blood pressure change such as, for example, the time interval between points <b>512</b> and <b>516</b>, peak to peak difference, slope of the time series <b>500</b> computed at suitable points, any other suitable metrics, or any suitable combinations thereof, may be stored for future reference. For example, if the same drug is administered at a new time, a new calibration may not be required because stored calibration parameters corresponding to a previous calibration, performed during a previous drug administration, may be recalled. Because the previous calibration may have been performed during a similar physiological state (e.g., for a similar drug administration), the physiological signals may exhibit similar values of suitable metrics. In some embodiments, storing metrics associated with a physiological signal may reduce the desired number of calibrations of the patient monitoring system.</div>

In some embodiments, the stored value may be recalled from any suitable database(s) stored in suitable memory device(s), as shown illustratively by step <b>850</b>. Step <b>850</b> may include parsing data, interpolating data, requesting values, searching data structures, traversing data structures (e.g., arrays, trees, multimaps), any other suitable technique for accessing a stored value, or any suitable combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0115">In some embodiments, any suitable pattern matching technique, pattern recognition technique, or other classification technique, or combination of techniques, may be used to compare metricsat step <b>806</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. For example, templates, classifications (e.g., k-nearest neighbor algorithms, decision trees), regressions (e.g., neural networks), any other pattern recognition techniques, or any suitable combination thereof may be used to compare or match the value of a monitored metric to a stored value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0116">If the patient monitoring system does not locate a suitable stored value, step <b>860</b> may be performed (see step <b>1060</b> of flow diagram <b>1000</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Step <b>860</b> may include determining a morphology change, performing a calibration, storing values in memory, any other suitable actions, or any combination thereof. For example, if the patient monitoring system cannot locate a suitable stored value for comparison, the patient monitoring system may store one or more current metric values so that stored metric values may be available in the future.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0117">Determination step <b>808</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may include, for example, determining whether a monitored metric value corresponds to a stored metric value. In some embodiments, a comparison of the monitored metric value and the stored value may be used at determination step <b>808</b>. For example, in some embodiments, a monitored metric value may be determined to correspond to a stored value if a computed difference between the two values is less than a particular threshold value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0118">It may be determined, for example, at determination step <b>808</b> that a monitored metric does not correspond to a stored value. In response to such a determination, the patient monitoring system may, in some embodiments, initiate step <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, or <b>806</b>. In some embodiments, the monitored metric value may be compared to further stored values at step <b>808</b>. In some embodiments, the patient monitoring system may compute a new value for the monitored metric and compare the new value to a stored value at determination step <b>808</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0119">In some embodiments, the patient monitoring system may determine that a monitored metric does not correspond to a stored value. In response to such a determination, the patient monitoring system may, in some embodiments, perform step <b>860</b> (see step <b>1060</b> of flow diagram <b>1000</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). For example, the patient monitoring system may determine that the monitored metric does not correspond to a stored value, and that a calibration is desired. One or more metric values corresponding to the calibration may be stored for future reference as stored values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0120">If the value of a monitored metric is determined to correspond to a stored value, calibration parameters may be updated in accordance with step <b>810</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Step <b>810</b> may include, for example, recalling calibration parameters (e.g., a, b and/or c<sub>i </sub>of Eqs. 14-18) from a memory device, replacing calibration parameters with stored calibration parameters, determining a blood pressure measurement based on stored calibration parameters, any other suitable process, or any suitable combination thereof. In some embodiments, calibration parameters associated with the stored value may be recalled and used in the current calibration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0121">In an illustrative example, two PPG signals may be received by a patient monitoring system (e.g., patient monitoring system <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at step <b>802</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. A metric such as, for example, the DPTT derived from the received signals may be computed as a time series by the patient monitoring system at step <b>804</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The patient monitoring system may compare one or more DPTT values to a suitable stored DPTT value in a suitable memory device (e.g., ROM <b>52</b>, remote memory <b>90</b>, or both, of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The stored DPTT value may be recalled by the patient monitoring system by suitable searching of a catalogue of stored metric values stored in a suitable database. If the patient monitoring system determines that the monitored DPTT value corresponds substantially to a stored DPTT value, the patient monitoring system may recall calibration parameters associated with the stored DPTT value. The patient monitoring system may update the current blood pressure calibration values (e.g., a, b and/or c<sub>i </sub>of Eqs. 14-18) with the blood pressure calibration values associated with the stored DPTT value. Although the previous example discloses monitoring a DPTT value and updating blood pressure calibration parameters, the value of any suitable metric may be monitored, and any suitable calibration parameters may be updated.</div>
