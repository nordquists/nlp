<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/188,320, filed Jul. 21, 2011, which claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/366,322, filed on Jul. 21, 2010, and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/391,229, filed on Oct. 8, 2010, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Driver bias may cause significant variations in the fuel economy of a vehicle. For example, studies conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have shown that, even when holding the vehicle and the route constant, driver behavior may account for up to 35% variation in fuel economy (FE).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Driver assistance systems for optimizing fuel economy may be categorized into two general groups based on their mechanisms of influence. Passive assistance systems include those where only advisory feedback is provided to the driver. In active assistance systems, system automation takes over some portion of vehicle control. Some active automation technologies work relatively independent of the driver, such as adaptive cruise control, and some work in conjunction with the driver, such as an automated/automatic transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Passive driver assistance schemes for fuel economy have been around for some time. Many of the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) offer some type of driver interface for fuel economy in at least some of their vehicle models. The commercial vehicle market, on the other hand, is typically dominated by aftermarket devices, which are often coupled with telematic solutions. In recent years, nomadic devices have also emerged, boosted by smart phone technology, but their effectiveness may be hindered due to limited access to the vehicle's data bus and limited capability as a driver interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Existing fuel-economy interface devices may provide visual feedback of instantaneous or average fuel economy. Some may also provide a fuel efficiency “score” to the driver. The existing interface devices, however, are not noted for providing actionable information to the driver in terms of which behavior is related to poor fuel economy or how to operate the vehicle in a more fuel-efficient manner. In addition, existing fuel economy driver feedback schemes are typically based on vehicle operations rather than the driver's interaction with the vehicle operating environment. For example, an aggressive driver braking hard while tailgating may be rated the same as a conservative driver being forced to brake hard because another vehicle suddenly cut in front of him, as both will lead to the same hard braking event and the same fuel economy assessment. As a result, the fuel economy score or rating given to the driver is often confusing and misleading, which makes it difficult for both the driver to make use of the data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently there is a general lack of actionable information and a poor differentiation between driver-caused and environment-caused fuel economy inefficiency. Both of these factors limit the effectiveness of existing fuel-economy driver interface technologies. In addition, since the driver's response to any passive feedback is typically going to be slow and coarse by nature, passive feedback may become distracting and ineffective in situations that require fast, frequent, or high-accuracy response from the driver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">As for active feedback technologies, examples include synthetic brake pulse or acceleration resistance, road speed governor, automated/automatic transmission, and standard or adaptive cruise control, to name a few. Some of these technologies were not intentionally introduced for the purpose of improving fuel efficiency, but have advanced in recent years to assist fuel economy determinations. For instance, current automated/automatic transmissions may have the capability of estimating road grade and load and adjusting gearshift schedule for better fuel economy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Existing active feedback devices, however, have limitations similar to passive devices. Many existing active feedback solutions do not have the intelligence to differentiate between driver-caused and environment-caused fuel economy inefficiency. In addition, many of the control strategies employed in active assistance solutions are based only on instantaneous information, such as the load-based gearshift scheduling of many newer automated/automatic transmissions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Achieving optimum driver behavior and powertrain operation to maximize fuel efficiency depends on the ability to estimate future conditions of the driver, vehicle and environment. Lack of knowledge of or inappropriate response to such future conditions may limit the effectiveness of vehicle automation systems. In recent years, progress in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has increased availability of road and traffic information at both vehicle level and fleet level. Since fuel consumption is a cumulative measure over time, the optimality of instantaneous driver behavior is significantly dependent on future conditions. The availability of predictive road and traffic information from modern ITS technologies, such as global positioning systems (GPS), digital maps and radars, make it feasible and affordable to reduce driver bias through enhanced driver feedback and/or powertrain automation. Most of the early solutions have been focused on utilizing predictive topographical information to reduce fuel consumption in a cruise control context, where the vehicle is switching between full autonomy and full driver control per driver's choice. Since the fuel-efficient control strategy will only be active in the full autonomy mode, accurate, predictive sensor information is generally required to enable the system to make appropriate decisions consistently to avoid frequent driver intervention. With the help of technologies such as GPS and digital maps, reasonably accuracy information is readily available for simple and largely static environments, such as long distance travel on an open freeway. For the more complex urban environment, where future traffic conditions may be fluid and unpredictable, sensor and decision errors are inevitable and the driver is more likely to simply take over control of the vehicle, which makes cruise-control based solutions less effective.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to the discussion that follows and the drawings, illustrative approaches to the disclosed systems and methods are described in detail. Although the drawings represent some possible approaches, the drawings are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be exaggerated, removed, or partially sectioned to better illustrate and explain the present disclosure. Further, the descriptions set forth herein are not intended to be exhaustive, otherwise limit, or restrict the claims to the precise forms and configurations shown in the drawings and disclosed in the following detailed description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a motor vehicle <b>20</b> employing an exemplary active driver assistance system (ADAS) <b>22</b> for optimizing vehicle fuel economy. For purposes of discussion, the features and operation of ADAS <b>22</b> are described primarily in connection with a goal of maximizing fuel economy, but it shall be appreciated that the features of ADAS <b>22</b> may also be utilized to improve other performance characteristics in addition to fuel economy, for example, minimizing vehicle wear and tear and travel time. An exemplary arrangement of ADAS <b>22</b> is illustrated in more detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. More specifically, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates the exemplary arrangement of the various elements of ADAS <b>22</b>. As noted above, the disclosed arrangement is merely to facilitate discussion and the arrangement is not limiting. Moreover, certain elements may be added or removed without compromising the relevant operation of ADAS <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">ADAS <b>22</b> may be configured to interact with a vehicle driver and utilize driver input when formulating a strategy for maximizing fuel economy. ADAS <b>22</b> generally operates in the background to continuously formulate and update vehicle operating strategies to maximize fuel economy and evaluate whether and how to communicate with or influence the driver's operation of the vehicle, through either active transmission/engine control and/or advisory driver feedback. ADAS <b>22</b> will not, however, request more power from the vehicle engine than requested by the driver. ADAS <b>22</b> may utilize historical and predictive information of both the vehicle operating environment (i.e., route and traffic information), as well as how the vehicle is being operated by the driver. The information may be obtained from on-board vehicle sensors, digital maps, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication systems, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The environment factors effecting fuel economy may be separated from driver behaviors factors, with the environment factors being categorized into individual driving scenarios. Driver assistance decisions may be based on real-time scenario recognition and scenario-specific strategies that target non-safety related driving behavior and which may significantly effect fuel economy. Although ADAS <b>22</b>, as described herein in an exemplary manner, is particularly applicable to commercial vehicles having an automated/automatic transmission, it may also be employed with other vehicle configurations as well, including semi-automatic and manual shift transmissions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Continuing to refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, vehicle <b>20</b> may include four rear drive wheels <b>24</b> and two front non-drive wheels <b>26</b>. In other illustrative configurations, all wheels may be drive wheels. Moreover, there may be more or fewer wheels for vehicle <b>20</b>. Operably associated with each of the wheels <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> may be a conventional type of wheel brake <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Vehicle <b>20</b> includes a vehicle drive system, generally designated <b>30</b>. Vehicle drive system <b>30</b> includes a vehicle engine <b>32</b> and a transmission <b>34</b>. Transmission <b>34</b> operatively connects to engine <b>32</b> and transmits drive torque generated by engine <b>32</b> to rear drive wheels <b>24</b>. Extending rearward from the transmission <b>34</b>, and also forming a portion of vehicle drive system <b>30</b>, is a drive-line, generally designated <b>36</b>. A drive shaft <b>38</b> interconnects transmission <b>34</b> to an inter-wheel differential <b>40</b> for transferring drive torque to a left rear axle shaft <b>42</b> and right rear axle shaft <b>44</b>. Drive-line <b>36</b> is illustrated and described as including shafts <b>38</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> primarily to facilitate understanding of the overall vehicle drive system <b>30</b>, and not by way of limitation. For example, in the illustrated vehicle <b>20</b>, and by way of example only, drive shaft <b>38</b> is illustrated as including a single shaft, but in practice may be configured to include additional shafts connected by way of universal joints or other suitable coupling mechanisms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Vehicle <b>20</b> may include a transmission/engine control unit (TECU) <b>46</b> for controlling operation of engine <b>32</b> and transmission <b>34</b>. TECU <b>46</b> may receive signals generated by various engine, transmission and vehicle sensors, and process the signals to control operation of engine <b>32</b> and transmission <b>34</b>. Although illustrated as a separate component from transmission <b>34</b>, TECU <b>46</b> may also be integrated with transmission <b>34</b>. Moreover, TECU <b>46</b> may be a single computing module or a plurality of computing modules at different locations within vehicle <b>20</b> and communicatively connected as discussed in more detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, ADAS <b>22</b> may include an on-board look-ahead powertrain management module (LPM) <b>48</b> that may provide primary control of the ADAS system. LPM <b>48</b> may form a portion of the more general system based TECU <b>46</b>, or may be in operational communication with TECU <b>46</b>. LPM <b>48</b> may include, for example, a microprocessor, a central processing unit (CPU), and a digital controller, among others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">LPM <b>48</b> may employ a mix of passive and active driver assistance system architecture aimed at improving vehicle fuel economy by assisting the driver to optimize a vehicle drive-cycle with respect to fuel economy without compromising safety, operating comfortableness, or the productivity of the vehicle operator. Fuel economy optimization may be achieved through a combination of engine and transmission shift and drive torque controls and actionable driver feedback. When employed with commercial vehicle fleets, LPM <b>48</b> may also provide commercial fleet managers with actionable driver fuel economy performance information. Depending on the requirements of a particular application, LPM <b>48</b> may be fully integrated with TECU <b>46</b>, or configured as a slave module of TECU <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, LPM <b>48</b> may be configured to communicate with an externally located back-office route/driver database (BORD) <b>50</b> for storing various information used in connection with ADAS <b>22</b>. BORD <b>50</b> may include a route database <b>52</b> configured to store data on a particular route that vehicle <b>20</b> operates, as well as a compilation of historical real-time traffic information occurring over the route. BORD <b>50</b> may also be configured store three-dimensional coordinates of a road network that vehicle <b>20</b> will be operating on, and the corresponding traffic constraints, such as speed limits, traffic lights, stop signs, and real-time traffic information. The real-time traffic information may be provided by a third-party service. The information stored on BORD <b>50</b> may include high-fidelity, third-party digital maps, or may be derived from aggregated route data received from LPM <b>48</b> over time. In the case of the latter, BORD <b>50</b> may also include a route learning module that compiles a knowledge base of the road network over time by combining route information learned from vehicle <b>20</b> and other vehicles through their daily operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">BORD <b>50</b> may also maintain an operator driving behavior database <b>54</b> for each driver of vehicle <b>20</b>, which may be updated over time using data received from LPM <b>48</b>. Driving performance data with respect to individual operating scenarios may be downloaded and stored on BORD <b>50</b>. BORD <b>50</b> may also include a driver fuel economy performance evaluation module <b>58</b> configured to evaluate each driver's fuel economy under various operating scenarios.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Although illustrated as a component separate from vehicle <b>20</b>, BORD <b>50</b> may be configured as a simplified on-board sub-module of LPM <b>48</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">A data-link interface unit <b>58</b> selectively establishes a wired <b>60</b> and/or wireless <b>62</b> communication link between LPM <b>48</b> and BORD <b>50</b>. For purposes of discussion, wireless communication links are indicated throughout the drawing figures by a dashed line, and wired communication links are indicated by a solid line. However, in practice, it may be possible for wired and wireless communication links to be used interchangeably depending on the requirements of a particular application. Data-link interface unit <b>58</b> may be used to upload pre-acquired (or learned-on-the-fly) route information and driver operating behavior data information to an on-broad route/driver behavior database <b>64</b> located on vehicle <b>20</b>. Data-link unit <b>58</b> may also be used to download new route and driver operating behavior data compiled by ADAS <b>22</b> from recent trips to BORD <b>50</b>. The route and driver operating behavior database <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> stored on BORD <b>50</b> may include a comprehensive digital map of an entire geographic region within which a business operates, and driving behavior information on multiple drivers. To minimized the size and cost of on-broad route/driver behavior database <b>64</b>, the on-board database may be configured to only store route and driver operating information specific to a particular route vehicle <b>20</b> will be traveling. The upload and download process may occur at a vehicle distribution terminal before and after a trip, or may take place in real-time through wireless communication between BORD <b>50</b> and ADAS <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Information/data used by LPM <b>48</b> to formulate a vehicle operating strategy for maximizing fuel economy may be obtained from a variety of sensors and information systems, which may include conventional on-board sensors, such as radar, vision, and a vehicle databus, and information technology services (ITS), such as a global positioning system (GPS), three-dimensional digital maps, and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication devices. For example, ADAS <b>22</b> may include various on-board sensors <b>66</b> configured to provide information regarding the operating environment immediately surrounding vehicle <b>20</b>. Sensors <b>66</b> collect information concerning potential obstacles, such as other vehicles, present within the immediate vicinity of vehicle <b>20</b>. Data collected by sensors <b>66</b> may be used by ADAS <b>22</b> to estimate, for example, a distance between vehicle <b>20</b> and the adjacent vehicles, as well as a speed and trajectory of the adjacent vehicles. Sensors <b>66</b> may include radar <b>68</b> and vision sensors. ADAS <b>22</b> may further include one or more data receivers <b>70</b> for receiving data transmitted over various wireless communication systems. Such systems may include dedicated short range communication systems (DSRC) <b>72</b>, which may include for example, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication devices. ADAS <b>22</b> may also receive data transmitted over dedicated government frequencies from a data transmitter <b>73</b>, for example, a global positioning system (GPS) <b>74</b> that may be used to generate three-dimensional digital maps <b>77</b>, and a traffic message channel (TMC) <b>76</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Information and data received from sensors <b>66</b>, data receiver <b>70</b>, and various other vehicle sensors, may be communicated to LPM <b>48</b> across a vehicle Controller Area Network (CAN) <b>78</b>. A known communications standard defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) is SAE J1939 for CAN-based communications. SAE J1587 is another possible communications standard that may also be used. Moreover, other communications standards, such as ISO9141 K, or other known standards, may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">ADAS <b>22</b> may also include a driver interface <b>79</b> that operably communicates with LPM <b>48</b>. Driver interface <b>79</b> provides the driver of vehicle <b>20</b> with information concerning fuel economy and feedback for modifying driving behavior to help maximize fuel economy. Driver interface <b>79</b> may included various visual displays, audio sources, such as speakers, and haptic devices. Haptic technology is a tactile feedback technology that takes advantage of a user's sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, and/or motions to the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, LPM <b>48</b> may be configured to generate one or more output signals. For example, a first output signal <b>92</b> may be transmitted to TECU <b>46</b> for use in connection with controlling engine <b>32</b> and transmission <b>34</b>. A second output signal <b>94</b> may be transmitted to driver interface <b>79</b>. The output signals from LPM <b>48</b> may be used to provide engine drive torque/speed control, transmission shift control and advisory driver information (i.e., through driver interface <b>79</b>). Although exemplarily configured LPM <b>48</b> is not described as employing brake control as a means for providing active assistance, the illustrated system architecture may nevertheless be adapted to include active safety features, such as brake control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Continuing to refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, LPM <b>48</b> may include five primary modules: a vehicle condition module <b>82</b>; an environment awareness module <b>84</b>; a driver intent recognition module <b>86</b>; a FE-optimal behavior estimation module <b>88</b>; and an arbitration module <b>90</b>. Although identified as individual modules for purposes of discussion, in practice, the individual modules may be combined into one or more integrated modules. The modules may be implemented as a combination of hardware and software, and may include one or more software applications or processes for causing one or more computer processors to perform the operations of LPM <b>48</b>. The preceding discussion is equally applicable to TECU <b>46</b>, which as noted, above may incorporate LPM <b>48</b> in one exemplary approach. The operation of each module is described in more below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0005" num="0000">Vehicle Condition Module (<b>82</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Vehicle condition module <b>82</b> operates to estimate vehicle load. This may be accomplished, for example, by using an extended Kalman filter (KF) based method employing data provided by GPS <b>74</b>, digital maps <b>77</b>, and vehicle CAN <b>78</b>. Vehicle load estimates may also be obtained through other means, such as private and governmental operated weigh stations. Vehicle condition module <b>82</b> may also determine engine and transmission configurations based on data received, for example, from vehicle CAN <b>78</b>, or through offline calibration procedures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0006" num="0000">Environment Awareness Module (<b>84</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Environment awareness module (<b>84</b>) may include a sensor fusion module <b>96</b> and a scenario recognition module <b>98</b>. The two modules are identified separately for purposes of discussion, but in practice, sensor fusion module <b>96</b> and scenario recognition module <b>98</b> may be integrated into fewer or more modules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring also to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, sensor fusion module <b>96</b> may employ an algorithm that utilizes the available sensor information from sensors <b>66</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and data receiver <b>70</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to predict future speed constraints that a driver may be facing within a look-ahead window <b>100</b>. Sensor fusion module <b>96</b> receives information/data from on-board vehicle sensors <b>66</b> concerning the operating environment within an immediate vicinity of vehicle <b>20</b>, and integrates that information/data with environment information/data received by data receiver <b>70</b> from various external data systems, such as GPS <b>74</b>, traffic message channel (TMC) <b>76</b>, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Sensor fusion module <b>96</b> may use the available sensor information/data to formulate a digital model <b>101</b> of the current vehicle operating environment occurring within an operating window <b>103</b>. Operating window <b>103</b> includes look-ahead window <b>100</b>, which extends a selected distance <b>102</b> in front of vehicle <b>20</b> along the vehicle's path of travel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, operating window <b>103</b> is divided into three segments: a first segment <b>104</b>; a second <b>106</b>; and a third segment <b>108</b>. In practice, however, operating window <b>103</b> may also be divided into fewer or more segments. Further, the number of segments need not remain constant, and may be varied based on various factors, including the operating environment in which vehicle <b>20</b> is operating. The operating environment may include, for example, road conditions (i.e., number of lanes, curvature of the road, whether the road or snow covered, etc.), traffic density and the proximity of other vehicles to vehicle <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Each segment <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, may be defined by a starting node and an ending node. For example, a first node <b>110</b> corresponds to the starting node of segment <b>104</b>, and a second node <b>112</b> correspond to its ending node. The ending node of a segment corresponds to the starting node of the next subsequent segment. For example, second node <b>112</b>, which corresponds to the ending node of segment <b>106</b>, also corresponds to the starting node of second segment <b>106</b>. Similarly, a third node <b>114</b> correspond to the ending node of second segment <b>106</b>, and the starting node of third segment <b>108</b>. A fourth node <b>116</b> corresponds to an ending node of third segment <b>108</b>. First node <b>110</b> also coincides with a beginning of operating window <b>103</b>, and fourth node <b>116</b> coincides with an end of operating window <b>103</b>. Operating window <b>103</b> may be continuously updated in order that vehicle <b>20</b> is never located outside the beginning and ending boundaries of operating window <b>103</b>, as defined by first node <b>110</b> and fourth node <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Sensor fusion module <b>96</b> may generate a road condition database <b>118</b> that may include information on road conditions occurring within first segment <b>104</b>, such as, for example, a length of the segment, the node type, posted speed limits, road class, number of lanes, and grade and curvature profiles. Exemplary node types may include a point at which a speed change occurs, an intersection, traffic light, stop sign and other points of the road where either road topology or a road speed limit change occurs. Similar road condition databases <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> may be compiled for second and third segments <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0077">Operating in parallel with environment awareness module <b>84</b> and FE-optimal behavior estimation module <b>88</b>, driver intent recognition module <b>86</b> accumulates historical driving data under various environment conditions. The compiled data may be used to formulate a statistical model for estimating a vehicle driver's current and future intent regarding the operation of vehicle <b>20</b>, and estimate if the driver's actions are being executed, for example, in connection passing, merging, and performing a lane change, to name a few. Driver intent recognition module <b>86</b> provides information/data that may be used by arbitration module <b>90</b> when assessing whether to actively intervene in the operation of vehicle <b>20</b> and/or prompt the driver to modify their driving behavior.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">Arbitration Module (<b>90</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0078">A schematic illustration of an exemplarily configured arbitration module <b>90</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Arbitration module <b>90</b> determines an arbitrated drive torque for propelling vehicle <b>20</b>. The arbitrated drive torque may fall within a range bounded by and including the optimized torque determined by FE-optimal behavior estimation module <b>88</b> and a drive torque requested by the vehicle driver. The arbitrated drive torque may be used by various vehicle controls, such as TECU <b>46</b>, to control operation of engine <b>32</b>, for example, through manipulation of an engine throttle position, and transmission <b>34</b>, for example, through initiation of a gear range shift. The arbitrated torque may also be used to formulate a strategy for passively prompting the driver of the vehicle to adjust their driving behavior, for example, by manually manipulating a vehicle accelerator pedal to adjust an engine throttle position, or manually initiating a transmission gear shift.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0079">Arbitration module <b>90</b> may utilize the information/data compiled and/or determined by vehicle condition module <b>82</b>, environment awareness module <b>84</b>, driver intent recognition module <b>86</b>, and FE-optimal behavior estimation module <b>88</b>, when determining the arbitrated torque. Factors that may be considered include a difference between the driver demand/intent, as determined by driver intent recognition module <b>86</b>, and the fuel economy optimal behavior profile, as determined by FE-optimal behavior estimation module <b>88</b>. Another factor is the nature of the perceived driver intent, for example, whether the driver's actions are safety and/or performance related. In instances where environment awareness module <b>84</b> determines that driver assistance may benefit fuel economy (i.e., there is a potential for intervention, as indicated, for example, in Table 1), arbitration module <b>90</b> determines whether to provide advisory feedback to the driver or actively assist the driver through powertrain automation, for example, performing gearshifts and controlling engine torque and speed. The determination whether to engage in advisory feedback and active assistance may take into consideration related safety and drivability factors, the accuracy of the output from environment awareness module <b>84</b>, and the manner in which the driver behavior deviates from the fuel economy optimal behavior determined by FE-optimal behavior estimation module <b>88</b>.</div>
