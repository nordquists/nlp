<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The disclosure will now be described more specifically with reference to the following embodiments. It is to be noted that the following descriptions of some embodiments are presented herein for purpose of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to be limited to the precise form disclosed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Large-scale public places such as shopping malls, stadiums, and hospitals are involved with dynamic environment conditions associated with a large foot-traffic volume and a large cleaning area. It is extremely demanding to maintain cleanliness of these public places. The cleaning task for maintaining these public places thus requires a cleaning robot having a long-lasting battery power to continuously clean the area, imposing a heavy on the battery power of the cleaning robot. To avoiding wasting battery power of the cleaning robot, it is required to have human inspectors to check on the cleanliness of various areas of the public place, and decide whether or not to dispatch a cleaning robot to clean a dirty area. The process is cumbersome and costly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Accordingly, the present disclosure provides, inter alia, a system for determining an area (e.g., a public place) that needs a cleaning task and selecting at least one cleaning robot suitable for performing the clean task, and a method for operating the system for dispatching at least one cleaning robot under an operation scheme that substantially obviate one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art. In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a system for dispatching cleaning robots. In some embodiments, the system includes an input subsystem configured to provide an input signal including information about foot traffic in a time period in the area (e.g., a public place); a first interface coupled to the input subsystem and configured to transmit the input signal; a processing subsystem having a processing block and a control block, the processing block being coupled to the first interface to receive the input signal and process the input signal, the control block coupled to the processing block to determine a cleaning task under an operation scheme and generate a control signal for the cleaning task; a second interface coupled to the processing subsystem and configured to transmit signals via a bi-direction bus; and a communication subsystem coupled to the second interface, configured to receive the control signal from the processing subsystem and one or more first signals respectively from the one or more cleaning robots indicating operating status of the one or more cleaning robots, configured to send the control signal based on the one or more first signals to dispatch at least one cleaning robot to the area to perform the cleaning task, and configured to receive at least one second signal from the at least one cleaning robot for the processing block to update the operation scheme, the at least one second signal indicating a progress of the cleaning task being performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a system for dispatching a cleaning robot under an operation scheme according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system <b>100</b> for dispatching a cleaning robot for performing cleaning task in an area is provided. The system <b>100</b> includes an input subsystem <b>10</b> for receiving an input signal related to dirtiness level of an area (e.g., a public place), a processing subsystem <b>30</b> configured to process the input signal for determining if a cleaning task is necessary for the area and generating a control signal under an operation scheme if the cleaning task is initiated, and a communication subsystem <b>50</b> configured to conduct signal communication between the processing subsystem <b>30</b> and multiple cleaning robots <b>200</b> disposed for multiple areas. In addition, a first interface <b>20</b> is provided in the system <b>100</b> for delivering the input signal via a uni-directional bus from the input subsystem <b>10</b> to the processing subsystem <b>30</b>. A second interface <b>40</b> is provided in the system <b>100</b> for transmitting or receiving signals via a bi-directional bus between the processing subsystem <b>30</b> and the communication subsystem <b>50</b>. The signal communication between the communication subsystem <b>50</b> and multiple cleaning robots <b>200</b> is realized via a wireless network in WiFi protocol or other compatible format to transfer the control signal to one or more cleaning robots to dispatch at least one cleaning robot <b>200</b> for performing the cleaning task and to transfer one or more feedback signals reversely to the processing subsystem <b>30</b> for updating the operation scheme as a self-learning process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the input subsystem <b>10</b> includes a plurality of monitoring devices <b>101</b> for collecting the input signal. For maintaining cleanliness in an area (e.g., a public place), the input signal related to the dirtiness level is highly correlated to foot-traffic volume over time. The monitor device <b>101</b> can be a surveillance camera or a counter device. The surveillance camera is able to provide images showing real time field information about foot-traffic volume and even direct recording garbage disposing events in the area. The counter device is at least able to provide real-time measurement of people passing certain area in the area. These monitor devices are readily set up for general purposes and can be directly utilized by the input subsystem <b>10</b> of the system <b>100</b> for intelligently dispatching a cleaning robot for maintaining cleanliness. In particular, the system <b>100</b> is configured to couple a plurality of such monitor devices <b>101</b> disposed in multiple area into its input subsystem <b>10</b> and collect an input signal about foot-traffic from each of the multiple area and use the input signal to make intelligent decision under the operation scheme on dispatching a cleaning robot only to an area that is determined to be necessary for cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the processing subsystem <b>30</b> in some embodiments is coupled to the input subsystem <b>10</b> via the first interface <b>20</b> which is configured to transfer the input signal from a plurality of monitor devices <b>101</b> disposed in an area or multiple input signals at the same time from different groups of monitor devices disposed respectively in multiple areas. In an embodiment, the input signal is transferred as a digital format through the first interface <b>20</b>. In an embodiment, the first interface <b>20</b> is configured to transfer date in a unidirectional bus. The processing subsystem <b>30</b> includes a memory <b>301</b> configured to receive the input signal as digital data and store the data which are usually the plurality of images taken over the multiple areas by the plurality monitor devices <b>101</b>. The processing subsystem <b>30</b> includes a processing block <b>302</b> coupled to the memory <b>301</b> as well as the first interface <b>20</b> and configured to process the input signal. Particularly, the processing block <b>302</b> includes one more image processors for processing the plurality of images. Optionally, the processing block <b>302</b> is a head counter of people from the image data or counter data. In general, a cumulated foot-traffic volume of a particular area over a certain time period can be obtained by the processing block <b>302</b>. The time period can be set to be an entire duration starting from a time when a last cleaning task was done on record in the particular area to a current time. The cumulated foot-traffic volume is a parameter highly correlated with dirtiness level in the area and is employed in the operation scheme for determining if a cleaning task is necessary for the particular area. Optionally, the processing block <b>302</b> is an image analyzer capable of further identifying and characterizing garbage information to assist the determination on whether to initiate a cleaning task.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the processing subsystem <b>30</b> includes a control block <b>303</b> coupled to the processing block <b>302</b> for determining a cleaning task based on the processed input signal under the operation scheme. In some embodiment, the control block <b>303</b> is configured to perform multiple logic calculations using the processed input signal from the processing block <b>302</b> as an input and based on a predetermined operation scheme for intelligently determining a cleaning task for an area (e.g., a public place) and generating a control signal as output for dispatching one or more cleaning robots to perform the cleaning task. Optionally, the processed input signal is the cumulated foot-traffic volume in a time period for the area, which is considered to be highly correlated to dirtiness level of the area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the operation scheme is defined by multiple parameters including at least a first foot-traffic threshold, a second foot-traffic threshold which is higher than the first foot-traffic threshold, a first duration threshold, a second duration threshold which is longer than the first duration threshold. Both the first foot-traffic threshold and the first duration threshold set a minimum value for possibly initiating a cleaning task. In other word, if the foot-traffic volume of an area (e.g., a public place) is smaller than the first foot-traffic threshold or the time period for collecting foot-traffic information is shorter than the first duration threshold, the probability for initiating a cleaning task is 0. Both the second foot-traffic threshold and the second duration threshold set a value that a cleaning task is a must, or the probability for initiating a cleaning task is 1 if the foot-traffic volume of the area is larger than the second foot-traffic threshold or the time period for collecting the foot-traffic information is longer than the second duration threshold. Other parameters for defining the operation scheme includes multiple (M) volume ranges between the first foot-traffic threshold and the second foot-traffic threshold, multiple (N) time ranges between the first duration threshold and the second duration threshold, and multiple values P<sub>MN </sub>of probability-for-cleaning assigned respectively to the multiple volume ranges and multiple time ranges in M×N optional correspondence relationships. For example, a value P<sub>34 </sub>of probability-for-cleaning is assigned to for every cumulated foot-traffic volume in 3<sup>rd </sup>volume range and every time period for collecting the cumulated foot-traffic volume in 4<sup>th </sup>time range. Additional parameters for defining the operation scheme include a probability threshold for initiating a cleaning task and a dirtiness threshold level preset for a standard cleaning task. Optionally, these parameters are obtained empirically and stored in the memory <b>301</b>. Optionally these parameters can be varied for different areas (e.g., different public places) or updated for different seasons over a year. In particular, some parameters can be updated internally by the system <b>100</b> through a self-learning process based on feedback signals received by the control block <b>303</b> sent from one or more cleaning robots that is performing the cleaning task.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the control block <b>303</b> is able to performing a logic calculation to compare the cumulated foot-traffic volume in the time period from a last cleaning task to current time in an area (e.g., a public place) with the currently stored parameters for the operation scheme. If the cumulated foot-traffic volume is smaller than the first foot-traffic threshold and the time period is shorter than the first duration threshold, then the control block determines that no cleaning task is necessary for this area. If the cumulated foot-traffic volume is greater than the second foot-traffic threshold and the time period is longer than the second duration threshold, the control block <b>303</b> determines there must be a cleaning task for the area. If the cumulated foot-traffic volume is greater than the first foot-traffic threshold but smaller than the second foot-traffic threshold, it is further identified the particular volume range in which the cumulated foot-traffic volume falls. If the time period is longer than the first duration threshold but shorter than the second duration threshold, it is further identified the particular time range in which the time period falls. Then, the control block <b>303</b> can determine that the value of probability-for-cleaning assigned for the particular volume range and time range is a current probability-for-cleaning for the area. The control block <b>303</b> further performs a logic calculation to compare the current probability-for-cleaning with the probability threshold under the operation scheme. If the current probability-for-cleaning is equal to or greater than the probability threshold, the control block <b>303</b> determines a cleaning task for the area. Otherwise, no cleaning task is needed for the area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The determination logic used above under the operation scheme is to discrete the cumulated foot-traffic volume and the time period so that the decision can be optimized. For example, assuming that the first foot-traffic threshold is 100 people and the second foot-traffic threshold is 600 people, in between, five volume ranges are preset: 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, 400-500, and 500-600). Assuming that the first duration threshold is 6 hours and the second duration threshold is 24 hours, in between, three time ranges are preset: 6-12, 12-18, and 18-24. For each preset volume range, three values of probability-for-cleaning are assigned corresponding to three preset time ranges, respectively. For example, for a volume range of 100-200 people, the time range of 6-12 corresponds a first value of probability-for-cleaning, the time range of 12-18 corresponds to a second value of probability-for-cleaning, and the time range of 18-24 corresponds to a third value of probability-for-cleaning. Totally, there are 5×3=15 correspondence relationships between a value of probability-for-cleaning and a particular range of certain foot-traffic volume and time period. The initially assigned values of probability-for-cleaning for all ranges are obtained empirically and stored in the memory. Later, every time when a cleaning task is finished, an opportunity is provided to update these values based on latest information about actual dirtiness level of the area in the current situation. Therefore, the determination logic of the control block <b>303</b>, after receiving the cumulated foot-traffic volume collected in a time period from the processing block <b>302</b>, will firstly identify which volume range is of the cumulated foot-traffic volume and which time range is of the time period for collecting above foot-traffic volume. Then, a probability-for-cleaning corresponding to this cumulated foot-traffic volume and time period can be determined based the predetermined correspondence relationship mentioned above.</div>

The cleaning robot <b>200</b> includes a communication unit <b>201</b> configured to receive control signal from the system <b>100</b> (specifically from the communication subsystem <b>50</b>) and also configured to send any feedback signal related to current status of the cleaning robot itself or any field information nearby related to the cleaning task.

Optionally, the inspection unit <b>203</b> includes a camera for capturing images about the garbage area or other sensors designed for identify garbage material types or amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the cleaning robot <b>200</b> is operated in following modes: 1) cleaning mode, i.e., it is currently performing a cleaning task previously assigned while it is open to receive any control signal for other cleaning tasks; 2) idle mode, i.e., it has been fully charged while no current cleaning task and open to receive any control signal for a new cleaning task; 3) moving mode, i.e., it is moving toward a target field location after receiving a control signal for a cleaning task, not yet in cleaning operation, and open to receive any control signal for other cleaning tasks; 4) charging mode, i.e., it is being charged and not open to receive any control signal until the charging is finished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the communication unit <b>201</b> of the cleaning robot <b>200</b> is configured to send a first signal back to the system <b>100</b> for indicating operating status of the one or more cleaning robots. e.g., the current mode of the cleaning robot, no matter what the current mode is one of about four modes. Additionally, the first signal contains information about the location and available battery power of this cleaning robot, time spent for current cleaning task if it is in cleaning mode and estimated time to finish the current task, and time needed for it to move from current location to a target location. The system <b>100</b> has the control block <b>303</b> in the processing subsystem <b>30</b> to analyze the first signal received from each cleaning robot separately under the operation scheme. The control block <b>303</b> is configured to calculate a time needed for each cleaning robot in idle mode to travel from its current location to the target location of an upcoming cleaning task, so that a cleaning robot bearing a shortest travel time can be selected out of multiple cleaning robots in idle mode. The control block <b>303</b> is configured to calculate total time needed for a cleaning robot in cleaning mode to finish its previously-assigned cleaning task, then to travel to the target location for the upcoming cleaning task and estimate the available battery power for above tasks and be able to return to charging stage after all, so that a cleaning robot bearing a shortest total time with sufficient battery power can be selected out of multiple cleaning robots in cleaning mode or moving mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the first signal from a cleaning robot includes information indicating that the cleaning robot is in an abnormal state. For example, the cleaning robot has mechanical problem, battery power loss unexpectedly, unusual object preventing the cleaning, received control signal for cleaning but not responded to move or no signal being sent to report its moving mode, etc. The alarm unit <b>304</b> will produce alarm signal or generate alarm message for human intervening. In an alternative embodiment, the abnormal state of a cleaning robot may also be detected by the input subsystem <b>10</b> through a plurality of monitor devices <b>101</b> disposed in the corresponding area (e.g., a corresponding public place). For example, the monitor device <b>101</b> may be able to detect a cleaning robot in cleaning mode but being stationary for long time or a cleaning robot in moving mode after finishing a cleaning task but not able to return the charging station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">In some additional embodiments, the communication unit <b>201</b> of the cleaning robot <b>200</b> is configured to send a second signal back to the system <b>100</b> for indicating a progress of the cleaning task being performed, e.g., reporting how a current cleaning task is performed. Specifically, the second signal contains information of garbage area measured before cleaning and garbage amount collected after cleaning. The information comes from real-time assessment of each cleaning task, which in turn provides a learning basis for the system <b>100</b> to improve its dispatching management efficiency. As the information is received as the second signal by the control block <b>303</b> of the processing subsystem <b>30</b>, optionally, the control block <b>303</b> is able to quantify a dirtiness level associated with the current cleaning task. For example, a dirtiness level can be characterized by taking a ratio of the garbage area over a total area of the area to be cleaned. Or in an alternative example, the dirtiness level is simply determined by the garbage amount. The control block <b>303</b> is able to perform a logic calculation to compare the new dirtiness level associated with a cleaning task with a pre-stored dirtiness threshold level under the current operation scheme. If the dirtiness level is greater than the dirtiness threshold level, the control block <b>303</b> is able to update the value of probability-for-cleaning previously assigned for the cumulated foot-traffic volume in the time period currently obtained for initiating the latest cleaning task by increasing the value by a first preset amount, i.e., increasing a likelihood for initiating a cleaning task for similar situation in the area next time. If the dirtiness level is less than the dirtiness threshold level, the control block <b>303</b> is able to update the value of probability-for-cleaning previously assigned for the cumulated foot-traffic volume in the time period currently obtained for initiating the latest cleaning task by decreasing the value by a second preset amount, i.e., reducing a likelihood for initiating a cleaning task for similar situation in the area next time. The first preset amount or the second preset amount is obtained empirically and can be different for different areas (e.g., different public places) and updated manually or automatically through a higher-level control. As used herein, the term “dirtiness threshold level” refers to a threshold level of dirtiness which may be characterized by various appropriate physical parameters. In one example, the dirtiness threshold level is a threshold ratio of the garbage area over a total area of the area to be cleaned. In another example, the dirtiness threshold level is a threshold garbage amount of the area to be cleaned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Optionally, other parameters used to define the operation scheme can be updated through self-learning process based on the second signal containing the real-time dirtiness level obtained during performing the latest cleaning task. For example, the first foot-traffic threshold may be raised if more often the value of probability-for-cleaning is increased after latest cleaning operation or reduced if more often the value of probability-for-cleaning is reduced. Similarly, other threshold values may be updated for enhance overall efficiency in executing the operation scheme for intelligently dispatching cleaning robots for performing cleaning tasks in multiple areas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, based on multiple first signals from multiple cleaning robots, the control block <b>303</b> is able to keep the latest status information for all the multiple cleaning robots. As multiple input signals respectively from multiple areas (e.g., multiple public places) are received, processed, and determined that multiple cleaning tasks are necessary in multiple areas, the control block <b>303</b> is able to select multiple available cleaning robots respectively and generate corresponding control signals respectively to dispatch multiple selected cleaning robots to the corresponding multiple areas for performing the cleaning tasks thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, based on the second signal from the cleaning robot in the target field of the area, the control block <b>303</b> can perform an alternative logic operation to divide the pubic place into two or more regions so that two or more cleaning tasks are initiated respectively for cleaning the two or more regions. For example, it is necessary when the second signal indicate a substantial increase of garbage area over a nominal value for the area, the above option in the operation scheme could be a more efficient if the control block <b>303</b> is able to select two or more cleaning robots capable of being dispatched respectively to the two or more regions for performing corresponding cleaning tasks with shorter operation time and less battery power usage overall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is flow chart showing a method of operating a system for dispatching a cleaning robot under an operation scheme for performing cleaning task according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method <b>300</b> is an intelligent dispatching method based on operation of the system <b>100</b> described earlier together with multiple cleaning robots <b>200</b> for maintaining cleanliness of multiple areas (e.g., multiple public places). The method <b>300</b> includes operating an input subsystem of the system <b>100</b> to collect information about an area. Particularly, the information includes a cumulated foot-traffic volume in a cumulated time period for the area counted from finishing time of a last cleaning task of the area. The input subsystem includes monitoring devices such as camera, counter, video recorder, and so on which are readily available for most public places in developed urban area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method <b>300</b> further includes transferring the information about the cumulated foot-traffic volume in the cumulated time period by a first interface to a processing subsystem of the system <b>100</b>. This information transfer is performed automatically through the setup of the input subsystem itself. The first interface serves a communication channel for passing the information in terms of digital data. Optionally, the information is a plurality of image data. Optionally, the information includes digital data about number of people and time duration of those people passing a certain area or staying or conducting certain activities in the area. Optionally, the digital form of this information is constantly stored and archived in a memory of the processing subsystem.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method <b>300</b> additionally includes processing the information by the processing subsystem to obtain at least a cumulated foot-traffic volume in a time period starting from an end of a last cleaning task in the subject area. The processing subsystem is able to process a plurality of image data to deduce a pair of quantitative values referring to a cumulated foot-traffic volume associated with the area and a time period for collecting the foot-traffic volume. Although other quantitative information can be deduced from the plurality of image data in association with information about dirtiness level in the area, the cumulated foot-traffic volume collected in the time period are used as an input for the processing subsystem to execute an operation scheme for determining if a cleaning task is necessary for the area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> again, the method <b>300</b> includes determining a cleaning task in the area under an operation scheme based on the cumulated foot traffic volume in the time period to generate a control signal. The operation scheme is defined by multiple parameters designed for setting up a cleaning plan based on empirical data about the dirtiness level, typical foot-traffic volume and variation in daily basis for the area. In particular, a control block in the processing subsystem is using the cumulated foot traffic volume in the time period as an input of a logic calculation for comparing them with relevant threshold parameters assigned for a current version of the operation scheme. For example, if the cumulated foot traffic volume in the time period is greater than a foot-traffic threshold and the time period is longer than a duration threshold, a cleaning task in determined to be initiated for the area. Accordingly, a control signal is generated for providing instruction for moving the cleaning robot toward a field position and guiding it to start performing the cleaning task from there in the area. Optionally, the cumulated foot traffic volume in the time period is used as an input to determine which volume range and which time range of those two quantitative values fall into. Then a value of probability-for-cleaning assigned for those ranges based on a predetermined correspondence relationship between various foot-traffic volumes and given probability values ranging from 0 to 1 is reassigned as a current value of probability-for-cleaning for the area. The current value of probability-for-cleaning is then compared with a probability threshold that is a predefined value, e.g., 50%, for initiating a cleaning task. The logic conclusion of the comparison leads to a determination of a cleaning task and generate a control signal accordingly, when the current value of probability-for-cleaning is found larger than or equal to the probability threshold. Of course, if the current value of probability-for-cleaning is found smaller than the probability threshold, then it is determined no cleaning task is needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method <b>300</b> also includes operating the communication subsystem to receive one or more first signals respectively from one or more cleaning robots, transferring the one or more first signals via the second interface to the processing subsystem, and determining at least one cleaning robots based on the one or more first signals. In an embodiment, the processing system needs to select one or more cleaning robots that are most suitable for performing the cleaning task before sending the control signal to them. One or more first signals from the cleaning robots carry the information about current modes, available battery powers, and travel times for the cleaning robots to move towards the field position associated with the cleaning task, which are basis for the system <b>100</b> to select or determine which one or more cleaning robots are the most suitable candidates for the upcoming cleaning task. Optionally, the communication subsystem of the system <b>100</b> includes a transceiver configured to receive one or more first signals via a wireless network from the one or more cleaning robots in the field. Optionally, the transceiver is also configured to transmit the one or more first signals through a bi-directional bus of the second interface to the processing subsystem. The processing subsystem further will process the one or more first signals through multiple logic calculation to select at least one cleaning robot for the cleaning task based on working mode, battery power, and shortest time to travel, etc. out of the one or more cleaning robots in the field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring further to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method <b>300</b> includes sending the control signal to dispatch the at least one cleaning robot to the area to perform the cleaning task and receive at least one second signal for updating the operation scheme. After the selection of the at least one cleaning robot as the most suitable one for the cleaning task in the area, the control signal is sent from the communication subsystem via the wireless network to the selected cleaning robot. The control signal, after being received by a communication unit of the cleaning robot, then is converted to specific instructions by a control unit of the cleaning robot to drive its moving unit in operation to move the cleaning robot to the field position and to guide its cleaning unit to perform relevant cleaning in garbage area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart showing part of the operation scheme according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an example of an operation flow <b>400</b> for determining a cleaning task and dispatching a cleaning robot based on a self-learning operation scheme is illustrated. As shown, the operation flow <b>400</b> starts with operating an input subsystem to collect information about multiple regions. The information about multiple regions is intended to be used as input for an intelligent determination under the operation scheme whether a cleaning task is needed for the multiple regions. In general, human activity in terms of foot-traffic volume would be a good indicator about dirtiness in each region. Particularly, the information could be provided in terms of images cumulated over time for each region. Next, the flow <b>400</b> continues with processing the information to obtain foot-traffic volumes cumulated in a time period in the multiple regions respectively. In this step, the specific value of foot-traffic volumes cumulated in the time period respectively for the multiple regions are deduced through digital image processing and calculations and can be loaded as inputs of the operation scheme.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the operation scheme includes multiple logic functions, such as determining, selecting, communicating, dividing or updating, supported by multiple parameters. Each function is executable by a logic control block as certain input information is provided and one or more outputs including a control signal can be generated accordingly. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the operation flow <b>400</b> is performing a determining function to decide whether a cleaning task is needed for any one of the multiple regions by comparing input information of the foot-traffic volumes cumulated in the time period with corresponding threshold parameters preset for current operation scheme. If a logic output of this determining function is “No”, the operation flow is ended. If a logic output of the determining function is “Yes”, the operation flow continues to next step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Under the operation scheme, assuming that the input information meets certain criteria defined by the threshold parameters, the output yields “Yes”. Particularly for this case, at least one of the multiple regions is determined to need a cleaning task there. According a control signal for the cleaning task is generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The operation flow <b>400</b> further is performing a selecting function under the operation scheme to select at least one cleaning robot suitable for the cleaning task just initiated. Again, certain input information is required for this selecting function. Particularly, the input information may come from multiple cleaning robots in the multiple regions regarding their current working modes, locations, battery life, etc. Partially, the communicating function of the operation scheme is also involved as the input information needs to be sent as a first signal to the control block from multiple cleaning robots respectively. Under the operation scheme, the information for all cleaning robots is analyzed and at least one cleaning robot may be selected assuming it is the best in meeting various criteria defined by multiple parameters for the cleaning task in the determined one of the multiple regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Once the selecting function is successfully accomplished, the operation flow <b>400</b> is performing a communicating function to send the control signal to the at least one cleaning robot selected for the cleaning task. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the communicating function may be executed through the communication subsystem via the second interface with the control block and via wireless network with a communication unit of the cleaning robot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The operation flow <b>400</b> further includes a step of operating the cleaning robot to perform the cleaning task and to collect field information. This step partly involves the communicating function as the cleaning robot uses the control signal to drive its moving unit and cleaning unit for performing the cleaning task in the determined one region. Further the operation flow <b>400</b> is to perform the communicating function of the operation scheme to generating a signal by the cleaning robot based on the field information sent back to the control block. The field information is about a dirtiness level of the region currently being cleaned and sent as a second signal back to the control block.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The operation flow <b>400</b> then includes a loop to perform an updating function of the operation scheme based on the second signal. Particularly, the control block is configured to update one or more parameters used to define the operation scheme based on the second signal as an input received from the cleaning robot that finishes a latest cleaning task in a latest determined one of multiple regions. The output of the updating function is to provide a new version of the operation scheme which is ready for being employed by the system to dispatch one or more cleaning robots for maintaining cleanliness of multiple regions in more accurate and more efficient way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart showing part of the operation scheme according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. This flow provides more details about a selecting function of the operation scheme employed by a system for intelligently dispatching cleaning robot for performing a just-initiated cleaning task in an area (e.g., a public place) disclosed throughout the specification. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flow <b>500</b> starts with a step of operating a communication subsystem of the system to collect information about multiple cleaning robots provided in the area. This information includes working modes, locations, battery life, mechanical conditions, etc. and should be updated substantially in real time whenever any above information is changed and passed as a signal sent to a control block of the system. The feedback signal will be used as an input for the control block to execute the selecting function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flow <b>500</b> then is to perform a step of the selecting function on determining whether any cleaning robot is in idle mode. Directly based on the feedback signal, one or more cleaning robots in idle mode can be determined. The idle mode means that the cleaning robot is fully charged in station and ready to take any cleaning task. Optionally, it may include cleaning robot in moving mode with sufficient battery life but ready to take a cleaning task. Assuming that the output of this sub-step is “Yes”, a selection logic operation is performed by the control block to select one cleaning robot out of the one or more cleaning robots that needs the shortest time to finish the just-initiated cleaning task. Then the selecting function is finished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Alternatively, assuming that the output of the above step of the selecting function is “No”, meaning none of cleaning robots is in idle mode. The operation flow <b>500</b> then moves to next step of determining whether any cleaning robot is in cleaning mode which means it is currently performing a previously-assigned cleaning task. A cleaning robot in cleaning mode is able to accept new cleaning task. If the output of this step is “No”, meaning none of cleaning robots is in cleaning mode (e.g., every cleaning robot in charging mode, so no cleaning task is taken for now until the charging to any one is finished), then the flow <b>500</b> loops back to continue the starting step to evaluate the information from all cleaning robots or wait for a mode change event of any cleaning robot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Alternatively, if the output of above step is “Yes”, meaning that one or more cleaning robots are in cleaning mode, then the flow <b>500</b> further is to perform a step of estimating times for the one or more cleaning robots in cleaning mode to finish respective previously-assigned cleaning tasks plus to move to perform a current cleaning task, and optionally plus to return to a charging station. The selection logic operation under the operation scheme is to identify a best cleaning robot in cleaning mode that can take least time to accomplish overall tasks. Of course, many other detail considerations can be included in the operation scheme for executing this selecting function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flow <b>500</b> is to perform a step of determining whether any cleaning robot has sufficient batter power based on estimated time to accomplish overall tasks including the previously-assigned task, moving, and the just-initiated cleaning task. Assuming the output of this step is “No”, then the just-initiated cleaning task cannot be accomplished and the operation flow <b>500</b> loops back to continue the starting step to evaluate the information from all cleaning robots or wait for a mode change event of any cleaning robot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Assuming the output of the above step is “Yes”, then the flow <b>500</b> moves to perform a step of selecting one cleaning robot with sufficient battery power and least time to move to the field position to perform and finish the just-initiated cleaning task.
