<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 15/744,737, filed Jan. 12, 2018, which is the U.S. national stage application of International Application PCT/CN2017/088033, filed Jun. 13, 2017, which claims priority to International Application PCT/CN2017/072566, filed Jan. 25, 2017 and Chinese Patent Application No. 201610414226.5, filed Jun. 13, 2016, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties in the present disclosure.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), also known as cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274) or B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1), is a 40 kDa type 1 transmembrane protein believed to play a major role in suppressing the immune system during particular events such as pregnancy, tissue allografts, autoimmune disease and other disease states such as hepatitis. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 or B7.1 transmits an inhibitory signal which reduces the proliferation of CD8+ T cells at the lymph nodes and supplementary to that PD-1 is also able to control the accumulation of foreign antigen specific T cells in the lymph nodes through apoptosis which is further mediated by a lower regulation of the gene Bcl-2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">It has been shown that upregulation of PD-L1 may allow cancers to evade the host immune system. An analysis of tumor specimens from patients with renal cell carcinoma found that high tumor expression of PD-L1 was associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and an increased risk of death. Many PD-L1 inhibitors are in development as immuno-oncology therapies and are showing good results in clinical trials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to treatment of cancers, PD-L1 inhibition has also shown promises in treating infectious diseases. In a mouse model of intracellular infection, <i>L. monocytogenes </i>induced PD-L1 protein expression in T cells, NK cells, and macrophages. PD-L1 blockade (e.g., using blocking antibodies) resulted in increased mortality for infected mice. Blockade reduced TNFα and nitric oxide production by macrophages, reduced granzyme B production by NK cells, and decreased proliferation of <i>L. monocytogenes </i>antigen-specific CD8 T cells (but not CD4 T cells). This evidence suggests that PD-L1 acts as a positive costimulatory molecule in intracellular infection.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides anti-PD-L1 antibody having high binding affinity to human PD-L1 proteins and can effectively block the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1. Also importantly, the examples demonstrate that these anti-PD-L1 antibodies promote T cell immune response and inhibit tumor growth. Different from known anti-PD-L1 antibodies that bind to the immunoglobulin V domain of the extracellular portion of the PD-L1 protein, these antibodies bind to the immunoglobulin C domain, in particular amino acid residues Y134, K162, and N183. These anti-PD-L1 antibodies are useful for therapeutic purposes such as treating various types of cancer, as well as infections, and can also be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006">Definitions</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">It is to be noted that the term “a” or “an” entity refers to one or more of that entity; for example, “an antibody,” is understood to represent one or more antibodies. As such, the terms “a” (or “an”), “one or more,” and “at least one” can be used interchangeably herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term “polypeptide” is intended to encompass a singular “polypeptide” as well as plural “polypeptides,” and refers to a molecule composed of monomers (amino acids) linearly linked by amide bonds (also known as peptide bonds). The term “polypeptide” refers to any chain or chains of two or more amino acids, and does not refer to a specific length of the product. Thus, peptides, dipeptides, tripeptides, oligopeptides, “protein,” “amino acid chain,” or any other term used to refer to a chain or chains of two or more amino acids, are included within the definition of “polypeptide,” and the term “polypeptide” may be used instead of, or interchangeably with any of these terms. The term “polypeptide” is also intended to refer to the products of post-expression modifications of the polypeptide, including without limitation glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, or modification by non-naturally occurring amino acids. A polypeptide may be derived from a natural biological source or produced by recombinant technology, but is not necessarily translated from a designated nucleic acid sequence. It may be generated in any manner, including by chemical synthesis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The term “isolated” as used herein with respect to cells, nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA, refers to molecules separated from other DNAs or RNAs, respectively, that are present in the natural source of the macromolecule. The term “isolated” as used herein also refers to a nucleic acid or peptide that is substantially free of cellular material, viral material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. Moreover, an “isolated nucleic acid” is meant to include nucleic acid fragments which are not naturally occurring as fragments and would not be found in the natural state. The term “isolated” is also used herein to refer to cells or polypeptides which are isolated from other cellular proteins or tissues. Isolated polypeptides is meant to encompass both purified and recombinant polypeptides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, the term “recombinant” as it pertains to polypeptides or polynucleotides intends a form of the polypeptide or polynucleotide that does not exist naturally, a non-limiting example of which can be created by combining polynucleotides or polypeptides that would not normally occur together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">“Homology” or “identity” or “similarity” refers to sequence similarity between two peptides or between two nucleic acid molecules. Homology can be determined by comparing a position in each sequence which may be aligned for purposes of comparison. When a position in the compared sequence is occupied by the same base or amino acid, then the molecules are homologous at that position. A degree of homology between sequences is a function of the number of matching or homologous positions shared by the sequences. An “unrelated” or “non-homologous” sequence shares less than 40% identity, though preferably less than 25% identity, with one of the sequences of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">A polynucleotide or polynucleotide region (or a polypeptide or polypeptide region) has a certain percentage (for example, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99%) of “sequence identity” to another sequence means that, when aligned, that percentage of bases (or amino acids) are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment and the percent homology or sequence identity can be determined using software programs known in the art, for example those described in Ausubel et al. eds. (2007) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Preferably, default parameters are used for alignment. One alignment program is BLAST, using default parameters. In particular, programs are BLASTN and BLASTP, using the following default parameters: Genetic code=standard; filter=none; strand=both; cutoff=60; expect=10; Matrix=BLOSUM62; Descriptions=50 sequences; sort by=HIGH SCORE; Databases=non-redundant, GenBank+EMBL+DDBJ+PDB+GenBank CDS translations+SwissProtein+SPupdate+PIR. Biologically equivalent polynucleotides are those having the above-noted specified percent homology and encoding a polypeptide having the same or similar biological activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The term “an equivalent nucleic acid or polynucleotide” refers to a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence having a certain degree of homology, or sequence identity, with the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid or complement thereof. A homolog of a double stranded nucleic acid is intended to include nucleic acids having a nucleotide sequence which has a certain degree of homology with or with the complement thereof. In one aspect, homologs of nucleic acids are capable of hybridizing to the nucleic acid or complement thereof. Likewise, “an equivalent polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide having a certain degree of homology, or sequence identity, with the amino acid sequence of a reference polypeptide. In some aspects, the sequence identity is at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99%. In some aspects, the equivalent polypeptide or polynucleotide has one, two, three, four or five addition, deletion, substitution and their combinations thereof as compared to the reference polypeptide or polynucleotide. In some aspects, the equivalent sequence retains the activity (e.g., epitope-binding) or structure (e.g., salt-bridge) of the reference sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Hybridization reactions can be performed under conditions of different “stringency”. In general, a low stringency hybridization reaction is carried out at about 40° C. in about 10×SSC or a solution of equivalent ionic strength/temperature. A moderate stringency hybridization is typically performed at about 50° C. in about 6×SSC, and a high stringency hybridization reaction is generally performed at about 60° C. in about 1×SSC. Hybridization reactions can also be performed under “physiological conditions” which is well known to one of skill in the art. A non-limiting example of a physiological condition is the temperature, ionic strength, pH and concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> normally found in a cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">A polynucleotide is composed of a specific sequence of four nucleotide bases: adenine (A); cytosine (C); guanine (G); thymine (T); and uracil (U) for thymine when the polynucleotide is RNA. Thus, the term “polynucleotide sequence” is the alphabetical representation of a polynucleotide molecule. This alphabetical representation can be input into databases in a computer having a central processing unit and used for bioinformatics applications such as functional genomics and homology searching. The term “polymorphism” refers to the coexistence of more than one form of a gene or portion thereof. A portion of a gene of which there are at least two different forms, i.e., two different nucleotide sequences, is referred to as a “polymorphic region of a gene”. A polymorphic region can be a single nucleotide, the identity of which differs in different alleles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The terms “polynucleotide” and “oligonucleotide” are used interchangeably and refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides or analogs thereof. Polynucleotides can have any three-dimensional structure and may perform any function, known or unknown. The following are non-limiting examples of polynucleotides: a gene or gene fragment (for example, a probe, primer, EST or SAGE tag), exons, introns, messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, ribozymes, cDNA, dsRNA, siRNA, miRNA, recombinant polynucleotides, branched polynucleotides, plasmids, vectors, isolated DNA of any sequence, isolated RNA of any sequence, nucleic acid probes and primers. A polynucleotide can comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. If present, modifications to the nucleotide structure can be imparted before or after assembly of the polynucleotide. The sequence of nucleotides can be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide can be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling component. The term also refers to both double- and single-stranded molecules. Unless otherwise specified or required, any embodiment of this disclosure that is a polynucleotide encompasses both the double-stranded form and each of two complementary single-stranded forms known or predicted to make up the double-stranded form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The term “encode” as it is applied to polynucleotides refers to a polynucleotide which is said to “encode” a polypeptide if, in its native state or when manipulated by methods well known to those skilled in the art, it can be transcribed and/or translated to produce the mRNA for the polypeptide and/or a fragment thereof. The antisense strand is the complement of such a nucleic acid, and the encoding sequence can be deduced therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, an “antibody” or “antigen-binding polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide or a polypeptide complex that specifically recognizes and binds to an antigen. An antibody can be a whole antibody and any antigen binding fragment or a single chain thereof. Thus the term “antibody” includes any protein or peptide containing molecule that comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin molecule having biological activity of binding to the antigen. Examples of such include, but are not limited to a complementarity determining region (CDR) of a heavy or light chain or a ligand binding portion thereof, a heavy chain or light chain variable region, a heavy chain or light chain constant region, a framework (FR) region, or any portion thereof, or at least one portion of a binding protein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The terms “antibody fragment” or “antigen-binding fragment”, as used herein, is a portion of an antibody such as F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>, F(ab)<sub>2</sub>, Fab′, Fab, Fv, scFv and the like. Regardless of structure, an antibody fragment binds with the same antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody. The term “antibody fragment” includes aptamers, spiegelmers, and diabodies. The term “antibody fragment” also includes any synthetic or genetically engineered protein that acts like an antibody by binding to a specific antigen to form a complex.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">A “single-chain variable fragment” or “scFv” refers to a fusion protein of the variable regions of the heavy (V<sub>H</sub>) and light chains (V<sub>L</sub>) of immunoglobulins. In some aspects, the regions are connected with a short linker peptide of ten to about 25 amino acids. The linker can be rich in glycine for flexibility, as well as serine or threonine for solubility, and can either connect the N-terminus of the V<sub>H </sub>with the C-terminus of the V<sub>L</sub>, or vice versa. This protein retains the specificity of the original immunoglobulin, despite removal of the constant regions and the introduction of the linker. ScFv molecules are known in the art and are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,892,019.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The term antibody encompasses various broad classes of polypeptides that can be distinguished biochemically. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon (γ, μ, α, δ, ε) with some subclasses among them (e.g., γ1-γ4). It is the nature of this chain that determines the “class” of the antibody as IgG, IgM, IgA IgG, or IgE, respectively. The immunoglobulin subclasses (isotypes) e.g., IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2</sub>, IgG<sub>3</sub>, IgG<sub>4</sub>, IgG<sub>5</sub>, etc. are well characterized and are known to confer functional specialization. Modified versions of each of these classes and isotypes are readily discernable to the skilled artisan in view of the instant disclosure and, accordingly, are within the scope of the instant disclosure. All immunoglobulin classes are clearly within the scope of the present disclosure, the following discussion will generally be directed to the IgG class of immunoglobulin molecules. With regard to IgG, a standard immunoglobulin molecule comprises two identical light chain polypeptides of molecular weight approximately 23,000 Daltons, and two identical heavy chain polypeptides of molecular weight 53,000-70,000. The four chains are typically joined by disulfide bonds in a “Y” configuration wherein the light chains bracket the heavy chains starting at the mouth of the “Y” and continuing through the variable region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Antibodies, antigen-binding polypeptides, variants, or derivatives thereof of the disclosure include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, multispecific, human, humanized, primatized, or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, epitope-binding fragments, e.g., Fab, Fab′ and F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>, Fd, Fvs, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), fragments comprising either a VK or VH domain, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to LIGHT antibodies disclosed herein). Immunoglobulin or antibody molecules of the disclosure can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA, and IgY), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda (K, λ). Each heavy chain class may be bound with either a kappa or lambda light chain. In general, the light and heavy chains are covalently bonded to each other, and the “tail” portions of the two heavy chains are bonded to each other by covalent disulfide linkages or non-covalent linkages when the immunoglobulins are generated either by hybridomas, B cells or genetically engineered host cells. In the heavy chain, the amino acid sequences run from an N-terminus at the forked ends of the Y configuration to the C-terminus at the bottom of each chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Both the light and heavy chains are divided into regions of structural and functional homology. The terms “constant” and “variable” are used functionally. In this regard, it will be appreciated that the variable domains of both the light (VK) and heavy (VH) chain portions determine antigen recognition and specificity. Conversely, the constant domains of the light chain (CK) and the heavy chain (CH1, CH2 or CH3) confer important biological properties such as secretion, transplacental mobility, Fc receptor binding, complement binding, and the like. By convention the numbering of the constant region domains increases as they become more distal from the antigen-binding site or amino-terminus of the antibody. The N-terminal portion is a variable region and at the C-terminal portion is a constant region; the CH3 and CK domains actually comprise the carboxy-terminus of the heavy and light chain, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">As indicated above, the variable region allows the antibody to selectively recognize and specifically bind epitopes on antigens. That is, the VK domain and VH domain, or subset of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), of an antibody combine to form the variable region that defines a three dimensional antigen-binding site. This quaternary antibody structure forms the antigen-binding site present at the end of each arm of the Y. More specifically, the antigen-binding site is defined by three CDRs on each of the VH and VK chains (i.e. CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3, CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3). In some instances, e.g., certain immunoglobulin molecules derived from camelid species or engineered based on camelid immunoglobulins, a complete immunoglobulin molecule may consist of heavy chains only, with no light chains. See, e.g., Hamers-Casterman et al., <i>Nature </i>363:446-448 (1993).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In naturally occurring antibodies, the six “complementarity determining regions” or “CDRs” present in each antigen-binding domain are short, non-contiguous sequences of amino acids that are specifically positioned to form the antigen-binding domain as the antibody assumes its three dimensional configuration in an aqueous environment. The remainder of the amino acids in the antigen-binding domains, referred to as “framework” regions, show less inter-molecular variability. The framework regions largely adopt a β-sheet conformation and the CDRs form loops which connect, and in some cases form part of, the β-sheet structure. Thus, framework regions act to form a scaffold that provides for positioning the CDRs in correct orientation by inter-chain, non-covalent interactions. The antigen-binding domain formed by the positioned CDRs defines a surface complementary to the epitope on the immunoreactive antigen. This complementary surface promotes the non-covalent binding of the antibody to its cognate epitope. The amino acids comprising the CDRs and the framework regions, respectively, can be readily identified for any given heavy or light chain variable region by one of ordinary skill in the art, since they have been precisely defined (see “Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,” Kabat, E., et al., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (1983); and Chothia and Lesk, <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>196:901-917 (1987)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In the case where there are two or more definitions of a term which is used and/or accepted within the art, the definition of the term as used herein is intended to include all such meanings unless explicitly stated to the contrary. A specific example is the use of the term “complementarity determining region” (“CDR”) to describe the non-contiguous antigen combining sites found within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides. This particular region has been described by Kabat et al., U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, “Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest” (1983) and by Chothia et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>196:901-917 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. The CDR definitions according to Kabat and Chothia include overlapping or subsets of amino acid residues when compared against each other. Nevertheless, application of either definition to refer to a CDR of an antibody or variants thereof is intended to be within the scope of the term as defined and used herein. The appropriate amino acid residues which encompass the CDRs as defined by each of the above cited references are set forth in the table below as a comparison. The exact residue numbers which encompass a particular CDR will vary depending on the sequence and size of the CDR. Those skilled in the art can routinely determine which residues comprise a particular CDR given the variable region amino acid sequence of the antibody.</div>

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Kabat et al. also defined a numbering system for variable domain sequences that is applicable to any antibody. One of ordinary skill in the art can unambiguously assign this system of “Kabat numbering” to any variable domain sequence, without reliance on any experimental data beyond the sequence itself. As used herein, “Kabat numbering” refers to the numbering system set forth by Kabat et al., U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, “Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest” (1983).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition to table above, the Kabat number system describes the CDR regions as follows: CDR-H1 begins at approximately amino acid 31 (i.e., approximately 9 residues after the first cysteine residue), includes approximately 5-7 amino acids, and ends at the next tryptophan residue. CDR-H2 begins at the fifteenth residue after the end of CDR-H1, includes approximately 16-19 amino acids, and ends at the next arginine or lysine residue. CDR-H3 begins at approximately the thirty third amino acid residue after the end of CDR-H2; includes 3-25 amino acids; and ends at the sequence W-G-X-G, where X is any amino acid. CDR-L1 begins at approximately residue 24 (i.e., following a cysteine residue); includes approximately 10-17 residues; and ends at the next tryptophan residue. CDR-L2 begins at approximately the sixteenth residue after the end of CDR-L1 and includes approximately 7 residues. CDR-L3 begins at approximately the thirty third residue after the end of CDR-L2 (i.e., following a cysteine residue); includes approximately 7-11 residues and ends at the sequence F or W-G-X-G, where X is any amino acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Antibodies disclosed herein may be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably, the antibodies are human, murine, donkey, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, llama, horse, or chicken antibodies. In another embodiment, the variable region may be condricthoid in origin (e.g., from sharks).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein, the term “heavy chain constant region” includes amino acid sequences derived from an immunoglobulin heavy chain. A polypeptide comprising a heavy chain constant region comprises at least one of: a CH1 domain, a hinge (e.g., upper, middle, and/or lower hinge region) domain, a CH2 domain, a CH3 domain, or a variant or fragment thereof. For example, an antigen-binding polypeptide for use in the disclosure may comprise a polypeptide chain comprising a CH1 domain; a polypeptide chain comprising a CH1 domain, at least a portion of a hinge domain, and a CH2 domain; a polypeptide chain comprising a CH1 domain and a CH3 domain; a polypeptide chain comprising a CH1 domain, at least a portion of a hinge domain, and a CH3 domain, or a polypeptide chain comprising a CH1 domain, at least a portion of a hinge domain, a CH2 domain, and a CH3 domain. In another embodiment, a polypeptide of the disclosure comprises a polypeptide chain comprising a CH3 domain. Further, an antibody for use in the disclosure may lack at least a portion of a CH2 domain (e.g., all or part of a CH2 domain). As set forth above, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the heavy chain constant region may be modified such that they vary in amino acid sequence from the naturally occurring immunoglobulin molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The heavy chain constant region of an antibody disclosed herein may be derived from different immunoglobulin molecules. For example, a heavy chain constant region of a polypeptide may comprise a CH1 domain derived from an IgG<sub>1 </sub>molecule and a hinge region derived from an IgG<sub>3 </sub>molecule. In another example, a heavy chain constant region can comprise a hinge region derived, in part, from an IgG<sub>1 </sub>molecule and, in part, from an IgG<sub>3 </sub>molecule. In another example, a heavy chain portion can comprise a chimeric hinge derived, in part, from an IgG<sub>1 </sub>molecule and, in part, from an IgG<sub>4 </sub>molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">As used herein, the term “light chain constant region” includes amino acid sequences derived from antibody light chain. Preferably, the light chain constant region comprises at least one of a constant kappa domain or constant lambda domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">A “light chain-heavy chain pair” refers to the collection of a light chain and heavy chain that can form a dimer through a disulfide bond between the CL domain of the light chain and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">As previously indicated, the subunit structures and three dimensional configuration of the constant regions of the various immunoglobulin classes are well known. As used herein, the term “VH domain” includes the amino terminal variable domain of an immunoglobulin heavy chain and the term “CH1 domain” includes the first (most amino terminal) constant region domain of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. The CH1 domain is adjacent to the VH domain and is amino terminal to the hinge region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">As used herein the term “CH2 domain” includes the portion of a heavy chain molecule that extends, e.g., from about residue 244 to residue 360 of an antibody using conventional numbering schemes (residues 244 to 360, Kabat numbering system; and residues 231-340, EU numbering system; see Kabat et al., U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, “Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest” (1983). The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather, two N-linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG molecule. It is also well documented that the CH3 domain extends from the CH2 domain to the C-terminal of the IgG molecule and comprises approximately 108 residues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">As used herein, the term “hinge region” includes the portion of a heavy chain molecule that joins the CH1 domain to the CH2 domain. This hinge region comprises approximately 25 residues and is flexible, thus allowing the two N-terminal antigen-binding regions to move independently. Hinge regions can be subdivided into three distinct domains: upper, middle, and lower hinge domains (Roux et al., <i>J. Immunol </i>161:4083 (1998)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">As used herein the term “disulfide bond” includes the covalent bond formed between two sulfur atoms. The amino acid cysteine comprises a thiol group that can form a disulfide bond or bridge with a second thiol group. In most naturally occurring IgG molecules, the CH1 and CK regions are linked by a disulfide bond and the two heavy chains are linked by two disulfide bonds at positions corresponding to 239 and 242 using the Kabat numbering system (position 226 or 229, EU numbering system).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As used herein, the term “chimeric antibody” will be held to mean any antibody wherein the immunoreactive region or site is obtained or derived from a first species and the constant region (which may be intact, partial or modified in accordance with the instant disclosure) is obtained from a second species. In certain embodiments the target binding region or site will be from a non-human source (e.g. mouse or primate) and the constant region is human.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, “percent humanization” is calculated by determining the number of framework amino acid differences (i.e., non-CDR difference) between the humanized domain and the germline domain, subtracting that number from the total number of amino acids, and then dividing that by the total number of amino acids and multiplying by 100.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">By “specifically binds” or “has specificity to,” it is generally meant that an antibody binds to an epitope via its antigen-binding domain, and that the binding entails some complementarity between the antigen-binding domain and the epitope. According to this definition, an antibody is said to “specifically bind” to an epitope when it binds to that epitope, via its antigen-binding domain more readily than it would bind to a random, unrelated epitope. The term “specificity” is used herein to qualify the relative affinity by which a certain antibody binds to a certain epitope. For example, antibody “A” may be deemed to have a higher specificity for a given epitope than antibody “B,” or antibody “A” may be said to bind to epitope “C” with a higher specificity than it has for related epitope “D.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">As used herein, the terms “treat” or “treatment” refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the progression of cancer. Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. “Treatment” can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">By “subject” or “individual” or “animal” or “patient” or “mammal,” is meant any subject, particularly a mammalian subject, for whom diagnosis, prognosis, or therapy is desired. Mammalian subjects include humans, domestic animals, farm animals, and zoo, sport, or pet animals such as dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, mice, horses, cattle, cows, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">As used herein, phrases such as “to a patient in need of treatment” or “a subject in need of treatment” includes subjects, such as mammalian subjects, that would benefit from administration of an antibody or composition of the present disclosure used, e.g., for detection, for a diagnostic procedure and/or for treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">Anti-PD-L1 Antibodies</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The present disclosure provides anti-PD-L1 antibodies with high affinity to the human PD-L1 protein. The tested antibodies exhibited potent binding and inhibitory activities and are useful for therapeutic and diagnostics uses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The PD-L1 protein is a 40 kDa type 1 transmembrane protein. Its extracellular portion includes an N-terminal immunoglobulin V (IgV) domain (amino acids 19-127) and a C-terminal immunoglobulin C (IgC) domain (amino acids 133-225). PD-1 and PD-L1 interact through the conserved front and side of their IgV domains, as do the IgV domains of antibodies and T cell receptors. Not surprisingly, the current anti-PD-L1 antibodies all bind to the IgV domain which can disrupt the binding between PD-1 and PD-L1. It is therefore a surprising and unexpected finding of the present disclosure that antibodies, such as many disclosed herein, that bind to the IgC domain of the PD-L1 protein can still effectively, and perhaps even more so, inhibit PD-L1, leading to even further improved therapeutic effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">One embodiment of the present disclosure, therefore, provides an anti-PD-L1 antibody or fragment thereof, which antibody or fragment thereof can specifically bind to an immunoglobulin C (Ig C) domain of a human Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein. In some embodiments, the Ig C domain consists of amino acid residues 133-225.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof can bind to at least one of amino acid residues Y134, K162, or N183 of the PD-L1 protein. In some embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof can bind to at least two of amino acid residues Y134, K162, or N183 of the PD-L1 protein. In some embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof can bind to at least one of amino acid residues Y134, K162, and N183 of the PD-L1 protein. In some embodiments, the antibody or fragment thereof does not bind to an immunoglobulin V (Ig V) domain of the PD-L1 protein, wherein the Ig V domain consists of amino acid residues 19-127.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, provided is an antibody that includes the heavy chain and light chain variable domains with the CDR regions as defined in SEQ ID NO: 1-6.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">As demonstrated in the experimental examples, the antibodies that contained these CDR regions, whether mouse, humanized or chimeric, had potent PD-L1 binding and inhibitory activities. Further computer modeling indicated that certain residues within the CDR can be modified to retain or improve the property of the antibodies. Such residues are referred to as “hot spots” which are underlined in Table 1. In some embodiments, an anti-PD-L1 antibody of the present disclosure includes the VH and VL CDR as listed in Table 1, with one, two or three further modifications. Such modifications can be addition, deletion or substation of amino acids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the modification is substitution at no more than one hot spot position from each of the CDRs.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a nonessential amino acid residue in an immunoglobulin polypeptide is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. In another embodiment, a string of amino acids can be replaced with a structurally similar string that differs in order and/or composition of side chain family members.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Non-limiting examples of conservative amino acid substitutions are provided in the table below, where a similarity score of 0 or higher indicates conservative substitution between the two amino acids.</div>

A biological equivalent of a VH or VL is a sequence that includes the designated amino acids while having an overall 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% sequence identity. A biological equivalent of SEQ ID NO: 20, for instance, can be a VH that has an overall 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 20 but retains the CDRs (SEQ ID NO: 1-6 or their variants), and optionally retains one or more, or all of the back-mutations. In one embodiment, the VH has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20 and the VL has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 28.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">It will also be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that antibodies as disclosed herein may be modified such that they vary in amino acid sequence from the naturally occurring binding polypeptide from which they were derived. For example, a polypeptide or amino acid sequence derived from a designated protein may be similar, e.g., have a certain percent identity to the starting sequence, e.g., it may be 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% identical to the starting sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In certain embodiments, the antibody comprises an amino acid sequence or one or more moieties not normally associated with an antibody. Exemplary modifications are described in more detail below. For example, an antibody of the disclosure may comprise a flexible linker sequence, or may be modified to add a functional moiety (e.g., PEG, a drug, a toxin, or a label).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Antibodies, variants, or derivatives thereof of the disclosure include derivatives that are modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from binding to the epitope. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibodies can be modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the antibodies may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">In some embodiments, the antibodies may be conjugated to therapeutic agents, prodrugs, peptides, proteins, enzymes, viruses, lipids, biological response modifiers, pharmaceutical agents, or PEG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The antibodies may be conjugated or fused to a therapeutic agent, which may include detectable labels such as radioactive labels, an immunomodulator, a hormone, an enzyme, an oligonucleotide, a photoactive therapeutic or diagnostic agent, a cytotoxic agent, which may be a drug or a toxin, an ultrasound enhancing agent, a non-radioactive label, a combination thereof and other such agents known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The antibodies can be detectably labeled by coupling it to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemiluminescent-tagged antigen-binding polypeptide is then determined by detecting the presence of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of particularly useful chemiluminescent labeling compounds are luminol, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium salt and oxalate ester.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">The antibodies can also be detectably labeled using fluorescence emitting metals such as <sup>152</sup>Eu, or others of the lanthanide series. These metals can be attached to the antibody using such metal chelating groups as diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Techniques for conjugating various moieties to an antibody are well known, see, e.g., Arnon et al., “Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy”, in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint molecule and is also a tumor antigen. As a tumor antigen targeting molecule, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment specific to PD-L1 can be combined with a second antigen-binding fragment specific to an immune cell to generate a bispecific antibody.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, the immune cell is selected from the group consisting of a T cell, a B cell, a monocyte, a macrophage, a neutrophil, a dendritic cell, a phagocyte, a natural killer cell, an eosinophil, a basophil, and a mast cell. Molecules on the immune cell which can be targeted include, for example, CD3, CD16, CD19, CD28, and CD64. Other examples include PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3 (also known as CD223), CD28, CD122, 4-1BB (also known as CD137), TIM3, OX-40 or OX40L, CD40 or CD40L, LIGHT, ICOS/ICOSL, GITR/GITRL, TIGIT, CD27, VISTA, B7H3, B7H4, HEVM or BTLA (also known as CD272), killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), and CD47. Specific examples of bispecificity include, without limitation, PD-L1/PD-1, PD-L1/LAG3, PD-L1/TIGIT, and PD-L1/CD47.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">As an immune checkpoint inhibitor, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment specific to PD-L1 can be combined with a second antigen-binding fragment specific to a tumor antigen to generate a bispecific antibody. A “tumor antigen” is an antigenic substance produced in tumor cells, i.e., it triggers an immune response in the host. Tumor antigens are useful in identifying tumor cells and are potential candidates for use in cancer therapy. Normal proteins in the body are not antigenic. Certain proteins, however, are produced or overexpressed during tumorigenesis and thus appear “foreign” to the body. This may include normal proteins that are well sequestered from the immune system, proteins that are normally produced in extremely small quantities, proteins that are normally produced only in certain stages of development, or proteins whose structure is modified due to mutation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">An abundance of tumor antigens are known in the art and new tumor antigens can be readily identified by screening. Non-limiting examples of tumor antigens include EGFR, Her2, EpCAM, CD20, CD30, CD33, CD47, CD52, CD133, CD73, CEA, gpA33, Mucins, TAG-72, CIX, PSMA, folate-binding protein, GD2, GD3, GM2, VEGF, VEGFR, Integrin, αVβ3, α5β1, ERBB2, ERBB3, MET, IGF1R, EPHA3, TRAILR1, TRAILR2, RANKL, FAP and Tenascin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In some aspects, the monovalent unit has specificity to a protein that is overexpressed on a tumor cell as compared to a corresponding non-tumor cell. A “corresponding non-tumor cell” as used here, refers to a non-tumor cell that is of the same cell type as the origin of the tumor cell. It is noted that such proteins are not necessarily different from tumor antigens. Non-limiting examples include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is overexpressed in most colon, rectum, breast, lung, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract carcinomas; heregulin receptors (HER-2, neu or c-erbB-2), which is frequently overexpressed in breast, ovarian, colon, lung, prostate and cervical cancers; epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is highly expressed in a range of solid tumors including those of the breast, head and neck, non-small cell lung and prostate; asialoglycoprotein receptor; transferrin receptor; serpin enzyme complex receptor, which is expressed on hepatocytes; fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), which is overexpressed on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), for anti-angiogenesis gene therapy; folate receptor, which is selectively overexpressed in 90% of nonmucinous ovarian carcinomas; cell surface glycocalyx; carbohydrate receptors; and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, which is useful for gene delivery to respiratory epithelial cells and attractive for treatment of lung diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis. Non-limiting examples of bispecificity in this respect include PD-L1/EGFR, PD-L1/Her2, PD-L1/CD33, PD-L1/CD133, PD-L1/CEA and PD-L1/VEGF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Different format of bispecific antibodies are also provided. In some embodiments, each of the anti-PD-L1 fragment and the second fragment each is independently selected from a Fab fragment, a single-chain variable fragment (scFv), or a single-domain antibody. In some embodiments, the bispecific antibody further includes a Fc fragment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Bifunctional molecules that include not just antibody or antigen binding fragment are also provided. As a tumor antigen targeting molecule, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment specific to PD-L1, such as those described here, can be combined with an immune cytokine or ligand optionally through a peptide linker. The linked immune cytokines or ligands include, but not limited to, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, GM-CSF, TNF-α, CD40L, OX40L, CD27L, CD30L, 4-1BBL, LIGHT and GITRL. Such bi-functional molecules can combine the immune checkpoint blocking effect with tumor site local immune modulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">Polynucleotides Encoding the Antibodies and Methods of Preparing the Antibodies</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">The present disclosure also provides isolated polynucleotides or nucleic acid molecules (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 34-60, 112, and 114) encoding the antibodies, variants or derivatives thereof of the disclosure. The polynucleotides of the present disclosure may encode the entire heavy and light chain variable regions of the antigen-binding polypeptides, variants or derivatives thereof on the same polynucleotide molecule or on separate polynucleotide molecules. Additionally, the polynucleotides of the present disclosure may encode portions of the heavy and light chain variable regions of the antigen-binding polypeptides, variants or derivatives thereof on the same polynucleotide molecule or on separate polynucleotide molecules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Methods of making antibodies are well known in the art and described herein. In certain embodiments, both the variable and constant regions of the antigen-binding polypeptides of the present disclosure are fully human. Fully human antibodies can be made using techniques described in the art and as described herein. For example, fully human antibodies against a specific antigen can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal which has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge, but whose endogenous loci have been disabled. Exemplary techniques that can be used to make such antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,150,584; 6,458,592; 6,420,140 which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">In certain embodiments, the prepared antibodies will not elicit a deleterious immune response in the animal to be treated, e.g., in a human. In one embodiment, antigen-binding polypeptides, variants, or derivatives thereof of the disclosure are modified to reduce their immunogenicity using art-recognized techniques. For example, antibodies can be humanized, primatized, deimmunized, or chimeric antibodies can be made. These types of antibodies are derived from a non-human antibody, typically a murine or primate antibody, that retains or substantially retains the antigen-binding properties of the parent antibody, but which is less immunogenic in humans. This may be achieved by various methods, including (a) grafting the entire non-human variable domains onto human constant regions to generate chimeric antibodies; (b) grafting at least a part of one or more of the non-human complementarity determining regions (CDRs) into a human framework and constant regions with or without retention of critical framework residues; or (c) transplanting the entire non-human variable domains, but “cloaking” them with a human-like section by replacement of surface residues. Such methods are disclosed in Morrison et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>57:6851-6855 (1984); Morrison et al., <i>Adv. Immunol. </i>44:65-92 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., <i>Science </i>239:1534-1536 (1988); Padlan, <i>Molec. Immun. </i>25:489-498 (1991); Padlan, <i>Molec. Immun. </i>31:169-217 (1994), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089, 5,693,761, 5,693,762, and 6,190,370, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">De-immunization can also be used to decrease the immunogenicity of an antibody. As used herein, the term “de-immunization” includes alteration of an antibody to modify T-cell epitopes (see, e.g., International Application Publication Nos.: WO/9852976 A1 and WO/0034317 A2). For example, variable heavy chain and variable light chain sequences from the starting antibody are analyzed and a human T-cell epitope “map” from each V region showing the location of epitopes in relation to complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and other key residues within the sequence is created. Individual T-cell epitopes from the T-cell epitope map are analyzed in order to identify alternative amino acid substitutions with a low risk of altering activity of the final antibody. A range of alternative variable heavy and variable light sequences are designed comprising combinations of amino acid substitutions and these sequences are subsequently incorporated into a range of binding polypeptides. Typically, between 12 and 24 variant antibodies are generated and tested for binding and/or function. Complete heavy and light chain genes comprising modified variable and human constant regions are then cloned into expression vectors and the subsequent plasmids introduced into cell lines for the production of whole antibody. The antibodies are then compared in appropriate biochemical and biological assays, and the optimal variant is identified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">The binding specificity of antigen-binding polypeptides of the present disclosure can be determined by in vitro assays such as immunoprecipitation, radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single-chain units (U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,778; Bird, <i>Science </i>242:423-442 (1988); Huston et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>55:5879-5883 (1988); and Ward et al., <i>Nature </i>334:544-554 (1989)) can be adapted to produce single-chain units of the present disclosure. Single-chain units are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single-chain fusion peptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in <i>E. coli </i>may also be used (Skerra et al., <i>Science </i>242: 1038-1041 (1988)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single-chain Fvs (scFvs) and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,258,498; Huston et al., <i>Methods in Enzymology </i>203:46-88 (1991); Shu et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Sci. USA </i>90:1995-1999 (1993); and Skerra et al., <i>Science </i>240:1038-1040 (1988). For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See, e.g., Morrison, <i>Science </i>229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., <i>BioTechniques </i>4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., <i>J. Immunol. Methods </i>125:191-202 (1989); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules derived from a non-human species antibody that bind the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen-binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen-binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., <i>Nature </i>332:323 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.) Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, <i>Molecular Immunology </i>28(4/5):489-498 (1991); Studnicka et al., <i>Protein Engineering </i>7(6):805-814 (1994); Roguska. et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Sci. USA </i>91:969-973 (1994)), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98/46645, WO 98/50433, WO 98/24893, WO 98/16654, WO 96/34096, WO 96/33735, and WO 91/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring that express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a desired target polypeptide. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B-cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar <i>Int. Rev. Immunol. </i>73:65-93 (1995). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publications WO 98/24893; WO 96/34096; WO 96/33735; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,413,923; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825; 5,661,016; 5,545,806; 5,814,318; and 5,939,598, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and GenPharm (San Jose, Calif.) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can also be generated using a technique referred to as “guided selection.” In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. (Jespers et al., <i>Bio/Technology </i>72:899-903 (1988). See also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In another embodiment, DNA encoding desired monoclonal antibodies may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The isolated and subcloned hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells such as <i>E. coli </i>cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulins. More particularly, the isolated DNA (which may be synthetic as described herein) may be used to clone constant and variable region sequences for the manufacture antibodies as described in Newman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,570, filed Jan. 25, 1995, which is incorporated by reference herein. Essentially, this entails extraction of RNA from the selected cells, conversion to cDNA, and amplification by PCR using Ig specific primers. Suitable primers for this purpose are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,570. As will be discussed in more detail below, transformed cells expressing the desired antibody may be grown up in relatively large quantities to provide clinical and commercial supplies of the immunoglobulin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Additionally, using routine recombinant DNA techniques, one or more of the CDRs of the antigen-binding polypeptides of the present disclosure, may be inserted within framework regions, e.g., into human framework regions to humanize a non-human antibody. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, e.g., Chothia et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>278:457-479 (1998) for a listing of human framework regions). Preferably, the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds to at least one epitope of a desired polypeptide, e.g., LIGHT. Preferably, one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions, and, preferably, the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally, such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present disclosure and within the skill of the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">In addition, techniques developed for the production of “chimeric antibodies” (Morrison et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA: </i>851-855 (1984); Neuberger et al., <i>Nature </i>372:604-608 (1984); Takeda et al., <i>Nature </i>314:452-454 (1985)) by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule, of appropriate antigen specificity, together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. As used herein, a chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Yet another highly efficient means for generating recombinant antibodies is disclosed by Newman, <i>Biotechnology </i>10: 1455-1460 (1992). Specifically, this technique results in the generation of primatized antibodies that contain monkey variable domains and human constant sequences. This reference is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. Moreover, this technique is also described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,658,570, 5,693,780 and 5,756,096 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Alternatively, antibody-producing cell lines may be selected and cultured using techniques well known to the skilled artisan. Such techniques are described in a variety of laboratory manuals and primary publications. In this respect, techniques suitable for use in the disclosure as described below are described in <i>Current Protocols in Immunology</i>, Coligan et al., Eds., Green Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1991) which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, including supplements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Additionally, standard techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to introduce mutations in the nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the present disclosure, including, but not limited to, site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis which result in amino acid substitutions. Preferably, the variants (including derivatives) encode less than 50 amino acid substitutions, less than 40 amino acid substitutions, less than 30 amino acid substitutions, less than 25 amino acid substitutions, less than 20 amino acid substitutions, less than 15 amino acid substitutions, less than 10 amino acid substitutions, less than 5 amino acid substitutions, less than 4 amino acid substitutions, less than 3 amino acid substitutions, or less than 2 amino acid substitutions relative to the reference variable heavy chain region, CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3, variable light chain region, CDR-L1, CDR-L2, or CDR-L3. Alternatively, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of the coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">The antibodies of the disclosure can also be used to treat or inhibit cancer. PD-L1 can be overexpressed in tumor cells. Tumor-derived PD-L1 can bind to PD-1 on immune cells thereby limiting antitumor T-cell immunity. Results with small molecule inhibitors, or monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-L1 in murine tumor models, indicate that targeted PD-L1 therapy is an important alternative and realistic approach to effective control of tumor growth. As demonstrated in the experimental examples, the anti-PD-L1 antibodies activated the adaptive immune response machinery, which can lead to improved survival in cancer patients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Accordingly, in some embodiments, provided are methods for treating a cancer in a patient in need thereof. The method, in one embodiment, entails administering to the patient an effective amount of an antibody of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, at least one of the cancer cells (e.g., stromal cells) in the patient expresses, over-express, or is induced to express PD-L1. Induction of PD-L1 expression, for instance, can be done by administration of a tumor vaccine or radiotherapy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Tumors that express the PD-L1 protein include those of bladder cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cancer, breast cancer, urethral cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, squamous cell cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal cancer, stomach cancer, oesophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, and small cell lung cancer. Accordingly, the presently disclosed antibodies can be used for treating any one or more such cancers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Cellular therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, are also provided in the present disclosure. A suitable cell can be used, that is put in contact with an anti-PD-L1 antibody of the present disclosure (or alternatively engineered to express an anti-PD-L1 antibody of the present disclosure). Upon such contact or engineering, the cell can then be introduced to a cancer patient in need of a treatment. The cancer patient may have a cancer of any of the types as disclosed herein. The cell (e.g., T cell) can be, for instance, a tumor-infiltrating T lymphocyte, a CD4+ T cell, a CD8+ T cell, or the combination thereof, without limitation.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0228">The anti-PD-L1 antibodies of the present disclosure can be used, in some embodiments, together with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Immune checkpoints are molecules in the immune system that either turn up a signal (co-stimulatory molecules) or turn down a signal (co-inhibitory molecules). Many cancers protect themselves from the immune system by inhibiting the T cell signal through agonist for co-inhibitory molecules or antagonist for co-stimulatory molecules. An immune checkpoint agonist or antagonist can help stop such a protective mechanism by the cell cells. An immune checkpoint agonist or antagonist may target any one or more of the following checkpoint molecules, PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3 (also known as CD223), CD28, CD122, 4-1BB (also known as CD137), TIM3, OX-40/OX40L, CD40/CD40L, LIGHT, ICOS/ICOSL, GITR/GITRL, TIGIT, CD27, VISTA, B7H3, B7H4, HEVM or BTLA (also known as CD272).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0229">Programmed T cell death 1 (PD-1) is a trans-membrane protein found on the surface of T cells, which, when bound to programmed T cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells, results in suppression of T cell activity and reduction of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Thus, PD-1 and PD-L1 are immune down-regulators or immune checkpoint “off switches”. Example PD-1 inhibitor include, without limitation, nivolumab, (Opdivo) (BMS-936558), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), pidilizumab, AMP-224, MEDI0680 (AMP-514), PDR001, MPDL3280A, MEDI4736, BMS-936559 and MSB0010718C.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236">As demonstrated in the experimental examples, the antibodies of the present disclosure can activate immune response which can then be useful for treating infections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0237">Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce. An infection can be caused by infectious agents such as viruses, viroids, prions, bacteria, nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths. In one aspect, the infectious agent is a bacterium, such as Gram negative bacterium. In one aspect, the infectious agent is virus, such as DNA viruses, RNA viruses, and reverse transcribing viruses. Non-limiting examples of viruses include Adenovirus, Coxsackievirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Herpes simplex virus, type 1, Herpes simplex virus, type 2, Cytomegalovirus, Human herpesvirus, type 8, HIV, Influenza virus, Measles virus, Mumps virus, Human papillomavirus, Parainfluenza virus, Poliovirus, Rabies virus, Respiratory syncytial virus, Rubella virus, Varicella-zoster virus.</div>

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0240">A specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the particular antibodies, variant or derivative thereof used, the patient's age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet, and the time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the severity of the particular disease being treated. Judgment of such factors by medical caregivers is within the ordinary skill in the art. The amount will also depend on the individual patient to be treated, the route of administration, the type of formulation, the characteristics of the compound used, the severity of the disease, and the desired effect. The amount used can be determined by pharmacological and pharmacokinetic principles well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0241">Methods of administration of the antibodies, variants or include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The antigen-binding polypeptides or compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Thus, pharmaceutical compositions containing the antigen-binding polypeptides of the disclosure may be administered orally, rectally, parenterally, intracistemally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, drops or transdermal patch), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0242">The term “parenteral” as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intra-articular injection and infusion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, it may be desirable to introduce the antibodies of the disclosure into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">It may be desirable to administer the antibodies polypeptides or compositions of the disclosure locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction, with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a protein, including an antibody, of the disclosure, care must be taken to use materials to which the protein does not absorb.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">In another embodiment, the antibodies or composition can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, 1990<i>, Science </i>249:1527-1533; Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">In yet another embodiment, the antigen-binding polypeptide or composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Sefton, 1987<i>, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. </i>14:201; Buchwald et al., 1980<i>, Surgery </i>88:507; Saudek et al., 1989<i>, N. Engl. J. Med. </i>321:574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J., 1983<i>, Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol.

In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990, Science 249:1527-1533).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">In a specific embodiment where the composition of the disclosure comprises a nucleic acid or polynucleotide encoding a protein, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded protein, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see, e.g., Joliot et al., 1991<i>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>88:1864-1868), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">The amount of the antibodies of the disclosure which will be effective in the treatment, inhibition and prevention of an inflammatory, immune or malignant disease, disorder or condition can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease, disorder or condition, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">As a general proposition, the dosage administered to a patient of the antigen-binding polypeptides of the present disclosure is typically 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of the patient's body weight, between 0.1 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg of the patient's body weight, or 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the disclosure may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the brain) of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">The methods for treating an infectious or malignant disease, condition or disorder comprising administration of an antibody, variant, or derivative thereof of the disclosure are typically tested in vitro, and then in vivo in an acceptable animal model, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. Suitable animal models, including transgenic animals, are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, in vitro assays to demonstrate the therapeutic utility of antigen-binding polypeptide described herein include the effect of an antigen-binding polypeptide on a cell line or a patient tissue sample. The effect of the antigen-binding polypeptide on the cell line and/or tissue sample can be determined utilizing techniques known to those of skill in the art, such as the assays disclosed elsewhere herein. In accordance with the disclosure, in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific antigen-binding polypeptide is indicated, include in vitro cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise administered a compound, and the effect of such compound upon the tissue sample is observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer an antibody of the disclosure or a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the disclosure, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the compound, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, 1987, <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>262:4429-4432), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">Diagnostic Methods</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">Over-expression of PD-L1 is observed in certain tumor samples, and patients having PD-L1-over-expressing cells are likely responsive to treatments with the anti-PD-L1 antibodies of the present disclosure. Accordingly, the antibodies of the present disclosure can also be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">A sample that preferably includes a cell can be obtained from a patient, which can be a cancer patient or a patient desiring diagnosis. The cell be a cell of a tumor tissue or a tumor block, a blood sample, a urine sample or any sample from the patient. Upon optional pre-treatment of the sample, the sample can be incubated with an antibody of the present disclosure under conditions allowing the antibody to interact with a PD-L1 protein potentially present in the sample. Methods such as ELISA can be used, taking advantage of the anti-PD-L1 antibody, to detect the presence of the PD-L1 protein in the sample.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">Presence of the PD-L1 protein in the sample (optionally with the amount or concentration) can be used for diagnosis of cancer, as an indication that the patient is suitable for a treatment with the antibody, or as an indication that the patient has (or has not) responded to a cancer treatment. For a prognostic method, the detection can be done at once, twice or more, at certain stages, upon initiation of a cancer treatment to indicate the progress of the treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">Compositions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">The present disclosure also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise an effective amount of an antibody, and an acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the composition further includes a second anticancer agent (e.g., an immune checkpoint inhibitor).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">In a specific embodiment, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. Further, a “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” will generally be a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">The term “carrier” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents such as acetates, citrates or phosphates. Antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfate; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose are also envisioned. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin, incorporated herein by reference. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the antigen-binding polypeptide, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration. The parental preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">In an embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">The compounds of the disclosure can be formulated as neutral or salt forms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">Antigen: human PDL1-Fc protein and human PD-L1 highly expressed CHOK1 cell line (PDL1-CHOK1 cell line).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">Immunization: To generate mouse monoclonal antibodies to human PD-L1, 6-8 week female BALB/c mice were firstly immunized with 1.5×10<sup>7 </sup>PDL1-CHOK1 cells. Day 14 and 33 post first immunization, the immunized mice were re-immunized with 1.5×10<sup>7 </sup>PDL1-CHOK1 cells respectively. To select mice producing antibodies that bond PD-L1 protein, sera from immunized mice were tested by ELISA. Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with human PD-L1 protein at 1 μg/ml in PBS, 100 μl/well at room temperature (RT) overnight, then blocked with 100 μl/well of 5% BSA. Dilutions of plasma from immunized mice were added to each well and incubated for 1-2 hours at RT. The plates were washed with PBS/Tween and then incubate with anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) for 1 hour at RT. After washing, the plates were developed with ABTS substrate and analyzed by spectrophotometer at OD 405 nm. Mice with sufficient titers of anti-PDL1 IgG were boosted with 50 ug human PDL1-Fc protein at Day 54 post-immunization. The resulting mice were used for fusions. The hybridoma supernatants were tested for anti-PD-L1 IgGs by ELISA.</div>

<heading id="h-0023">Example 6: Humanization of the HL1210-3 Mouse mAb</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0272">The mAb HL1210-3 variable region genes were employed to create a humanized MAb. In the first step of this process, the amino acid sequences of the VH and VK of MAb HL1210-3 were compared against the available database of human Ig gene sequences to find the overall best-matching human germline Ig gene sequences. For the light chain, the closest human match was the O18/Jk2 and KV1-39*01/KJ2*04 gene, and for the heavy chain the closest human match was the VH3-21 gene. VH3-11, VH3-23, VH3-7*01 and VH3-48 genes were also selected due to their close matches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0273">Humanized variable domain sequences were then designed where the CDR1 (SEQ ID NO.4), 2 (SEQ ID NO.5) and 3 (SEQ ID NO.6) of the HL1210-3 light chain were grafted onto framework sequences of the O18/Jk2 and KV1-39*01/KJ2*04 gene, and the CDR1 (SEQ ID NO.1), 2 (SEQ ID NO.2), and 3 (SEQ ID NO.3) sequences of the HL1210-3 VH were grafted onto framework sequences of the VH3-21, VH3-11, VH3-23, VH3-48 or VH3-7*01 gene. A 3D model was then generated to determine if there were any framework positions where replacing the mouse amino acid to the human amino acid could affect binding and/or CDR conformation. In the case of the light chain, 22S, 43S, 60D, 63T and 42Q (Kabat numbering, see Table 7) in framework were identified. In the case of the heavy chain, 1E, 37V, 40T, 44S, 49A, 77N, 91I, 94R and 108T in the framework was involved in back-mutations.</div>

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0283">The binding of the humanized antibodies to recombinant PD-L1 protein (human PD-L1-his taq) was tested by BIACORE™ using a capture method. The HL1210-3 mouse mAb were captured using anti-mouse Fc antibody coated on a CM5 chip. A series dilution of human PD-L1-his taq protein was injected over captured antibody for 3 mins at a flow rate of 25 μg/ml. The antigen was allowed to dissociate for 900 s. All the experiment were carried out on a Biacore T200. Data analysis was carried out using Biacore T200 evaluation software and is shown in Table 11 below.</div>

Receptor Blocking Assay by Using Recombinant Human PD-L1
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0291">There are two receptors i.e. PD-1 and B7-1 for human PD-L1. To explore the blocking property of humanized PD-L1 antibody to these two proteins, the protein based receptor blocking assay was employed here. Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with human PD-L1-Fc protein at 1 μg/ml in PBS, 100 μl/well at 4° C. overnight, then blocked with 200 μl/well of 5% BSA at 37° C. for 2 hr. 50 μl biotin-labeled human PD-1-Fc or B7-1vprotein and 5-fold dilutions of PD-L1 antibodies starting from 100 nM at 50 μl were added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. The plates were washed with PBS/Tween and then incubate with Streptavidin-HRP for 1 hour at 37° C. After washing, the plates were developed with TMB substrate and analyzed by spectrophotometer at OD 450 nm. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, Hu1210-41 can efficiently inhibit the binding of human PD-L1 to human PD1 and B7-1.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0292">To evaluate the in vitro function of humanized antibodies, the response of human T cells assessed in a mixed lymphocyte reaction setting. Human DCs were differentiated from CD14+ monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 for 7 days. CD4+ T cells isolated from another donor were then co-cultured with the DCs and serial dilutions of anti-PD-L1 blocking antibody. At day 5 post-inoculation, the culture supernatant was assayed for IL-2 and IFNγ production. The results indicated that the Hu1210-8, Hu1210-9, Hu1210-16 and Hu1210-17 antibodies can dose-dependently promote IL-2 and IFNγ production, suggesting anti-PD-L1 antibodies can promote human T cell response.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0295" num="0294">Cells from the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line HCC827 will be grafted into NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. NSG mice are NOD scid gamma deficient and the most immunodeficient mice making them ideal recipients for human tumor cell and PBMC grafting. 10 days post-graft, human PBMCs will be transplanted into the tumor-bearing mice. Approximately 20 days post-graft, once the tumor volume has reached 100-150 mm<sup>3</sup>, PD-L1 antibody will be administered to the mice every other day at 5 mg/kg. Tumor volume will be monitored every other day in conjunction with antibody administration. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, Hu1210-31 can inhibit the tumor growth by 30% at 5 mg/kg. Hu1210-41 antibody can dose-dependently inhibit the tumor growth, while the tumor weight was also dose-dependently suppressed by Hu1210-41 antibody (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>).</div>

<heading id="h-0034">Example 12: Identification of PD-L1 Epitope</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0298" num="0297">This study was conducted to identify amino acid residues involved in the binding of PD-L1 to the antibodies of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0299" num="0298">An alanine-scan library of PD-L1 was constructed. Briefly, 217 mutant clones of PD-L1 were generated on Integral Molecular's protein engineering platform. Binding of Hu1210-41 Fab to each variant in the PD-L1 mutation library was determined, in duplicate, by high-throughput flow cytometry. Each raw data point had background fluorescence subtracted and was normalized to reactivity with PD-L1 wild-type (WT). For each PD-L1 variant, the mean binding value was plotted as a function of expression (control anti-PD-L1 mAb reactivity). To identify preliminary critical clones (circles with crosses), thresholds (dashed lines) of &gt;70% WT binding to control MAb and &lt;30% WT reactivity to Hu1210-41 Fab were applied (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). Y134, K162, and N183 of PDL1 were identified as required residues for Hu1210-41 binding. The low reactivity of N183A clone with Hu1210-41 Fab suggests that it is the major energetic contributor to Hu1210-41 binding, with lesser contributions by Y134 and K162.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0300" num="0299">The critical residues (spheres) were identified on a 3D PD-L1 structure (PDB ID#5JDR, Zhang et al., 2017), illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. These residues, Y134, K162, and N183, therefore, constitute an epitope of PD-L1 responsible for binding to antibodies of various embodiments of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0301" num="0300">It is interesting to note that Y134, K162, and N183 are all located within the IgC domain of the PD-L1 protein. Both PD-1 and PD-L1's extracellular portions have an IgV domain and an IgC domain. It is commonly known that PD-L1 binds to PD-1 through bindings between their IgV domains. Unlike such conventional antibodies, however, Hu1210-41 binds to the IgC domain, which would have been expected to be ineffective in inhibiting PD-1/PD-L1 binding. This different epitope of Hu1210-41, surprisingly, likely contributes to the excellent activities of Hu1210-41.</div>
