<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">According to another example embodiment of the present disclosure, if a user command is a volume decrease command, the processor <b>140</b> may determine whether a current volume value of the external audio output device <b>200</b> is a preset volume value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Here, the processor <b>140</b> may determine whether the current volume value of the external audio output device <b>200</b> is the preset volume value, by updating current volume value information of the external audio output device <b>200</b>. Therefore, the processor <b>140</b> may periodically receive volume value information of the external audio output device <b>200</b>. The processor <b>140</b> may receive the volume value information of the external audio output device <b>200</b> whenever the processor <b>140</b> transmits a control signal to the external audio output device <b>200</b>. However, the present disclosure is not limited to this method, and thus volume value information of the external audio output device <b>200</b> may be received at preset time intervals or after a volume decrease command of a user is input.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">If the current volume value of the external audio output device <b>200</b> is higher than the preset volume value, the processor <b>140</b> may determine the external audio output device <b>200</b> as the device of which the volume value is to be changed according to the user command.

Here, the processor <b>140</b> may control the user terminal device <b>100</b> to decrease a volume value of the user terminal device <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">According to another example embodiment, as described above, the memory <b>130</b> may store current volume value information of the user terminal device <b>100</b> and current volume value information of the external audio output device <b>200</b> in a point of time when the user terminal device <b>100</b> is connected to the external audio output device <b>200</b>.
