<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The illustrative embodiments of the invention relate generally to a disc pump system for pumping fluid and, more specifically, to a disc pump system having two or more pumps that are fluidly coupled by a known restriction. The illustrative embodiments relate to a disc pump system that measures the pressure at each end of the known restriction to determine the flow rate of fluid pumped by the disc pump system.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The generation of high amplitude pressure oscillations in closed cavities has received significant attention in the fields of thermo-acoustics and disc pump type compressors. Recent developments in non-linear acoustics have allowed the generation of pressure waves with higher amplitudes than previously thought possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known to use acoustic resonance to achieve fluid pumping from defined inlets and outlets. This can be achieved using a cylindrical cavity with an acoustic driver at one end, which drives an acoustic standing wave. In such a cylindrical cavity, the acoustic pressure wave has limited amplitude. Varying cross-section cavities, such as cone, horn-cone, and bulb shapes have been used to achieve high amplitude pressure oscillations, thereby significantly increasing the pumping effect. In such high amplitude waves, the non-linear mechanisms with energy dissipation have been suppressed. However, high amplitude acoustic resonance has not been employed within disc-shaped cavities in which radial pressure oscillations are excited until recently. International Patent Application No. PCT/GB2006/001487, published as WO 2006/111775, discloses a disc pump having a substantially disc-shaped cavity with a high aspect ratio, i.e., the ratio of the radius of the cavity to the height of the cavity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Such a disc pump has a substantially cylindrical cavity comprising a side wall closed at each end by end walls. The disc pump also comprises an actuator that drives either one of the end walls to oscillate in a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the driven end wall. The spatial profile of the motion of the driven end wall is described as being matched to the spatial profile of the fluid pressure oscillations within the cavity, a state described herein as mode-matching. When the disc pump is mode-matched, work done by the actuator on the fluid in the cavity adds constructively across the driven end wall surface, thereby enhancing the amplitude of the pressure oscillation in the cavity and delivering high disc pump efficiency. The efficiency of a mode-matched disc pump is dependent upon the interface between the driven end wall and the side wall. It is desirable to maintain the efficiency of such a disc pump by structuring the interface to not decrease or dampen the motion of the driven end wall, thereby mitigating any reduction in the amplitude of the fluid pressure oscillations within the cavity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The actuator of the disc pump described above causes an oscillatory motion of the driven end wall (“displacement oscillations”) in a direction substantially perpendicular to the end wall or substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical cavity, referred to hereinafter as “axial oscillations” of the driven end wall within the cavity. The axial oscillations of the driven end wall generate substantially proportional “pressure oscillations” of fluid within the cavity creating a radial pressure distribution approximating that of a Bessel function of the first kind as described in International Patent Application No. PCT/GB2006/001487, which is incorporated by reference herein. Such oscillations are referred to hereinafter as “radial oscillations” of the fluid pressure within the cavity. A portion of the driven end wall between the actuator and the side wall provides an interface with the side wall of the disc pump that decreases dampening of the displacement oscillations to mitigate any reduction of the pressure oscillations within the cavity. The portion of the driven end wall that provides such an interface is referred to hereinafter as an “isolator” as described more specifically in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/477,594, which is incorporated by reference herein. The illustrative embodiments of the isolator are operatively associated with the peripheral portion of the driven end wall to reduce dampening of the displacement oscillations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Such disc pumps also have one or more valves for controlling the flow of fluid through the disc pump and, more specifically, valves being capable of operating at high frequencies. Conventional valves typically operate at lower frequencies below 500 Hz for a variety of applications. For example, many conventional compressors typically operate at 50 or 60 Hz. Linear resonance compressors that are known in the art operate between 150 and 350 Hz. Yet many portable electronic devices, including medical devices, require disc pumps for delivering a positive pressure or providing a vacuum. The disc pumps are relatively small in size, and it is advantageous for such disc pumps to be inaudible in operation to provide discrete operation. To achieve these objectives, such disc pumps must operate at very high frequencies requiring valves capable of operating at about 20 kHz and higher. To operate at these high frequencies, the valve must be responsive to a high frequency oscillating pressure that can be rectified to create a net flow of fluid through the disc pump. Such a valve is described more specifically in International Patent Application No. PCT/GB2009/050614, which is incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Valves may be disposed in either a first or second aperture, or both apertures, for controlling the flow of fluid through the disc pump. Each valve comprises a first plate having apertures extending generally perpendicular therethrough and a second plate also having apertures extending generally perpendicular therethrough, wherein the apertures of the second plate are substantially offset from the apertures of the first plate. The valve further comprises a sidewall disposed between the first and second plate, wherein the sidewall is closed around the perimeter of the first and second plates to form a cavity between the first and second plates in fluid communication with the apertures of the first and second plates. The valve further comprises a flap disposed and moveable between the first and second plates, wherein the flap has apertures substantially offset from the apertures of the first plate and substantially aligned with the apertures of the second plate. The flap is motivated between the first and second plates in response to a change in direction of the differential pressure of the fluid across the valve.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In the following detailed description of several illustrative embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof. By way of illustration, the accompanying drawings show specific preferred embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical structural, mechanical, electrical, and chemical changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. To avoid detail not necessary to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments described herein, the description may omit certain information known to those skilled in the art. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the illustrative embodiments are defined only by the appended claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a disc pump system <b>100</b> having a plurality of disc pumps. The plurality of disc pumps includes at least a first disc pump <b>10</b> and a second disc pump <b>80</b> that are operable to supply a positive or negative pressure to the load <b>38</b> to pressurize or depressurize a load <b>38</b>, respectively. In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the disc pumps are mounted to a common substrate <b>28</b>, such as a printed circuit board. In turn, the substrate <b>28</b> is mounted to a manifold <b>52</b> that fluidly couples the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> to a load <b>38</b> via an aperture <b>17</b>. The disc pump <b>10</b> is fluidly coupled to the aperture <b>17</b>, while the disc pump <b>80</b> is fluidly coupled to the aperture <b>17</b> via a passage, such as a restriction <b>50</b>, between the manifold <b>52</b> and the substrate <b>28</b>. The restriction <b>50</b> may be a conduit, fluid path, or similar feature that has known dimensions and accommodates fluid flow between the disc pump <b>80</b> and the aperture <b>17</b>. As such, the restriction <b>50</b> is a known restriction. In an embodiment, the restriction <b>50</b> is a cylindrical chamber of known dimensions. The cylindrical chamber may be adapted to follow a circuitous path, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, to lengthen the pathway of the restriction <b>50</b> and accommodate size limitations that might apply to the disc pump system <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Each of the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> includes a sensor <b>238</b> to measure the pressure associated with each of the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> at each end of the restriction <b>50</b>. The difference between the pressures measured at each of the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> is indicative of the pressure differential, or pressure drop, across the restriction. The pressure differential across the restriction <b>50</b> may be measured to determine the airflow to or from the load <b>38</b> through the aperture <b>17</b>. Being able to determine the airflow through the aperture <b>17</b> facilitates control of the fluid dynamic characteristics for pressurizing or depressurizing the load <b>38</b> as the magnitude of the pressure increases or decreases at the load <b>38</b>. This flow measurement data can be used to detect or locate a leak at the load <b>38</b> and to collect usage data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> may each be designed for predetermined performance characteristics to pressurize or depressurize the load <b>38</b>. For example, the second disc pump <b>80</b> may be designed to deliver a higher airflow to the aperture <b>17</b> through the restriction <b>50</b> when the load <b>38</b> is at ambient pressure, while the first disc pump <b>10</b> may be designed to deliver a higher pressure differential but comparatively less airflow to the load <b>38</b>. Thus, the two disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> may function as a system to optimize the fluid dynamic characteristics for pressurizing or depressurizing the load <b>38</b>. The functionality of the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> may also be reversed depending on the desired performance characteristics. That said, it is necessary to further describe the operation of the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b>, which are substantially similar except for certain features of the valves that control the operational characteristics of the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b>. Thus, the disc pump <b>10</b> is described in detail to point out the valve features that can be varied to achieve different flow and pressure characteristics for either one of the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">For the purposes of describing the functionality of features of the disc pump <b>10</b> that are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-12</figref>, the second disc pump <b>80</b> is considered to be in an off state so that the only airflow supplied to or from the load <b>38</b> is provided by the disc pump <b>10</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the disc pump <b>10</b> comprises a disc pump body having a substantially elliptical shape including a cylindrical wall <b>11</b> closed at each end by end plates <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>. The cylindrical wall <b>11</b> may be mounted to a substrate <b>28</b>, which forms the end plate <b>13</b>. The substrate <b>28</b> may be a printed circuit board or another suitable material. The disc pump <b>10</b> further comprises a pair of disc-shaped interior plates <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> supported within the disc pump <b>10</b> by an isolator <b>30</b> having a ring-shape and affixed to the cylindrical wall <b>11</b>. The internal surfaces of the cylindrical wall <b>11</b>, the end plate <b>12</b>, the interior plate <b>14</b>, and the isolator <b>30</b> form a cavity <b>16</b> within the disc pump <b>10</b>. The internal surfaces of the cavity <b>16</b> comprise a side wall <b>18</b> which is a first portion of the inside surface of the cylindrical wall <b>11</b> that is closed at both ends by end walls <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> wherein the end wall <b>20</b> is the internal surface of the end plate <b>12</b> and the end wall <b>22</b> comprises the internal surface of the interior plate <b>14</b> and a first side of the isolator <b>30</b>. The end wall <b>22</b> thus comprises a central portion corresponding to the inside surface of the interior plate <b>14</b> and a peripheral portion corresponding to the inside surface of the isolator <b>30</b>. Although the disc pump <b>10</b> and its components are substantially elliptical in shape, the specific embodiment disclosed herein is a circular, elliptical shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The cylindrical wall <b>11</b> and the end plates <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> may be a single component comprising the disc pump body or separate components. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the end plate <b>13</b> is formed by the substrate <b>28</b> that may be a printed circuit board, an assembly board, or printed wire assembly (PWA) on which the disc pump <b>10</b> is mounted. Although the cavity <b>16</b> is substantially circular in shape, the cavity <b>16</b> may also be more generally elliptical in shape. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the end wall <b>20</b> defining the cavity <b>16</b> is shown as being generally frusto-conical. In another embodiment, the end wall <b>20</b> defining the inside surfaces of the cavity <b>16</b> may include a generally planar surface that is parallel to the actuator <b>40</b>, discussed below. A disc pump comprising frusto-conical surfaces is described in more detail in the WO2006/111775 publication, which is incorporated by reference herein. The end plates <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and cylindrical wall <b>11</b> of the disc pump body may be formed from any suitable rigid material including, without limitation, metal, ceramic, glass, or plastic including, without limitation, inject-molded plastic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The interior plates <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the disc pump <b>10</b> together form an actuator <b>40</b> that is operatively associated with the central portion of the end wall <b>22</b>, which forms the internal surfaces of the cavity <b>16</b>. One of the interior plates <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> must be formed of a piezoelectric material that may include any electrically active material that exhibits strain in response to an applied electrical signal, such as, for example, an electrostrictive or magnetostrictive material. In one preferred embodiment, for example, the interior plate <b>15</b> is formed of piezoelectric material that exhibits strain in response to an applied electrical signal, i.e., the active interior plate. The other one of the interior plates <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> preferably possesses a bending stiffness similar to the active interior plate and may be formed of a piezoelectric material or an electrically inactive material, such as a metal or ceramic. In this embodiment, the interior plate <b>14</b> possesses a bending stiffness similar to the active interior plate <b>15</b> and is formed of an electrically inactive material, such as a metal or ceramic, i.e., the inert interior plate. When the active interior plate <b>15</b> is excited by an electrical current, the active interior plate <b>15</b> expands and contracts in a radial direction relative to the longitudinal axis of the cavity <b>16</b>, causing the interior plates <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> to bend, thereby inducing an axial deflection of the end walls <b>22</b> in a direction substantially perpendicular to the end walls <b>22</b> (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In other embodiments that are not shown, the isolator <b>30</b> may support either one of the interior plates <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, whether the active interior plate <b>15</b> or inert interior plate <b>14</b>, from the top or the bottom surfaces depending on the specific design and orientation of the disc pump <b>10</b>. In another embodiment, the actuator <b>40</b> may be replaced by a device in a force-transmitting relation with only one of the interior plates <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> such as, for example, a mechanical, magnetic or electrostatic device, wherein the selected interior plate <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> may be formed as an electrically inactive or passive layer of material driven into oscillation in the manner described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The disc pump <b>10</b> further comprises at least one aperture extending from the cavity <b>16</b> to the outside of the disc pump <b>10</b>, wherein the at least one aperture contains a valve to control the flow of fluid through the aperture. The aperture may be located at any position in the cavity <b>16</b> where the actuator <b>40</b> generates a pressure differential. The embodiment of the disc pump <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref> comprises an aperture <b>27</b> located at approximately the center of and extending through the end plate <b>12</b>. The aperture <b>27</b> contains at least one end valve <b>29</b> that regulates the flow of fluid in one direction, as indicated by the arrows, so that end valve <b>29</b> functions as an outlet valve for the disc pump <b>10</b>.</div>

Although the term “vacuum” and “negative pressure” may be used to describe the reduced pressure, the actual pressure reduction may be significantly less than the pressure reduction normally associated with a complete vacuum.

The displacement as shown in this figure and the other figures is exaggerated. Because the actuator <b>40</b> is suspended by the isolator <b>30</b> and not rigidly mounted, the actuator <b>40</b> is free to oscillate about its center of mass in its fundamental mode. In this fundamental mode, the amplitude of the displacement oscillations of the actuator <b>40</b> is substantially zero at an annular displacement node <b>42</b> located between the center of the driven end wall <b>22</b> and the side wall <b>18</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows one possible pressure oscillation profile illustrating the pressure oscillation within the cavity <b>16</b> resulting from the axial displacement oscillations shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The solid curved line and arrows represent the pressure at one point in time. In this mode and higher-order modes, the amplitude of the pressure oscillations has a peripheral pressure anti-node <b>45</b>′ near the side wall <b>18</b> of the cavity <b>16</b>. The amplitude of the pressure oscillations is substantially zero at the annular pressure node <b>44</b> between the central pressure anti-node <b>45</b> and the peripheral pressure anti-node <b>45</b>′. At the same time, the amplitude of the pressure oscillations as represented by the dashed line has a negative central pressure anti-node <b>47</b> near the center of the cavity <b>16</b> with a peripheral pressure anti-node <b>47</b>′ and the same annular pressure node <b>44</b>. For a cylindrical cavity, the radial dependence of the amplitude of the pressure oscillations in the cavity <b>16</b> may be approximated by a Bessel function of the first kind. The pressure oscillations described above result from the radial movement of the fluid in the cavity <b>16</b> and so will be referred to as the “radial pressure oscillations” of the fluid within the cavity <b>16</b> as distinguished from the axial displacement oscillations of the actuator <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">With further reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, it can be seen that the radial dependence of the amplitude of the axial displacement oscillations of the actuator <b>40</b> (the “mode-shape” of the actuator <b>40</b>) should approximate a Bessel function of the first kind so as to match more closely the radial dependence of the amplitude of the desired pressure oscillations in the cavity <b>16</b> (the “mode-shape” of the pressure oscillation). By not rigidly mounting the actuator <b>40</b> at its perimeter and allowing the actuator <b>40</b> to vibrate more freely about its center of mass, the mode-shape of the displacement oscillations substantially matches the mode-shape of the pressure oscillations in the cavity <b>16</b>, thus achieving mode-shape matching or, more simply, mode-matching. Although the mode-matching may not always be perfect in this respect, the axial displacement oscillations of the actuator <b>40</b> and the corresponding pressure oscillations in the cavity <b>16</b> have substantially the same relative phase across the full surface of the actuator <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, the radial position of the annular pressure node <b>44</b> of the pressure oscillations in the cavity <b>16</b> and the radial position of the annular displacement node <b>42</b> of the axial displacement oscillations of actuator <b>40</b> are substantially coincident.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">As the actuator <b>40</b> vibrates about its center of mass, the radial position of the annular displacement node <b>42</b> will necessarily lie inside the radius of the actuator <b>40</b> when the actuator <b>40</b> vibrates in its fundamental bending mode as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Thus, to ensure that the annular displacement node <b>42</b> is coincident with the annular pressure node <b>44</b>, the radius of the actuator (r<sub>act</sub>) should preferably be greater than the radius of the annular pressure node <b>44</b> to optimize mode-matching. Assuming again that the pressure oscillation in the cavity <b>16</b> approximates a Bessel function of the first kind, the radius of the annular pressure node <b>44</b> would be approximately 0.63 of the radius from the center of the end wall <b>22</b> to the side wall <b>18</b>, i.e., the radius of the cavity <b>16</b> (“r”), as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Therefore, the radius of the actuator <b>40</b> (r<sub>act</sub>) should preferably satisfy the following inequality: r<sub>act</sub>≥0.63r.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The isolator <b>30</b> may be a flexible membrane that enables the edge of the actuator <b>40</b> to move more freely, as described above, by bending and stretching in response to the vibration of the actuator <b>40</b> as shown by the displacement at the peripheral displacement anti-node <b>43</b>′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The isolator <b>30</b> mitigates the potential dampening effects of the side wall <b>18</b> on the actuator <b>40</b> by providing a low mechanical impedance support between the actuator <b>40</b> and the cylindrical wall <b>11</b> of the disc pump <b>10</b>, thereby reducing the dampening of the axial oscillations at the peripheral displacement anti-node <b>43</b>′ of the actuator <b>40</b>. Essentially, the isolator <b>30</b> minimizes the energy being transferred from the actuator <b>40</b> to the side wall <b>18</b> with the outer peripheral edge of the isolator <b>30</b> remaining substantially stationary. Consequently, the annular displacement node <b>42</b> will remain substantially aligned with the annular pressure node <b>44</b> so as to maintain the mode-matching condition of the disc pump <b>10</b>. Thus, the axial displacement oscillations of the driven end wall <b>22</b> continue to efficiently generate oscillations of the pressure within the cavity <b>16</b> from the central pressure anti-nodes <b>45</b>, <b>47</b> to the peripheral pressure anti-nodes <b>45</b>′, <b>47</b>′ at the side wall <b>18</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</div>

The sensor <b>238</b>, which may also be referred to as an optical sensor, includes an optical transmitter <b>240</b> and optical receiver <b>242</b> for use in measuring displacement (δy) of the actuator <b>40</b>. To measure displacement, the optical transmitter <b>240</b> communicates an optical signal <b>244</b> that may be a light wave in a visible or non-visible spectrum. The optical signal <b>244</b> is reflected off the surface of the interior plate <b>15</b> of the actuator <b>40</b> so that the reflected signal is received by the optical receiver <b>242</b>, regardless of the displacement (δy) of the actuator <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. When the actuator <b>40</b> is in the rest position <b>34</b>, a first reflected signal <b>246</b> impinges on the optical receiver <b>242</b> at the position shown in both <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4A</figref>. As the actuator <b>40</b> is displaced from the rest position <b>34</b> to the biased position <b>36</b>, the first reflected signal <b>246</b> is displaced by a corresponding reflected displacement (δx) as a second reflected signal <b>248</b> depending on the displacement (δy) of the actuator <b>40</b>. Essentially, the image of the reflected signals that impinge on the optical receiver <b>242</b> follow a path from the rest position <b>34</b> to the fully biased position <b>36</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The reflected displacement (δx) is proportional to the displacement (δy) of the actuator <b>40</b>, which is a function of the pressure provided by the disc pump <b>10</b>.

This pressure-related displacement (δy) of the actuator <b>40</b>, may be viewed as a quasi-static displacement that changes gradually as the disc pump <b>10</b> supplies pressure to (or removes pressure from) the load <b>38</b>. Thus, the displacements (δy) or (δx) may be measured and used to calculate the pressure differential across the actuator <b>40</b> by establishing the correlation between the pressure-related displacement (δy) of the actuator <b>40</b> and the pressure differential across the actuator <b>40</b> (and the corresponding pressure provided by the disc pump <b>10</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, the optical transmitter <b>240</b> may be a laser, a light emitting diode (LED), a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), or other light emitting element.

As the actuator <b>40</b> oscillates in a fundamental mode to generate airflow as described and shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the amplitude of the displacement oscillations of the actuator <b>40</b> may be substantially zero at any annular displacement nodes <b>42</b>. Correspondingly, the amplitudes of the displacement oscillations at other points along the actuator <b>40</b> are greater than zero as also described. Therefore, the optical transmitter <b>240</b> should be positioned and oriented so that the optical signal <b>244</b> is reflected from a position close to the annular displacement node <b>42</b> to minimize the effect of the high frequency oscillations of the actuator <b>40</b> and more accurately measure the displacement (δy) of the actuator <b>40</b> as the actuator <b>40</b> moves more slowly from the rest position <b>34</b> to the biased position <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, the optical receiver <b>242</b> may include multiple pixels forming a sensor array.

The optical receiver <b>242</b> may be configured to convert the reflected signals <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> sensed by the optical receiver <b>242</b> into electrical signals by the respective pixels of the optical receiver <b>242</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Alternative methods of computing the displacement of the actuator <b>40</b> may be utilized in accordance with the principles described above.

Although generally proportional, the reflected displacement (δx) may equal the displacement (δy) of the actuator <b>40</b> multiplied by a scale factor where the scale factor may be predetermined based on the configuration of the disc pump <b>10</b> or other alignment factors. As a result, the reduced pressure within the cavity <b>16</b> of the disc pump <b>10</b> may be determined by sensing the displacement (δy) of the actuator <b>40</b> without the need for pressure sensors that directly measure the pressure provided to a load. This may be desirable because pressure sensors that directly measure pressure may be too bulky or too expensive for application in measuring the pressure provided by the disc pump <b>10</b> within a reduced pressure system for example. The illustrative embodiments optimize the utilization of space within the disc pump <b>10</b> without interfering with the pressure oscillations being created within the cavity <b>16</b> of the disc pump <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the disc pump <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is shown with the valves <b>29</b>, <b>32</b>, both of which are substantially similar in structure and represented, for example, by a valve <b>110</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7D</figref> and having a center portion <b>111</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The following description associated with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-9B</figref> are all based on the function of a single valve <b>110</b> that may be positioned in any one of the apertures <b>27</b>, <b>31</b> of the disc pump <b>10</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a graph of the pressure oscillations of fluid within the disc pump <b>10</b> and shows that the valve <b>110</b> is located at or near the central pressure anti-node <b>45</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The valve <b>110</b> allows fluid to flow in only one direction as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The valve <b>110</b> may be a check valve or any other valve that allows fluid to flow in only one direction. Some valve types may regulate fluid flow by switching between an open and closed position. For such valves to operate at the high frequencies generated by the actuator <b>40</b>, the valves <b>29</b>, <b>32</b> must have an extremely fast response time such that they are able to open and close on a timescale significantly shorter than the timescale of the pressure variation. One embodiment of the valves <b>29</b>, <b>32</b> achieves this by employing an extremely light flap valve, which has low inertia and consequently is able to move rapidly in response to changes in relative pressure across the valve structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 7A</figref>-D, the valve <b>110</b> is a flap valve. The valve <b>110</b> comprises a substantially cylindrical wall <b>112</b> that is ring-shaped and closed at one end by a retention plate <b>114</b> and at the other end by a sealing plate <b>116</b>. The inside surface of the wall <b>112</b>, the retention plate <b>114</b>, and the sealing plate <b>116</b> form a cavity <b>115</b> within the valve <b>110</b>. The valve <b>110</b> further comprises a substantially circular valve flap <b>117</b> disposed between the retention plate <b>114</b> and the sealing plate <b>116</b>, but adjacent the sealing plate <b>116</b>. The circular valve flap <b>117</b> may be disposed adjacent the retention plate <b>114</b> in another embodiment, and in this sense the valve flap <b>117</b> is considered to be “biased” against either one of the sealing plate <b>116</b> or the retention plate <b>114</b>. The peripheral portion of the valve flap <b>117</b> is sandwiched between the sealing plate <b>116</b> and the wall <b>112</b> so that the motion of the valve flap <b>117</b> is restrained in the plane substantially perpendicular to the surface of the valve flap <b>117</b>. The motion of the valve flap <b>117</b> in such plane may also be restrained by the peripheral portion of the valve flap <b>117</b> being attached directly to either the sealing plate <b>116</b> or the wall <b>112</b>, or by the valve flap <b>117</b> being a close fit within the wall <b>112</b>. The remainder of the valve flap <b>117</b> is sufficiently flexible and movable in a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the valve flap <b>117</b>, so that a force applied to either surface of the valve flap <b>117</b> will motivate the valve flap <b>117</b> between the sealing plate <b>116</b> and the retention plate <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The retention plate <b>114</b> and the sealing plate <b>116</b> both have holes <b>118</b> and <b>120</b>, respectively, which extend through each plate. The valve flap <b>117</b> also has holes <b>122</b> that are generally aligned with the holes <b>118</b> of the retention plate <b>114</b> to provide a passage through which fluid may flow as indicated by the dashed arrows <b>124</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 8A</figref>. The holes <b>122</b> in the valve flap <b>117</b> may also be partially aligned, i.e., having only a partial overlap, with the holes <b>118</b> in the retention plate <b>114</b>. Although the holes <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> are shown to be of substantially uniform size and shape, they may be of different diameters or even different shapes without limiting the scope of the invention. In one embodiment of the invention, the holes <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> form an alternating pattern across the surface of the plates as shown by the solid and dashed circles, respectively, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>. In other embodiments, the holes <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may be arranged in different patterns without affecting the operation of the valve <b>110</b> with respect to the functioning of the individual pairings of holes <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> as illustrated by individual sets of the dashed arrows <b>124</b>. The pattern of holes <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may be designed to increase or decrease the number of holes to control the total flow of fluid through the valve <b>110</b> as required. For example, the number of holes <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may be increased to reduce the flow resistance of the valve <b>110</b> to increase the total flow rate of the valve <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring also to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>, the center portion <b>111</b> of the valve <b>110</b> illustrates how the valve flap <b>117</b> is motivated between the sealing plate <b>116</b> and the retention plate <b>114</b> when a force applied to either surface of the valve flap <b>117</b>. When no force is applied to either surface of the valve flap <b>117</b> to overcome the bias of the valve flap <b>117</b>, the valve <b>110</b> is in a “normally closed” position because the valve flap <b>117</b> is disposed adjacent the sealing plate <b>116</b> where the holes <b>122</b> of the flap are offset or not aligned with the holes <b>118</b> of the sealing plate <b>116</b>. In this “normally closed” position, the flow of fluid through the sealing plate <b>116</b> is substantially blocked or covered by the non-perforated portions of the valve flap <b>117</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. When pressure is applied against either side of the valve flap <b>117</b> that overcomes the bias of the valve flap <b>117</b> and motivates the valve flap <b>117</b> away from the sealing plate <b>116</b> towards the retention plate <b>114</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 8A</figref>, the valve <b>110</b> moves from the normally closed position to an “open” position over a time period, i.e., an opening time delay (T<sub>o</sub>), allowing fluid to flow in the direction indicated by the dashed arrows <b>124</b>. When the pressure changes direction as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the valve flap <b>117</b> will be motivated back towards the sealing plate <b>116</b> to the normally closed position. When this happens, fluid will flow for a short time period, i.e., a closing time delay (T<sub>c</sub>), in the opposite direction as indicated by the dashed arrows <b>132</b> until the valve flap <b>117</b> seals the holes <b>120</b> of the sealing plate <b>116</b> to substantially block fluid flow through the sealing plate <b>116</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>. In other embodiments of the invention, the valve flap <b>117</b> may be biased against the retention plate <b>114</b> with the holes <b>118</b>, <b>122</b> aligned in a “normally open” position. In this embodiment, applying positive pressure against the valve flap <b>117</b> will be necessary to motivate the valve flap <b>117</b> into a “closed” position. Note that the terms “sealed” and “blocked” as used herein in relation to valve operation are intended to include cases in which substantial (but incomplete) sealing or blockage occurs, such that the flow resistance of the valve is greater in the “closed” position than in the “open” position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The operation of the valve <b>110</b> is a function of the change in direction of the differential pressure (ΔP) of the fluid across the valve <b>110</b>.

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the fluid pressure between the valve flap <b>117</b> and the sealing plate <b>116</b> is lower than the fluid pressure between the valve flap <b>117</b> and the retention plate <b>114</b>. Thus, the valve flap <b>117</b> experiences a net force, represented by arrows <b>138</b>, which accelerates the valve flap <b>117</b> toward the sealing plate <b>116</b> to close the valve <b>110</b>. In this manner, the changing differential pressure cycles the valve <b>110</b> between closed and open positions based on the direction (i.e., positive or negative) of the differential pressure across the valve <b>110</b>.

While in practice the time-dependence of the differential pressure across the valve <b>110</b> may be approximately sinusoidal, the time-dependence of the differential pressure across the valve <b>110</b> is approximated as varying in the square-wave form shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> to facilitate explanation of the operation of the valve. The positive differential pressure <b>55</b> is applied across the valve <b>110</b> over the positive pressure time period (t<sub>P</sub>+) and the negative differential pressure <b>65</b> is applied across the valve <b>110</b> over the negative pressure time period (t<sub>P</sub>−) of the square wave. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> illustrates the motion of the valve flap <b>117</b> in response to this time-varying pressure.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In the equations above, ω is the flow velocity; p<sub>1 </sub>is pressure incoming; p<sub>2 </sub>is pressure exiting; T<sub>1 </sub>is incoming temperature of the fluid; T<sub>2 </sub>is outgoing temperature of the fluid; f<sub>1 </sub>is the friction coefficient of the restriction; Re is the Reynolds number; k is absolute roughness of the restriction; D is the diameter of restriction; and ρ<sub>2 </sub>is density of the fluid (or incoming gas). The pipe friction coefficient varies depending on the surface of the path but is otherwise constant. Where the pressure at both the first disc pump <b>10</b> and second disc pump <b>80</b> is known, the equation above can be solved to determine the flow velocity, or flow rate. It is noted that in order for the measured flow rate to be representative of the flow provided by the disc pump system <b>100</b>, one of the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b>, should be temporarily stopped and used only to measure pressure (and not to provide flow).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Generally, the expected flow and associated pressure ranges provided by the disc pump system <b>100</b> are known design parameters. As such, the restriction <b>50</b> can be tuned so that measurements taken using the methodology described above will have the desired level of precision. For example, the length, diameter, and surface roughness of the restriction can be adjusted. In an exemplary embodiment, the restriction <b>50</b> may have a length of less than or equal to about 10 mm and a diameter greater than or equal to about 0.5 mm. It follows that a short, narrow, and rough restriction is best suited for a small space, but such a restriction is more likely to suffer from condensation build-up or obstruction by foreign debris. Further, the manufacturing tolerances for a smaller restriction are narrowed and more critical. A longer, wider, and smoother restriction can be manufactured more reliably and is less likely to occlude. A longer known restriction may be formed within a smaller space by arranging the known restriction in a tortuous path, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">If the restriction <b>50</b> having a tortuous path is formed between the two disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, then flow through one of the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> will need to be stopped in order to make an accurate measurement of the flow between the two disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b>, i.e. the measurement of the flow through the restriction <b>50</b>. For the flow through one pump <b>10</b> or <b>80</b> to be representative of the flow through the disc pump system <b>100</b>, it is desirable to have the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> biased. For example, the first disc pump <b>10</b> may be biased to provide a lower flow rate that is associated with a higher pressure differential, and the second disc pump <b>80</b> may be biased to provide a higher flow rate that is associated with a lower pressure differential. In one embodiment, the second pump <b>80</b> is a high-flow pump situated at the distal end of the restriction. In the embodiment, the second disc pump <b>80</b> continues to operate when flow is measured. When the disc pumps <b>10</b>, <b>80</b> are biased as described, the operation of first disc pump <b>10</b> is less critical to the operation of the disc pump system <b>100</b> when the disc pump system <b>100</b> provides increased flow (e.g., at start-up or when a leak is present). The biased disc pump configurations minimize the impact of temporarily ceasing operation of the first disc pump <b>10</b> so that the first disc pump <b>10</b> may act as a flow sensor because second disc pump <b>80</b> provides the majority of the flow. Conversely, when the load <b>38</b> is evacuated and an increased pressure differential is desired, the high-flow biased second disc pump <b>80</b> can be switched off and the high-pressure first disc pump <b>10</b> can function while the flow rate is measured.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Enabling the measurement of a flow rate in the disc pump system <b>100</b> supplies a number of advantages. The flow rate of the disc pump system <b>100</b> can be measured without the need for additional components or expense, and a smaller footprint is required. In addition, the flow rate data can be used to determine conditions at the load <b>38</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">In one embodiment, the disc pump system <b>100</b> determines whether there is a leak at the load <b>38</b> based on the measured flow rate and pressure.

In response to determining that a leak exists, the disc pump system <b>100</b> may shut down or transmit an alarm or alert signal via an audio interface.
