<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/797,230, filed Jul. 13, 2015, now allowed, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/031,734, filed Feb. 22, 2011, now U.S. Pat.

<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a heterocyclic compound, a light-emitting element, a light-emitting device, an electronic device, and a lighting device.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">In recent years, research and development have been extensively conducted on light-emitting elements utilizing electroluminescence (EL). In the basic structure of such a light-emitting element, a layer containing a light-emitting substance is interposed between a pair of electrodes. By voltage application to this element, light emission from the light-emitting substance can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0004">Since such light-emitting elements are self-luminous elements, they have advantages over liquid crystal displays in having high pixel visibility and eliminating the need for backlights, for example, thereby being considered as suitable for flat panel display elements. Light-emitting elements are also highly advantageous in that they can be thin and lightweight. Furthermore, very high speed response is one of the features of such elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0005">Furthermore, since such light-emitting elements can be formed in a film form, they make it possible to provide planar light emission. Accordingly, elements having a large area can be easily formed. This is a feature difficult to obtain with point light sources typified by incandescent lamps and LEDs or linear light sources typified by fluorescent lamps. Thus, light-emitting elements also have great potential as planar light sources applicable to lightings and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0006">Such light-emitting elements utilizing electroluminescence can be broadly classified according to whether a light-emitting substance is an organic compound or an inorganic compound. In the case of an organic EL element in which a layer containing an organic compound used as a light-emitting substance is provided between a pair of electrodes, application of a voltage to the light-emitting element causes injection of electrons from a cathode and holes from an anode into the layer containing the organic compound having a light-emitting property and thus a current flows. The injected electrons and holes then lead the organic compound having a light-emitting property to its excited state, whereby light emission is obtained from the excited organic compound having a light-emitting property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0007">The excited state formed by an organic compound can be a singlet excited state or a triplet excited state. Emission from the singlet excited state (S*) is called fluorescence, and emission from the triplet excited state (T*) is called phosphorescence. In addition, the statistical generation ratio thereof in a light-emitting element is considered to be as follows: S*:T*=1:3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0008">In a compound which converts energy of a singlet excited state into light emission (hereinafter, referred to as a fluorescent compound), at room temperature, emission from the triplet excited state (phosphorescence) is not observed while only emission from the singlet excited state (fluorescence) is observed. Therefore the internal quantum efficiency (the ratio of generated photons to injected carriers) of a light-emitting element using a fluorescent compound is assumed to have a theoretical limit of 25% based on the ratio of S* to T* which is 1:3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0009">In contrast, in a compound which converts energy of a triplet excited state into light emission (hereinafter, referred to as a phosphorescent compound), emission from the triplet excited state (phosphorescence) is observed. Further, in a phosphorescent compound, since intersystem crossing (i.e. transfer from a singlet excited state to a triplet excited state) easily occurs, the internal quantum efficiency can be increased to 75% to 100% in theory. In other words, the emission efficiency can be three to four times as much as that of a fluorescent compound. For this reason, light-emitting elements using phosphorescent compounds are now under active development in order to realize highly efficient light-emitting elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0010">When a light-emitting layer of a light-emitting element is formed using a phosphorescent compound described above, in order to suppress concentration quenching or quenching due to triplet-triplet annihilation in the phosphorescent compound, the light-emitting layer is often formed such that the phosphorescent compound is dispersed in a matrix of another compound. Here, the compound serving as the matrix is called a host material, and the compound dispersed in the matrix, such as a phosphorescent compound, is called a guest material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0011">In the case where a phosphorescent compound is a guest material, a host material needs to have higher triplet excitation energy (a larger energy difference between a ground state and a triplet excited state) than the phosphorescent compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0012">Furthermore, since singlet excitation energy (an energy difference between a ground state and a singlet excited state) is higher than triplet excitation energy, a substance that has high triplet excitation energy also has high singlet excitation energy. Therefore the above substance that has high triplet excitation energy is also effective in a light-emitting element using a fluorescent compound as a light-emitting substance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0013">Studies have been conducted on compounds having dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline rings, which are examples of the host material used when a phosphorescent compound is a guest material (e.g., see Patent Documents 1 and 2).</div>

<heading id="h-0006">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">However, the above compounds having dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline rings have a planar structure, and accordingly, these compounds are easily crystallized. A light-emitting element using a compound that is easy to crystallize has a short lifetime. Further, if another skeleton is directly bonded to the dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring so that the compound has a three-dimensionally bulky structure, the conjugated system could possibly extend to cause a decrease in triplet excitation energy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, in order to realize a light-emitting device, an electronic device, and a lighting device each having reduced power consumption and high reliability, a light-emitting element having low driving voltage, a light-emitting element having high current efficiency, or a light-emitting element having a long lifetime have been expected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a novel heterocyclic compound which can be used for a light-emitting element, as a host material of a light-emitting layer in which a light-emitting substance is dispersed, in particular, a novel heterocyclic compound which can be suitably used as a host material in which a phosphorescent compound is used as a light-emitting substance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a light-emitting element having low driving voltage. Yet another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a light-emitting element having high current efficiency. Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a light-emitting element having a long lifetime. Still another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a light-emitting device, an electronic device, and a lighting device each having reduced power consumption by use of any of these light-emitting elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">A compound with a quinoxaline skeleton has a high electron-transport property, and use of such a compound for a light-emitting element enables the element to have low driving voltage. However, a quinoxaline skeleton has a planar structure. Since a compound having a planar structure is easily crystallized when formed into a film, use of such a compound for light-emitting elements causes the elements to have a short a lifetime. Furthermore, a quinoxaline skeleton is poor at accepting holes. When a compound that cannot easily accept holes is used as a host material of a light-emitting layer, the region of electron-hole recombination concentrates on an interface of the light-emitting layer, leading to a reduction in the lifetime of the light-emitting element. It is likely that these problems will be solved by introduction of a hole-transport skeleton into the molecule. However, if a hole-transport skeleton is directly bonded to a quinoxaline skeleton, the conjugated system extends to cause a decrease in band gap and a decrease in triplet excitation energy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Nevertheless, the present inventors have found that the above problems can be solved by using, for a light-emitting element, a compound in which a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring and a hole-transport skeleton are bonded through an arylene group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">One embodiment of the present invention is a light-emitting element including a compound in which a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring and a hole-transport skeleton are bonded through an arylene group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">A compound applied to one embodiment of the present invention has a hole-transport skeleton in addition to a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring, making it easy to accept holes. Accordingly, by use of the compound as a host material of a light-emitting layer, electrons and holes recombine in the light-emitting layer, so that it is possible to suppress the decrease in the lifetime of the light-emitting element. Furthermore, the introduction of a hole-transport skeleton enables the compound to have a three-dimensionally bulky structure, and the compound is difficult to crystallize when formed into a film. By the use of the compound for a light-emitting element, the element can have a long lifetime. Moreover, in this compound, since a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring and a hole-transport skeleton are bonded through an arylene group, decreases in band gap and triplet excitation energy can be prevented as compared with a compound in which a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring and a hole-transport skeleton are directly bonded. By the use of the compound for a light-emitting element, the element can have high current efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, the compound described above can be suitably used as a material for an organic device such as a light-emitting element or an organic transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">As the hole-transport skeleton, a π-electron rich heteroaromatic ring is preferable. As the π-electron rich heteroaromatic ring, a carbazole ring, a dibenzofuran ring, or a dibenzothiophene ring is preferable. As the arylene group, any of a substituted or unsubstituted phenylene group and a substituted or unsubstituted biphenyldiyl group is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Since a light-emitting element of one embodiment of the present invention which is obtained as above has low driving voltage, high current efficiency, and a long lifetime, a light-emitting device (such as an image display device) using this light-emitting element can have reduced power consumption. Thus, one embodiment of the present invention is a light-emitting device including any of the above light-emitting elements. One embodiment of the present invention also includes an electronic device using the light-emitting device in its display portion and a lighting device using the light-emitting device in its light-emitting portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The light-emitting device in this specification covers an image display device using a light-emitting element and also the following devices: a module including a light-emitting element to which a connector such as an anisotropic conductive film, a TAB (tape automated bonding) tape, or a TCP (tape carrier package) is attached; a module in which the top of a TAB tape or a TCP is provided with a printed wiring board; a module in which an IC (integrated circuit) is directly mounted on a light-emitting element by a COG (chip on glass) technique; and further a light-emitting device used for a lighting device and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">As the compound in which a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring and a hole-transport skeleton are bonded through an arylene group, a heterocyclic compound below can be given.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">A heterocyclic compound of one embodiment of the present invention has a wide band gap. Accordingly, by use of such a heterocyclic compound for a light-emitting element, as a host material of a light-emitting layer in which a light-emitting substance is dispersed, high current efficiency can be obtained. In particular, a heterocyclic compound of one embodiment of the present invention is suitably used as a host material in which a phosphorescent compound is dispersed. Further, since a heterocyclic compound of this embodiment is a substance having a high electron-transport property, it can be suitably used as a material for an electron-transport layer in a light-emitting element. By the use of a heterocyclic compound of this embodiment, a light-emitting element having low driving voltage can be realized. In addition, a light-emitting element having high current efficiency can be realized. A light-emitting element having a long lifetime can also be realized. Furthermore, by the use of this light-emitting element, a light-emitting device, an electronic device, and a lighting device each having reduced power consumption can be obtained.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">Embodiment 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">In Embodiment 2, light-emitting elements of embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">One embodiment of the present invention is a light-emitting element including a compound in which a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring and a hole-transport skeleton are bonded through an arylene group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">A compound with a quinoxaline skeleton has a high electron-transport property, and use of such a compound for a light-emitting element enables the element to have low driving voltage. However, a quinoxaline skeleton has a planar structure. Since a compound having a planar structure is easily crystallized when formed into a film, use of such a compound for light-emitting elements causes the elements to have a short a lifetime. Furthermore, a quinoxaline skeleton is poor at accepting holes. When a compound that cannot easily accept holes is used as a host material of a light-emitting layer, the region of electron-hole recombination concentrates on an interface of the light-emitting layer, leading to a reduction in the lifetime of the light-emitting element. It is likely that these problems will be solved by the introduction of a hole-transport skeleton into the molecule. However, if a hole-transport skeleton is directly bonded to a quinoxaline skeleton, the conjugated system extends to cause a decrease in band gap and a decrease in triplet excitation energy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">Nevertheless, the present inventors have found that the above problems can be solved by using, for a light-emitting element, a compound in which a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring and a hole-transport skeleton are bonded through an arylene group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">The above-described compound has a hole-transport skeleton in addition to a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring, making it easy to accept holes. Accordingly, by use of the compound as a host material of a light-emitting layer, electrons and holes recombine in the light-emitting layer, so that it is possible to suppress the decrease in the lifetime of the light-emitting element. Furthermore, the introduction of a hole-transport skeleton enables the compound to have a three-dimensionally bulky structure, and the compound is difficult to crystallize when formed into a film. By the use of the compound for a light-emitting element, the element can have a long lifetime. Moreover, in this compound, since a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring and a hole-transport skeleton are bonded through an arylene group, decreases in band gap and triplet excitation energy can be prevented as compared with a compound in which a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline ring and a hole-transport skeleton are directly bonded. By the use of the compound for a light-emitting element, the element can have high current efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Thus, the compound described above can be suitably used as a material for an organic device such as a light-emitting element or an organic transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">As the hole-transport skeleton, a π-electron rich heteroaromatic ring is preferable. As the π-electron rich heteroaromatic ring, a carbazole ring, a dibenzofuran ring, or a dibenzothiophene ring is preferable. As the arylene group, any of a substituted or unsubstituted phenylene group and a substituted or unsubstituted biphenyldiyl group is preferable.</div>

The substances given here are mainly materials having a hole mobility of 10<sup>−6 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more. Note that other than the above substances, any organic compound that has a property of transporting more holes than electrons may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">Further, as the electron acceptor, 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroquinodimethane (abbreviation: F<sub>4</sub>-TCNQ), chloranil, and the like can be given. In addition, transition metal oxides can be given. Moreover, oxides of metals belonging to Groups 4 to 8 of the periodic table can be given. Specifically, vanadium oxide, niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, chromium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, manganese oxide, and rhenium oxide are preferable because they have a high electron-accepting property. Among these metal oxides, molybdenum oxide, which is easy to handle, is preferred owing to its stability in air and low hygroscopic property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">In contrast, in the case of the structure in which an electron donor is added to an organic compound having a high electron-transport property, as the organic compound having a high electron-transport property, a metal complex having a quinoline skeleton or a benzoquinoline skeleton, such as Alq, Almq<sub>3</sub>, BeBq<sub>2</sub>, or BAlq, or the like can be used, for example. A metal complex having an oxazole-based ligand or a thiazole-based ligand, such as Zn(BOX)<sub>2 </sub>or Zn(BTZ)<sub>2 </sub>can also be used. Other than such metal complexes, PBD, OXD-7, TAZ, BPhen, BCP, or the like can be used. The substances given here are mainly materials having an electron mobility of 10<sup>−6 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more. Note that other than the above substances, any organic compound that has a property of transporting more electrons than holes may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236">Further, as the electron donor, any of alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare-earth metals, metals belonging to Group 13 of the periodic table, or oxides or carbonates thereof can be used. Specifically, lithium, cesium, magnesium, calcium, ytterbium, indium, lithium oxide, cesium carbonate, or the like is preferably used. An organic compound such as tetrathianaphthacene may also be used as the electron donor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0237">Note that by the formation of the charge generation layer <b>313</b> using a material described above, it is possible to suppress an increase in driving voltage caused by stacking the EL layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">In this embodiment, the light-emitting element having two light-emitting units is described, and a light-emitting element having a stack of three or more light-emitting units can also be employed as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. A plurality of light-emitting units which are partitioned by a charge generation layer is arranged between a pair of electrodes, as in the light-emitting element according to this embodiment, whereby it is possible to realize an element having a long lifetime which can emit light with a high luminance while current density is kept low.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0239">With light-emitting units having emission colors different from each other, the light-emitting element as a whole can be made to emit light with a desired color. For example, in a light-emitting element having two light-emitting units, the emission colors of the first light-emitting unit and the second light-emitting unit are made complementary; thus, the light-emitting element which emits white light as a whole can be obtained. Note that the term “complementary” means color relationship in which an achromatic color is obtained when colors are mixed. That is, white light emission can be obtained by mixture of light obtained from substances emitting lights with complementary colors. The same can be applied to a light-emitting element which has three light-emitting units. For example, the light-emitting element as a whole can emit white light when the emission color of the first light-emitting unit is red, the emission color of the second light-emitting unit is green, and the emission color of the third light-emitting unit is blue.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">Note that a lead wiring <b>408</b> is a wiring for transmitting signals that are to be inputted to the source driver circuit <b>401</b> and the gate driver circuit <b>403</b>, and receives a video signal, a clock signal, a start signal, a reset signal, and the like from an FPC (flexible printed circuit) <b>409</b> which serves as an external input terminal. Although only the FPC is illustrated here, a printed wiring board (PWB) may be attached to the FPC. The light-emitting device in this specification includes not only a light-emitting device itself but also a light-emitting device to which an FPC or a PWB is attached.</div>

For example, when positive photosensitive acrylic is used as a material for the insulator <b>414</b>, it is preferable that only an upper end portion of the insulator <b>414</b> have a curved surface with a radius of curvature (0.2 μm to 3 μm). For the insulator <b>414</b>, it is also possible to use either a negative type that becomes insoluble in an etchant by light irradiation or a positive type that becomes soluble in an etchant by light irradiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">A light-emitting layer <b>416</b> and a second electrode <b>417</b> are formed over the first electrode <b>413</b>. Here, as a material for forming the first electrode <b>413</b> functioning as the anode, a material having a high work function is preferably used.

In order that light generated in the light-emitting layer <b>416</b> be transmitted through the second electrode <b>417</b>, a stack of a metal thin film having a reduced thickness and a transparent conductive film (e.g., ITO, indium oxide containing 2 wt % to 20 wt % of zinc oxide, indium oxide-tin oxide that includes silicon or silicon oxide, or zinc oxide) is preferably used for the second electrode <b>417</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">The sealing substrate <b>404</b> is attached to the element substrate <b>410</b> with the sealant <b>405</b>; thus, a light-emitting element <b>418</b> is provided in the space <b>407</b> enclosed by the element substrate <b>410</b>, the sealing substrate <b>404</b>, and the sealant <b>405</b>. Note that the space <b>407</b> may be filled with filler such as an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen or argon) or with the sealant <b>405</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">Note that as the sealant <b>405</b>, an epoxy-based resin is preferably used.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0274">In a 2-L three-neck flask were put 5.3 g (20 mmol) of 2-chlorodibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline, 6.1 g (20 mmol) of 3-(dibenzothiophen-4-yl)phenylboronic acid, 460 mg (0.4 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), 300 mL of toluene, 20 mL of ethanol, and 20 mL of a 2M aqueous potassium carbonate solution. This mixture was degassed by stirring under reduced pressure, and the air in the flask was replaced with nitrogen. This mixture was stirred under a nitrogen stream at 100° C. for 7.5 hours. After cooled to room temperature, the obtained mixture was filtered to give a white substance. The substance obtained by the filtration was washed well with water and ethanol in this order, and then dried. The obtained solid was dissolved in about 600 mL of hot toluene, followed by suction filtration through Celite (produced by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Catalog No. 531-16855) and Florisil (produced by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Catalog No. 540-00135), whereby a clear colorless filtrate was obtained. The obtained filtrate was concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography. The chromatography was carried out using hot toluene as a developing solvent. Acetone and ethanol were added to the solid obtained here, followed by irradiation with ultrasonic waves. Then, the generated suspended solid was filtered and the obtained solid was dried to give 7.85 g of a white powder in 80% yield, which was the substance to be produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">The above produced substance was relatively soluble in hot toluene, but is a material that is easy to precipitate when cooled. Further, the substance was poorly soluble in other organic solvents such as acetone and ethanol. Hence, the utilization of these different degrees of solubility resulted in a high-yield synthesis by a simple method as above. Specifically, after the reaction finished, the mixture was returned to room temperature and the precipitated solid was collected by filtration, whereby most impurities were able to be easily removed. Further, by the column chromatography with hot toluene as a developing solvent, the produced substance, which is easy to precipitate, was able to be readily purified.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0317" num="0316">As shown in Table 2, the CIE chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of Light-emitting Element 1 were (0.54, 0.46) at a luminance of 850 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The CIE chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of Light-emitting Element 2 were (0.54, 0.46) at a luminance of 860 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The CIE chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of Reference Light-emitting Element 3 were (0.53, 0.46) at a luminance of 1200 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. The CIE chromaticity coordinates (x, y) of Reference Light-emitting Element 4 were (0.55, 0.45) at a luminance of 970 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. It is found that all these light-emitting elements exhibited light emission from [Ir(mppr-Me)<sub>2</sub>(acac)].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0318" num="0317"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> reveals that Light-emitting Elements 1 and 2 each have low driving voltage and high current efficiency. A structural difference in the compounds each used as a host material of a light-emitting layer between Light-emitting Element 2 and Reference Light-emitting Element 4 is that a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline skeleton is included in Light-emitting Element 2 while a triphenylene skeleton is included in Reference Light-emitting Element 4. Which of a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline skeleton or a triphenylene skeleton was included made a differences in voltage vs. luminance characteristics and luminance vs. current efficiency characteristics between Light-emitting Element 2 and Reference Light-emitting Element 4. It is thus confirmed that, like a heterocyclic compound of one embodiment of the present invention, a compound having a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline skeleton is effective in realizing high voltage vs. luminance characteristics and high luminance vs. current efficiency characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0318">Next, Light-emitting Elements 1 and 2 and Reference Light-emitting Elements 3 and 4 were subjected to reliability tests. Results of the reliability tests are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the vertical axis represents normalized luminance (%) with an initial luminance of 100%, and the horizontal axis represents driving time (h) of the elements. In the reliability tests, the light-emitting elements of this example were driven under the conditions where the current density was constant and the initial luminance was 5000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows that Light-emitting Element 1 kept 82% of the initial luminance after driving for 230 hours and Light-emitting Element 2 kept 89% of the initial luminance after driving for 230 hours. The luminance of Reference Light-emitting Element 3 decreases to 62% of the initial luminance after 210 hours, and the luminance of Reference Light-emitting Element 4 decreases to 69% of the initial luminance after 210 hours. These results of the reliability tests revealed that Light-emitting Elements 1 and 2 each had a long lifetime. Note that, from these results, when the initial luminance is 5000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, the luminance half life of Light-emitting Element 2, whose lifetime was the longest, is estimated at about 6000 hours. When the initial luminance is changed to 1000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, which is of practical use, this luminance half life corresponds to 150000 hours, indicating that the lifetime is extremely long.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0319">A dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline skeleton is included in Light-emitting Element 1 while a quinoxaline skeleton is included in Reference Light-emitting Element 3.

It is thus confirmed that, like a heterocyclic compound of one embodiment of the present invention, having a dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline skeleton is effective in realizing a light-emitting element with much higher reliability.</div>

The mixture was degassed by stirring under reduced pressure, and the air in the flask was replaced with nitrogen. To this mixture was added 0.24 mg (0.20 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0). This mixture was stirred under a nitrogen stream at 80° C. for 24 hours. After a predetermined time had elapsed, the precipitated solid was suction filtered to give a solid. Ethanol was added to this solid, followed by irradiation with ultrasonic waves. The solid was suction filtered to give a solid. The obtained solid was dissolved in toluene, and the toluene solution was suction filtered through Celite (produced by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Catalog No. 531-16855) and alumina, and the filtrate was concentrated to give a solid.
