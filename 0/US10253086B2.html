<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to the use of T cells engineered to express a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR), optionally in combination with a B cell inhibitor, e.g., one or more inhibitors of CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a to treat a disease associated with expression of the Cluster of Differentiation 19 protein (CD19).</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Many patients with B cell malignancies are incurable with standard therapy. In addition, traditional treatment options often have serious side effects. Attempts have been made in cancer immunotherapy, however, several obstacles render this a very difficult goal to achieve clinical effectiveness. Although hundreds of so-called tumor antigens have been identified, these are generally derived from self and thus are poorly immunogenic. Furthermore, tumors use several mechanisms to render themselves hostile to the initiation and propagation of immune attack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Recent developments using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified autologous T cell (CART) therapy, which relies on redirecting T cells to a suitable cell-surface molecule on cancer cells such as B cell malignancies, show promising results in harnessing the power of the immune system to treat B cell malignancies and other cancers (see, e.g., Sadelain et al., Cancer Discovery 3:388-398 (2013)). The clinical results of the murine derived CART19 (i.e., “CTL019”) have shown promise in establishing complete remissions in patients suffering with CLL as well as in childhood ALL (see, e.g., Kalos et al., Sci Transl Med 3:95ra73 (2011), Porter et al., NEJM 365:725-733 (2011), Grupp et al., NEJM 368:1509-1518 (2013)). Besides the ability for the chimeric antigen receptor on the genetically modified T cells to recognize and destroy the targeted cells, a successful therapeutic T cell therapy needs to have the ability to proliferate and persist over time, in order to survey for leukemic relapse. The variable quality of T cells, resulting from anergy, suppression, or exhaustion, will have effects on CAR-transformed T cells' performance, over which skilled practitioners have limited control at this time. To be effective, CAR transformed patient T cells need to persist and maintain the ability to proliferate in response to the cognate antigen. It has been shown that ALL patient T cells perform can do this with CART19 comprising a murine scFv (see, e.g., Grupp et al., NEJM 368:1509-1518 (2013)).</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure features, at least in part, a method of treating a disorder associated with expression of the Cluster of Differentiation 19 protein (CD19) (e.g., OMIM Acc. No. 107265, Swiss Prot. Acc No. P15391). In certain embodiments, the disorder is a cancer, e.g., a hematological cancer. In some embodiments, the method comprises administering a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) molecule that binds CD19 in combination with a B-cell inhibitor, for example, one or more (e.g., one, two, three or more) B-cell inhibitors. In some embodiments, the B-cell inhibitor is chosen from an inhibitor of CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, or ROR1, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the combination maintains or has better clinical effectiveness as compared to either therapy alone. In some embodiments, the methods herein involve the use of engineered cells, e.g., T cells, to express a CAR molecule that binds CD19, in combination with a B-cell inhibitor (e.g., an antibody (e.g., a mono- or bispecific antibody) to a second B target, e.g., CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, or ROR1) or a CAR-expressing cell e.g., a CAR-expressing immune effector cell, that binds to the second B cell target, or a combination thereof) to treat the disorder associated with expression of CD19. The disclosure additionally features novel antigen binding domains and CAR molecules directed to CD20 and CD22, and uses, e.g., as monotherapies or in combination therapies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention pertains to a method of treating a subject (e.g., a mammal) having a disease associated with expression of CD19.

In certain aspects, the disclosure provides a method of providing an anti-tumor immunity in a subject, e.g., a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a combination (e.g., one or more CAR-expressing cells) as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In an aspect, the disclosure provides a method of preventing a CD19-negative relapse in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal one or more B-cell inhibitors, wherein the B-cell inhibitor comprises an inhibitor of one or more of CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the disclosure provides a method of treating a subject having a disease associated with expression of CD19, e.g., DLBCL (e.g. primary DLBCL). The method comprises administering to the subject an effective number of one or more cells that express a CAR molecule that binds CD19, e.g., a CD19 CAR, optionally in combination with a PD1 inhibitor. Optionally, the subject has, or is identified as having, at least 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of cancer cells, e.g., DLBCL cells, which are CD3+/PD1+.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In an aspect, the disclosure provides a method of treating a subject having a disease associated with expression of CD19, e.g., DLBCL. The method comprises administering to the subject an effective number of one or more cells that express a CAR molecule that binds CD19, e.g., a CD19 CAR, in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In an aspect, the disclosure provides one or more B-cell inhibitors, wherein the B-cell inhibitor comprises an inhibitor of one or more of CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a, for use in the treatment of a subject having a disease associated with expression of CD19, and wherein said subject has received, is receiving or is about to receive a cell that expresses a CAR molecule that binds CD19, e.g., a CD19 CAR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0005" num="0000">Timing and Dosage of the Combination Administration</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The one or more therapies described herein can be administered to the subject substantially at the same time or in any order. For instance, a CD19 inhibitor, e.g., a CD19 CAR-expressing cell described herein, the one or more B-cell inhibitor, and/or optionally the at least one additional therapeutic agent can be administered simultaneously, in the same or in separate compositions, or sequentially.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">For sequential administration, the CAR-expressing cell described herein (e.g., a CD19 CAR-expressing cell, a CD20 CAR-expressing cell, or a CD22 CAR-expressing cell) can be administered first, and the additional agent can be administered second, or the order of administration can be reversed. In some embodiments, the first therapy (e.g., a CAR-expressing cell such as a CD19 CART cell, CD20 CART cell, or CD22 CART cell) is continued when the second therapy is introduced, and in other embodiments the first therapy is withdrawn before, after, or at the same time as the second therapy is introduced. In instances of sequential administration, in some embodiments, the second therapy is initiated after a predetermined amount of time, or after the subject displays one or more indications that relapse has occurred or is likely to occur. The indication can be, e.g., the presence of cancer cells having a disturbance in the target of the first therapy, e.g., CD19, CD20, or CD22. The disturbance may be, e.g., a frameshift mutation and/or a premature stop codon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In other embodiments, the two or more therapies (e.g., a CD19 CAR-expressing cell and a B-cell inhibitor) are administered simultaneously. Without being bound by theory, in some embodiments, simultaneous administration of the therapies can reduce the likelihood of relapse and/or delay relapse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">When administered in combination, the first therapy (e.g., CAR therapy, e.g., CAR-expressing cell directed against CD19, CD20, or CD22) and the additional agent (e.g., second or third agent, e.g., a B-cell inhibitor), or all, can be administered in an amount or dose that is higher, lower, or the same as the amount or dosage of each agent used individually, e.g., as a monotherapy. In certain embodiments, the administered amount or dosage of the first therapy, second therapy, optionally a third therapy, or all, is lower (e.g., at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50%) than the amount or dosage of each agent used individually, e.g., as a monotherapy. In other embodiments, the amount or dosage of the first therapy, second therapy, optionally a third therapy, or all, that results in a desired effect (e.g., treatment of cancer) is lower (e.g., at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50% lower) than the amount or dosage of each agent used individually, e.g., as a monotherapy, required to achieve the same therapeutic effect. In certain embodiments, the lower dose results in reduced side effects compared to those seen when the regular (monotherapy) dose is administered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the therapy comprises a population of cells. In embodiments, the cells are immune effector cells, e.g., CAR-expressing cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Alternatively, or in combination with the methods described herein, methods are disclosed that comprise a diagnostic step or a patient selection step, for instance as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In one aspect, the invention provides a method of evaluating a subject, e.g., a patient, for relapser status (e.g. a relapser or a non-relapser after a CAR-therapy). In one embodiment, the method identifies a subject, e.g., a patient, who has relapsed (“relapser”) or who is are likely to relapse, or who has not relapsed (“non-relapser”) or who is likely not to relapse, after treatment with a CAR therapy (e.g., a CD19 CART therapy, e.g., described herein, e.g., a CTL019 therapy). In an embodiment, relapser status (e.g. relapser or non-relapser after a CART therapy) is determined by assaying for one or more characteristics of CD19.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the one or more characteristics of CD19 include an alteration in a nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a mutation such as an insertion, a deletion, or a substitution, or a combination thereof), an alteration in a nucleic acid level, an alteration in a protein sequence, or an alteration in a protein level, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, a relapser has one or more mutations in CD19, e.g., one or more mutations (e.g. insertions or deletions) in exon 2 of CD19. In an embodiment, a relapser has one or more mutations in exon 1, exon 2, exon 3, exon 4, exon 5, exon 6, or exon 7 of CD19. In an embodiment, the mutation produces a premature stop codon, e.g., by an insertion or deletion leading to a frameshift, e.g., in exon 2 of CD19. In an embodiment, the mutation is a mutation of Table 31.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, the characteristic of CD19 is compared to a reference characteristic. For example, when the characteristic is a sequence (e.g., protein or nucleic acid sequence from a biological sample), the reference characteristic can be a wild-type sequence (e.g., protein or nucleic acid sequence) of CD19. The characteristic may be the percent of cells in the sample having a mutant sequence. When the characteristic is a level (e.g., protein or nucleic acid level), the reference characteristic can be a wild-type level (e.g., protein or nucleic acid level) of CD19. The characteristic may be the level of protein or nucleic acid in the sample. The characteristic may be the percentage of cells in the sample that have a level of protein or nucleic acid that is above a given threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, methods are provided for identifying a subject having cancer, e.g., a hematological cancer, such as, e.g., CLL or ALL, as being a relapser or non-relapser after a treatment that comprises a CAR therapy, e.g., a CD19 CART therapy. The method comprises: (1) acquiring a sample from the subject (e.g., an apheresis sample obtained from the blood of the subject; and/or e.g., a manufactured product sample, e.g., genetically engineered T cells obtained from the blood of the subject); (2) determining a characteristic of CD19, e.g., a sequence or level as described herein; and (3) (optionally) comparing the determined characteristic of CD19 to a reference characteristic; wherein the difference, e.g., statistically significant difference, between the determined characteristic compared to the reference characteristic is predictive of relapse to the CAR therapy; and (4) identifying the subject as a relapser or non-relapser to the CAR therapy, e.g., based on the determined characteristic of CD19. In one embodiment, the presence or absence of the characteristic of CD19 is the presence or absence of a premature stop codon, e.g., by an insertion or deletion leading to a frameshift. In an embodiment, the presence of the characteristic of CD19 is a mutation of Table 31.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment, the provided methods comprise (1) acquiring a sample from the subject (e.g., an apheresis sample obtained from the blood of the subject; and/or, e.g., a manufactured product sample, e.g., genetically engineered T cells obtained from the blood of the subject, e.g., a manufactured CART19 product); (2) determining a characteristic of CD19, e.g., a sequence or level as described herein; and (3) (optionally) comparing the determined characteristic of CD19 to a reference characteristic; wherein the presence of the characteristic of CD19 (e.g., the difference, e.g., a statistically significant difference, between the determined characteristic compared to the reference characteristic) is predictive of relapse to the CAR therapy. In one embodiment, the presence of the characteristic of CD19 is the presence of a premature stop codon, e.g., by an insertion or deletion leading to a frameshift. In an embodiment, the presence of the characteristic of CD19 is a mutation of Table 31.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment, methods are provided for determining the relapse of a subject having cancer, e.g., a hematological cancer such as CLL or ALL, after a treatment comprising a CAR therapy, e.g., a CD19 CAR therapy as described herein. The method comprises determining a characteristic of CD19 in a sample obtained prior to relapse. In an embodiment, the presence of the characteristic of CD19 (e.g., the difference, e.g., a statistically significant difference, between the determined characteristic compared to the reference characteristic) is indicative of relapse after CAR therapy. In one embodiment, the presence of the characteristic of CD19 is the presence of a premature stop codon, e.g., by an insertion or deletion leading to a frameshift. In an embodiment, the presence of the characteristic of CD19 is a mutation of Table 31.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, methods are provided for evaluating a subject having cancer, e.g., a hematological cancer such as CLL or ALL. The method comprises acquiring a value of relapser status for the subject that comprises a measure of one or characteristics of CD19, e.g., one or more of the characteristics of CD19 as described herein, thereby evaluating the subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, methods are provided for evaluating or monitoring the effectiveness of a CAR therapy, e.g., a CD19 CART therapy, in a subject having cancer comprising acquiring a value of relapser status for the subject that comprises a measure of one or more characteristic of CD19, e.g., one or more of the characteristics of CD19 as described herein, thereby evaluating or monitoring the effectiveness of the CAR therapy in the subject.</div>

<heading id="h-0030">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0031">Definitions</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0333">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0334">The term “a” and “an” refers to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, “an element” means one element or more than one element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0321" num="0335">The term “about” when referring to a measurable value such as an amount, a temporal duration, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of ±20% or in some instances ±10%, or in some instances ±5%, or in some instances ±1%, or in some instances ±0.1% from the specified value, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0322" num="0336">The term “apheresis” as used herein refers to the art-recognized extracorporeal process by which the blood of a donor or patient is removed from the donor or patient and passed through an apparatus that separates out selected particular constituent(s) and returns the remainder to the circulation of the donor or patient, e.g., by retransfusion. Thus, “an apheresis sample” refers to a sample obtained using apheresis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0323" num="0337">The term “bioequivalent” refers to an amount of an agent other than the reference compound (e.g., RAD001), required to produce an effect equivalent to the effect produced by the reference dose or reference amount of the reference compound (e.g., RAD001). In an embodiment the effect is the level of mTOR inhibition, e.g., as measured by P70 S6 kinase inhibition, e.g., as evaluated in an in vivo or in vitro assay, e.g., as measured by an assay described herein, e.g., the Boulay assay, or measurement of phosphorylated S6 levels by western blot. In an embodiment, the effect is alteration of the ratio of PD-1 positive/PD-1 negative T cells, as measured by cell sorting. In an embodiment a bioequivalent amount or dose of an mTOR inhibitor is the amount or dose that achieves the same level of P70 S6 kinase inhibition as does the reference dose or reference amount of a reference compound. In an embodiment, a bioequivalent amount or dose of an mTOR inhibitor is the amount or dose that achieves the same level of alteration in the ratio of PD-1 positive/PD-1 negative T cells as does the reference dose or reference amount of a reference compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0324" num="0338">The term “inhibition” or “inhibitor” includes a reduction in a certain parameter, e.g., an activity, of a given molecule, e.g., CD20, CD10, CD19, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a. For example, inhibition of an activity, e.g., an activity of CD20, CD10, CD19, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a, of at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or more is included by this term. Thus, inhibition need not be 100%. Activities for the inhibitors can be determined as described herein or by assays known in the art. A “B-cell inhibitor” is a molecule, e.g., a small molecule, antibody, CAR or cell comprising a CAR, which causes the reduction in a certain parameter, e.g., an activity, e.g., growth or proliferation, of a B-cell, or which causes a reduction in a certain parameter, e.g., an activity, of a molecule associated with a B cell. Non-limiting examples of molecules associated with a B cell include proteins expressed on the surface of B cells, e.g., CD20, CD10, CD19, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a.</div>

Non-cancer related indications associated with expression of CD20 may also be included. In some embodiments, the CD20-expressing cells express, or at any time expressed, CD20 mRNA. In an embodiment, the CD20-expressing cells produce a CD20 protein (e.g., wild-type or mutant), and the CD20 protein may be present at normal levels or reduced levels. In an embodiment, the CD20-expressing cells produced detectable levels of a CD20 protein at one point, and subsequently produced substantially no detectable CD20 protein.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0328" num="0342">As used herein, unless otherwise specified, the terms “prevent,” “preventing” and “prevention” refer to an action that occurs before the subject begins to suffer from the condition, or relapse of the condition. Prevention need not result in a complete prevention of the condition; partial prevention or reduction of the condition or a symptom of the condition, or reduction of the risk of developing the condition, is encompassed by this term.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0343">Administered “in combination”, as used herein, means that two (or more) different treatments are delivered to the subject during the course of the subject's affliction with the disorder, e.g., the two or more treatments are delivered after the subject has been diagnosed with the disorder and before the disorder has been cured or eliminated or treatment has ceased for other reasons. In some embodiments, the delivery of one treatment is still occurring when the delivery of the second begins, so that there is overlap in terms of administration. This is sometimes referred to herein as “simultaneous” or “concurrent delivery”. In other embodiments, the delivery of one treatment ends before the delivery of the other treatment begins. In some embodiments of either case, the treatment is more effective because of combined administration. For example, the second treatment is more effective, e.g., an equivalent effect is seen with less of the second treatment, or the second treatment reduces symptoms to a greater extent, than would be seen if the second treatment were administered in the absence of the first treatment, or the analogous situation is seen with the first treatment. In some embodiments, delivery is such that the reduction in a symptom, or other parameter related to the disorder is greater than what would be observed with one treatment delivered in the absence of the other. The effect of the two treatments can be partially additive, wholly additive, or greater than additive. The delivery can be such that an effect of the first treatment delivered is still detectable when the second is delivered. In one embodiment, the CAR-expressing cell is administered at a dose and/or dosing schedule described herein, and the B-cell inhibitor, or agent that enhances the activity of the CD19 CAR-expressing cell is administered at a dose and/or dosing schedule described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0330" num="0344">“Derived from” as that term is used herein, indicates a relationship between a first and a second molecule. It generally refers to structural similarity between the first molecule and a second molecule and does not connote or include a process or source limitation on a first molecule that is derived from a second molecule. For example, in the case of an intracellular signaling domain that is derived from a CD3zeta molecule, the intracellular signaling domain retains sufficient CD3zeta structure such that is has the required function, namely, the ability to generate a signal under the appropriate conditions. It does not connote or include a limitation to a particular process of producing the intracellular signaling domain, e.g., it does not mean that, to provide the intracellular signaling domain, one must start with a CD3zeta sequence and delete unwanted sequence, or impose mutations, to arrive at the intracellular signaling domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0331" num="0345">The term “signaling domain” refers to the functional portion of a protein which acts by transmitting information within the cell to regulate cellular activity via defined signaling pathways by generating second messengers or functioning as effectors by responding to such messengers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0332" num="0346">As used herein, the term “CD19” refers to the Cluster of Differentiation 19 protein, which is an antigenic determinant detectable on leukemia precursor cells. The human and murine amino acid and nucleic acid sequences can be found in a public database, such as GenBank, UniProt and Swiss-Prot. For example, the amino acid sequence of human CD19 can be found as UniProt/Swiss-Prot Accession No. P15391 and the nucleotide sequence encoding of the human CD19 can be found at Accession No. NM_001178098. As used herein, “CD19” includes proteins comprising mutations, e.g., point mutations, fragments, insertions, deletions and splice variants of full length wild-type CD19. CD19 is expressed on most B lineage cancers, including, e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocyte leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Other cells with express CD19 are provided below in the definition of “disease associated with expression of CD19.” It is also an early marker of B cell progenitors. See, e.g., Nicholson et al. Mol. Immun. 34 (16-17): 1157-1165 (1997). In one aspect the antigen-binding portion of the CART recognizes and binds an antigen within the extracellular domain of the CD19 protein. In one aspect, the CD19 protein is expressed on a cancer cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0333" num="0347">The term “antibody,” as used herein, refers to a protein, or polypeptide sequence derived from an immunoglobulin molecule which specifically binds with an antigen. Antibodies can be polyclonal or monoclonal, multiple or single chain, or intact immunoglobulins, and may be derived from natural sources or from recombinant sources. Antibodies can be tetramers of immunoglobulin molecules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0334" num="0348">The term “antibody fragment” refers to at least one portion of an antibody, that retains the ability to specifically interact with (e.g., by binding, steric hindrance, stabilizing/destabilizing, spatial distribution) an epitope of an antigen. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>, Fv fragments, scFv antibody fragments, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains, linear antibodies, single domain antibodies such as sdAb (either VL or VH), camelid VHH domains, multi-specific antibodies formed from antibody fragments such as a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region, and an isolated CDR or other epitope binding fragments of an antibody. An antigen binding fragment can also be incorporated into single domain antibodies, maxibodies, minibodies, nanobodies, intrabodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, v-NAR and bis-scFv (see, e.g., Hollinger and Hudson, Nature Biotechnology 23:1126-1136, 2005). Antigen binding fragments can also be grafted into scaffolds based on polypeptides such as a fibronectin type III (Fn3)(see U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,199, which describes fibronectin polypeptide minibodies).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0335" num="0349">The term “scFv” refers to a fusion protein comprising at least one antibody fragment comprising a variable region of a light chain and at least one antibody fragment comprising a variable region of a heavy chain, wherein the light and heavy chain variable regions are contiguously linked, e.g., via a synthetic linker, e.g., a short flexible polypeptide linker, and capable of being expressed as a single chain polypeptide, and wherein the scFv retains the specificity of the intact antibody from which it is derived. Unless specified, as used herein an scFv may have the VL and VH variable regions in either order, e.g., with respect to the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the polypeptide, the scFv may comprise VL-linker-VH or may comprise VH-linker-VL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0336" num="0350">The term “complementarity determining region” or “CDR,” as used herein, refers to the sequences of amino acids within antibody variable regions which confer antigen specificity and binding affinity. For example, in general, there are three CDRs in each heavy chain variable region (e.g., HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3) and three CDRs in each light chain variable region (LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3). The precise amino acid sequence boundaries of a given CDR can be determined using any of a number of well-known schemes, including those described by Kabat et al. (1991), “Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,” 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (“Kabat” numbering scheme), Al-Lazikani et al., (1997) JMB 273,927-948 (“Chothia” numbering scheme), or a combination thereof. Under the Kabat numbering scheme, in some embodiments, the CDR amino acid residues in the heavy chain variable domain (VH) are numbered 31-35 (HCDR1), 50-65 (HCDR2), and 95-102 (HCDR3); and the CDR amino acid residues in the light chain variable domain (VL) are numbered 24-34 (LCDR1), 50-56 (LCDR2), and 89-97 (LCDR3).

In a combined Kabat and Chothia numbering scheme, in some embodiments, the CDRs correspond to the amino acid residues that are part of a Kabat CDR, a Chothia CDR, or both. For instance, in some embodiments, the CDRs correspond to amino acid residues 26-35 (HCDR1), 50-65 (HCDR2), and 95-102 (HCDR3) in a VH, e.g., a mammalian VH, e.g., a human VH; and amino acid residues 24-34 (LCDR1), 50-56 (LCDR2), and 89-97 (LCDR3) in a VL, e.g., a mammalian VL, e.g., a human VL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0337" num="0351">As used herein, the term “binding domain” or “antibody molecule” refers to a protein, e.g., an immunoglobulin chain or fragment thereof, comprising at least one immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. The term “binding domain” or “antibody molecule” encompasses antibodies and antibody fragments. In an embodiment, an antibody molecule is a multispecific antibody molecule, e.g., it comprises a plurality of immunoglobulin variable domain sequences, wherein a first immunoglobulin variable domain sequence of the plurality has binding specificity for a first epitope and a second immunoglobulin variable domain sequence of the plurality has binding specificity for a second epitope. In an embodiment, a multispecific antibody molecule is a bispecific antibody molecule. A bispecific antibody has specificity for no more than two antigens. A bispecific antibody molecule is characterized by a first immunoglobulin variable domain sequence which has binding specificity for a first epitope and a second immunoglobulin variable domain sequence that has binding specificity for a second epitope.</div>

Kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) light chains refer to the two major antibody light chain isotypes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0341" num="0355">The term “recombinant antibody” refers to an antibody which is generated using recombinant DNA technology, such as, for example, an antibody expressed by a bacteriophage or yeast expression system. The term should also be construed to mean an antibody which has been generated by the synthesis of a DNA molecule encoding the antibody and which DNA molecule expresses an antibody protein, or an amino acid sequence specifying the antibody, wherein the DNA or amino acid sequence has been obtained using recombinant DNA or amino acid sequence technology which is available and well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0342" num="0356">The term “antigen” or “Ag” refers to a molecule that provokes an immune response. This immune response may involve either antibody production, or the activation of specific immunologically-competent cells, or both. The skilled artisan will understand that any macromolecule, including virtually all proteins or peptides, can serve as an antigen. Furthermore, antigens can be derived from recombinant or genomic DNA. A skilled artisan will understand that any DNA, which comprises a nucleotide sequences or a partial nucleotide sequence encoding a protein that elicits an immune response therefore encodes an “antigen” as that term is used herein. Furthermore, one skilled in the art will understand that an antigen need not be encoded solely by a full length nucleotide sequence of a gene. It is readily apparent that the present invention includes, but is not limited to, the use of partial nucleotide sequences of more than one gene and that these nucleotide sequences are arranged in various combinations to encode polypeptides that elicit the desired immune response. Moreover, a skilled artisan will understand that an antigen need not be encoded by a “gene” at all. It is readily apparent that an antigen can be generated synthesized or can be derived from a biological sample, or might be macromolecule besides a polypeptide. Such a biological sample can include, but is not limited to a tissue sample, a tumor sample, a cell or a fluid with other biological components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0343" num="0357">The terms “compete” or “cross-compete” are used interchangeably herein to refer to the ability of an antibody molecule to interfere with binding of an antibody molecule, e.g., an anti-CD20 or CD22 antibody molecule provided herein, to a target, e.g., human CD20 or CD22. The interference with binding can be direct or indirect (e.g., through an allosteric modulation of the antibody molecule or the target). The extent to which an antibody molecule is able to interfere with the binding of another antibody molecule to the target, and therefore whether it can be said to compete, can be determined using a competition binding assay, e.g., as described herein. In some embodiments, a competition binding assay is a quantitative competition assay. In some embodiments, a first antibody molecule is said to compete for binding to the target with a second antibody molecule when the binding of the first antibody molecule to the target is reduced by 10% or more, e.g., 20% or more, 30% or more, 40% or more, 50% or more, 55% or more, 60% or more, 65% or more, 70% or more, 75% or more, 80% or more, 85% or more, 90% or more, 95% or more, 98% or more, 99% or more in a competition binding assay (e.g., a competition assay described herein).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0344" num="0358">As used herein, the term “epitope” refers to the moieties of an antigen (e.g., human CD20 or CD22) that specifically interact with an antibody molecule. Such moieties, referred to herein as epitopic determinants, typically comprise, or are part of, elements such as amino acid side chains or sugar side chains. An epitopic determinate can be defined, e.g., by methods known in the art or disclosed herein, e.g., by crystallography or by hydrogen-deuterium exchange. At least one or some of the moieties on the antibody molecule, that specifically interact with an epitopic determinant, are typically located in a CDR(s). Typically an epitope has a specific three dimensional structural characteristics. Typically an epitope has specific charge characteristics. Some epitopes are linear epitopes while others are conformational epitopes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0345" num="0359">The term “anti-cancer effect” refers to a biological effect which can be manifested by various means, including but not limited to, e.g., a decrease in tumor volume, a decrease in the number of cancer cells, a decrease in the number of metastases, an increase in life expectancy, decrease in cancer cell proliferation, decrease in cancer cell survival, or amelioration of various physiological symptoms associated with the cancerous condition. An “anti-cancer effect” can also be manifested by the ability of the peptides, polynucleotides, cells and antibodies described herein in prevention of the occurrence of cancer in the first place. The term “anti-tumor effect” refers to a biological effect which can be manifested by various means, including but not limited to, e.g., a decrease in tumor volume, a decrease in the number of tumor cells, a decrease in tumor cell proliferation, or a decrease in tumor cell survival.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0346" num="0360">The term “autologous” refers to any material derived from the same individual to whom it is later to be re-introduced into the individual.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0347" num="0361">The term “allogeneic” refers to any material derived from a different animal of the same species as the individual to whom the material is introduced.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0349" num="0363">The term “cancer” refers to a disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of aberrant cells. Cancer cells can spread locally or through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body. Examples of various cancers are described herein and include but are not limited to, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, skin cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cancer, liver cancer, brain cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, lung cancer and the like. The terms “tumor” and “cancer” are used interchangeably herein, e.g., both terms encompass solid and liquid, e.g., diffuse or circulating, tumors. As used herein, the term “cancer” or “tumor” includes premalignant, as well as malignant cancers and tumors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0364">The terms “cancer associated antigen” or “tumor antigen” or “proliferative disorder antigen” or “antigen associated with a proliferative disorder” interchangeably refers to a molecule (typically protein, carbohydrate or lipid) that is preferentially expressed on the surface of a cancer cell, either entirely or as a fragment (e.g., MHC/peptide), in comparison to a normal cell, and which is useful for the preferential targeting of a pharmacological agent to the cancer cell. In some embodiments, a tumor antigen is a marker expressed by both normal cells and cancer cells, e.g., a lineage marker, e.g., CD19 on B cells. In certain aspects, the tumor antigens of the present invention are derived from, cancers including but not limited to primary or metastatic melanoma, thymoma, lymphoma, sarcoma, lung cancer, liver cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemias, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer and adenocarcinomas such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and the like. In some embodiments, the tumor antigen is an antigen that is common to a specific proliferative disorder. In some embodiments, a cancer-associated antigen is a cell surface molecule that is overexpressed in a cancer cell in comparison to a normal cell, for instance, 1-fold over expression, 2-fold overexpression, 3-fold overexpression or more in comparison to a normal cell. In some embodiments, a cancer-associated antigen is a cell surface molecule that is inappropriately synthesized in the cancer cell, for instance, a molecule that contains deletions, additions or mutations in comparison to the molecule expressed on a normal cell. In some embodiments, a cancer-associated antigen will be expressed exclusively on the cell surface of a cancer cell, entirely or as a fragment (e.g., MHC/peptide), and not synthesized or expressed on the surface of a normal cell. In some embodiments, the CARs of the present invention includes CARs comprising an antigen binding domain (e.g., antibody or antibody fragment) that binds to a MHC presented peptide. Normally, peptides derived from endogenous proteins fill the pockets of Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, and are recognized by T cell receptors (TCRs) on CD8+ T lymphocytes. The MHC class I complexes are constitutively expressed by all nucleated cells. In cancer, virus-specific and/or tumor-specific peptide/MHC complexes represent a unique class of cell surface targets for immunotherapy. TCR-like antibodies targeting peptides derived from viral or tumor antigens in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A1 or HLA-A2 have been described (see, e.g., Sastry et al., J Virol. 2011 85(5):1935-1942; Sergeeva et al., Bood, 2011 117(16):4262-4272; Verma et al., J Immunol 2010 184(4):2156-2165; Willemsen et al., Gene Ther 2001 8(21):1601-1608; Dao et al., Sci Transl Med 2013 5(176):176ra33; Tassev et al., Cancer Gene Ther 2012 19(2):84-100).

For the avoidance of doubt, a disease associated with expression of CD19 may include a condition associated with cells which do not presently express CD19, e.g., because CD19 expression has been downregulated, e.g., due to treatment with a molecule targeting CD19, e.g., a CD19 CAR, but which at one time expressed CD19. In one aspect, a cancer associated with expression of CD19 is a hematological cancer. In one aspect, the hematological cancer is a leukemia or a lymphoma.

Non-cancer related indications associated with expression of CD19 include, but are not limited to, e.g., autoimmune disease, (e.g., lupus), inflammatory disorders (allergy and asthma) and transplantation. In some embodiments, the CD19-expressing cells express, or at any time expressed, CD19 mRNA. In an embodiment, the CD19-expressing cells produce a CD19 protein (e.g., wild-type or mutant), and the CD19 protein may be present at normal levels or reduced levels. In an embodiment, the CD19-expressing cells produced detectable levels of a CD19 protein at one point, and subsequently produced substantially no detectable CD19 protein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0352" num="0366">The term “conservative sequence modifications” refers to amino acid modifications that do not significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics of the antibody or antibody fragment containing the amino acid sequence. Such conservative modifications include amino acid substitutions, additions and deletions. Modifications can be introduced into an antibody or antibody fragment of the invention by standard techniques known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Conservative amino acid substitutions are ones in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, one or more amino acid residues within a CAR of the invention can be replaced with other amino acid residues from the same side chain family and the altered CAR can be tested using the functional assays described herein.</div>

Stimulation can mediate altered expression of certain molecules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0354" num="0368">The term “stimulatory molecule,” refers to a molecule expressed by an immune cell, e.g., T cell, NK cell, or B cell) that provides the cytoplasmic signaling sequence(s) that regulate activation of the immune cell in a stimulatory way for at least some aspect of the immune cell signaling pathway. In one aspect, the signal is a primary signal that is initiated by, for instance, binding of a TCR/CD3 complex with an MHC molecule loaded with peptide, and which leads to mediation of a T cell response, including, but not limited to, proliferation, activation, differentiation, and the like. A primary cytoplasmic signaling sequence (also referred to as a “primary signaling domain”) that acts in a stimulatory manner may contain a signaling motif which is known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif or ITAM. Examples of an ITAM containing cytoplasmic signaling sequence that is of particular use in the invention includes, but is not limited to, those derived from CD3 zeta, common FcR gamma (FCER1G), Fc gamma RIIa, FcR beta (Fc Epsilon Rib), CD3 gamma, CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon, CD79a, CD79b, DAP10, and DAP12.

In a specific CAR of the invention, the primary signaling sequence of CD3-zeta is the sequence provided as SEQ ID NO:17, or the equivalent residues from a non-human species, e.g., mouse, rodent, monkey, ape and the like. In a specific CAR of the invention, the primary signaling sequence of CD3-zeta is the sequence as provided in SEQ ID NO:43, or the equivalent residues from a non-human species, e.g., mouse, rodent, monkey, ape and the like.</div>

T-cells may recognize these complexes using their T-cell receptors (TCRs). APCs process antigens and present them to T-cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0356" num="0370">“Immune effector cell,” as that term is used herein, refers to a cell that is involved in an immune response, e.g., in the promotion of an immune effector response. Examples of immune effector cells include T cells, e.g., alpha/beta T cells and gamma/delta T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T (NK-T) cells, mast cells, and myeloid-derived phagocytes.</div>

E.g., an immune effector function or response refers a property of a T or NK cell that promotes killing or the inhibition of growth or proliferation, of a target cell. In the case of a T cell, primary stimulation and co-stimulation are examples of immune effector function or response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0358" num="0372">The term “effector function” refers to a specialized function of a cell. Effector function of a T cell, for example, may be cytolytic activity or helper activity including the secretion of cytokines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0373">An “intracellular signaling domain,” as the term is used herein, refers to an intracellular portion of a molecule. The intracellular signaling domain can generate a signal that promotes an immune effector function of the CAR containing cell, e.g., a CART cell. Examples of immune effector function, e.g., in a CART cell, include cytolytic activity and helper activity, including the secretion of cytokines. In embodiments, the intracellular signal domain is the portion of the protein which transduces the effector function signal and directs the cell to perform a specialized function. While the entire intracellular signaling domain can be employed, in many cases it is not necessary to use the entire chain. To the extent that a truncated portion of the intracellular signaling domain is used, such truncated portion may be used in place of the intact chain as long as it transduces the effector function signal. The term intracellular signaling domain is thus meant to include any truncated portion of the intracellular signaling domain sufficient to transduce the effector function signal.</div>

Thus, a gene, cDNA, or RNA, encodes a protein if transcription and translation of mRNA corresponding to that gene produces the protein in a cell or other biological system. Both the coding strand, the nucleotide sequence of which is identical to the mRNA sequence and is usually provided in sequence listings, and the non-coding strand, used as the template for transcription of a gene or cDNA, can be referred to as encoding the protein or other product of that gene or cDNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0367" num="0381">Unless otherwise specified, a “nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence” includes all nucleotide sequences that are degenerate versions of each other and that encode the same amino acid sequence.

Thus, the term “transfer vector” includes an autonomously replicating plasmid or a virus. The term should also be construed to further include non-plasmid and non-viral compounds which facilitate transfer of nucleic acid into cells, such as, for example, a polylysine compound, liposome, and the like. Examples of viral transfer vectors include, but are not limited to, adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated virus vectors, retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0373" num="0387">The term “expression vector” refers to a vector comprising a recombinant polynucleotide comprising expression control sequences operatively linked to a nucleotide sequence to be expressed. An expression vector comprises sufficient cis-acting elements for expression; other elements for expression can be supplied by the host cell or in an in vitro expression system. Expression vectors include all those known in the art, including cosmids, plasmids (e.g., naked or contained in liposomes) and viruses (e.g., lentiviruses, retroviruses, adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses) that incorporate the recombinant polynucleotide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0374" num="0388">The term “lentivirus” refers to a genus of the Retroviridae family. Lentiviruses are unique among the retroviruses in being able to infect non-dividing cells; they can deliver a significant amount of genetic information into the DNA of the host cell, so they are one of the most efficient methods of a gene delivery vector. HIV, SIV, and FIV are all examples of lentiviruses.</div>

When a subunit position in both of the two molecules is occupied by the same monomeric subunit; e.g., if a position in each of two DNA molecules is occupied by adenine, then they are homologous or identical at that position. The homology between two sequences is a direct function of the number of matching or homologous positions; e.g., if half (e.g., five positions in a polymer ten subunits in length) of the positions in two sequences are homologous, the two sequences are 50% homologous; if 90% of the positions (e.g., 9 of 10), are matched or homologous, the two sequences are 90% homologous.</div>

For the most part, humanized antibodies and antibody fragments thereof are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody or antibody fragment) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, a humanized antibody/antibody fragment can comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications can further refine and optimize antibody or antibody fragment performance. In general, the humanized antibody or antibody fragment thereof will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or a significant portion of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody or antibody fragment can also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0381" num="0395">The term “operably linked” or “transcriptional control” refers to functional linkage between a regulatory sequence and a heterologous nucleic acid sequence resulting in expression of the latter. For example, a first nucleic acid sequence is operably linked with a second nucleic acid sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is placed in a functional relationship with the second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if the promoter affects the transcription or expression of the coding sequence. Operably linked DNA sequences can be contiguous with each other and, e.g., where necessary to join two protein coding regions, are in the same reading frame.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0391" num="0405">As used herein, a 5′ cap (also termed an RNA cap, an RNA 7-methylguanosine cap or an RNA m<sup>7</sup>G cap) is a modified guanine nucleotide that has been added to the “front” or 5′ end of a eukaryotic messenger RNA shortly after the start of transcription. The 5′ cap consists of a terminal group which is linked to the first transcribed nucleotide. Its presence is important for recognition by the ribosome and protection from RNases. Cap addition is coupled to transcription, and occurs co-transcriptionally, such that each influences the other. Shortly after the start of transcription, the 5′ end of the mRNA being synthesized is bound by a cap-synthesizing complex associated with RNA polymerase. This enzymatic complex catalyzes the chemical reactions that are required for mRNA capping. Synthesis proceeds as a multi-step biochemical reaction. The capping moiety can be modified to modulate functionality of mRNA such as its stability or efficiency of translation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0392" num="0406">As used herein, “in vitro transcribed RNA” refers to RNA, e.g., mRNA, that has been synthesized in vitro.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0393" num="0407">As used herein, a “poly(A)” is a series of adenosines attached by polyadenylation to the mRNA. In some embodiments of a construct for transient expression, the polyA is between 50 and 5000 (SEQ ID NO: 28), e.g., greater than 64, e.g., greater than 100, e.g., than 300 or 400. Poly(A) sequences can be modified chemically or enzymatically to modulate mRNA functionality such as localization, stability or efficiency of translation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0394" num="0408">As used herein, “polyadenylation” refers to the covalent linkage of a polyadenylyl moiety, or its modified variant, to a messenger RNA molecule. In eukaryotic organisms, most messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are polyadenylated at the 3′ end. The 3′ poly(A) tail is a long sequence of adenine nucleotides (often several hundred) added to the pre-mRNA through the action of an enzyme, polyadenylate polymerase. In higher eukaryotes, the poly(A) tail is added onto transcripts that contain a specific sequence, the polyadenylation signal. The poly(A) tail and the protein bound to it aid in protecting mRNA from degradation by exonucleases. Polyadenylation is also important for transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. Polyadenylation occurs in the nucleus immediately after transcription of DNA into RNA, but additionally can also occur later in the cytoplasm. After transcription has been terminated, the mRNA chain is cleaved through the action of an endonuclease complex associated with RNA polymerase. The cleavage site is usually characterized by the presence of the base sequence AAUAAA near the cleavage site. After the mRNA has been cleaved, adenosine residues are added to the free 3′ end at the cleavage site.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0395" num="0409">As used herein, “transient” refers to expression of a non-integrated transgene for a period of hours, days or weeks, wherein the period of time of expression is less than the period of time for expression of the gene if integrated into the genome or contained within a stable plasmid replicon in the host cell.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0403" num="0417">A subject “responds” to treatment if a parameter of a cancer (e.g., a hematological cancer, e.g., cancer cell growth, proliferation and/or survival) in the subject is retarded or reduced by a detectable amount, e.g., about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more as determined by any appropriate measure, e.g., by mass, cell count or volume. In one example, a subject responds to treatment if the subject experiences a life expectancy extended by about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or more beyond the life expectancy predicted if no treatment is administered. In another example, a subject responds to treatment, if the subject has an increased disease-free survival, overall survival or increased time to progression. Several methods can be used to determine if a patient responds to a treatment including, for example, criteria provided by NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®).

The reappearance may involve the level of cancer cells rising above a certain threshold, e.g., above 20%, 1%, 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1%. For example, e.g., in the context of B-ALL, the reappearance may involve, e.g., a reappearance of blasts in the blood, bone marrow (&gt;5%), or any extramedullary site, after a complete response. A complete response, in this context, may involve &lt;5% BM blast. More generally, in an embodiment, a response (e.g., complete response or partial response) can involve the absence of detectable MRD (minimal residual disease). In an embodiment, the initial period of responsiveness lasts at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 days; at least 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks; at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 months; or at least 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 years.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0406" num="0420">In some embodiments, a therapy that includes a CD19 inhibitor, e.g., a CD19 CAR therapy, may relapse or be refractory to treatment. The relapse or resistance can be caused by CD19 loss (e.g., an antigen loss mutation) or other CD19 alteration that reduces the level of CD19 (e.g., caused by clonal selection of CD19-negative clones). A cancer that harbors such CD19 loss or alteration is referred to herein as a “CD19-negative cancer” or a “CD19-negative relapsed cancer”). It shall be understood that a CD19-negative cancer need not have 100% loss of CD19, but a sufficient reduction to reduce the effectiveness of a CD19 therapy such that the cancer relapses or becomes refractory. In some embodiments, a CD19-negative cancer results from a CD19 CAR therapy.</div>

The association results in a functional coupling of a first entity linked to, e.g., fused to, a first switch domain, and a second entity linked to, e.g., fused to, a second switch domain. A first and second switch domain are collectively referred to as a dimerization switch. In embodiments, the first and second switch domains are the same as one another, e.g., they are polypeptides having the same primary amino acid sequence, and are referred to collectively as a homodimerization switch.

Methods for evaluating mTOR activity, e.g., by inhibition of P70 S6 kinase, are discussed herein. The dose is insufficient to result in complete immune suppression but is sufficient to enhance the immune response. In an embodiment, the low, immune enhancing, dose of mTOR inhibitor results in a decrease in the number of PD-1 positive T cells and/or an increase in the number of PD-1 negative T cells, or an increase in the ratio of PD-1 negative T cells/PD-1 positive T cells. In an embodiment, the low, immune enhancing, dose of mTOR inhibitor results in an increase in the number of naive T cells.

In one aspect, the invention provides a cell (e.g., T cell) engineered to express a CAR, wherein the CAR T cell (“CART”) exhibits an anticancer property. In one aspect a cell is transformed with the CAR and the CAR is expressed on the cell surface. In some embodiments, the cell (e.g., T cell) is transduced with a viral vector encoding a CAR. In some embodiments, the viral vector is a retroviral vector. In some embodiments, the viral vector is a lentiviral vector. In some such embodiments, the cell may stably express the CAR. In another embodiment, the cell (e.g., T cell) is transfected with a nucleic acid, e.g., mRNA, cDNA, DNA, encoding a CAR. In some such embodiments, the cell may transiently express the CAR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0421" num="0435">In one aspect, the anti-CD19 protein binding portion of the CAR is a scFv antibody fragment.

In one aspect such antibody fragments are functional in that they provide a biological response that can include, but is not limited to, activation of an immune response, inhibition of signal-transduction origination from its target antigen, inhibition of kinase activity, and the like, as will be understood by a skilled artisan. In one aspect, the anti-CD19 antigen binding domain of the CAR is a scFv antibody fragment that is humanized compared to the murine sequence of the scFv from which it is derived. In one aspect, the parental murine scFv sequence is the CAR19 construct provided in PCT publication WO2012/079000 and provided herein as SEQ ID NO:59.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0599" num="0613">As used herein, the term “CD79b” refers to an antigenic determinant known to be detectable on some malignant hematological cancer cells, e.g., leukemia cells. The human and murine amino acid and nucleic acid sequences can be found in a public database, such as GenBank, UniProt and Swiss-Prot. For example, the amino acid sequences of human CD79b can be found at Accession Nos. NP_000617.1 (isoform 1 precursor), NP_067613.1 (isoform 2 precursor), or NP_001035022.1 (isoform 3 precursor), and the mRNA sequences encoding them can be found at Accession Nos. NM_000626.2 (transcript variant 1) NM_021602.2 (transcript variant 2), or NM_001039933.1 (transcript variant 3). As used herein, “CD79b” includes proteins comprising mutations, e.g., point mutations, fragments, insertions, deletions and splice variants of full length wild-type CD79b. In one aspect the antigen-binding portion of the CAR recognizes and binds an antigen within the extracellular domain of the CD79b protein. In one aspect, the CD79b protein is expressed on a cancer cell. In embodiments, the CD79b protein is a wild-type CD79b protein; in other embodiments, the CD79b protein is a mutant CD79b protein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0600" num="0614">CD79b is also called immunoglobulin-associated beta, which is a component of the B lymphocyte antigen receptor multimeric complex. CD79b forms a heterodimer with another accessory protein called CD79a (immunoglobulin-associated alpha), and the heterodimer complexes with surface immunoglobulins on B cells. CD79b is important for the assembly of and surface expression of the B lymphocyte antigen receptor. CD79b and CD79a are important for pre-B-cell and B-cell development. Mutation and aberrant CD79b expression occurs in many B-CLL cells and may be correlated with the loss of surface expression and/or defective signaling of B lymphocyte antigen receptor in B-CLL. See, e.g., Thompson et al. Blood 90.4(1997):1387-94. In some cases, overexpression of a mutant form or splice variant of CD79b has been correlated with diminished B lymphocyte antigen receptor in B-CLL and other lymphoid malignancies. See, e.g., Cragg et al. Blood 100.9(2002):3068-76.</div>

In one aspect, the CD79a protein is expressed on a cancer cell. In embodiments, the CD79a protein is a wild-type CD79a protein; in other embodiments, the CD79a protein is a mutant CD79a protein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0616" num="0630">CD79a is also called immunoglobulin-associated alpha. CD79a heterodimerizes with CD79b to form a component of the B lymphocyte antigen receptor multimeric complex. CD79a is expressed in many hematological cancers, e.g., acute leukemias (e.g., AML), B-cell Lymphomas, and Myelomas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0617" num="0631">Provided herein are CD79a inhibitors and combination therapies. CD79a inhibitors include but are not limited to small molecules, recombinant proteins, anti-CD79a CAR-expressing cells, e.g. CARTs, and anti-CD79a antibodies (e.g., an anti-CD79a mono- or bispecific antibody) and fragments thereof. In some embodiments, anti-CD79a inhibitors can be used to treat a B-cell malignancy described herein. In an embodiment, the CD79a inhibitor is administered in combination with a CD19 inhibitor, e.g., a CD19 CAR-expressing cell, e.g., a CAR-expressing cell described herein, e.g., a cell expressing a CAR comprising an antibody binding domain that is murine, human, or humanized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0618" num="0632">In an embodiment, the CD79a inhibitor is an anti-CD79a antibody or fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the anti-CD79a antibody or fragment thereof comprises a monoclonal antibody, e.g., a monospecific or bispecific antibody or fragment thereof. For example, the anti-CD79a antibody or fragment thereof comprises an anti-CD79a antibody or fragment thereof (e.g., variable regions or CDRs) described in Poison et al. Blood 110.2(2007):616-23, incorporated herein by reference. For example, the anti-CD79a antibody or fragment thereof comprises the 7H7, 15E4, or 16C11 antibody or fragment thereof (e.g., variable regions or CDRs) described in Polson et al. See Id.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0619" num="0633">In some embodiments, the CD79a inhibitor is conjugated or otherwise bound to a therapeutic agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0620" num="0634">In some embodiments, a CD79a inhibitor includes an anti-CD79a CAR-expressing cell, e.g., CART, e.g., a cell expressing an anti-CD79a CAR construct or encoded by a CD79a binding CAR comprising a scFv, CDRs, or VH and VL chains. For example, an anti-CD79a CAR-expressing cell, e.g., CART is a generated by engineering a CD79a-CAR (that comprises a CD79a binding domain) into a cell (e.g., a T cell or NK cell), e.g., for administration in combination with a CAR-expressing cell described herein. Also provided herein are methods of use of the CAR-expressing cells described herein for adoptive therapy.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0623" num="0637">The inhibitors herein, e.g., CAR-expressing cells directed against CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a, may comprise one or more of the compositions described herein, e.g., a transmembrane domain, intracellular signaling domain, costimulatory domain, leader sequence, or hinge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0624" num="0638">In one aspect, the present invention encompasses a recombinant nucleic acid construct comprising a transgene encoding a CAR. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding an anti-CD19 binding domain selected from one or more of SEQ ID NOS:61-72, wherein the sequence is contiguous with and in the same reading frame as the nucleic acid sequence encoding an intracellular signaling domain. An exemplary intracellular signaling domain that can be used in the CAR includes, but is not limited to, one or more intracellular signaling domains of, e.g., CD3-zeta, CD28, 4-1BB, and the like. In some instances, the CAR can comprise any combination of CD3-zeta, CD28, 4-1BB, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0625" num="0639">In one aspect, the present invention contemplates modifications of the starting antibody or fragment (e.g., scFv) amino acid sequence that generate functionally equivalent molecules. For example, the VH or VL of an antigen binding domain, e.g., scFv, comprised in the CAR can be modified to retain at least about 70%, 71%. 72%. 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% identity of the starting VH or VL framework region of the antigen binding domain, e.g., scFv. The present invention contemplates modifications of the entire CAR construct, e.g., modifications in one or more amino acid sequences of the various domains of the CAR construct in order to generate functionally equivalent molecules. The CAR construct can be modified to retain at least about 70%, 71%. 72%. 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% identity of the starting CAR construct.

For instance, the CDR may have, e.g., up to and including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 alterations (e.g., substitutions) relative to a CDR sequence provided herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0626" num="0640">The nucleic acid sequences coding for the desired molecules can be obtained using recombinant methods known in the art, such as, for example by screening libraries from cells expressing the gene, by deriving the gene from a vector known to include the same, or by isolating directly from cells and tissues containing the same, using standard techniques. Alternatively, the nucleic acid of interest can be produced synthetically, rather than cloned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0627" num="0641">The present invention includes, among other things, retroviral and lentiviral vector constructs expressing a CAR that can be directly transduced into a cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0628" num="0642">The present invention also includes an RNA construct that can be directly transfected into a cell. A method for generating mRNA for use in transfection involves in vitro transcription (IVT) of a template with specially designed primers, followed by polyA addition, to produce a construct containing 3′ and 5′ untranslated sequence (“UTR”), a 5′ cap and/or Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES), the nucleic acid to be expressed, and a polyA tail, typically 50-2000 bases in length (SEQ ID NO:118). RNA so produced can efficiently transfect different kinds of cells. In one embodiment, the template includes sequences for the CAR. In an embodiment, an RNA CAR vector is transduced into a T cell by electroporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0629" num="0643">Antigen Binding Domain</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0630" num="0644">In one aspect, the CAR of the invention comprises a target-specific binding element otherwise referred to as an antigen binding domain. The choice of moiety depends upon the type and number of ligands that define the surface of a target cell. For example, the antigen binding domain may be chosen to recognize a ligand that acts as a cell surface marker on target cells associated with a particular disease state. Thus examples of cell surface markers that may act as ligands for the antigen binding domain in a CAR of the invention include those associated with viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, autoimmune disease and cancer cells. The antigen-binding domain can bind, e.g., one or more of CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0631" num="0645">In one aspect, the CAR-mediated T-cell response can be directed to an antigen of interest by way of engineering an antigen binding domain that specifically binds a desired antigen into the CAR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0632" num="0646">The antigen binding domain (e.g., an antigen-binding domain that binds one or more of CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a) can be any domain that binds to the antigen including but not limited to a monoclonal antibody, a polyclonal antibody, a recombinant antibody, a murine antibody, a human antibody, a humanized antibody, and a functional fragment thereof, including but not limited to a single-domain antibody such as a heavy chain variable domain (VH), a light chain variable domain (VL) and a variable domain (VHH) of camelid derived nanobody, and to an alternative scaffold known in the art to function as antigen binding domain, such as a recombinant fibronectin domain, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0633" num="0647">In some instances, it is beneficial for the antigen binding domain to be derived from the same species in which the CAR will ultimately be used in. For example, for use in humans, it may be beneficial for the antigen binding domain (e.g., an antigen-binding domain that binds one or more of CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a) of the CAR to comprise human or humanized residues for the antigen binding domain of an antibody or antibody fragment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0634" num="0648">A humanized antibody can be produced using a variety of techniques known in the art, including but not limited to, CDR-grafting (see, e.g., European Patent No. EP 239,400; International Publication No. WO 91/09967; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539, 5,530,101, and 5,585,089, each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference), veneering or resurfacing (see, e.g., European Patent Nos. EP 592,106 and EP 519,596; Padlan, 1991, Molecular Immunology, 28(4/5):489-498; Studnicka et al., 1994, Protein Engineering, 7(6):805-814; and Roguska et al., 1994, PNAS, 91:969-973, each of which is incorporated herein by its entirety by reference), chain shuffling (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference), and techniques disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2005/0042664, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2005/0048617, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,407,213, 5,766,886, International Publication No. WO 9317105, Tan et al., J.

Mol. Biol., 235(3):959-73 (1994), each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Often, framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, for example improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well-known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; and Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature, 332:323, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0635" num="0649">A humanized antibody or antibody fragment has one or more amino acid residues remaining in it from a source which is nonhuman. These nonhuman amino acid residues are often referred to as “import” residues, which are typically taken from an “import” variable domain. As provided herein, humanized antibodies or antibody fragments comprise one or more CDRs from nonhuman immunoglobulin molecules and framework regions wherein the amino acid residues comprising the framework are derived completely or mostly from human germline. Multiple techniques for humanization of antibodies or antibody fragments are well-known in the art and can essentially be performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody, i.e., CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT Publication No. WO 91/09967; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,567; 6,331,415; 5,225,539; 5,530,101; 5,585,089; 6,548,640, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety). In such humanized antibodies and antibody fragments, substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a nonhuman species. Humanized antibodies are often human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some framework (FR) residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. Humanization of antibodies and antibody fragments can also be achieved by veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, 1991, Molecular Immunology, 28(4/5):489-498; Studnicka et al., Protein Engineering, 7(6):805-814 (1994); and Roguska et al., PNAS, 91:969-973 (1994)) or chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0636" num="0650">The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called “best-fit” method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., J. Immunol., 151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196:901 (1987), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety). Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (see, e.g., Nicholson et al. Mol. Immun. 34 (16-17): 1157-1165 (1997); Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., J. Immunol., 151:2623 (1993), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety). In some embodiments, the framework region, e.g., all four framework regions, of the heavy chain variable region are derived from a VH4_4-59 germline sequence. In one embodiment, the framework region can comprise, one, two, three, four or five modifications, e.g., substitutions, e.g., from the amino acid at the corresponding murine sequence (e.g., of SEQ ID NO:59). In one embodiment, the framework region, e.g., all four framework regions of the light chain variable region are derived from a VK3_1.25 germline sequence. In one embodiment, the framework region can comprise, one, two, three, four or five modifications, e.g., substitutions, e.g., from the amino acid at the corresponding murine sequence (e.g., of SEQ ID NO:59).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0637" num="0651">In some aspects, the portion of a CAR composition of the invention that comprises an antibody fragment is humanized with retention of high affinity for the target antigen and other favorable biological properties. According to one aspect of the invention, humanized antibodies and antibody fragments are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, e.g., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind the target antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody or antibody fragment characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen, is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0638" num="0652">A humanized antibody or antibody fragment may retain a similar antigenic specificity as the original antibody, e.g., in the present invention, the ability to bind human CD19, CD20, or CD22. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody or antibody fragment may have improved affinity and/or specificity of binding to human CD19, CD20, or CD22.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0639" num="0653">In one aspect, the binding domain (e.g., an antigen-binding domain that binds one or more of CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a) is a fragment, e.g., a single chain variable fragment (scFv). In one aspect, the binding domain is a Fv, a Fab, a (Fab′)2, or a bi-functional (e.g. bi-specific) hybrid antibody (e.g., Lanzavecchia et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 17, 105 (1987)). In one aspect, the antibodies and fragments thereof of the invention binds a CD19, CD20, or CD22 protein with wild-type or enhanced affinity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0640" num="0654">In some instances, scFvs can be prepared according to method known in the art (see, for example, Bird et al., (1988) Science 242:423-426 and Huston et al., (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). ScFv molecules can be produced by linking VH and VL regions together using flexible polypeptide linkers. The scFv molecules comprise a linker (e.g., a Ser-Gly linker) with an optimized length and/or amino acid composition. The linker length can greatly affect how the variable regions of a scFv fold and interact. In fact, if a short polypeptide linker is employed (e.g., between 5-10 amino acids) intrachain folding is prevented. Interchain folding is also required to bring the two variable regions together to form a functional epitope binding site. For examples of linker orientation and size see, e.g., Hollinger et al. 1993 Proc Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6444-6448, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0100543, 2005/0175606, 2007/0014794, and PCT publication Nos. WO2006/020258 and WO2007/024715, is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0641" num="0655">An scFv can comprise a linker of at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or more amino acid residues between its VL and VH regions. The linker sequence may comprise any naturally occurring amino acid. In some embodiments, the linker sequence comprises amino acids glycine and serine. In another embodiment, the linker sequence comprises sets of glycine and serine repeats such as (Gly<sub>4</sub>Ser)n, where n is a positive integer equal to or greater than 1 (SEQ ID NO:18). In one embodiment, the linker can be (Gly<sub>4</sub>Ser)<sub>4 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:106) or (Gly<sub>4</sub>Ser)<sub>3</sub>(SEQ ID NO:107). Variation in the linker length may retain or enhance activity, giving rise to superior efficacy in activity studies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0642" num="0656">In some embodiments, the amino acid sequence of the antigen binding domain (e.g., an antigen-binding domain that binds one or more of CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a) or other portions or the entire CAR) can be modified, e.g., an amino acid sequence described herein can be modified, e.g., by a conservative substitution. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0643" num="0657">Percent identity in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refers to two or more sequences that are the same. Two sequences are “substantially identical” if two sequences have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (e.g., 60% identity, optionally 70%, 71%. 72%. 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% identity over a specified region, or, when not specified, over the entire sequence), when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. Optionally, the identity exists over a region that is at least about 50 nucleotides (or 10 amino acids) in length, or over a region that is 100 to 500 or 1000 or more nucleotides (or 20, 50, 200 or more amino acids) in length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0644" num="0658">For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, (1970) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482c, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, (1988) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Brent et al., (2003) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0645" num="0659">Two examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., (1977) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402; and Altschul et al., (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0646" num="0660">The percent identity between two amino acid sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller, (1988) Comput. Appl. Biosci. 4:11-17) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:444-453) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at www.gcg.com), using either a Blossom 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0647" num="0661">In one aspect, the present invention contemplates modifications of the starting antibody or fragment (e.g., scFv) amino acid sequence that generate functionally equivalent molecules. For example, the VH or VL of a binding domain (e.g., an antigen-binding domain that binds one or more of CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a), e.g., scFv, comprised in the CAR can be modified to retain at least about 70%, 71%. 72%. 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% identity of the starting VH or VL framework region of the anti-CD19 binding domain, e.g., scFv.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0651" num="0665">Within each antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., scFv) of a bispecific antibody molecule, the VH can be upstream or downstream of the VL. In some embodiments, the upstream antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., scFv) is arranged with its VH (VH<sub>1</sub>) upstream of its VL (VL<sub>1</sub>) and the downstream antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., scFv) is arranged with its VL (VL<sub>2</sub>) upstream of its VH (VH<sub>2</sub>), such that the overall bispecific antibody molecule has the arrangement VH<sub>1</sub>-VL<sub>1</sub>-VL<sub>2</sub>-VH<sub>2</sub>. In other embodiments, the upstream antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., scFv) is arranged with its VL (VL<sub>1</sub>) upstream of its VH (VH<sub>1</sub>) and the downstream antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., scFv) is arranged with its VH (VH<sub>2</sub>) upstream of its VL (VL<sub>2</sub>), such that the overall bispecific antibody molecule has the arrangement VL<sub>1</sub>-VH<sub>1</sub>-VH<sub>2</sub>-VL<sub>2</sub>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0653" num="0667">In one aspect, the antibodies and antibody fragments disclosed herein (e.g., those directed against CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a) can be grafted to one or more constant domain of a T cell receptor (“TCR”) chain, for example, a TCR alpha or TCR beta chain, to create an chimeric TCR that binds specifically to a cancer associated antigen. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that chimeric TCRs will signal through the TCR complex upon antigen binding. For example, an scFv as disclosed herein, can be grafted to the constant domain, e.g., at least a portion of the extracellular constant domain, the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain, of a TCR chain, for example, the TCR alpha chain and/or the TCR beta chain. As another example, an antibody fragment, for example a VL domain as described herein, can be grafted to the constant domain of a TCR alpha chain, and an antibody fragment, for example a VH domain as described herein, can be grafted to the constant domain of a TCR beta chain (or alternatively, a VL domain may be grafted to the constant domain of the TCR beta chain and a VH domain may be grafted to a TCR alpha chain). As another example, the CDRs of an antibody or antibody fragment, e.g., the CDRs of an antibody or antibody fragment as described in any of the Tables herein may be grafted into a TCR alpha and/or beta chain to create a chimeric TCR that binds specifically to a cancer associated antigen. For example, the LC CDRs disclosed herein may be grafted into the variable domain of a TCR alpha chain and the HC CDRs disclosed herein may be grafted to the variable domain of a TCR beta chain, or vice versa. Such chimeric TCRs may be produced by any appropriate method (For example, Willemsen R A et al, Gene Therapy 2000; 7: 1369-1377; Zhang T et al, Cancer Gene Ther 2004; 11: 487-496; Aggen et al, Gene Ther. 2012 April; 19(4):365-74).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0037" num="0000">Non-Antibody Scaffolds</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0654" num="0668">In embodiments, the antigen binding domain comprises a non antibody scaffold, e.g., a fibronectin, ankyrin, domain antibody, lipocalin, small modular immuno-pharmaceutical, maxybody, Protein A, or affilin. The non antibody scaffold has the ability to bind to target antigen on a cell. In embodiments, the antigen binding domain is a polypeptide or fragment thereof of a naturally occurring protein expressed on a cell. In some embodiments, the antigen binding domain comprises a non-antibody scaffold. A wide variety of non-antibody scaffolds can be employed so long as the resulting polypeptide includes at least one binding region which specifically binds to the target antigen on a target cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0655" num="0669">Non-antibody scaffolds include: fibronectin (Novartis, Mass.), ankyrin (Molecular Partners AG, Zurich, Switzerland), domain antibodies (Domantis, Ltd., Cambridge, Mass., and Ablynx nv, Zwijnaarde, Belgium), lipocalin (Pieris Proteolab AG, Freising, Germany), small modular immuno-pharmaceuticals (Trubion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Seattle, Wash.), maxybodies (Avidia, Inc., Mountain View, Calif.), Protein A (Affibody AG, Sweden), and affilin (gamma-crystallin or ubiquitin) (Scil Proteins GmbH, Halle, Germany).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0656" num="0670">Fibronectin scaffolds can be based on fibronectin type III domain (e.g., the tenth module of the fibronectin type III (<sup>10 </sup>Fn3 domain)). The fibronectin type III domain has 7 or 8 beta strands which are distributed between two beta sheets, which themselves pack against each other to form the core of the protein, and further containing loops (analogous to CDRs) which connect the beta strands to each other and are solvent exposed. There are at least three such loops at each edge of the beta sheet sandwich, where the edge is the boundary of the protein perpendicular to the direction of the beta strands (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,818,418). Because of this structure, this non-antibody scaffold mimics antigen binding properties that are similar in nature and affinity to those of antibodies. These scaffolds can be used in a loop randomization and shuffling strategy in vitro that is similar to the process of affinity maturation of antibodies in vivo.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0657" num="0671">The ankyrin technology is based on using proteins with ankyrin derived repeat modules as scaffolds for bearing variable regions which can be used for binding to different targets. The ankyrin repeat module is a 33 amino acid polypeptide consisting of two anti-parallel α-helices and a β-turn. Binding of the variable regions is mostly optimized by using ribosome display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0658" num="0672">Avimers are derived from natural A-domain containing protein such as HERS. These domains are used by nature for protein-protein interactions and in human over 250 proteins are structurally based on A-domains. Avimers consist of a number of different “A-domain” monomers (2-10) linked via amino acid linkers. Avimers can be created that can bind to the target antigen using the methodology described in, for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20040175756; 20050053973; 20050048512; and 20060008844.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0659" num="0673">Affibody affinity ligands are small, simple proteins composed of a three-helix bundle based on the scaffold of one of the IgG-binding domains of Protein A. Protein A is a surface protein from the bacterium <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. This scaffold domain consists of 58 amino acids, 13 of which are randomized to generate affibody libraries with a large number of ligand variants (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,831,012). Affibody molecules mimic antibodies, they have a molecular weight of 6 kDa, compared to the molecular weight of antibodies, which is 150 kDa. In spite of its small size, the binding site of affibody molecules is similar to that of an antibody.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0660" num="0674">Protein epitope mimetics (PEM) are medium-sized, cyclic, peptide-like molecules (MW 1-2 kDa) mimicking beta-hairpin secondary structures of proteins, the major secondary structure involved in protein-protein interactions.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0665" num="0679">With respect to the transmembrane domain, in various embodiments, a CAR can be designed to comprise a transmembrane domain that is attached to the extracellular domain of the CAR. A transmembrane domain can include one or more additional amino acids adjacent to the transmembrane region, e.g., one or more amino acid associated with the extracellular region of the protein from which the transmembrane was derived (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 up to 15 amino acids of the extracellular region) and/or one or more additional amino acids associated with the intracellular region of the protein from which the transmembrane protein is derived (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 up to 15 amino acids of the intracellular region). In one aspect, the transmembrane domain is one that is associated with one of the other domains of the CAR, e.g., in one embodiment, the transmembrane domain may be from the same protein that the signaling domain, costimulatory domain or the hinge domain is derived from. In another aspect, the transmembrane domain is not derived from the same protein that any other domain of the CAR is derived from. In some instances, the transmembrane domain can be selected or modified by amino acid substitution to avoid binding of such domains to the transmembrane domains of the same or different surface membrane proteins, e.g., to minimize interactions with other members of the receptor complex. In one aspect, the transmembrane domain is capable of homodimerization with another CAR on the cell surface of a CAR-expressing cell. In a different aspect the amino acid sequence of the transmembrane domain may be modified or substituted so as to minimize interactions with the binding domains of the native binding partner present in the same CAR-expressing cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0666" num="0680">The transmembrane domain may be derived either from a natural or from a recombinant source.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0667" num="0681">In some instances, the transmembrane domain can be attached to the extracellular region of the CAR, e.g., the antigen binding domain of the CAR, via a hinge, e.g., a hinge from a human protein.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0676" num="0690">It is known that signals generated through the TCR alone are insufficient for full activation of the T cell and that a secondary and/or costimulatory signal is also required. Thus, T cell activation can be said to be mediated by two distinct classes of cytoplasmic signaling sequences: those that initiate antigen-dependent primary activation through the TCR (primary intracellular signaling domains) and those that act in an antigen-independent manner to provide a secondary or costimulatory signal (secondary cytoplasmic domain, e.g., a costimulatory domain).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0677" num="0691">A primary signaling domain regulates primary activation of the TCR complex either in a stimulatory way, or in an inhibitory way. Primary intracellular signaling domains that act in a stimulatory manner may contain signaling motifs which are known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs or ITAMs.</div>

For example, the intracellular signaling domain of the CAR can comprise a CD3 zeta chain portion and a costimulatory signaling domain. The costimulatory signaling domain refers to a portion of the CAR comprising the intracellular domain of a costimulatory molecule. In one embodiment, the intracellular domain is designed to comprise the signaling domain of CD3-zeta and the signaling domain of CD28. In one aspect, the intracellular domain is designed to comprise the signaling domain of CD3-zeta and the signaling domain of ICOS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0682" num="0696">A costimulatory molecule can be a cell surface molecule other than an antigen receptor or its ligands that is required for an efficient response of lymphocytes to an antigen.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0040" num="0000">Strategies for Regulating Chimeric Antigen Receptors</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0688" num="0702">In some embodiments, a regulatable CAR (RCAR) where the CAR activity can be controlled is desirable to optimize the safety and efficacy of a CAR therapy. There are many ways CAR activities can be regulated. For example, inducing apoptosis using, e.g., a caspase fused to a dimerization domain (see, e.g., Di et al., N Engl. J. Med. 2011 Nov. 3; 365(18):1673-1683), can be used as a safety switch in the CAR therapy of the instant invention. In one embodiment, the cells (e.g., T cells or NK cells) expressing a CAR of the present invention further comprise an inducible apoptosis switch, wherein a human caspase (e.g., caspase 9) or a modified version is fused to a modification of the human FKB protein that allows conditional dimerization. In the presence of a small molecule, such as a rapalog (e.g., AP 1903, AP20187), the inducible caspase (e.g., caspase 9) is activated and leads to the rapid apoptosis and death of the cells (e.g., T cells or NK cells) expressing a CAR of the present invention. Examples of a caspase-based inducible apoptosis switch (or one or more aspects of such a switch) have been described in, e.g., US2004040047; US20110286980; US20140255360; WO1997031899; WO2014151960; WO2014164348; WO2014197638; WO2014197638; all of which are incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0689" num="0703">In another example, CAR-expressing cells can also express an inducible Caspase-9 (iCaspase-9) molecule that, upon administration of a dimerizer drug (e.g., rimiducid (also called AP1903 (Bellicum Pharmaceuticals) or AP20187 (Ariad)) leads to activation of the Caspase-9 and apoptosis of the cells. The iCaspase-9 molecule contains a chemical inducer of dimerization (CID) binding domain that mediates dimerization in the presence of a CID. This results in inducible and selective depletion of CAR-expressing cells. In some cases, the iCaspase-9 molecule is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule separate from the CAR-encoding vector(s). In some cases, the iCaspase-9 molecule is encoded by the same nucleic acid molecule as the CAR-encoding vector. The iCaspase-9 can provide a safety switch to avoid any toxicity of CAR-expressing cells. See, e.g., Song et al. Cancer Gene Ther. 2008; 15(10):667-75; Clinical Trial Id. No. NCT02107963; and Di Stasi et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365:1673-83.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0690" num="0704">Alternative strategies for regulating the CAR therapy of the instant invention include utilizing small molecules or antibodies that deactivate or turn off CAR activity, e.g., by deleting CAR-expressing cells, e.g., by inducing antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). For example, CAR-expressing cells described herein may also express an antigen that is recognized by molecules capable of inducing cell death, e.g., ADCC or complement-induced cell death. For example, CAR expressing cells described herein may also express a receptor capable of being targeted by an antibody or antibody fragment. Examples of such receptors include EpCAM, VEGFR, integrins (e.g., integrins αvβ3, α4, αI3/4β3, α4β7, α5β1, αvβ3, αv), members of the TNF receptor superfamily (e.g., TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2), PDGF Receptor, interferon receptor, folate receptor, GPNMB, ICAM-1, HLA-DR, CEA, CA-125, MUC1, TAG-72, IL-6 receptor, 5T4, GD2, GD3, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD11, CD11a/LFA-1, CD15, CD18/ITGB2, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23/lgE Receptor, CD25, CD28, CD30, CD33, CD38, CD40, CD41, CD44, CD51, CD52, CD62L, CD74, CD80, CD125, CD147/basigin, CD152/CTLA-4, CD154/CD40L, CD195/CCR5, CD319/SLAMF7, and EGFR, and truncated versions thereof (e.g., versions preserving one or more extracellular epitopes but lacking one or more regions within the cytoplasmic domain).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0691" num="0705">For example, a CAR-expressing cell described herein may also express a truncated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which lacks signaling capacity but retains the epitope that is recognized by molecules capable of inducing ADCC, e.g., cetuximab (ERBITUX®), such that administration of cetuximab induces ADCC and subsequent depletion of the CAR-expressing cells (see, e.g., WO2011/056894, and Jonnalagadda et al., Gene Ther. 2013; 20(8)853-860). Another strategy includes expressing a highly compact marker/suicide gene that combines target epitopes from both CD32 and CD20 antigens in the CAR-expressing cells described herein, which binds rituximab, resulting in selective depletion of the CAR-expressing cells, e.g., by ADCC (see, e.g., Philip et al., Blood. 2014; 124(8)1277-1287). Other methods for depleting CAR-expressing cells described herein include administration of CAMPATH, a monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody that selectively binds and targets mature lymphocytes, e.g., CAR-expressing cells, for destruction, e.g., by inducing ADCC. In other embodiments, the CAR-expressing cell can be selectively targeted using a CAR ligand, e.g., an anti-idiotypic antibody. In some embodiments, the anti-idiotypic antibody can cause effector cell activity, e.g., ADCC or ADC activities, thereby reducing the number of CAR-expressing cells. In other embodiments, the CAR ligand, e.g., the anti-idiotypic antibody, can be coupled to an agent that induces cell killing, e.g., a toxin, thereby reducing the number of CAR-expressing cells. Alternatively, the CAR molecules themselves can be configured such that the activity can be regulated, e.g., turned on and off, as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0692" num="0706">In other embodiments, a CAR-expressing cell described herein may also express a target protein recognized by the T cell depleting agent. In one embodiment, the target protein is CD20 and the T cell depleting agent is an anti-CD20 antibody, e.g., rituximab. In such embodiment, the T cell depleting agent is administered once it is desirable to reduce or eliminate the CAR-expressing cell, e.g., to mitigate the CAR induced toxicity. In other embodiments, the T cell depleting agent is an anti-CD52 antibody, e.g., alemtuzumab.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0693" num="0707">In an aspect, a RCAR comprises a set of polypeptides, typically two in the simplest embodiments, in which the components of a standard CAR described herein, e.g., an antigen binding domain and an intracellular signaling domain, are partitioned on separate polypeptides or members. In some embodiments, the set of polypeptides include a dimerization switch that, upon the presence of a dimerization molecule, can couple the polypeptides to one another, e.g., can couple an antigen binding domain to an intracellular signaling domain. In one embodiment, a CAR of the present invention utilizes a dimerization switch as those described in, e.g., WO2014127261, which is incorporated by reference herein. Additional description and exemplary configurations of such regulatable CARs are provided herein and in International Publication No. WO 2015/090229, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>

In some embodiments, the RCAR involves a switch domain comprising a FRB sequence, e.g., as set out in SEQ ID NO: 124, or a mutant FRB sequence, e.g., as set out in any of SEQ ID Nos. 125-130.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0697" num="0711">Split CAR</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0698" num="0712">In some embodiments, the CAR-expressing cell uses a split CAR. The split CAR approach is described in more detail in publications WO2014/055442 and WO2014/055657. Briefly, a split CAR system comprises a cell expressing a first CAR having a first antigen binding domain and a costimulatory domain (e.g., 41BB), and the cell also expresses a second CAR having a second antigen binding domain and an intracellular signaling domain (e.g., CD3 zeta). When the cell encounters the first antigen, the costimulatory domain is activated, and the cell proliferates. When the cell encounters the second antigen, the intracellular signaling domain is activated and cell-killing activity begins. Thus, the CAR-expressing cell is only fully activated in the presence of both antigens.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0699" num="0713">RNA Transfection</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0700" num="0714">Disclosed herein are methods for producing an in vitro transcribed RNA CAR. The present invention also includes (among other things) a CAR encoding RNA construct that can be directly transfected into a cell. A method for generating mRNA for use in transfection can involve in vitro transcription (IVT) of a template with specially designed primers, followed by polyA addition, to produce a construct containing 3′ and 5′ untranslated sequence (“UTR”), a 5′ cap and/or Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES), the nucleic acid to be expressed, and a polyA tail, typically 50-2000 bases in length (SEQ ID NO:118). RNA so produced can efficiently transfect different kinds of cells. In one aspect, the template includes sequences for the CAR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0701" num="0715">In one aspect the CAR is encoded by a messenger RNA (mRNA). In one aspect the mRNA encoding the CAR is introduced into an immune effector cell, e.g., a T cell or a NK cell, for production of a CAR-expressing cell, e.g., a CART cell or a CAR NK cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0702" num="0716">In one embodiment, the in vitro transcribed RNA CAR can be introduced to a cell as a form of transient transfection. The RNA is produced by in vitro transcription using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated template. DNA of interest from any source can be directly converted by PCR into a template for in vitro mRNA synthesis using appropriate primers and RNA polymerase. The source of the DNA can be, for example, genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, phage DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA sequence or any other appropriate source of DNA. A desired temple for in vitro transcription is a CAR of the present invention. For example, the template for the RNA CAR comprises an extracellular region comprising a single chain variable domain of an anti-tumor antibody; a hinge region, a transmembrane domain (e.g., a transmembrane domain of CD8a); and a cytoplasmic region that includes an intracellular signaling domain, e.g., comprising the signaling domain of CD3-zeta and the signaling domain of 4-1BB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0703" num="0717">In one embodiment, the DNA to be used for PCR contains an open reading frame. The DNA can be from a naturally occurring DNA sequence from the genome of an organism. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid can include some or all of the 5′ and/or 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). The nucleic acid can include exons and introns. In one embodiment, the DNA to be used for PCR is a human nucleic acid sequence. In another embodiment, the DNA to be used for PCR is a human nucleic acid sequence including the 5′ and 3′ UTRs. The DNA can alternatively be an artificial DNA sequence that is not normally expressed in a naturally occurring organism. An exemplary artificial DNA sequence is one that contains portions of genes that are ligated together to form an open reading frame that encodes a fusion protein. The portions of DNA that are ligated together can be from a single organism or from more than one organism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0704" num="0718">PCR is used to generate a template for in vitro transcription of mRNA which is used for transfection. Methods for performing PCR are well known in the art. Primers for use in PCR are designed to have regions that are substantially complementary to regions of the DNA to be used as a template for the PCR. “Substantially complementary,” as used herein, refers to sequences of nucleotides where a majority or all of the bases in the primer sequence are complementary, or one or more bases are non-complementary, or mismatched. Substantially complementary sequences are able to anneal or hybridize with the intended DNA target under annealing conditions used for PCR. The primers can be designed to be substantially complementary to any portion of the DNA template. For example, the primers can be designed to amplify the portion of a nucleic acid that is normally transcribed in cells (the open reading frame), including 5′ and 3′ UTRs. The primers can also be designed to amplify a portion of a nucleic acid that encodes a particular domain of interest. In one embodiment, the primers are designed to amplify the coding region of a human cDNA, including all or portions of the 5′ and 3′ UTRs. Primers useful for PCR can be generated by synthetic methods that are well known in the art. “Forward primers” are primers that contain a region of nucleotides that are substantially complementary to nucleotides on the DNA template that are upstream of the DNA sequence that is to be amplified. “Upstream” is used herein to refer to a location 5, to the DNA sequence to be amplified relative to the coding strand. “Reverse primers” are primers that contain a region of nucleotides that are substantially complementary to a double-stranded DNA template that are downstream of the DNA sequence that is to be amplified. “Downstream” is used herein to refer to a location 3′ to the DNA sequence to be amplified relative to the coding strand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0705" num="0719">Any DNA polymerase useful for PCR can be used in the methods disclosed herein. The reagents and polymerase are commercially available from a number of sources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0706" num="0720">Chemical structures with the ability to promote stability and/or translation efficiency may also be used. The RNA in some embodiments has 5′ and 3′ UTRs. In one embodiment, the 5′ UTR is between one and 3000 nucleotides in length. The length of 5′ and 3′ UTR sequences to be added to the coding region can be altered by different methods, including, but not limited to, designing primers for PCR that anneal to different regions of the UTRs. Using this approach, one of ordinary skill in the art can modify the 5′ and 3′ UTR lengths required to achieve optimal translation efficiency following transfection of the transcribed RNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0707" num="0721">The 5′ and 3′ UTRs can be the naturally occurring, endogenous 5′ and 3′ UTRs for the nucleic acid of interest. Alternatively, UTR sequences that are not endogenous to the nucleic acid of interest can be added by incorporating the UTR sequences into the forward and reverse primers or by any other modifications of the template. The use of UTR sequences that are not endogenous to the nucleic acid of interest can be useful for modifying the stability and/or translation efficiency of the RNA. For example, it is known that AU-rich elements in 3′ UTR sequences can decrease the stability of mRNA. Therefore, 3′ UTRs can be selected or designed to increase the stability of the transcribed RNA based on properties of UTRs that are well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0708" num="0722">In one embodiment, the 5′ UTR can contain the Kozak sequence of the endogenous nucleic acid. Alternatively, when a 5′ UTR that is not endogenous to the nucleic acid of interest is being added by PCR as described above, a consensus Kozak sequence can be redesigned by adding the 5′ UTR sequence. Kozak sequences can increase the efficiency of translation of some RNA transcripts, but does not appear to be required for all RNAs to enable efficient translation. The requirement for Kozak sequences for many mRNAs is known in the art. In other embodiments the 5′ UTR can be 5′UTR of an RNA virus whose RNA genome is stable in cells. In other embodiments various nucleotide analogues can be used in the 3′ or 5′ UTR to impede exonuclease degradation of the mRNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0709" num="0723">To enable synthesis of RNA from a DNA template without the need for gene cloning, a promoter of transcription should be attached to the DNA template upstream of the sequence to be transcribed. When a sequence that functions as a promoter for an RNA polymerase is added to the 5′ end of the forward primer, the RNA polymerase promoter becomes incorporated into the PCR product upstream of the open reading frame that is to be transcribed. In one embodiment, the promoter is a T7 polymerase promoter, as described elsewhere herein. Other useful promoters include, but are not limited to, T3 and SP6 RNA polymerase promoters. Consensus nucleotide sequences for T7, T3 and SP6 promoters are known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0710" num="0724">In an embodiment, the mRNA has both a cap on the 5′ end and a 3′ poly(A) tail which determine ribosome binding, initiation of translation and stability mRNA in the cell. On a circular DNA template, for instance, plasmid DNA, RNA polymerase produces a long concatameric product which is not suitable for expression in eukaryotic cells. The transcription of plasmid DNA linearized at the end of the 3′ UTR results in normal sized mRNA which is not effective in eukaryotic transfection even if it is polyadenylated after transcription.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0711" num="0725">On a linear DNA template, phage T7 RNA polymerase can extend the 3′ end of the transcript beyond the last base of the template (Schenborn and Mierendorf, Nuc Acids Res., 13:6223-36 (1985); Nacheva and Berzal-Herranz, Eur. J. Biochem., 270:1485-65 (2003).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0712" num="0726">The conventional method of integration of polyA/T stretches into a DNA template is molecular cloning. However polyA/T sequence integrated into plasmid DNA can cause plasmid instability, which is why plasmid DNA templates obtained from bacterial cells are often highly contaminated with deletions and other aberrations. This makes cloning procedures not only laborious and time consuming but often not reliable. That is why a method which allows construction of DNA templates with polyA/T 3′ stretch without cloning highly desirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0713" num="0727">The polyA/T segment of the transcriptional DNA template can be produced during PCR by using a reverse primer containing a polyT tail, such as 100T tail (SEQ ID NO: 29) (size can be 50-5000 T (SEQ ID NO: 30)), or after PCR by any other method, including, but not limited to, DNA ligation or in vitro recombination. Poly(A) tails also provide stability to RNAs and reduce their degradation. Generally, the length of a poly(A) tail positively correlates with the stability of the transcribed RNA. In one embodiment, the poly(A) tail is between 100 and 5000 adenosines (SEQ ID NO: 57).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0714" num="0728">Poly(A) tails of RNAs can be further extended following in vitro transcription with the use of a poly(A) polymerase, such as <i>E. coli </i>polyA polymerase (E-PAP). In one embodiment, increasing the length of a poly(A) tail from 100 nucleotides to between 300 and 400 nucleotides (SEQ ID NO: 104) results in about a two-fold increase in the translation efficiency of the RNA. Additionally, the attachment of different chemical groups to the 3′ end can increase mRNA stability. Such attachment can contain modified/artificial nucleotides, aptamers and other compounds. For example, ATP analogs can be incorporated into the poly(A) tail using poly(A) polymerase. ATP analogs can further increase the stability of the RNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0715" num="0729">5′ caps on also provide stability to RNA molecules. In an embodiment, RNAs produced by the methods disclosed herein include a 5′ cap. The 5′ cap is provided using techniques known in the art and described herein (Cougot, et al., Trends in Biochem. Sci., 29:436-444 (2001); Stepinski, et al., RNA, 7:1468-95 (2001); Elango, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun., 330:958-966 (2005)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0716" num="0730">The RNAs produced by the methods disclosed herein can also contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence. The IRES sequence may be any viral, chromosomal or artificially designed sequence which initiates cap-independent ribosome binding to mRNA and facilitates the initiation of translation. Any solutes suitable for cell electroporation, which can contain factors facilitating cellular permeability and viability such as sugars, peptides, lipids, proteins, antioxidants, and surfactants can be included.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0717" num="0731">RNA can be introduced into target cells using any of a number of different methods, for instance, commercially available methods which include, but are not limited to, electroporation (Amaxa Nucleofector-II (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany)), (ECM 830 (BTX) (Harvard Instruments, Boston, Mass.) or the Gene Pulser II (BioRad, Denver, Colo.), Multiporator (Eppendort, Hamburg Germany), cationic liposome mediated transfection using lipofection, polymer encapsulation, peptide mediated transfection, or biolistic particle delivery systems such as “gene guns” (see, for example, Nishikawa, et al. Hum Gene Ther., 12(8):861-70 (2001).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0718" num="0732">Non-Viral Delivery Methods</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0719" num="0733">In some aspects, non-viral methods can be used to deliver a nucleic acid encoding a CAR described herein into a cell or tissue or a subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0720" num="0734">In some embodiments, the non-viral method includes the use of a transposon (also called a transposable element). In some embodiments, a transposon is a piece of DNA that can insert itself at a location in a genome, for example, a piece of DNA that is capable of self-replicating and inserting its copy into a genome, or a piece of DNA that can be spliced out of a longer nucleic acid and inserted into another place in a genome. For example, a transposon comprises a DNA sequence made up of inverted repeats flanking genes for transposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0721" num="0735">Exemplary methods of nucleic acid delivery using a transposon include a Sleeping Beauty transposon system (SBTS) and a piggyBac (PB) transposon system. See, e.g., Aronovich et al. Hum. Mol. Genet. 20.R1(2011):R14-20; Singh et al. Cancer Res. 15(2008):2961-2971; Huang et al. Mol. Ther. 16(2008):580-589; Grabundzija et al. Mol. Ther. 18(2010):1200-1209; Kebriaei et al. Blood. 122.21(2013):166; Williams. Molecular Therapy 16.9(2008):1515-16; Bell et al. Nat. Protoc. 2.12(2007):3153-65; and Ding et al. Cell. 122.3(2005):473-83, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0722" num="0736">The SBTS includes two components: 1) a transposon containing a transgene and 2) a source of transposase enzyme. The transposase can transpose the transposon from a carrier plasmid (or other donor DNA) to a target DNA, such as a host cell chromosome/genome. For example, the transposase binds to the carrier plasmid/donor DNA, cuts the transposon (including transgene(s)) out of the plasmid, and inserts it into the genome of the host cell. See, e.g., Aronovich et al.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0723" num="0737">Exemplary transposons include a pT2-based transposon. See, e.g., Grabundzija et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 41.3(2013):1829-47; and Singh et al. Cancer Res. 68.8(2008): 2961-2971, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Exemplary transposases include a Tc1/mariner-type transposase, e.g., the SB10 transposase or the SB11 transposase (a hyperactive transposase which can be expressed, e.g., from a cytomegalovirus promoter). See, e.g., Aronovich et al.; Kebriaei et al.; and Grabundzija et al., all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0724" num="0738">Use of the SBTS permits efficient integration and expression of a transgene, e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a CAR described herein. Provided herein are methods of generating a cell, e.g., T cell or NK cell, that stably expresses a CAR described herein, e.g., using a transposon system such as SBTS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0725" num="0739">In accordance with methods described herein, in some embodiments, one or more nucleic acids, e.g., plasmids, containing the SBTS components are delivered to a cell (e.g., T or NK cell). For example, the nucleic acid(s) are delivered by standard methods of nucleic acid (e.g., plasmid DNA) delivery, e.g., methods described herein, e.g., electroporation, transfection, or lipofection. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid contains a transposon comprising a transgene, e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a CAR described herein. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid contains a transposon comprising a transgene (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a CAR described herein) as well as a nucleic acid sequence encoding a transposase enzyme. In other embodiments, a system with two nucleic acids is provided, e.g., a dual-plasmid system, e.g., where a first plasmid contains a transposon comprising a transgene, and a second plasmid contains a nucleic acid sequence encoding a transposase enzyme. For example, the first and the second nucleic acids are co-delivered into a host cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0726" num="0740">In some embodiments, cells, e.g., T or NK cells, are generated that express a CAR described herein by using a combination of gene insertion using the SBTS and genetic editing using a nuclease (e.g., Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs), the CRISPR/Cas system, or engineered meganuclease re-engineered homing endonucleases).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0727" num="0741">In some embodiments, use of a non-viral method of delivery permits reprogramming of cells, e.g., T or NK cells, and direct infusion of the cells into a subject. Advantages of non-viral vectors include but are not limited to the ease and relatively low cost of producing sufficient amounts required to meet a patient population, stability during storage, and lack of immunogenicity.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0740" num="0754">The nucleic acid sequences coding for the desired molecules can be obtained using recombinant methods known in the art, such as, for example by screening libraries from cells expressing the gene, by deriving the gene from a vector known to include the same, or by isolating directly from cells and tissues containing the same, using standard techniques. Alternatively, the gene of interest can be produced synthetically, rather than cloned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0741" num="0755">The present invention also provides vectors in which a DNA of the present invention is inserted. Vectors derived from retroviruses such as the lentivirus are suitable tools to achieve long-term gene transfer since they allow long-term, stable integration of a transgene and its propagation in daughter cells. Lentiviral vectors have the added advantage over vectors derived from onco-retroviruses such as murine leukemia viruses in that they can transduce non-proliferating cells, such as hepatocytes. They also have the added advantage of low immunogenicity. A retroviral vector may also be, e.g., a gammaretroviral vector. A gammaretroviral vector may include, e.g., a promoter, a packaging signal (w), a primer binding site (PBS), one or more (e.g., two) long terminal repeats (LTR), and a transgene of interest, e.g., a gene encoding a CAR. A gammaretroviral vector may lack viral structural gens such as gag, pol, and env. Exemplary gammaretroviral vectors include Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV), Spleen-Focus Forming Virus (SFFV), and Myeloproliferative Sarcoma Virus (MPSV), and vectors derived therefrom. Other gammaretroviral vectors are described, e.g., in Tobias Maetzig et al., “Gammaretroviral Vectors: Biology, Technology and Application” Viruses. 2011 June; 3(6): 677-713.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0742" num="0756">In another embodiment, the vector comprising the nucleic acid encoding the desired CAR of the invention is an adenoviral vector (A5/35). In another embodiment, the expression of nucleic acids encoding CARs can be accomplished using of transposons such as sleeping beauty, crispr, CAS9, and zinc finger nucleases. See below June et al. 2009 <i>Nature Reviews Immunology </i>9.10: 704-716, is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0743" num="0757">A vector may also include, e.g., a signal sequence to facilitate secretion, a polyadenylation signal and transcription terminator (e.g., from Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH) gene), an element allowing episomal replication and replication in prokaryotes (e.g. SV40 origin and ColE1 or others known in the art) and/or elements to allow selection (e.g., ampicillin resistance gene and/or zeocin marker).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0744" num="0758">In brief summary, the expression of natural or synthetic nucleic acids encoding CARs is typically achieved by operably linking a nucleic acid encoding the CAR polypeptide or portions thereof to a promoter, and incorporating the construct into an expression vector. The vectors can be suitable for replication and integration eukaryotes. Typical cloning vectors contain transcription and translation terminators, initiation sequences, and promoters useful for regulation of the expression of the desired nucleic acid sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0745" num="0759">In some aspects, the expression constructs of the present invention may also be used for nucleic acid immunization and gene therapy, using standard gene delivery protocols. Methods for gene delivery are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,346, 5,580,859, 5,589,466, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. In another embodiment, the invention provides a gene therapy vector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0746" num="0760">The nucleic acid can be cloned into a number of types of vectors. For example, the nucleic acid can be cloned into a vector including, but not limited to a plasmid, a phagemid, a phage derivative, an animal virus, and a cosmid. Vectors of particular interest include expression vectors, replication vectors, probe generation vectors, and sequencing vectors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0747" num="0761">Further, the expression vector may be provided to a cell in the form of a viral vector. Viral vector technology is well known in the art and is described, for example, in Sambrook et al., 2012, MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL, volumes 1-4, Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY), and in other virology and molecular biology manuals. Viruses, which are useful as vectors include, but are not limited to, retroviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, herpes viruses, and lentiviruses. In general, a suitable vector contains an origin of replication functional in at least one organism, a promoter sequence, convenient restriction endonuclease sites, and one or more selectable markers, (e.g., WO 01/96584; WO 01/29058; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,193).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0748" num="0762">A number of viral based systems have been developed for gene transfer into mammalian cells. For example, retroviruses provide a convenient platform for gene delivery systems. A selected gene can be inserted into a vector and packaged in retroviral particles using techniques known in the art. The recombinant virus can then be isolated and delivered to cells of the subject either in vivo or ex vivo. A number of retroviral systems are known in the art. In some embodiments, adenovirus vectors are used. A number of adenovirus vectors are known in the art. In one embodiment, lentivirus vectors are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0749" num="0763">Additional promoter elements, e.g., enhancers, regulate the frequency of transcriptional initiation. Typically, these are located in the region 30-110 bp upstream of the start site, although a number of promoters have been shown to contain functional elements downstream of the start site as well. The spacing between promoter elements frequently is flexible, so that promoter function is preserved when elements are inverted or moved relative to one another. In the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter, the spacing between promoter elements can be increased to 50 bp apart before activity begins to decline. Depending on the promoter, it appears that individual elements can function either cooperatively or independently to activate transcription. Exemplary promoters include the CMV IE gene, EF-1α, ubiquitin C, or phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) promoters. In an embodiment, the promoter is a PGK promoter, e.g., a truncated PGK promoter as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0750" num="0764">An example of a promoter that is capable of expressing a CAR transgene in a mammalian T cell is the EF1a promoter. The native EF1a promoter drives expression of the alpha subunit of the elongation factor-1 complex, which is responsible for the enzymatic delivery of aminoacyl tRNAs to the ribosome. The EF1a promoter has been extensively used in mammalian expression plasmids and has been shown to be effective in driving CAR expression from transgenes cloned into a lentiviral vector. See, e.g., Milone et al., Mol. Ther. 17(8): 1453-1464 (2009). In one aspect, the EF1a promoter comprises the sequence provided as SEQ ID NO:100.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0751" num="0765">Another example of a promoter is the immediate early cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter sequence. This promoter sequence is a strong constitutive promoter sequence capable of driving high levels of expression of any polynucleotide sequence operatively linked thereto. However, other constitutive promoter sequences may also be used, including, but not limited to the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, MoMuLV promoter, an avian leukemia virus promoter, an Epstein-Barr virus immediate early promoter, a Rous sarcoma virus promoter, as well as human gene promoters such as, but not limited to, the actin promoter, the myosin promoter, the elongation factor-1α promoter, the hemoglobin promoter, and the creatine kinase promoter. Further, the invention should not be limited to the use of constitutive promoters. Inducible promoters are also contemplated as part of the invention. The use of an inducible promoter provides a molecular switch capable of turning on expression of the polynucleotide sequence which it is operatively linked when such expression is desired, or turning off the expression when expression is not desired. Examples of inducible promoters include, but are not limited to a metallothionine promoter, a glucocorticoid promoter, a progesterone promoter, and a tetracycline promoter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0752" num="0766">Another example of a promoter is the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. In embodiments, a truncated PGK promoter (e.g., a PGK promoter with one or more, e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10, 100, 200, 300, or 400, nucleotide deletions when compared to the wild-type PGK promoter sequence) may be desired. The nucleotide sequences of exemplary PGK promoters are provided below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0757" num="0771">A vector may also include, e.g., a signal sequence to facilitate secretion, a polyadenylation signal and transcription terminator (e.g., from Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH) gene), an element allowing episomal replication and replication in prokaryotes (e.g. SV40 origin and ColE1 or others known in the art) and/or elements to allow selection (e.g., ampicillin resistance gene and/or zeocin marker).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0758" num="0772">In order to assess the expression of a CAR polypeptide or portions thereof, the expression vector to be introduced into a cell can also contain either a selectable marker gene or a reporter gene or both to facilitate identification and selection of expressing cells from the population of cells sought to be transfected or infected through viral vectors. In other aspects, the selectable marker may be carried on a separate piece of DNA and used in a co-transfection procedure. Both selectable markers and reporter genes may be flanked with appropriate regulatory sequences to enable expression in the host cells. Useful selectable markers include, for example, antibiotic-resistance genes, such as neo and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0759" num="0773">Reporter genes are used for identifying potentially transfected cells and for evaluating the functionality of regulatory sequences. In general, a reporter gene is a gene that is not present in or expressed by the recipient organism or tissue and that encodes a polypeptide whose expression is manifested by some easily detectable property, e.g., enzymatic activity. Expression of the reporter gene is assayed at a suitable time after the DNA has been introduced into the recipient cells. Suitable reporter genes may include genes encoding luciferase, beta-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, secreted alkaline phosphatase, or the green fluorescent protein gene (e.g., Ui-Tei et al., 2000 FEBS Letters 479: 79-82). Suitable expression systems are well known and may be prepared using known techniques or obtained commercially. In general, the construct with the minimal 5′ flanking region showing the highest level of expression of reporter gene is identified as the promoter. Such promoter regions may be linked to a reporter gene and used to evaluate agents for the ability to modulate promoter-driven transcription.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0760" num="0774">In embodiments, the vector may comprise two or more nucleic acid sequences encoding a CAR, e.g., a first CAR that binds to CD19 and a second CAR, e.g., an inhibitory CAR or a CAR that specifically binds to a second antigen, e.g., CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a. In such embodiments, the two or more nucleic acid sequences encoding the CAR are encoded by a single nucleic molecule in the same frame and as a single polypeptide chain. In this aspect, the two or more CARs, can, e.g., be separated by one or more peptide cleavage sites. (e.g., an auto-cleavage site or a substrate for an intracellular protease). Examples of peptide cleavage sites include the following, wherein the GSG residues are optional:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0762" num="0776">Methods of introducing and expressing genes into a cell are known in the art. In the context of an expression vector, the vector can be readily introduced into a host cell, e.g., mammalian, bacterial, yeast, or insect cell by any method in the art. For example, the expression vector can be transferred into a host cell by physical, chemical, or biological means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0763" num="0777">Physical methods for introducing a polynucleotide into a host cell include calcium phosphate precipitation, lipofection, particle bombardment, microinjection, electroporation, and the like. Methods for producing cells comprising vectors and/or exogenous nucleic acids are well-known in the art. See, for example, Sambrook et al., 2012, MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL, volumes 1-4, Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY). A suitable method for the introduction of a polynucleotide into a host cell is calcium phosphate transfection</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0764" num="0778">Biological methods for introducing a polynucleotide of interest into a host cell include the use of DNA and RNA vectors. Viral vectors, and especially retroviral vectors, have become the most widely used method for inserting genes into mammalian, e.g., human cells. Other viral vectors can be derived from lentivirus, poxviruses, herpes simplex virus I, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses, and the like. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,350,674 and 5,585,362.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0765" num="0779">Chemical means for introducing a polynucleotide into a host cell include colloidal dispersion systems, such as macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. An exemplary colloidal system for use as a delivery vehicle in vitro and in vivo is a liposome (e.g., an artificial membrane vesicle). Other methods of state-of-the-art targeted delivery of nucleic acids are available, such as delivery of polynucleotides with targeted nanoparticles or other suitable sub-micron sized delivery system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0766" num="0780">In the case where a non-viral delivery system is utilized, an exemplary delivery vehicle is a liposome. The use of lipid formulations is contemplated for the introduction of the nucleic acids into a host cell (in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo). In another aspect, the nucleic acid may be associated with a lipid. The nucleic acid associated with a lipid may be encapsulated in the aqueous interior of a liposome, interspersed within the lipid bilayer of a liposome, attached to a liposome via a linking molecule that is associated with both the liposome and the oligonucleotide, entrapped in a liposome, complexed with a liposome, dispersed in a solution containing a lipid, mixed with a lipid, combined with a lipid, contained as a suspension in a lipid, contained or complexed with a micelle, or otherwise associated with a lipid. Lipid, lipid/DNA or lipid/expression vector associated compositions are not limited to any particular structure in solution. For example, they may be present in a bilayer structure, as micelles, or with a “collapsed” structure. They may also simply be interspersed in a solution, possibly forming aggregates that are not uniform in size or shape. Lipids are fatty substances which may be naturally occurring or synthetic lipids. For example, lipids include the fatty droplets that naturally occur in the cytoplasm as well as the class of compounds which contain long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, such as fatty acids, alcohols, amines, amino alcohols, and aldehydes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0767" num="0781">Lipids suitable for use can be obtained from commercial sources. For example, dimyristyl phosphatidylcholine (“DMPC”) can be obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.; dicetyl phosphate (“DCP”) can be obtained from K &amp; K Laboratories (Plainview, N.Y.); cholesterol (“Choi”) can be obtained from Calbiochem-Behring; dimyristyl phosphatidylglycerol (“DMPG”) and other lipids may be obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, Ala.). Stock solutions of lipids in chloroform or chloroform/methanol can be stored at about −20° C. Chloroform is used as the only solvent since it is more readily evaporated than methanol. “Liposome” is a generic term encompassing a variety of single and multilamellar lipid vehicles formed by the generation of enclosed lipid bilayers or aggregates. Liposomes can be characterized as having vesicular structures with a phospholipid bilayer membrane and an inner aqueous medium. Multilamellar liposomes have multiple lipid layers separated by aqueous medium. They form spontaneously when phospholipids are suspended in an excess of aqueous solution. The lipid components undergo self-rearrangement before the formation of closed structures and entrap water and dissolved solutes between the lipid bilayers (Ghosh et al., 1991 Glycobiology 5: 505-10). However, compositions that have different structures in solution than the normal vesicular structure are also encompassed. For example, the lipids may assume a micellar structure or merely exist as nonuniform aggregates of lipid molecules. Also contemplated are lipofectamine-nucleic acid complexes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0768" num="0782">Regardless of the method used to introduce exogenous nucleic acids into a host cell or otherwise expose a cell to the inhibitor of the present invention, in order to confirm the presence of the recombinant DNA sequence in the host cell, a variety of assays may be performed. Such assays include, for example, “molecular biological” assays well known to those of skill in the art, such as Southern and Northern blotting, RT-PCR and PCR; “biochemical” assays, such as detecting the presence or absence of a particular peptide, e.g., by immunological means (ELISAs and Western blots) or by assays described herein to identify agents falling within the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0769" num="0783">The present invention further provides a vector comprising a CAR encoding nucleic acid molecule. In one aspect, a CAR vector can be directly transduced into a cell, e.g., a T cell. In one aspect, the vector is a cloning or expression vector, e.g., a vector including, but not limited to, one or more plasmids (e.g., expression plasmids, cloning vectors, minicircles, minivectors, double minute chromosomes), retroviral and lentiviral vector constructs. In one aspect, the vector is capable of expressing the CAR construct in mammalian T cells. In one aspect, the mammalian T cell is a human T cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0041" num="0000">Immune Effector Cells Expressing a CAR</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0770" num="0784">In another aspect, the present invention provides a population of CAR-expressing cells. In some embodiments, the population of CAR-expressing cells comprises a cell that expresses one or more CARs described herein. In some embodiments, the population of CAR-expressing cells comprises a mixture of cells expressing different CARs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0771" num="0785">For example, in one embodiment, the population of CART cells can include a first cell expressing a CAR having an antigen binding domain to a tumor antigen described herein, e.g., CD19, and a second cell expressing a CAR having a different antigen binding domain, e.g., an antigen binding domain to a different tumor antigen described herein, e.g., an antigen binding domain to a tumor antigen described herein that differs from the tumor antigen bound by the antigen binding domain of the CAR expressed by the first cell, e.g., CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0772" num="0786">As another example, the population of CAR-expressing cells can include a first cell expressing a CAR that includes an antigen binding domain to a tumor antigen described herein, and a second cell expressing a CAR that includes an antigen binding domain to a target other than a tumor antigen as described herein. In one embodiment, the population of CAR-expressing cells includes, e.g., a first cell expressing a CAR that includes a primary intracellular signaling domain, and a second cell expressing a CAR that includes a secondary signaling domain. Either one or both of the CAR expressing cells can have a truncated PGK promoter, e.g., as described herein, operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the CAR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0773" num="0787">In another aspect, the present invention provides a population of cells wherein at least one cell in the population expresses a CAR having an antigen binding domain to a tumor antigen described herein, and a second cell expressing another agent, e.g., an agent which enhances the activity of a CAR-expressing cell. The CAR expressing cells of the population can have a truncated PGK promoter, e.g., as described herein, operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the CAR. In one embodiment, the agent can be an agent which inhibits an inhibitory molecule. Inhibitory molecules, e.g., PD-1, can, in some embodiments, decrease the ability of a CAR-expressing cell to mount an immune effector response. Examples of inhibitory molecules include PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4, TIM3, CEACAM (CEACAM-1, CEACAM-3, and/or CEACAM-5), LAG3, VISTA, BTLA, TIGIT, LAIR1, CD160, 2B4, CD80, CD86, B7-H3 (CD276), B7-H4 (VTCN1), HVEM (TNFRSF14 or CD270), KIR, A2aR, MHC class I, MHC class II, GALS, adenosine, and TGFR (e.g., TGFRbeta). In one embodiment, the agent which inhibits an inhibitory molecule comprises a first polypeptide, e.g., an inhibitory molecule, associated with a second polypeptide that provides a positive signal to the cell, e.g., an intracellular signaling domain described herein. In one embodiment, the agent comprises a first polypeptide, e.g., of an inhibitory molecule such as PD1, PD-L1, CTLA4, TIM3, CEACAM (e.g., CEACAM-1, CEACAM-3, and/or CEACAM-5), LAG3, VISTA, BTLA, TIGIT, LAIR1, CD160, 2B4 or TGFR beta, or a fragment of any of these, and a second polypeptide which is an intracellular signaling domain described herein (e.g., comprising a costimulatory domain (e.g., 41BB, CD27, OX40 or CD28, e.g., as described herein) and/or a primary signaling domain (e.g., a CD3 zeta signaling domain described herein). In one embodiment, the agent comprises a first polypeptide of PD-1 or a fragment thereof, and a second polypeptide of an intracellular signaling domain described herein (e.g., a CD28 signaling domain described herein and/or a CD3 zeta signaling domain described herein).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0042" num="0000">Co-Expression of CAR with Other Molecules or Agents</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0774" num="0788">Co-Expression of a Second CAR</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0775" num="0789">In one aspect, the CAR-expressing cell described herein can further comprise a second CAR, e.g., a second CAR that includes a different antigen binding domain, e.g., to the same target (CD19) or a different target (e.g., CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a). In one embodiment, the second CAR includes an antigen binding domain to a target expressed on acute myeloid leukemia cells, such as, e.g., CD20, CD22, ROR1, CD10, CD33, CLL-1, CD34, CD123, FLT3, CD79b, CD179b, and CD79a. In one embodiment, the CAR-expressing cell comprises a first CAR that targets a first antigen and includes an intracellular signaling domain having a costimulatory signaling domain but not a primary signaling domain, and a second CAR that targets a second, different, antigen and includes an intracellular signaling domain having a primary signaling domain but not a costimulatory signaling domain. While not wishing to be bound by theory, placement of a costimulatory signaling domain, e.g., 4-1BB, CD28, CD27 or OX-40, onto the first CAR, and the primary signaling domain, e.g., CD3 zeta, on the second CAR can limit the CAR activity to cells where both targets are expressed. In one embodiment, the CAR expressing cell comprises a first CD19 CAR that includes a CD19 binding domain, a transmembrane domain and a costimulatory domain and a second CAR that targets an antigen other than CD19 (e.g., an antigen expressed on AML cells, e.g., CD22, CD20, ROR1, CD10, CD33, CLL-1, CD34, CD123, FLT3, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a) and includes an antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and a primary signaling domain. In another embodiment, the CAR expressing cell comprises a first CD19 CAR that includes a CD19 binding domain, a transmembrane domain and a primary signaling domain and a second CAR that targets an antigen other than CD19 (e.g., an antigen expressed on AML cells, e.g., CD22, CD20, ROR1, CD10, CD33, CD123, CLL-1, CD34, FLT3, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a) and includes an antigen binding domain to the antigen, a transmembrane domain and a costimulatory signaling domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0776" num="0790">In one aspect, the CAR-expressing cell described herein can further comprise a second CAR, e.g., a second CAR that includes a different antigen binding domain, e.g., to the same target (e.g., CD19) or a different target (e.g., a target other than CD19, e.g., CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, ROR1, CD79b, CD179b, or CD79a). In one embodiment, the CAR-expressing cell comprises a first CAR that targets a first antigen and includes an intracellular signaling domain having a costimulatory signaling domain but not a primary signaling domain, and a second CAR that targets a second, different, antigen and includes an intracellular signaling domain having a primary signaling domain but not a costimulatory signaling domain. Placement of a costimulatory signaling domain, e.g., 4-1BB, CD28, CD27, OX-40 or ICOS, onto the first CAR, and the primary signaling domain, e.g., CD3 zeta, on the second CAR can limit the CAR activity to cells where both targets are expressed. In one embodiment, the CAR expressing cell comprises a first CAR that includes an antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and a costimulatory domain and a second CAR that targets another antigen and includes an antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and a primary signaling domain. In another embodiment, the CAR expressing cell comprises a first CAR that includes an antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and a primary signaling domain and a second CAR that targets another antigen and includes an antigen binding domain to the antigen, a transmembrane domain and a costimulatory signaling domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0777" num="0791">In one embodiment, the CAR-expressing cell comprises an XCAR described herein (e.g., CD19 CAR, CD20 CAR, or CD22 CAR) and an inhibitory CAR. In one embodiment, the CAR-expressing cell comprises a CD19 CAR described herein and an inhibitory CAR. In one embodiment, the inhibitory CAR comprises an antigen binding domain that binds an antigen found on normal cells but not cancer cells, e.g., normal cells that also express CD19. In one embodiment, the inhibitory CAR comprises the antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain of an inhibitory molecule. For example, the intracellular domain of the inhibitory CAR can be an intracellular domain PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4, TIM3, CEACAM (CEACAM-1, CEACAM-3, and/or CEACAM-5), LAGS, VISTA, BTLA, TIGIT, LAIR1, CD160, 2B4, CD80, CD86, B7-H3 (CD276), B7-H4 (VTCN1), HVEM (TNFRSF14 or CD270), KIR, A2aR, MHC class I, MHC class II, GALS, adenosine, and TGFR (e.g., TGFRbeta).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0778" num="0792">In one embodiment, when the CAR-expressing cell comprises two or more different CARs, the antigen binding domains of the different CARs can be such that the antigen binding domains do not interact with one another. For example, a cell expressing a first and second CAR can have an antigen binding domain of the first CAR, e.g., as a fragment, e.g., an scFv, that does not form an association with the antigen binding domain of the second CAR, e.g., the antigen binding domain of the second CAR is a VHH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0779" num="0793">Co-Expression of an Agent that Enhances CAR Activity</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0780" num="0794">In another aspect, the CAR-expressing cell described herein can further express another agent, e.g., an agent that enhances the activity or fitness of a CAR-expressing cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0781" num="0795">For example, in one embodiment, the agent can be an agent which inhibits a molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T cell function. In some embodiments, the molecule that modulates or regulates T cell function is an inhibitory molecule. Inhibitory molecules, e.g., PD1, can, in some embodiments, decrease the ability of a CAR-expressing cell to mount an immune effector response. Examples of inhibitory molecules include PD1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4, TIM3, CEACAM (e.g., CEACAM-1, CEACAM-3 and/or CEACAM-5), LAG3, VISTA, BTLA, TIGIT, LAIR1, CD160, 2B4, CD160, 2B4, CD80, CD86, B7-H3 (CD276), B7-H4 (VTCN1), HVEM (TNFRSF14 or CD270), KIR, A2aR, MHC class I, MHC class II, GAL9, adenosine, and TGFR (e.g., TGFR beta).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0782" num="0796">In one embodiment, an inhibitory nucleic acid, e.g., an inhibitory nucleic acid, e.g., a dsRNA, e.g., an siRNA or shRNA, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), a transcription-activator like effector nuclease (TALEN), or a zinc finger endonuclease (ZFN), e.g., as described herein, can be used to inhibit expression of a molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function in the CAR-expressing cell. In an embodiment the agent is an shRNA, e.g., an shRNA described herein. In an embodiment, the agent that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function is inhibited within a CAR-expressing cell. For example, a dsRNA molecule that inhibits expression of a molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function is linked to the nucleic acid that encodes a component, e.g., all of the components, of the CAR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0783" num="0797">In one embodiment, the agent which inhibits an inhibitory molecule comprises a first polypeptide, e.g., an inhibitory molecule, associated with a second polypeptide that provides a positive signal to the cell, e.g., an intracellular signaling domain described herein. In one embodiment, the agent comprises a first polypeptide, e.g., of an inhibitory molecule such as PD1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4, TIM3, CEACAM (e.g., CEACAM-1, CEACAM-3 and/or CEACAM-5), LAG3, VISTA, BTLA, TIGIT, LAIR1, CD160, 2B4, CD160, 2B4, CD80, CD86, B7-H3 (CD276), B7-H4 (VTCN1), HVEM (TNFRSF14 or CD270), KIR, A2aR, MHC class I, MHC class II, GAL9, adenosine, or TGFR (e.g., TGFR beta), or a fragment of any of these (e.g., at least a portion of an extracellular domain of any of these), and a second polypeptide which is an intracellular signaling domain described herein (e.g., comprising a costimulatory domain (e.g., 41BB, CD27 or CD28, e.g., as described herein) and/or a primary signaling domain (e.g., a CD3 zeta signaling domain described herein). In one embodiment, the agent comprises a first polypeptide of PD1 or a fragment thereof (e.g., at least a portion of an extracellular domain of PD1), and a second polypeptide of an intracellular signaling domain described herein (e.g., a CD28 signaling domain described herein and/or a CD3 zeta signaling domain described herein). PD1 is an inhibitory member of the CD28 family of receptors that also includes CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, and BTLA. PD-1 is expressed on activated B cells, T cells and myeloid cells (Agata et al. 1996 Int. Immunol 8:765-75). Two ligands for PD1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 have been shown to downregulate T cell activation upon binding to PD1 (Freeman et a. 2000 J Exp Med 192:1027-34; Latchman et al. 2001 Nat Immunol 2:261-8; Carter et al. 2002 Eur J Immunol 32:634-43). PD-L1 is abundant in human cancers (Dong et al. 2003 J Mol Med 81:281-7; Blank et al. 2005 Cancer Immunol. Immunother 54:307-314; Konishi et al. 2004 Clin Cancer Res 10:5094). Immune suppression can be reversed by inhibiting the local interaction of PD1 with PD-L1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0784" num="0798">In one embodiment, the agent comprises the extracellular domain (ECD) of an inhibitory molecule, e.g., Programmed Death 1 (PD1), can be fused to a transmembrane domain and intracellular signaling domains such as 41BB and CD3 zeta (also referred to herein as a PD1 CAR). In one embodiment, the PD1 CAR, when used in combinations with a CD19 CAR described herein, improves the persistence of the T cell. In one embodiment, the CAR is a PD1 CAR comprising the extracellular domain of PD1 indicated as underlined in SEQ ID NO: 121. In one embodiment, the PD1 CAR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:121.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0043" num="0000">Co-Expression of CAR with a Chemokine Receptor</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0791" num="0805">In embodiments, the CAR-expressing cell described herein further comprises a chemokine receptor molecule. Transgenic expression of chemokine receptors CCR2b or CXCR2 in T cells enhances trafficking to CCL2- or CXCL1-secreting solid tumors including melanoma and neuroblastoma (Craddock et al., <i>J Immunother. </i>2010 October; 33(8):780-8 and Kershaw et al., <i>Hum Gene Ther. </i>2002 Nov. 1; 13(16):1971-80). Thus, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that chemokine receptors expressed in CAR-expressing cells that recognize chemokines secreted by tumors, e.g., solid tumors, can improve homing of the CAR-expressing cell to the tumor, facilitate the infiltration of the CAR-expressing cell to the tumor, and enhances antitumor efficacy of the CAR-expressing cell. The chemokine receptor molecule can comprise a naturally occurring or recombinant chemokine receptor or a chemokine-binding fragment thereof. A chemokine receptor molecule suitable for expression in a CAR-expressing cell described herein include a CXC chemokine receptor (e.g., CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, CXCR6, or CXCR7), a CC chemokine receptor (e.g., CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, or CCR11), a CX3C chemokine receptor (e.g., CX3CR1), a XC chemokine receptor (e.g., XCR1), or a chemokine-binding fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the chemokine receptor molecule to be expressed with a CAR described herein is selected based on the chemokine(s) secreted by the tumor. In one embodiment, the CAR-expressing cell described herein further comprises, e.g., expresses, a CCR2b receptor or a CXCR2 receptor. In an embodiment, the CAR described herein and the chemokine receptor molecule are on the same vector or are on two different vectors. In embodiments where the CAR described herein and the chemokine receptor molecule are on the same vector, the CAR and the chemokine receptor molecule are each under control of two different promoters or are under the control of the same promoter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0044" num="0000">Conditional Expression of Immune Response-Enhancing Agents</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0792" num="0806">Also provided herein are compositions and methods for conditionally expressing an agent that enhances the immune response or activity of a CAR-expressing cell described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0793" num="0807">In one aspect, the present disclosure features an immune effector cell that is engineered to constitutively express a CAR, also referred to herein as a nonconditional CAR. In one embodiment, a nonconditional CAR as described herein comprises an antigen binding domain that binds to a cancer associated antigen, e.g., CD19, CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, or ROR1. In embodiments, the nonconditional CAR-expressing immune effector cell further comprises a conditionally-expressed agent that enhances the therapeutic efficacy, e.g., the immune response, of the CAR-expressing immune effector cell. In such embodiments, the expression of the conditionally expressed agent occurs upon activation of the nonconditional CAR-expressing immune effector cell, e.g., upon binding of the nonconditional CAR molecule to its target, e.g., a cancer associated antigen, e.g., CD19, CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, or ROR1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0794" num="0808">Immune response-enhancing agents as described herein can be characterized by one or more of the following: 1) targets or binds to a different cancer associated antigen than that targeted by the nonconditional CAR; 2) inhibits the expression or activity of an immune checkpoint or inhibitory molecule; and/or 3) activates the expression and/or secretion of a component that enhances immune response or activation of an immune effector cell. The immune response-enhancing agent can be a polypeptide or a nucleic acid, e.g., a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide that enhances immune response. Examples of conditionally expressed agents that enhance the immune response include, but are not limited to, an additional CAR (referred to as a conditional CAR); a TCR-based molecule (e.g., a TCR-CAR); an inhibitor of an immune checkpoint or an inhibitory molecule; and/or a cytokine. In embodiments, the conditional CAR binds to a different cancer associated antigen than that targeted by the nonconditional CAR. In embodiments, the inhibitor of an immune checkpoint or inhibitory molecule described herein is an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof, an inhibitory nucleic acid (e.g., an siRNA or shRNA), or a small molecule that inhibits or decreases the activity of an immune checkpoint or inhibitory molecule selected from PD1, PD-L1, CTLA4, TIM3, CEACAM (e.g., CEACAM-1, CEACAM-3 and/or CEACAM-5), LAGS, VISTA, BTLA, TIGIT, LAIR1, CD160, 2B4, CD80, CD86, B7-H3 (CD276), B7-H4 (VTCN1), HVEM (TNFRSF14 or CD270), KIR, A2aR, MHC class I, MHC class II, GALS, adenosine, or TGFR beta. In embodiments, the cytokine comprises IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, or IL-21, or functional fragments or derivatives thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0795" num="0809">In embodiments, the immune effector cell comprises a nonconditional CAR and one or more conditional CARs, where the conditional CAR binds to a different cancer associated antigen than that targeted by the nonconditional CAR. By way of example, in one embodiment, an immune effector cell comprises a nonconditional CAR that binds to CD19 and one or more conditional CARs that bind to CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, or ROR1, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment, an immune effector cell comprises a nonconditional CAR that binds to CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, or ROR1 and a conditional CAR that binds to CD19.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0796" num="0810">Conditional expression of the agent that enhances the immune response upon activation of the CAR-expressing immune effector cell is achieved by operatively linking an activation-conditional control region to the agent that enhances the immune response (e.g., to a nucleic acid sequence encoding such an agent). In one embodiment, the activation conditional control region comprises a promoter sequence that initiates expression, e.g., transcription, of the operatively linked immune response enhancing agent upon activation of the immune effector cell. In one embodiment, the activation conditional control region comprises one or more regulatory sequences (e.g., a transcription factor binding sequence or site) that facilitate the initiation of expression upon activation of the immune effector cell. In embodiments, the activation-conditional control region comprises a promoter sequence and/or one or more transcription factor binding sequences from a promoter or regulatory sequence of a gene that is upregulated upon one or more of the following: immune effector cell (e.g., T cell) activation, T-cell differentiation, T-cell polarization, or helper T cell development. Examples of such genes include, but are not limited to, NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2), NF-κB (nuclear factor-KB), IL-2, IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-3, GM-CSF, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0797" num="0811">In one embodiment, the activation-conditional control region comprises one or more, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more, NFAT binding sequences or sites. In embodiments, the NFAT-binding sequence in the promoter comprises (5′-GGAAA-3′) (SEQ ID NO: 1312), optionally situated in a longer consensus sequence of 5′ (A/T)GGAAA(A/N)(A/T/C)N 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 1313). In embodiments, the NFAT-binding sequence is a Kb-like sequence such as GGGACT (SEQ ID NO: 1314). (See, Gibson et al., The Journal of Immunology, 2007, 179: 3831-3840.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0798" num="0812">In one embodiment, the activation-conditional control region further comprises an IL-2 promoter (or a minimal IL-2 promoter), an IL-2R promoter, an ATF2 promoter, or a NF-κB promoter, or any functional fragment or derivative thereof. In one embodiment, the activation-conditional control region comprises one or more NFAT-binding sequences, e.g., 3 or 6 NFAT-binding sequences, and an IL-2 promoter, e.g., an IL-2 minimal promoter. In one embodiment, the activation-conditional control region comprises the sequence of AGCTTGGATCCAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGTTAAGAGGAAAATT TGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGTTAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGTTCAAG CTTGTCGAC (SEQ ID NO: 1315).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0045" num="0000">Sources of Cells</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0799" num="0813">Prior to expansion and genetic modification or other modification, a source of cells, e.g., T cells or natural killer (NK) cells, can be obtained from a subject. Examples of subjects include humans, monkeys, chimpanzees, dogs, cats, mice, rats, and transgenic species thereof. T cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bone marrow, lymph node tissue, cord blood, thymus tissue, tissue from a site of infection, ascites, pleural effusion, spleen tissue, and tumors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0800" num="0814">In certain aspects of the present disclosure, immune effector cells, e.g., T cells, can be obtained from a unit of blood collected from a subject using any number of techniques known to the skilled artisan, such as Ficoll™ separation. In one aspect, cells from the circulating blood of an individual are obtained by apheresis. The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. In one aspect, the cells collected by apheresis may be washed to remove the plasma fraction and, optionally, to place the cells in an appropriate buffer or media for subsequent processing steps. In one embodiment, the cells are washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In an alternative embodiment, the wash solution lacks calcium and may lack magnesium or may lack many if not all divalent cations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0801" num="0815">Initial activation steps in the absence of calcium can lead to magnified activation. As those of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate a washing step may be accomplished by methods known to those in the art, such as by using a semi-automated “flow-through” centrifuge (for example, the Cobe 2991 cell processor, the Baxter CytoMate, or the Haemonetics Cell Saver 5) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, the cells may be resuspended in a variety of biocompatible buffers, such as, for example, Ca-free, Mg-free PBS, PlasmaLyte A, or other saline solution with or without buffer. Alternatively, the undesirable components of the apheresis sample may be removed and the cells directly resuspended in culture media.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0802" num="0816">It is recognized that the methods of the application can utilize culture media conditions comprising 5% or less, for example 2%, human AB serum, and employ known culture media conditions and compositions, for example those described in Smith et al., “Ex vivo expansion of human T cells for adoptive immunotherapy using the novel Xeno-free CTS Immune Cell Serum Replacement” Clinical &amp; Translational Immunology (2015) 4, e31; doi:10.1038/cti.2014.31.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0803" num="0817">In one aspect, T cells are isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes by lysing the red blood cells and depleting the monocytes, for example, by centrifugation through a PERCOLL™ gradient or by counterflow centrifugal elutriation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0804" num="0818">The methods described herein can include, e.g., selection of a specific subpopulation of immune effector cells, e.g., T cells, that are a T regulatory cell-depleted population, CD25+ depleted cells, using, e.g., a negative selection technique, e.g., described herein. In some embodiments, the population of T regulatory depleted cells contains less than 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1% of CD25+ cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0805" num="0819">In one embodiment, T regulatory cells, e.g., CD25+ T cells, are removed from the population using an anti-CD25 antibody, or fragment thereof, or a CD25-binding ligand, IL-2. In one embodiment, the anti-CD25 antibody, or fragment thereof, or CD25-binding ligand is conjugated to a substrate, e.g., a bead, or is otherwise coated on a substrate, e.g., a bead. In one embodiment, the anti-CD25 antibody, or fragment thereof, is conjugated to a substrate as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0806" num="0820">In one embodiment, the T regulatory cells, e.g., CD25+ T cells, are removed from the population using CD25 depletion reagent from Miltenyi™. In one embodiment, the ratio of cells to CD25 depletion reagent is 1e7 cells to 20 uL, or 1e7 cells to 15 uL, or 1e7 cells to 10 uL, or 1e7 cells to 5 uL, or 1e7 cells to 2.5 uL, or 1e7 cells to 1.25 uL. In one embodiment, e.g., for T regulatory cells, e.g., CD25+ depletion, greater than 500 million cells/ml is used. In a further aspect, a concentration of cells of 600, 700, 800, or 900 million cells/ml is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0807" num="0821">In one embodiment, the population of immune effector cells to be depleted includes about 6×10<sup>9 </sup>CD25+ T cells. In other aspects, the population of immune effector cells to be depleted include about 1×10<sup>9 </sup>to 1×10<sup>10 </sup>CD25+ T cell, and any integer value in between. In one embodiment, the resulting population T regulatory depleted cells has 2×10<sup>9 </sup>T regulatory cells, e.g., CD25+ cells, or less (e.g., 1×10<sup>9</sup>, 5×10<sup>8</sup>, 1×10<sup>8</sup>, 5×10<sup>7</sup>, 1×10<sup>7</sup>, or less CD25+ cells).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0808" num="0822">In one embodiment, the T regulatory cells, e.g., CD25+ cells, are removed from the population using the CliniMAC system with a depletion tubing set, such as, e.g., tubing 162-01. In one embodiment, the CliniMAC system is run on a depletion setting such as, e.g., DEPLETION2.1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0809" num="0823">Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, decreasing the level of negative regulators of immune cells (e.g., decreasing the number of unwanted immune cells, e.g., T<sub>REG </sub>cells), in a subject prior to apheresis or during manufacturing of a CAR-expressing cell product significantly reduces the risk of subject relapse. For example, methods of depleting T<sub>REG </sub>cells are known in the art. Methods of decreasing T<sub>REG </sub>cells include, but are not limited to, cyclophosphamide, anti-GITR antibody (an anti-GITR antibody described herein), CD25-depletion, mTOR inhibitor, and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0810" num="0824">In some embodiments, the manufacturing methods comprise reducing the number of (e.g., depleting) T<sub>REG </sub>cells prior to manufacturing of the CAR-expressing cell. For example, manufacturing methods comprise contacting the sample, e.g., the apheresis sample, with an anti-GITR antibody and/or an anti-CD25 antibody (or fragment thereof, or a CD25-binding ligand), e.g., to deplete T<sub>REG </sub>cells prior to manufacturing of the CAR-expressing cell (e.g., T cell, NK cell) product.</div>

In an embodiment, a subject is pre-treated with one or more therapies that reduce TREG cells prior to collection of cells for CAR-expressing cell product manufacturing, thereby reducing the risk of subject relapse to CAR-expressing cell treatment. In an embodiment, methods of decreasing T<sub>REG </sub>cells include, but are not limited to, administration to the subject of one or more of cyclophosphamide, anti-GITR antibody, CD25-depletion, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, methods of decreasing T<sub>REG </sub>cells include, but are not limited to, administration to the subject of one or more of cyclophosphamide, anti-GITR antibody, CD25-depletion, mTOR inhibitor, or a combination thereof. Administration of one or more of cyclophosphamide, anti-GITR antibody, CD25-depletion, or a combination thereof, can occur before, during or after an infusion of the CAR-expressing cell product. Administration of one or more of cyclophosphamide, anti-GITR antibody, CD25-depletion, mTOR inhibitor, or a combination thereof, can occur before, during or after an infusion of the CAR-expressing cell product.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0815" num="0829">In one embodiment, the population of cells to be removed are neither the regulatory T cells or tumor cells, but cells that otherwise negatively affect the expansion and/or function of CART cells, e.g. cells expressing CD14, CD11b, CD33, CD15, or other markers expressed by potentially immune suppressive cells. In one embodiment, such cells are envisioned to be removed concurrently with regulatory T cells and/or tumor cells, or following said depletion, or in another order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0816" num="0830">The methods described herein can include more than one selection step, e.g., more than one depletion step. Enrichment of a T cell population by negative selection can be accomplished, e.g., with a combination of antibodies directed to surface markers unique to the negatively selected cells. One method is cell sorting and/or selection via negative magnetic immunoadherence or flow cytometry that uses a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies directed to cell surface markers present on the cells negatively selected. For example, to enrich for CD4+ cells by negative selection, a monoclonal antibody cocktail can include antibodies to CD14, CD20, CD11b, CD16, HLA-DR, and CD8.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0817" num="0831">The methods described herein can further include removing cells from the population which express a tumor antigen, e.g., a tumor antigen that does not comprise CD25, e.g., CD19, CD30, CD38, CD123, CD20, CD14 or CD11b, to thereby provide a population of T regulatory depleted, e.g., CD25+ depleted, and tumor antigen depleted cells that are suitable for expression of a CAR, e.g., a CAR described herein. In one embodiment, tumor antigen expressing cells are removed simultaneously with the T regulatory, e.g., CD25+ cells. For example, an anti-CD25 antibody, or fragment thereof, and an anti-tumor antigen antibody, or fragment thereof, can be attached to the same substrate, e.g., bead, which can be used to remove the cells or an anti-CD25 antibody, or fragment thereof, or the anti-tumor antigen antibody, or fragment thereof, can be attached to separate beads, a mixture of which can be used to remove the cells. In other embodiments, the removal of T regulatory cells, e.g., CD25+ cells, and the removal of the tumor antigen expressing cells is sequential, and can occur, e.g., in either order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0818" num="0832">Also provided are methods that include removing cells from the population which express a check point inhibitor, e.g., a check point inhibitor described herein, e.g., one or more of PD1+ cells, LAG3+ cells, and TIM3+ cells, to thereby provide a population of T regulatory depleted, e.g., CD25+ depleted cells, and check point inhibitor depleted cells, e.g., PD1+, LAG3+ and/or TIM3+ depleted cells. Exemplary check point inhibitors include PD1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4, TIM3, CEACAM (e.g., CEACAM-1, CEACAM-3 and/or CEACAM-5), LAG3, VISTA, BTLA, TIGIT, LAIR1, CD160, 2B4, CD80, CD86, B7-H3 (CD276), B7-H4 (VTCN1), HVEM (TNFRSF14 or CD270), KIR, A2aR, MHC class I, MHC class II, GALS, adenosine, and TGFR (e.g., TGFRbeta), e.g., as described herein. In one embodiment, check point inhibitor expressing cells are removed simultaneously with the T regulatory, e.g., CD25+ cells. For example, an anti-CD25 antibody, or fragment thereof, and an anti-check point inhibitor antibody, or fragment thereof, can be attached to the same bead which can be used to remove the cells, or an anti-CD25 antibody, or fragment thereof, and the anti-check point inhibitor antibody, or fragment thereof, can be attached to separate beads, a mixture of which can be used to remove the cells. In other embodiments, the removal of T regulatory cells, e.g., CD25+ cells, and the removal of the check point inhibitor expressing cells is sequential, and can occur, e.g., in either order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0819" num="0833">Methods described herein can include a positive selection step. For example, T cells can be isolated by incubation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (e.g., 3×28)-conjugated beads, such as DYNABEADS® M-450 CD3/CD28 T, for a time period sufficient for positive selection of the desired T cells. In one aspect, the time period is about 30 minutes. In a further aspect, the time period ranges from 30 minutes to 36 hours or longer and all integer values there between. In a further aspect, the time period is at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hours. In yet another aspect, the time period is 10 to 24 hours. In one aspect, the incubation time period is 24 hours. Longer incubation times may be used to isolate T cells in any situation where there are few T cells as compared to other cell types, such in isolating tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from tumor tissue or from immunocompromised individuals. Further, use of longer incubation times can increase the efficiency of capture of CD8+ T cells. Thus, by simply shortening or lengthening the time T cells are allowed to bind to the CD3/CD28 beads and/or by increasing or decreasing the ratio of beads to T cells (as described further herein), subpopulations of T cells can be preferentially selected for or against at culture initiation or at other time points during the process. Additionally, by increasing or decreasing the ratio of anti-CD3 and/or anti-CD28 antibodies on the beads or other surface, subpopulations of T cells can be preferentially selected for or against at culture initiation or at other desired time points.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0820" num="0834">In one embodiment, a T cell population can be selected that expresses one or more of IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-17A, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-13, granzyme B, and perforin, or other appropriate molecules, e.g., other cytokines. Methods for screening for cell expression can be determined, e.g., by the methods described in PCT Publication No.: WO 2013/126712.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0821" num="0835">For isolation of a desired population of cells by positive or negative selection, the concentration of cells and surface (e.g., particles such as beads) can be varied. In certain aspects, it may be desirable to significantly decrease the volume in which beads and cells are mixed together (e.g., increase the concentration of cells), to ensure maximum contact of cells and beads. For example, in one aspect, a concentration of about 10 billion cells/ml, 9 billion/ml, 8 billion/ml, 7 billion/ml, 6 billion/ml, or 5 billion/ml is used. In one aspect, a concentration of 1 billion cells/ml is used. In one aspect, a concentration of cells from 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 million cells/ml is used. In further aspects, concentrations of 125 or 150 million cells/ml can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0822" num="0836">Using high concentrations can result in increased cell yield, cell activation, and cell expansion. Further, use of high cell concentrations allows more efficient capture of cells that may weakly express target antigens of interest, such as CD28-negative T cells, or from samples where there are many tumor cells present (e.g., leukemic blood, tumor tissue, etc.). Such populations of cells may have therapeutic value and would be desirable to obtain. For example, using high concentration of cells allows more efficient selection of CD8+ T cells that normally have weaker CD28 expression.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0823" num="0837">In a related aspect, it may be desirable to use lower concentrations of cells. By significantly diluting the mixture of T cells and surface (e.g., particles such as beads), interactions between the particles and cells is minimized. This selects for cells that express high amounts of desired antigens to be bound to the particles. For example, CD4+ T cells express higher levels of CD28 and are more efficiently captured than CD8+ T cells in dilute concentrations. In one aspect, the concentration of cells used is 5×10<sup>6</sup>/ml. In other aspects, the concentration used can be from about 1×10<sup>5</sup>/ml to 1×10<sup>6</sup>/ml, and any integer value in between.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0824" num="0838">In other aspects, the cells may be incubated on a rotator for varying lengths of time at varying speeds at either 2-10° C. or at room temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0825" num="0839">T cells for stimulation can also be frozen after a washing step. Wishing not to be bound by theory, the freeze and subsequent thaw step provides a more uniform product by removing granulocytes and to some extent monocytes in the cell population. After the washing step that removes plasma and platelets, the cells may be suspended in a freezing solution. While many freezing solutions and parameters are known in the art and will be useful in this context, one method involves using PBS containing 20% DMSO and 8% human serum albumin, or culture media containing 10% Dextran 40 and 5% Dextrose, 20% Human Serum Albumin and 7.5% DMSO, or 31.25% Plasmalyte-A, 31.25% Dextrose 5%, 0.45% NaCl, 10% Dextran 40 and 5% Dextrose, 20% Human Serum Albumin, and 7.5% DMSO or other suitable cell freezing media containing for example, Hespan and PlasmaLyte A, the cells then are frozen to −80° C. at a rate of 1° per minute and stored in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen storage tank. Other methods of controlled freezing may be used as well as uncontrolled freezing immediately at −20° C. or in liquid nitrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0826" num="0840">In certain aspects, cryopreserved cells are thawed and washed as described herein and allowed to rest for one hour at room temperature prior to activation using the methods of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0827" num="0841">Also contemplated in the context of the invention is the collection of blood samples or apheresis product from a subject at a time period prior to when the expanded cells as described herein might be needed. As such, the source of the cells to be expanded can be collected at any time point necessary, and desired cells, such as T cells, isolated and frozen for later use in immune effector cell therapy for any number of diseases or conditions that would benefit from immune effector cell therapy, such as those described herein. In one aspect a blood sample or an apheresis is taken from a generally healthy subject. In certain aspects, a blood sample or an apheresis is taken from a generally healthy subject who is at risk of developing a disease, but who has not yet developed a disease, and the cells of interest are isolated and frozen for later use. In certain aspects, the T cells may be expanded, frozen, and used at a later time. In certain aspects, samples are collected from a patient shortly after diagnosis of a particular disease as described herein but prior to any treatments. In a further aspect, the cells are isolated from a blood sample or an apheresis from a subject prior to any number of relevant treatment modalities, including but not limited to treatment with agents such as natalizumab, efalizumab, antiviral agents, chemotherapy, radiation, immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporin, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and FK506, antibodies, or other immunoablative agents such as CAMPATH, anti-CD3 antibodies, cytoxan, fludarabine, cyclosporin, FK506, rapamycin, mycophenolic acid, steroids, FR901228, and irradiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0828" num="0842">In a further aspect of the present invention, T cells are obtained from a patient directly following treatment that leaves the subject with functional T cells. In this regard, it has been observed that following certain cancer treatments, in particular treatments with drugs that damage the immune system, shortly after treatment during the period when patients would normally be recovering from the treatment, the quality of T cells obtained may be optimal or improved for their ability to expand ex vivo. Likewise, following ex vivo manipulation using the methods described herein, these cells may be in a preferred state for enhanced engraftment and in vivo expansion. Thus, it is contemplated within the context of the present invention to collect blood cells, including T cells, dendritic cells, or other cells of the hematopoietic lineage, during this recovery phase. Further, in certain aspects, mobilization (for example, mobilization with GM-CSF) and conditioning regimens can be used to create a condition in a subject wherein repopulation, recirculation, regeneration, and/or expansion of particular cell types is favored, especially during a defined window of time following therapy. Illustrative cell types include T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and other cells of the immune system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0829" num="0843">In one embodiment, the immune effector cells expressing a CAR molecule, e.g., a CAR molecule described herein, are obtained from a subject that has received a low, immune enhancing dose of an mTOR inhibitor. In an embodiment, the population of immune effector cells, e.g., T cells, to be engineered to express a CAR, are harvested after a sufficient time, or after sufficient dosing of the low, immune enhancing, dose of an mTOR inhibitor, such that the level of PD1 negative immune effector cells, e.g., T cells, or the ratio of PD1 negative immune effector cells, e.g., T cells/PD1 positive immune effector cells, e.g., T cells, in the subject or harvested from the subject has been, at least transiently, increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0830" num="0844">In other embodiments, population of immune effector cells, e.g., T cells, which have, or will be engineered to express a CAR, can be treated ex vivo by contact with an amount of an mTOR inhibitor that increases the number of PD1 negative immune effector cells, e.g., T cells or increases the ratio of PD1 negative immune effector cells, e.g., T cells/PD1 positive immune effector cells, e.g., T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0831" num="0845">In one embodiment, a T cell population is diacylglycerol kinase (DGK)-deficient. DGK-deficient cells include cells that do not express DGK RNA or protein, or have reduced or inhibited DGK activity. DGK-deficient cells can be generated by genetic approaches, e.g., administering RNA-interfering agents, e.g., siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, to reduce or prevent DGK expression. Alternatively, DGK-deficient cells can be generated by treatment with DGK inhibitors described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0832" num="0846">In one embodiment, a T cell population is Ikaros-deficient. Ikaros-deficient cells include cells that do not express Ikaros RNA or protein, or have reduced or inhibited Ikaros activity, Ikaros-deficient cells can be generated by genetic approaches, e.g., administering RNA-interfering agents, e.g., siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, to reduce or prevent Ikaros expression. Alternatively, Ikaros-deficient cells can be generated by treatment with Ikaros inhibitors, e.g., lenalidomide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0833" num="0847">In embodiments, a T cell population is DGK-deficient and Ikaros-deficient, e.g., does not express DGK and Ikaros, or has reduced or inhibited DGK and Ikaros activity. Such DGK and Ikaros-deficient cells can be generated by any of the methods described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0834" num="0848">In an embodiment, the NK cells are obtained from the subject. In another embodiment, the NK cells are an NK cell line, e.g., NK-92 cell line (Conkwest).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0835" num="0849">Allogeneic CAR</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0836" num="0850">In embodiments described herein, the immune effector cell can be an allogeneic immune effector cell, e.g., T cell or NK cell. For example, the cell can be an allogeneic T cell, e.g., an allogeneic T cell lacking expression of a functional T cell receptor (TCR) and/or human leukocyte antigen (HLA), e.g., HLA class I and/or HLA class II.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0837" num="0851">A T cell lacking a functional TCR can be, e.g., engineered such that it does not express any functional TCR on its surface, engineered such that it does not express one or more subunits that comprise a functional TCR (e.g., engineered such that it does not express (or exhibits reduced expression) of TCR alpha, TCR beta, TCR gamma, TCR delta, TCR epsilon, and/or TCR zeta) or engineered such that it produces very little functional TCR on its surface (e.g., engineered such that it does not express (or exhibits reduced expression) of TCR alpha, TCR beta, TCR gamma, TCR delta, TCR epsilon, and/or TCR zeta). Alternatively, the T cell can express a substantially impaired TCR, e.g., by expression of mutated or truncated forms of one or more of the subunits of the TCR. The term “substantially impaired TCR” means that this TCR will not elicit an adverse immune reaction in a host.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0838" num="0852">A T cell described herein can be, e.g., engineered such that it does not express a functional HLA on its surface. For example, a T cell described herein, can be engineered such that cell surface expression HLA, e.g., HLA class 1 and/or HLA class II, is downregulated. In some embodiments, downregulation of HLA may be accomplished by reducing or eliminating expression of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0839" num="0853">In some embodiments, the T cell can lack a functional TCR and a functional HLA, e.g., HLA class I and/or HLA class II.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0840" num="0854">Modified T cells that lack expression of a functional TCR and/or HLA can be obtained by any suitable means, including a knock out or knock down of one or more subunit of TCR or HLA. For example, the T cell can include a knock down of TCR and/or HLA using siRNA, shRNA, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) transcription-activator like effector nuclease (TALEN), or zinc finger endonuclease (ZFN).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0841" num="0855">In some embodiments, the allogeneic cell can be a cell which does not express or expresses at low levels an inhibitory molecule, e.g. a cell engineered by any method described herein. For example, the cell can be a cell that does not express or expresses at low levels an inhibitory molecule, e.g., that can decrease the ability of a CAR-expressing cell to mount an immune effector response. Examples of inhibitory molecules include PD1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4, TIM3, CEACAM (e.g., CEACAM-1, CEACAM-3 and/or CEACAM-5), LAGS, VISTA, BTLA, TIGIT, LAIR1, CD160, 2B4, CD80, CD86, B7-H3 (CD276), B7-H4 (VTCN1), HVEM (TNFRSF14 or CD270), KIR, A2aR, MHC class I, MHC class II, GALS, adenosine, and TGFR (e.g., TGFR beta). Inhibition of an inhibitory molecule, e.g., by inhibition at the DNA, RNA or protein level, can optimize a CAR-expressing cell performance. In embodiments, an inhibitory nucleic acid, e.g., an inhibitory nucleic acid, e.g., a dsRNA, e.g., an siRNA or shRNA, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), a transcription-activator like effector nuclease (TALEN), or a zinc finger endonuclease (ZFN), e.g., as described herein, can be used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0853" num="0867">While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, in some embodiments, a therapeutic T cell has short term persistence in a patient, due to shortened telomeres in the T cell; accordingly, transfection with a telomerase gene can lengthen the telomeres of the T cell and improve persistence of the T cell in the patient. See Carl June, “Adoptive T cell therapy for cancer in the clinic”, Journal of Clinical Investigation, 117:1466-1476 (2007). Thus, in an embodiment, an immune effector cell, e.g., a T cell, ectopically expresses a telomerase subunit, e.g., the catalytic subunit of telomerase, e.g., TERT, e.g., hTERT. In some aspects, this disclosure provides a method of producing a CAR-expressing cell, comprising contacting a cell with a nucleic acid encoding a telomerase subunit, e.g., the catalytic subunit of telomerase, e.g., TERT, e.g., hTERT. The cell may be contacted with the nucleic acid before, simultaneous with, or after being contacted with a construct encoding a CAR.</div>

Briefly, ex vivo culture and expansion of T cells can comprise: (1) collecting CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from a mammal from peripheral blood harvest or bone marrow explants; and (2) expanding such cells ex vivo. In addition to the cellular growth factors described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,199,942, other factors such as flt3-L, IL-1, IL-3 and c-kit ligand, can be used for culturing and expansion of the cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0864" num="0878">Generally, a population of immune effector cells may be expanded by contact with a surface having attached thereto an agent that stimulates a CD3/TCR complex associated signal and a ligand that stimulates a costimulatory molecule on the surface of the T cells. In particular, T cell populations may be stimulated as described herein, such as by contact with an anti-CD3 antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, or an anti-CD2 antibody immobilized on a surface, or by contact with a protein kinase C activator (e.g., bryostatin) in conjunction with a calcium ionophore. For co-stimulation of an accessory molecule on the surface of the T cells, a ligand that binds the accessory molecule is used. For example, a population of T cells can be contacted with an anti-CD3 antibody and an anti-CD28 antibody, under conditions appropriate for stimulating proliferation of the T cells. To stimulate proliferation of either CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells, an anti-CD3 antibody and an anti-CD28 antibody may be used. Examples of an anti-CD28 antibody include 9.3, B-T3, XR-CD28 (Diaclone, Besancon, France) can be used as can other methods commonly known in the art (Berg et al., Transplant Proc. 30(8):3975-3977, 1998; Haanen et al., J. Exp. Med. 190(9):13191328, 1999; Garland et al., J. Immunol Meth. 227(1-2):53-63, 1999).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0865" num="0879">In some embodiments, immune effector cells (such as PBMCs or T cells) are expanded and stimulated by contacting the cells to one or both of an anti-CD3 antibody and IL-2. In embodiments, the cells are expanded without anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 beads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0866" num="0880">In certain aspects, the primary stimulatory signal and the costimulatory signal for the T cell may be provided by different protocols. For example, the agents providing each signal may be in solution or coupled to a surface. When coupled to a surface, the agents may be coupled to the same surface (i.e., in “cis” formation) or to separate surfaces (i.e., in “trans” formation). Alternatively, one agent may be coupled to a surface and the other agent in solution. In one aspect, the agent providing the costimulatory signal is bound to a cell surface and the agent providing the primary activation signal is in solution or coupled to a surface. In certain aspects, both agents can be in solution. In one aspect, the agents may be in soluble form, and then cross-linked to a surface, such as a cell expressing Fc receptors or an antibody or other binding agent which will bind to the agents. In this regard, see for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20040101519 and 20060034810 for artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) that are contemplated for use in activating and expanding T cells in the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0867" num="0881">In one aspect, the two agents are immobilized on beads, either on the same bead, i.e., “cis,” or to separate beads, i.e., “trans.” By way of example, the agent providing the primary activation signal is an anti-CD3 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof and the agent providing the costimulatory signal is an anti-CD28 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof; and both agents are co-immobilized to the same bead in equivalent molecular amounts. In one aspect, a 1:1 ratio of each antibody bound to the beads for CD4+ T cell expansion and T cell growth is used. In certain aspects, a ratio of anti CD3:CD28 antibodies bound to the beads is used such that an increase in T cell expansion is observed as compared to the expansion observed using a ratio of 1:1. In one particular aspect an increase of from about 1 to about 3 fold is observed as compared to the expansion observed using a ratio of 1:1. In one aspect, the ratio of CD3:CD28 antibody bound to the beads ranges from 100:1 to 1:100 and all integer values there between. In one aspect, more anti-CD28 antibody is bound to the particles than anti-CD3 antibody, i.e., the ratio of CD3:CD28 is less than one. In certain aspects, the ratio of anti CD28 antibody to anti CD3 antibody bound to the beads is greater than 2:1. In one particular aspect, a 1:100 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to beads is used. In one aspect, a 1:75 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to beads is used. In a further aspect, a 1:50 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to beads is used. In one aspect, a 1:30 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to beads is used. In one aspect, a 1:10 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to beads is used. In one aspect, a 1:3 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to the beads is used. In yet one aspect, a 3:1 CD3:CD28 ratio of antibody bound to the beads is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0868" num="0882">Ratios of particles to cells from 1:500 to 500:1 and any integer values in between may be used to stimulate T cells or other target cells. As those of ordinary skill in the art can readily appreciate, the ratio of particles to cells may depend on particle size relative to the target cell. For example, small sized beads could only bind a few cells, while larger beads could bind many. In certain aspects the ratio of cells to particles ranges from 1:100 to 100:1 and any integer values in-between and in further aspects the ratio comprises 1:9 to 9:1 and any integer values in between, can also be used to stimulate T cells. The ratio of anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-coupled particles to T cells that result in T cell stimulation can vary as noted above, however certain suitable values include 1:100, 1:50, 1:40, 1:30, 1:20, 1:10, 1:9, 1:8, 1:7, 1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, and 15:1 with one suitable ratio being at least 1:1 particles per T cell. In one aspect, a ratio of particles to cells of 1:1 or less is used. In one particular aspect, a suitable particle: cell ratio is 1:5. In further aspects, the ratio of particles to cells can be varied depending on the day of stimulation. For example, in one aspect, the ratio of particles to cells is from 1:1 to 10:1 on the first day and additional particles are added to the cells every day or every other day thereafter for up to 10 days, at final ratios of from 1:1 to 1:10 (based on cell counts on the day of addition). In one particular aspect, the ratio of particles to cells is 1:1 on the first day of stimulation and adjusted to 1:5 on the third and fifth days of stimulation. In one aspect, particles are added on a daily or every other day basis to a final ratio of 1:1 on the first day, and 1:5 on the third and fifth days of stimulation. In one aspect, the ratio of particles to cells is 2:1 on the first day of stimulation and adjusted to 1:10 on the third and fifth days of stimulation. In one aspect, particles are added on a daily or every other day basis to a final ratio of 1:1 on the first day, and 1:10 on the third and fifth days of stimulation. One of skill in the art will appreciate that a variety of other ratios may be suitable for use in the present invention. In particular, ratios will vary depending on particle size and on cell size and type. In one aspect, the most typical ratios for use are in the neighborhood of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 on the first day.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0869" num="0883">In further aspects of the present invention, the cells, such as T cells, are combined with agent-coated beads, the beads and the cells are subsequently separated, and then the cells are cultured. In an alternative aspect, prior to culture, the agent-coated beads and cells are not separated but are cultured together. In a further aspect, the beads and cells are first concentrated by application of a force, such as a magnetic force, resulting in increased ligation of cell surface markers, thereby inducing cell stimulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0870" num="0884">By way of example, cell surface proteins may be ligated by allowing paramagnetic beads to which anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 are attached (3×28 beads) to contact the T cells. In one aspect the cells (for example, 10<sup>4 </sup>to 10<sup>9 </sup>T cells) and beads (for example, DYNABEADS® M-450 CD3/CD28 T paramagnetic beads at a ratio of 1:1) are combined in a buffer, for example PBS (without divalent cations such as, calcium and magnesium). Again, those of ordinary skill in the art can readily appreciate any cell concentration may be used. For example, the target cell may be very rare in the sample and comprise only 0.01% of the sample or the entire sample (i.e., 100%) may comprise the target cell of interest. Accordingly, any cell number is within the context of the present invention. In certain aspects, it may be desirable to significantly decrease the volume in which particles and cells are mixed together (i.e., increase the concentration of cells), to ensure maximum contact of cells and particles. For example, in one aspect, a concentration of about 10 billion cells/ml, 9 billion/ml, 8 billion/ml, 7 billion/ml, 6 billion/ml, or 5 billion/ml or 2 billion cells/ml is used. In one aspect, greater than 100 million cells/ml is used. In a further aspect, a concentration of cells of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 million cells/ml is used. In yet one aspect, a concentration of cells from 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 million cells/ml is used. In further aspects, concentrations of 125 or 150 million cells/ml can be used. Using high concentrations can result in increased cell yield, cell activation, and cell expansion. Further, use of high cell concentrations allows more efficient capture of cells that may weakly express target antigens of interest, such as CD28-negative T cells. Such populations of cells may have therapeutic value and would be desirable to obtain in certain aspects. For example, using high concentration of cells allows more efficient selection of CD8+ T cells that normally have weaker CD28 expression.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0871" num="0885">In one embodiment, cells transduced with a nucleic acid encoding a CAR, e.g., a CAR described herein, are expanded, e.g., by a method described herein. In one embodiment, the cells are expanded in culture for a period of several hours (e.g., about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 18, 21 hours) to about 14 days (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 days). In one embodiment, the cells are expanded for a period of 4 to 9 days. In one embodiment, the cells are expanded for a period of 8 days or less, e.g., 7, 6 or 5 days. In one embodiment, the cells, e.g., a CAR cell described herein, are expanded in culture for 5 days, and the resulting cells are more potent than the same cells expanded in culture for 9 days under the same culture conditions. Potency can be defined, e.g., by various T cell functions, e.g. proliferation, target cell killing, cytokine production, activation, migration, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the cells, e.g., a CD19 CAR cell described herein, expanded for 5 days show at least a one, two, three or four fold increase in cells doublings upon antigen stimulation as compared to the same cells expanded in culture for 9 days under the same culture conditions. In one embodiment, the cells, e.g., the cells expressing a CAR described herein, are expanded in culture for 5 days, and the resulting cells exhibit higher proinflammatory cytokine production, e.g., IFN-γ and/or GM-CSF levels, as compared to the same cells expanded in culture for 9 days under the same culture conditions. In one embodiment, the cells, e.g., a CAR cell described herein, expanded for 5 days show at least a one, two, three, four, five, ten fold or more increase in pg/ml of proinflammatory cytokine production, e.g., IFN-γ and/or GM-CSF levels, as compared to the same cells expanded in culture for 9 days under the same culture conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0872" num="0886">In one aspect of the present invention, the mixture may be cultured for several hours (about 3 hours) to about 14 days or any hourly integer value in between. In one aspect, the mixture may be cultured for 21 days. In one aspect of the invention the beads and the T cells are cultured together for about eight days. In one aspect, the beads and T cells are cultured together for 2-3 days.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0873" num="0887">Several cycles of stimulation may also be desired such that culture time of T cells can be 60 days or more. Conditions appropriate for T cell culture include an appropriate media (e.g., Minimal Essential Media or RPMI Media 1640 or, X-vivo 15, (Lonza)) that may contain factors necessary for proliferation and viability, including serum (e.g., fetal bovine or human serum), interleukin-2 (IL-2), insulin, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-7, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, TGFβ, and TNF-α or any other additives for the growth of cells known to the skilled artisan. Other additives for the growth of cells include, but are not limited to, surfactant, plasmanate, and reducing agents such as N-acetyl-cysteine and 2-mercaptoethanol. Media can include RPMI 1640, AIM-V, DMEM, MEM, α-MEM, F-12, X-Vivo 15, and X-Vivo 20, Optimizer, with added amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and vitamins, either serum-free or supplemented with an appropriate amount of serum (or plasma) or a defined set of hormones, and/or an amount of cytokine(s) sufficient for the growth and expansion of T cells. Antibiotics, e.g., penicillin and streptomycin, are included only in experimental cultures, not in cultures of cells that are to be infused into a subject. The target cells are maintained under conditions necessary to support growth, for example, an appropriate temperature (e.g., 37° C.) and atmosphere (e.g., air plus 5% CO<sub>2</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0874" num="0888">In one embodiment, the cells are expanded in an appropriate media (e.g., media described herein) that includes one or more interleukin that result in at least a 200-fold (e.g., 200-fold, 250-fold, 300-fold, 350-fold) increase in cells over a 14 day expansion period, e.g., as measured by a method described herein such as flow cytometry. In one embodiment, the cells are expanded in the presence IL-15 and/or IL-7 (e.g., IL-15 and IL-7).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0875" num="0889">In some embodiments a CAR-expressing cell described herein (e.g., a T cell such as a CD4+ T cell or a CD8+ T cell) is contacted with a composition comprising a interleukin-15 (IL-15) polypeptide, a interleukin-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ra) polypeptide, or a combination of both a IL-15 polypeptide and a IL-15Ra polypeptide e.g., hetIL-15, during the manufacturing of the CAR-expressing cell, e.g., ex vivo. In embodiments, a CAR-expressing cell described herein is contacted with a composition comprising a IL-15 polypeptide during the manufacturing of the CAR-expressing cell, e.g., ex vivo. In embodiments, a CAR-expressing cell described herein is contacted with a composition comprising a combination of both a IL-15 polypeptide and a IL-15 Ra polypeptide during the manufacturing of the CAR-expressing cell, e.g., ex vivo. In embodiments, a CAR-expressing cell described herein is contacted with a composition comprising hetIL-15 during the manufacturing of the CAR-expressing cell, e.g., ex vivo.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0876" num="0890">In one embodiment the CAR-expressing cell (e.g., a T cell or NK cell) described herein is contacted with a composition comprising hetIL-15 during ex vivo expansion. In an embodiment, the CAR-expressing cell described herein is contacted with a composition comprising an IL-15 polypeptide during ex vivo expansion. In an embodiment, the CAR-expressing cell described herein is contacted with a composition comprising both an IL-15 polypeptide and an IL-15Ra polypeptide during ex vivo expansion. In one embodiment the contacting results in the survival and proliferation of a lymphocyte subpopulation, e.g., CD8+ T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0877" num="0891">In an embodiments, the method of making disclosed herein further comprises contacting the population of immune effector cells (e.g., T cells or NK cells) with a nucleic acid encoding a telomerase subunit, e.g., hTERT. The nucleic acid encoding the telomerase subunit can be DNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0878" num="0892">T cells that have been exposed to varied stimulation times may exhibit different characteristics. For example, typical blood or apheresed peripheral blood mononuclear cell products have a helper T cell population (TH, CD4+) that is greater than the cytotoxic or suppressor T cell population (TC, CD8+). Ex vivo expansion of T cells by stimulating CD3 and CD28 receptors produces a population of T cells that prior to about days 8-9 consists predominately of TH cells, while after about days 8-9, the population of T cells comprises an increasingly greater population of TC cells. Accordingly, depending on the purpose of treatment, infusing a subject with a T cell population comprising predominately of TH cells may be advantageous. Similarly, if an antigen-specific subset of TC cells has been isolated it may be beneficial to expand this subset to a greater degree.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0879" num="0893">Further, in addition to CD4 and CD8 markers, other phenotypic markers vary significantly, but in large part, reproducibly during the course of the cell expansion process. Thus, such reproducibility enables the ability to tailor an activated T cell product for specific purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0880" num="0894">Once a CAR, e.g., CD19 CAR is constructed, various assays can be used to evaluate the activity of the molecule, such as but not limited to, the ability to expand T cells following antigen stimulation, sustain T cell expansion in the absence of re-stimulation, and anti-cancer activities in appropriate in vitro and animal models. Assays to evaluate the effects of a CAR, e.g., CD19 CAR are described in further detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0881" num="0895">Western blot analysis of CAR expression in primary T cells can be used to detect the presence of monomers and dimers, e.g., as described in paragraph 695 of International Application WO2015/142675, filed Mar. 13, 2015, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0882" num="0896">In vitro expansion of CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells following antigen stimulation can be measured by flow cytometry. For example, a mixture of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are stimulated with αCD3/αCD28 beads followed by transduction with lentiviral vectors expressing GFP under the control of the promoters to be analyzed. Exemplary promoters include the CMV IE gene, EF-1a, ubiquitin C, or phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) promoters. GFP fluorescence is evaluated on day 6 of culture in the CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets by flow cytometry. See, e.g., Milone et al., Molecular Therapy 17(8): 1453-1464 (2009). Alternatively, a mixture of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are stimulated with αCD3/αCD28 coated magnetic beads on day 0, and transduced with CAR on day 1 using a bicistronic lentiviral vector expressing CAR along with eGFP using a 2A ribosomal skipping sequence. Cultures are re-stimulated with either CD19<sup>+</sup> K562 cells (K562-CD19), wild-type K562 cells (K562 wild type) or K562 cells expressing hCD32 and 4-1BBL in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody (K562-BBL-3/28) following washing. Exogenous IL-2 is added to the cultures every other day at 100 IU/ml. GFP<sup>+</sup> T cells are enumerated by flow cytometry using bead-based counting. See, e.g., Milone et al., Molecular Therapy 17(8): 1453-1464 (2009).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0883" num="0897">Sustained CAR<sup>P </sup>T cell expansion in the absence of re-stimulation can also be measured. See, e.g., Milone et al., Molecular Therapy 17(8): 1453-1464 (2009). Briefly, mean T cell volume (fl) is measured on day 8 of culture using a Coulter Multisizer particle counter, a Nexcelom Cellometer Vision, or Millipore Scepter following stimulation with αCD3/αCD28 coated magnetic beads on day 0, and transduction with the indicated CAR on day 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0884" num="0898">Animal models can also be used to measure a CAR-expressing cell activity, e.g., as described in paragraph 698 of International Application WO2015/142675, filed Mar. 13, 2015, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0885" num="0899">Dose dependent CAR treatment response can be evaluated, e.g., as described in paragraph 699 of International Application WO2015/142675, filed Mar. 13, 2015, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Cytotoxicity can be assessed by a standard <sup>51</sup>Cr-release assay, e.g., as described in paragraph 701 of International Application WO2015/142675, filed Mar. 13, 2015, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Imaging technologies can be used to evaluate specific trafficking and proliferation of CARs in tumor-bearing animal models, e.g., as described in paragraph 702 of International Application WO2015/142675, filed Mar. 13, 2015, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>

In one exemplary embodiment, the CAR ligand is an antibody that binds to the CAR molecule, e.g., binds to the extracellular antigen binding domain of CAR (e.g., an antibody that binds to the antigen binding domain, e.g., an anti-idiotypic antibody; or an antibody that binds to a constant region of the extracellular binding domain).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0919" num="0946">The invention includes (among other things) a type of cellular therapy where T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and the CAR T cell is infused to a recipient in need thereof. The infused cell is able to kill tumor cells in the recipient. Unlike antibody therapies, CAR-modified T cells are able to replicate in vivo resulting in long-term persistence that can lead to sustained tumor control. In various aspects, the T cells administered to the patient, or their progeny, persist in the patient for at least four months, five months, six months, seven months, eight months, nine months, ten months, eleven months, twelve months, thirteen months, fourteen month, fifteen months, sixteen months, seventeen months, eighteen months, nineteen months, twenty months, twenty-one months, twenty-two months, twenty-three months, two years, three years, four years, or five years after administration of the T cell to the patient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0920" num="0947">The invention also includes a type of cellular therapy where immune effector cells, e.g., NK cells or T cells are modified, e.g., by in vitro transcribed RNA, to transiently express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and the CAR-expressing (e.g., CAR T) cell is infused to a recipient in need thereof. The infused cell is able to kill cancer cells in the recipient. Thus, in various aspects, the CAR-expressing cells, e.g., T cells, administered to the patient, is present for less than one month, e.g., three weeks, two weeks, one week, after administration of the CAR-expressing cell, e.g., T cell, to the patient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0921" num="0948">Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the anti-cancer immunity response elicited by the CAR-modified T cells may be an active or a passive immune response, or alternatively may be due to a direct vs indirect immune response. In one aspect, the CAR (e.g., CD19-CAR) transduced T cells exhibit specific proinflammatory cytokine secretion and potent cytolytic activity in response to human cancer cells expressing the target antigen (e.g., CD19), resist soluble target antigen inhibition, mediate bystander killing and mediate regression of an established human cancer. For example, antigen-less cancer cells within a heterogeneous field of target antigen-expressing cancer may be susceptible to indirect destruction by target antigen-redirected T cells that has previously reacted against adjacent antigen-positive cancer cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0922" num="0949">In one aspect, the CAR-modified cells of the invention, e.g., fully human CAR T cells, may be a type of vaccine for ex vivo immunization and/or in vivo therapy in a mammal. In one aspect, the mammal is a human.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0945" num="0972">Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of cancers of lymphocytes, formed from either B or T cells. NHLs occur at any age and are often characterized by lymph nodes that are larger than normal, weight loss, and fever. Different types of NHLs are categorized as aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow-growing) types. B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas include Burkitt lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, immunoblastic large cell lymphoma, precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. Examples of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas include mycosis fungoides, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Lymphomas that occur after bone marrow or stem cell transplantation are typically B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. See, e.g., Maloney. NEJM. 366.21(2012):2008-16.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0946" num="0973">Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a form of NHL that develops from B cells. DLBCL is an aggressive lymphoma that can arise in lymph nodes or outside of the lymphatic system, e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract, testes, thyroid, skin, breast, bone, or brain. Three variants of cellular morphology are commonly observed in DLBCL: centroblastic, immunoblastic, and anaplastic. Centroblastic morphology is most common and has the appearance of medium-to-large-sized lymphocytes with minimal cytoplasm. There are several subtypes of DLBCL. For example, primary central nervous system lymphoma is a type of DLBCL that only affects the brain is called and is treated differently than DLBCL that affects areas outside of the brain. Another type of DLBCL is primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, which often occurs in younger patients and grows rapidly in the chest. Symptoms of DLBCL include a painless rapid swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin, which is caused by enlarged lymph nodes. For some subjects, the swelling may be painful. Other symptoms of DLBCL include night sweats, unexplained fevers, and weight loss. Although most patients with DLBCL are adults, this disease sometimes occurs in children. Treatment for DLBCL includes chemotherapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, etoposide), antibodies (e.g., Rituxan), radiation, or stem cell transplants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0947" num="0974">Follicular lymphoma a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is a lymphoma of follicle center B-cells (centrocytes and centroblasts), which has at least a partially follicular pattern. Follicular lymphoma cells express the B-cell markers CD10, CD19, CD20, and CD22. Follicular lymphoma cells are commonly negative for CD5. Morphologically, a follicular lymphoma tumor is made up of follicles containing a mixture of centrocytes (also called cleaved follicle center cells or small cells) and centroblasts (also called large noncleaved follicle center cells or large cells). The follicles are surrounded by non-malignant cells, mostly T-cells. The follicles contain predominantly centrocytes with a minority of centroblasts. The World Health Organization (WHO) morphologically grades the disease as follows: grade 1 (&lt;5 centroblasts per high-power field (hpf); grade 2 (6-15 centroblasts/hpf); grade 3 (&gt;15 centroblasts/hpf). Grade 3 is further subdivided into the following grades: grade 3A (centrocytes still present); grade 3B (the follicles consist almost entirely of centroblasts). Treatment of follicular lymphoma includes chemotherapy, e.g., alkyating agents, nucleoside analogs, anthracycline-containing regimens, e.g., a combination therapy called CHOP—cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone/prednisolone, antibodies (e.g., rituximab), radioimmunotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0948" num="0975">CLL is a B-cell malignancy characterized by neoplastic cell proliferation and accumulation in bone morrow, blood, lymph nodes, and the spleen. The median age at time of diagnosis of CLL is about 65 years. Current treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, or bone marrow transplantation. Sometimes symptoms are treated surgically (e.g., splenectomy removal of enlarged spleen) or by radiation therapy (e.g., de-bulking swollen lymph nodes). Chemotherapeutic agents to treat CLL include, e.g., fludarabine, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine), chlorambucil, vincristine, pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), doxorubicin, and prednisone. Biological therapy for CLL includes antibodies, e.g., alemtuzumab, rituximab, and ofatumumab; as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. A number of criteria can be used to classify stage of CLL, e.g., the Rai or Binet system. The Rai system describes CLL has having five stages: stage 0 where only lymphocytosis is present; stage I where lymphadenopathy is present; stage II where splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or both are present; stage III where anemia, organomegaly, or both are present (progression is defined by weight loss, fatigue, fever, massive organomegaly, and a rapidly increasing lymphocyte count); and stage IV where anemia, thrombocytopenia, organomegaly, or a combination thereof are present. Under the Binet staging system, there are three categories: stage A where lymphocytosis is present and less than three lymph nodes are enlarged (this stage is inclusive of all Rai stage 0 patients, one-half of Rai stage I patients, and one-third of Rai stage II patients); stage B where three or more lymph nodes are involved; and stage C wherein anemia or thrombocytopenia, or both are present. These classification systems can be combined with measurements of mutation of the immunoglobulin genes to provide a more accurate characterization of the state of the disease. The presence of mutated immunoglobulin genes correlates to improved prognosis.</div>

In many cases of MCL, cyclin D1 (a regulator of CDK4/6) is expressed (e.g., due to chromosomal translocation involving immunoglobulin and Cyclin D1 genes) in MCL cells. Thus, without being bound by theory, it is thought that MCL cells are highly sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition with high specificity (i.e., minimal effect on normal immune cells). CDK4/6 inhibitors alone have had some efficacy in treating MCL, but have only achieved partial remission with a high relapse rate. An exemplary CDK4/6 inhibitor is LEE011 (also called ribociclib), the structure of which is shown below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1048" num="1075">In embodiments, the subject has CLL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). For example, the subject has a deletion in the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p), e.g., in a leukemic cell). In other examples, the subject does not have a del(17p). In embodiments, the subject has relapsed CLL or SLL, e.g., the subject has previously been administered a cancer therapy (e.g., previously been administered one, two, three, or four prior cancer therapies). In embodiments, the subject has refractory CLL or SLL. In other embodiments, the subject has follicular lymphoma, e.g., relapse or refractory follicular lymphoma. In one embodiment, the kinase inhibitor is a BTK inhibitor, e.g., ibrutinib (PCI-32765), and the ibrutinib is administered at a dose of about 250 mg, 300 mg, 350 mg, 400 mg, 420 mg, 440 mg, 460 mg, 480 mg, 500 mg, 520 mg, 540 mg, 560 mg, 580 mg, 600 mg (e.g., 250 mg, 420 mg or 560 mg) daily for a period of time, e.g., daily for 21 day cycle, or daily for 28 day cycle. In one embodiment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or more cycles of ibrutinib are administered. In some embodiments, ibrutinib is administered in combination with rituximab. See, e.g., Burger et al. (2013) Ibrutinib In Combination With Rituximab (iR) Is Well Tolerated and Induces a High Rate Of Durable Remissions In Patients With High-Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL): New, Updated Results Of a Phase II Trial In 40 Patients, Abstract 675 presented at 55<sup>th </sup>ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition, New Orleans, La. 7-10 December. Without being bound by theory, it is thought that the addition of ibrutinib enhances the T cell proliferative response and may shift T cells from a T-helper-2 (Th2) to T-helper-1 (Th1) phenotype. Th1 and Th2 are phenotypes of helper T cells, with Th1 versus Th2 directing different immune response pathways. A Th1 phenotype is associated with proinflammatory responses, e.g., for killing cells, such as intracellular pathogens/viruses or cancerous cells, or perpetuating autoimmune responses. A Th2 phenotype is associated with eosinophil accumulation and anti-inflammatory responses. In some embodiments of the methods, uses, and compositions herein, the BTK inhibitor is a BTK inhibitor described in International Application WO/2015/079417, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. For instance, in some embodiments, the BTK inhibitor is a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1065" num="1092">In embodiments, a CAR-expressing cell described herein is administered to a subject in combination with an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor. IDO is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of the amino acid, L-tryptophan, to kynurenine. Many cancers overexpress IDO, e.g., prostatic, colorectal, pancreatic, cervical, gastric, ovarian, head, and lung cancer. pDCs, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) can express IDO. Without being bound by theory, it is thought that a decrease in L-tryptophan (e.g., catalyzed by IDO) results in an immunosuppressive milieu by inducing T-cell anergy and apoptosis. Thus, without being bound by theory, it is thought that an IDO inhibitor can enhance the efficacy of a CAR-expressing cell described herein, e.g., by decreasing the suppression or death of a CAR-expressing immune cell. In embodiments, the subject has a solid tumor, e.g., a solid tumor described herein, e.g., prostatic, colorectal, pancreatic, cervical, gastric, ovarian, head, or lung cancer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1081" num="1108">In an embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a dsRNA molecule that inhibits expression of the molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function is operably linked to a promoter, e.g., a H1- or a U6-derived promoter such that the dsRNA molecule that inhibits expression of the molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function is expressed, e.g., is expressed within a CAR-expressing cell. See e.g., Tiscornia G., “Development of Lentiviral Vectors Expressing siRNA,” Chapter 3, in Gene Transfer: Delivery and Expression of DNA and RNA (eds. Friedmann and Rossi). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., USA, 2007; Brummelkamp T R, et al. (2002) Science 296: 550-553; Miyagishi M, et al. (2002) Nat. Biotechnol. 19: 497-500. In an embodiment the nucleic acid molecule that encodes a dsRNA molecule that inhibits expression of the molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function is present on the same vector, e.g., a lentiviral vector, that comprises a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a component, e.g., all of the components, of the CAR. In such an embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule that encodes a dsRNA molecule that inhibits expression of the molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function is located on the vector, e.g., the lentiviral vector, 5′- or 3′- to the nucleic acid that encodes a component, e.g., all of the components, of the CAR. The nucleic acid molecule that encodes a dsRNA molecule that inhibits expression of the molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function can be transcribed in the same or different direction as the nucleic acid that encodes a component, e.g., all of the components, of the CAR. In an embodiment the nucleic acid molecule that encodes a dsRNA molecule that inhibits expression of the molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function is present on a vector other than the vector that comprises a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a component, e.g., all of the components, of the CAR. In an embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule that encodes a dsRNA molecule that inhibits expression of the molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function it transiently expressed within a CAR-expressing cell. In an embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule that encodes a dsRNA molecule that inhibits expression of the molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function is stably integrated into the genome of a CAR-expressing cell. In an embodiment, the molecule that modulates or regulates, e.g., inhibits, T-cell function is PD-1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1082" num="1109">In one embodiment, the inhibitor of an inhibitory signal can be, e.g., an antibody or antibody fragment that binds to an inhibitory molecule. For example, the agent can be an antibody or antibody fragment that binds to PD1, PD-L1, PD-L2 or CTLA4 (e.g., ipilimumab (also referred to as MDX-010 and MDX-101, and marketed as Yervoy®; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Tremelimumab (IgG2 monoclonal antibody available from Pfizer, formerly known as ticilimumab, CP-675,206)). In an embodiment, the agent is an antibody or antibody fragment that binds to TIM3. In an embodiment, the agent is an antibody or antibody fragment that binds to LAG3. In an embodiment, the agent is an antibody or antibody fragment that binds to CEACAM (e.g., CEACAM-1, CEACAM-3 and/or CEACAM-5).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1083" num="1110">PD1 is an inhibitory member of the CD28 family of receptors that also includes CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, and BTLA. PD1 is expressed on activated B cells, T cells and myeloid cells (Agata et al. 1996 Int. Immunol 8:765-75). Two ligands for PD1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 have been shown to downregulate T cell activation upon binding to PD1 (Freeman et a. 2000 J Exp Med 192:1027-34; Latchman et al. 2001 Nat Immunol 2:261-8; Carter et al. 2002 Eur J Immunol 32:634-43). PD-L1 is abundant in human cancers (Dong et al. 2003 J Mol Med 81:281-7; Blank et al. 2005 Cancer Immunol. Immunother 54:307-314; Konishi et al. 2004 Clin Cancer Res 10:5094).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1098" num="1125">While not wishing to be bound by theory, in some embodiments, a tumor microenvironment is not conducive to CART cells attacking cancer cells, due to direct or indirect inhibitory effects exerted by the presence of PD-L1+ expressing cells or PD1+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment. More specifically, a tumor microenvironment can comprise tumor cells (which are generally CD19+), immune effector cells (which can be CD3+ T cells and can be PD1+ or PD1−, and which can be endogenous cells or CAR-expressing cells), and activated myeloid cells (which are generally PD-L1+). PD1+ T cells can create a “barrier” around the tumor microenvironment by preventing entry of CART cells the tumor. According to the non-limiting theory herein, pre-administration of a PD1 inhibitor and/or PD-L1 inhibitor makes the tumor microenvironment more favorable to entry of CAR-expressing cells into the tumor microenvironment and effectively clear the target positive cancer cells.

In one embodiment, the cytokine is administered after assessment of the subject's response to the CAR-expressing cells. For example, the subject is administered CAR-expressing cells according to the dosage and regimens described herein. The response of the subject to CART therapy is assessed at 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, or 1 year or more after administration of CAR-expressing cells, using any of the methods described herein, including inhibition of tumor growth, reduction of circulating tumor cells, or tumor regression. Subjects that do not exhibit a sufficient response to CART therapy can be administered a cytokine. Administration of the cytokine to the subject that has sub-optimal response to the CART therapy improves CART efficacy and/or anti-tumor activity. In an embodiment, the cytokine administered after administration of CAR-expressing cells is IL-7.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1208" num="1243">In some embodiments of the methods described herein, imaging with FDG-PET/CT (PET/CT) is performed on a subject who has been treated with a CAR therapy. This measurement can predict response to the therapy. For instance, in embodiments, metabolically active tumor volume (MTV) and/or [11F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake are measured. In embodiments, a decrease in MTV is indicative of response, e.g., CR (complete response) or PR (partial response), e.g., a post-treatment MTV value of about 0 is indicative of CR, while an increase in MTV is indicative of PD (progressive disease). In embodiments, a decrease in FDG uptake is indicative of response, e.g., CR or PR, while an increase in FDG uptake is indicative of PD. In embodiments, the imaging is performed after administration of the CAR therapy, e.g., about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, or 6 months after administration of the CAR therapy. In embodiments, the imaging is performed on a subject who does not have symptoms of CRS (cytokine release syndrome), e.g., a patient who suffered from CRS and whose symptoms resolved prior to imaging. In embodiments, the imaging is performed on a subject who has symptoms of CRS. In embodiments, imaging is performed prior to CAR therapy, and the pre-therapy image is compared to a post-therapy image. In embodiments, the subject has a cancer, e.g., lymphoma, e.g., diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL). In some embodiments, the CAR therapy comprises a CAR19-expressing cell, e.g., CTL019. In some embodiments, the CAR therapy comprises a CAR therapy described herein, e.g., a CAR20-expressing cell, a CAR22-expressing cell, or a CAR19-expressing cell, optionally in combination with a B-cell therapy.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1209" num="1244">CD19 Characteristics, e.g. Mutations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1210" num="1245">Without wishing to be bound by theory, some cancer patients show an initial response to a CD19 inhibitor such as a CD19 CAR-expressing cell, and then relapse. In some embodiments, the relapse is caused (at least in part) by a frameshift and/or premature stop codon in CD19 in the cancer cells, or other change in the expression (including expression levels) of CD19 which reduces the ability of a CD19 CAR-expressing cell to target the cancer cells. Such a mutation can reduce the effectiveness of the CD19 therapy and contribute to the patient's relapse. Accordingly, in some embodiments, it can be beneficial when a CD19 therapy is supplemented or replaced with a therapy directed to a second, different target, e.g., a target expressed in B-cells, e.g., one or more of CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, or ROR1. Various exemplary combination therapies of this type are disclosed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1211" num="1246">This application discloses, among other things, methods for treating a subject having cancer comprising one or more of: (1) determining if a subject has a difference, e.g., statistically significant difference, in a characteristic of CD19 relative to a reference characteristic, and (2) if there is a difference between the determined characteristic and reference characteristic, administering to the subject a therapeutically effective dose of a CAR therapy, e.g., CART, thereby treating the subject. The patient may be, e.g., a patient who has relapsed after treatment with a CD19 inhibitor, e.g., a CD19 CAR expressing cell. The patient may be a patient who has received or is receiving a CD19 CAR therapy and is at risk of relapse. The patient may be a non-responder to a CD19 CAR therapy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1212" num="1247">The characteristic can be, e.g., a CD19 sequence, e.g., protein or nucleic acid sequence. The sequence can be determined, e.g., as described in the Examples, by high throughput nucleic acid sequencing, or by mass spectrometry of proteins. As described in the Example herein, a patient may relapse after CD19 CART therapy because of mutations in CD19, e.g., in exon 2 of CD19, e.g., a mutation that causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon in CD19. In embodiments, the insertion or deletion does not cause one or both of a frameshift and a premature stop codon. The mutation may be, e.g., an insertion, a deletion, a substitution, a translocation, or a combination of any of the foregoing. The insertion, deletion, or substitution may involve, e.g., at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 20, or 50 nucleotides. The insertion, deletion, or substitution may involve, e.g., at most 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 20, 50, or 100 nucleotides. In some cases, a population of cells will comprise more than one mutation. In such cases, the mutations can be in overlapping or non-overlapping sub-populations of cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1213" num="1248">In some cases a patient is identified as having a CD19 characteristic that reduces CD19's ability to engage with a CD19 inhibitor such as a CD19 CAR expressing cell. Such a characteristic may be, e.g., a frameshift mutation, a premature stop codon, an alteration in nucleic acid sequence or an alteration in the structure of the primary mRNA transcript. The characteristic may be, e.g., a departure from normal production of CD19 that occurs earlier than splicing. The characteristic may be, e.g., a characteristic other than exon skipping. Such patients may be treated with an inhibitor of another target, e.g., a B-cell inhibitor, for example a CAR expressing cell directed against another epitope, e.g., an epitope within one or more of CD10, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD123, FLT-3, or ROR1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1214" num="1249">In some cases, a patient is identified as having a CD19 characteristic that reduces CD19's ability to engage with a CD19 inhibitor, such as a CD19 CAR expressing cell, but does not reduce or abrogate CD19's ability to engage with a second CD19 inhibitor, such as a CD19 inhibitor that binds to a different region on CD19. Such a characteristic may be, e.g., a mutation that does not cause one or both of a frameshift mutation or a premature stop codon. Such a characteristic may be, e.g., an alteration in nucleic acid sequence or an alteration in the structure of the primary mRNA transcript, a departure from normal production of CD19 that occurs earlier than splicing, or a characteristic other than exon skipping. Such patients may be treated with an inhibitor of CD19, e.g., a B-cell inhibitor directed against an intact region of CD19, e.g., a wild-type portion of CD19. For instance, if a mutation is present in exon 2, the second CD19 inhibitor may bind to an exon other than exon 2, or a part of exon 2 that lacks the mutation. The second CD19 inhibitor may be, e.g., a CD19 inhibitor described herein.</div>

In one embodiment, the CAR-expressing cells, e.g., CAR T cells are administered every other day for 3 administrations per week. In one embodiment, the CAR-expressing cells, e.g., CAR T cells of the invention are administered for at least two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or more weeks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1227" num="1262">In some embodiments, subjects may be adult subjects (i.e., 18 years of age and older). In certain embodiments, subjects may be between 1 and 30 years of age. In some embodiments, the subjects are 16 years of age or older. In certain embodiments, the subjects are between 16 and 30 years of age. In some embodiments, the subjects are child subjects (i.e., between 1 and 18 years of age).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1228" num="1263">In one aspect, CAR-expressing cells, e.g., CARTs are generated using lentiviral viral vectors, such as lentivirus. CAR-expressing cells, e.g., CARTs generated that way will have stable CAR expression.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1229" num="1264">In one aspect, CAR-expressing cells, e.g., CARTs, are generated using a viral vector such as a gammaretroviral vector, e.g., a gammaretroviral vector described herein. CARTs generated using these vectors can have stable CAR expression.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1230" num="1265">In one aspect, CAR-expressing cells, e.g., CARTs transiently express CAR vectors for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 days after transduction. Transient expression of CARs can be effected by RNA CAR vector delivery. In one aspect, the CAR RNA is transduced into the cell, e.g., NK cell or T cell, by electroporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1231" num="1266">A potential issue that can arise in patients being treated using transiently expressing CAR T cells (particularly with murine scFv bearing CARTs) is anaphylaxis after multiple treatments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1232" num="1267">Without being bound by this theory, it is believed that such an anaphylactic response might be caused by a patient developing humoral anti-CAR response, i.e., anti-CAR antibodies having an anti-IgE isotype. It is thought that a patient's antibody producing cells undergo a class switch from IgG isotype (that does not cause anaphylaxis) to IgE isotype when there is a ten to fourteen day break in exposure to antigen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1233" num="1268">If a patient is at high risk of generating an anti-CAR antibody response during the course of transient CAR therapy (such as those generated by RNA transductions), CART infusion breaks should not last more than ten to fourteen days.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0061" num="0000">Humanization of Murine Anti-CD19 Antibody</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1234" num="1269">Humanization of murine CD19 antibody is desired for the clinical setting, where the mouse-specific residues may induce a human-anti-mouse antigen (HAMA) response in patients who receive CART19 treatment, i.e., treatment with T cells transduced with the CAR19 construct. The production, characterization, and efficacy of humanized CD19 CAR sequences is described in International Application WO2014/153270 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, including Examples 1-5 (p. 115-159), for instance Tables 3, 4, and 5 (p. 125-147).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0062" num="0000">CAR Constructs, e.g., CD19 CAR Constructs</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1235" num="1270">Of the CD19 CAR constructs described in International Application WO2014/153270, certain sequences are reproduced herein. It is understood that the sequences in this section can also be used in the context of other CARs, e.g., CD10 CARs, CD20 CARs, CD22 CARs, CD34 CARs, CD123 CARs, FLT-3 CARs, ROR1 CARs, CD79b CARs, CD179b CARs, or CD79a CARs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1236" num="1271">The sequences of the humanized scFv fragments (SEQ ID NOS: 1-12) are provided below in Table 2. Full CAR constructs were generated using SEQ ID NOs: 1-12 with additional sequences, SEQ ID NOs: 13-17, shown below, to generate full CAR constructs with SEQ ID NOs: 31-42.</div>

Clones CD22-64 and CD22-65 were based on affinity maturation of clone CD22-12 above. In some embodiments, the affinity of an affinity-matured binding domain for CD22 is stronger than that of CD22-12 for CD22. In some embodiments, the on-rate of an affinity-matured binding domain for CD22 is faster than that of CD22-12 for CD22.</div>

In embodiments, the antigen binding domain further comprises a LC CDR1, a LC CDR2, and a LC CDR3. In embodiments, the antigen binding domain comprises a LC CDR1, a LC CDR2, and a LC CDR3 of any light chain binding domain amino acid sequences listed in Table 6A or 6B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1256" num="1291">In some embodiments, the antigen binding domain comprises one, two or all of LC CDR1, LC CDR2, and LC CDR3 of any light chain binding domain amino acid sequences listed in Table 6A or 6B, and one, two or all of HC CDR1, HC CDR2, and HC CDR3 of any heavy chain binding domain amino acid sequences listed in Table 6A or 6B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1257" num="1292">In some embodiments, the CDRs are defined according to the Kabat numbering scheme, the Chothia numbering scheme, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1258" num="1293">CD22-64 and CD22-65 were based on affinity maturation of clone CD22-12. All three constructs were tested and found to have activity (see Example 25 herein). Based on these observations, a structural genus was designed to encompass the working examples. Thus, in some embodiments, a CD22 binding domain described herein comprises a HCDR3 having a sequence: XRLQDGNSWSDAFDV (SEQ ID NO: 141). In some embodiments, X is any amino acid, any canonical amino acid, a nonpolar amino acid (e.g., G, A, V, L, I, P, M, F, or W), a nonpolar amino acid without an aromatic ring (e.g., G, A, V, L, I, P, or M), or an acidic amino acid (e.g., D or E).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1259" num="1294">Furthermore, CAR22-53 and CAR22-57 through CAR22-65 have structural similarities in their CDRs.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1276" num="1311">Anti-CD20 single chain variable fragments were isolated. See Table 11A and 11B. Anti-CD20 scFvs were cloned into lentiviral CAR expression vectors with the CD3zeta chain and the 4-1BB costimulatory molecule. CAR-containing plasmids were amplified by bacterial transformation in STBL3 cells, followed by Maxiprep using endotoxin-free Qiagen Plasmid Maki kit. Lentiviral supernatant was produced in 293T cells using standard techniques.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1294" num="1329">Anti-CD123 single chain variable fragments were isolated. Anti-CD123 scFvs were cloned into lentiviral CAR expression vectors with the CD3zeta chain and the 4-1BB costimulatory molecule. CAR-containing plasmids were amplified by bacterial transformation in STBL3 cells, followed by Maxiprep using endotoxin-free Qiagen Plasmid Maki kit. Lentiviral supernatant was produced in 293T cells using standard techniques.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1318" num="1353">Additional description of these CD123 CARs is provided, for instance, in PCT/CN2014/090508, which application incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1319" num="1354">Human anti-CD123 CAR constructs were evaluated for activity using a Jurkat cell line containing the luciferase reporter driven by the NFAT promoter (termed JNL cells). CD123 CAR activity was measured for four human CAR constructs described herein (CD123 CAR1-4) and murine CD123 CAR constructs 1172 and 1176. CAR activity was measured as activation of this NFAT-driven reporter. Lentiviral supernatants containing the CART constructs were added to JNL cells for transduction. 4-6 days after transduction, JNL cells were either evaluated for CAR expression by FACS as described below or mixed with target-positive (MOLM3, K562 cells engineered to express CD123 (CD123-K562)) or target-negative (K562) cell lines at an effector (JNL) to target cell line (E:T) ratio of 3:1 to trigger activation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>). After 20 hours of co-incubation, luciferase signal was measured using the Bright-Glo™ Luciferase Assay on the EnVision instrument as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A, 42B and 42C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1320" num="1355">Optimal anti-CD123 CAR constructs were selected based on the quantity and quality of the effector T cell responses of CD123 CAR transduced T cells (“CART-CD123” or “CART-CD123 T cells”) in response to CD123 expressing (“CD123+”) targets. Effector T cell responses include, but are not limited to, cellular expansion, proliferation, doubling, cytokine production and target cell killing or cytolytic activity (degranulation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0065" num="0000">Generation of CART-CD123</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1321" num="1356">The human scFv encoding lentiviral transfer vectors were used to produce the genomic material packaged into the VSVg pseudotyped lentiviral particles. Lentiviral transfer vector DNA was mixed with the three packaging components of VSVg, gag/pol and rev in combination with lipofectamine reagent to transfect them together in to Lenti-X 293T cells (Clontech).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1322" num="1357">After 30 hours, the media was collected, filtered and stored at −80 C. The therapeutic CART-CD123 were generated by starting with the blood from a normal apheresed donor whose naïve T cells were obtained by negative selection for T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. These cells were activated by CD3×28 beads (Dynabeads® Human T-Expander CD3/CD28, Invitrogen) at a ratio of 1:3 in RPMI 1640, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1× Penicillin/Streptomycin, 100 μM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM NaPyruvate, 10 mM Hepes, and 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol at 37° C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. T cells were cultured at 1×10<sup>6 </sup>T cells in 0.5 mL medium per well of a 24-well plate. After 24 hours, the T cells was blasting and 0.5 mL of viral supernatant was added. The T cells then began to divide in a logarithmic growth pattern, which was monitored by measuring the cell counts per mL, and T cells were diluted in fresh medium every two days. As the T cells began to rest down after approximately 10 days, the logarithmic growth waned. The combination of slowing growth rate and T cell size approaching ˜300 fl determined the state for T cells to be cryopreserved for later analysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1323" num="1358">Before cryopreserving, percentage of cells transduced (expressing the anti-CD123 CAR on the cell surface) and their relative fluorescence intensity of expression were determined by flow cytometric analysis on a BD LSRFortessa or BD-FACSCanto using Protein L as a detection reagent. Gating histogram plots of relative fluorescent intensity from that FACS for signal above unstained cells demonstrated the percentage of transduced T cells. Transduction resulted in a range of CART positive cells from 12-42% as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A, 42B and 42C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0066" num="0000">Evaluating Cytolytic Activity of CART-CD123 Redirected T Cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1324" num="1359">To evaluate the functional abilities of CART-CD123 T cells to kill target expressing cells, the cells were thawed and allowed to recover overnight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1325" num="1360">T cell killing was directed towards CD123-expressing MOLM13 acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines stably expressing luciferase. Untransduced T cells were used to determine non-specific background killing levels. The cytolytic activities of CART-CD123 were measured as a titration of effector:target cell ratios of 4:1 and 2-fold downward dilutions of T cells where effectors were defined as T cells expressing the anti-CD123 chimeric receptor. Assays were initiated by mixing an appropriate number of T cells with a constant number of targets cells. After 20 hours luciferase signal was measured using the Bright-Glo™ Luciferase Assay on the EnVision instrument. As the proportion of CD123-CART-expressing cells to untransduced T cells was increased, killing of CD123 cells was similarly increased. The data presented herein suggest that those cells expressing CD123 are destroyed only by CD123-CART-expressing cells and not by untransduced T cells. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</figref>.</div>

These clones were all cross-reactive against cynomolgus CD123. Their activity was compared against mouse clones 1172 and 1176, comprising the VH and VL domains in a light-to-heavy orientation with a CD8 hinge domain, CD8 transmembrane domain, and 41BB-costimulatory domain. 1176 is also cross-reactive against cynomolgus CD123. 1172 is not.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1327" num="1362">Plasmids were transformed into competent cells, grown in 500 cc broth, isolated by maxiprep, and transduced using standard methods into 293T cells.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1328" num="1363">The lentivirus was titered on SupT1 cells and the appropriate amount of virus was determined for a transduction of primary T cells at a MOI of 3. Primary normal donor CD4+CD8 cells were stimulated using anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Dynal, Invitrogen) and interleukin-2 100 U/ml for 6 days, followed by debeading and were and frozen once. The T cell cellular volume decreased to &lt;300 fL (after approximately 10-12 days).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1329" num="1364">T cell transduction efficiency was virtually 100% for all clones (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44A and 44B</figref>).

Cells were then harvested, stained with anti-CD3 APC and acquired using BD LSR Fortessa (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A, 46B and 46C</figref>).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1332" num="1367">To assess cytotoxicity, CART cells (NVS 2-4, 1172 and 1176 clones) were thawed and rested overnight at 2e<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml in T cell media. Cells were counted and resuspended at 1e<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml the following day. Tumor target cells (MOLM14) were resuspended at 1e<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml. Cells were plated in a black, flat-bottom 96 well plate at decreasing E:T ratios as indicated (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>), in duplicate. After 20 hours of incubation, luciferin was added and the plate was imaged to determine photon flux as a measure of residual live cells. Killing of MOLM14 cells was equivalent between all clones at most effector:target ratios at 20 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0070" num="0000">In Vivo Mouse Model</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1333" num="1368">NSG mice were injected iv with 1e<sup>6 </sup>luciferase expressing MOLM14 cells on D0. On D6 mice were imaged (IVIS Spectrum) for tumor burden and randomized into treatment groups. Mice with the lowest tumor burden were assigned to the control group (untransduced T cells, UTD). CART cells (NVS 2-4, 1172 and 1176 clones) or control T cells (1e6) were injected i.v. on D7. Data from imaging on performed D13 is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1344" num="1379">This section describes the production and function of bispecific CAR19/CAR22 constructs. Two bispecific scFv tandem fusions were designed: antiCD22 (HL)4G4S-antiCD19 (LH) and antiCD19-4G4S-antiCD22. The designation (HL) indicates that the heavy chain variable region is upstream of the light chain region within the indicated scFv, and the designation (LH) indicates that the light chain variable region is upstream of the heavy chain region within the indicated scFv. The anti-CD22 base molecule is hCD22-2, and uses the HL orientation. The anti-CD19 base molecule is a humanized anti-CD19 sequence, provided herein as construct ID 104876 of Table 2, which uses the LH orientation. The constructs are illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1345" num="1380">The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of both bispecific constructs, as well as the scFv portions thereof, are given below in Table 28.</div>

The following working examples specifically point out various aspects of the present invention, and are not to be construed as limiting in any way the remainder of the disclosure.</div>
<heading id="h-0073">Example 1: CD19 CAR T Cells for Use in Treating Multiple Myeloma</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1353" num="1388">Even with current regimens of chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and autologous stem cell transplant, myeloma is considered an incurable disease. The present example describes treating multiple myeloma (MM) with autologous T cells directed to CD19 with a chimeric antigen receptor (lentivirus/CD19:4-1BB:CD3zeta; also known as “CART19” or CTL019). This example demonstrates that CD19-directed CAR therapies have the potential to establish deep, long-term durable remissions based on targeting the myeloma stem cell and/or tumor cells that express very low (undetectable by most methods) levels of CD19.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1354" num="1389">In treating a patient with an aggressive secondary plasma cell leukemia, we found that CART19 administered two days after a salvage autologous stem cell transplant resulted in rapid clearance of plasma cell leukemia and a very good partial response in a patient who had progressed through multiple lines of chemotherapy. This patient was transfusion-dependent for months prior to the treatment; at two months after the treatment, she has recovered her blood counts (with normal-range platelet counts and white blood cell counts) and has not required transfusions since she was discharged from the hospital from her treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1355" num="1390">Because myeloma cells do not naturally express CD19, the finding that CART19 treatment induced a rapid and significant tumor response in this tumor was surprising. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it was reasoned that CART19 could be used to treat myeloma because: (1) while myeloma cells are traditionally thought to be negative for CD19 expression by flow cytometry, there are data indicating that myeloma cells may express very low levels of CD19, such that expression is detectable by RNA but not by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry; and (2) the concept of targeting the clonotypic B cell, which is thought to be the cancerous stem cell that gives rise to multiple myeloma, and is particularly resistant to chemotherapy. There is a clonal relationship between B cells and myeloma tumor cells, but traditional myeloma therapy is aimed at the malignant plasma cells rather than B cells. CART19 for treating myeloma therefore targets a different cell population than most myeloma therapies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1356" num="1391">In our single patient experience, the patient had circulating plasma cells, and we were able to test her tumor cells for the expression of CD19. Approximately 1-2% of her tumor cells expressed the CD19 antigen. Thus, it was reasoned that CART19 may have a direct effect on a very small population of her tumor cells; a very good partial response, though would not have been predicted based on targeting only the very small population of CD19+ tumor cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1357" num="1392">In this case, CART19 was administered following autologous stem cell transplant rescue after high-dose melphalan. Although this is a standard therapy in myeloma, it is not curative. Furthermore, this patient had previously undergone tandem autologous stem cell transplants and relapsed early (&lt;6 months) after transplant. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, use of CART19 cells as described in the present example may have a non-overlapping mechanism in the treatment of myeloma when combined with a salvage autologous stem cell transplant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1358" num="1393">Ten additional multiple myeloma patients will be treated with CART19 in a Phase I trial, and at least three patients have been treated to date.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0074" num="0000">Dose Rationale and Risks/Benefits</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1359" num="1394">We have chosen to use flat dosing via the intravenous route of administration for this protocol. The primary objective of this protocol was to test the safety and feasibility of administering CART-19 cells to patients with multiple myeloma. The primary toxicities that were anticipated are (I) cytokine release when the CARs encounter their surrogate CD19 antigen on malignant or normal B cells; (2) depletion of normal B cells, similar to rituximab therapy; (3) steroid-responsive skin and gastrointestinal syndromes resembling graft-versus-host disease as has been seen previously when expanded/costimulated autologous T-cells have been coupled with ASCT for MM. A theoretical concern was whether transformation or uncontrolled proliferation of the CART-19 T cells might occur in response to high levels of CD19. This was less a concern in this application compared to another study of CLL patients, as the burden of clonotypic B-cells in MM is expected to be far lower than the burden of malignant B-cells in the refractory CLL patients treated on that study.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0075" num="0000">Dose Rationale</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1360" num="1395">With the first 3 patients, we have observed clinical activity at doses ranging from 1.4×10<sup>7 </sup>to 1.1×10<sup>9 </sup>CART-19 cells. This observation demonstrates, at least in the first 3 patients treated, that there is not an obvious dose response relationship. A complete response was observed in patients administered with two log fold difference in dose. Thus, unlike standard drugs that are metabolized, CAR T cells can have a wide dose response range. This is most likely because the CAR T cells are able to proliferate extensively in the patients. We therefore set a dose range of 1-5×10<sup>8 </sup>CART-19 cells for infusion. In this single-patient study offered on a compassionate use basis, the patient was offered up to 5×10<sup>8 </sup>CART19 cells, with no lower dose limit. For the ten patient trial, patients will be offered 1-5×10<sup>7 </sup>CART-19 cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0076" num="0000">General Design</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1361" num="1396">This was single patient-study offered on a compassionate use basis; it was modeled after a Phase I study to determine if the infusion of autologous T cells transduced to express CART-19 is safe. The primary goals of the study were to determine the safety, tolerability and engraftment potential of CART-19 T cells in patients undergoing salvage ASCT after early relapse following first ASCT. The protocol consists of an open label pilot study.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1362" num="1397">At entry subjects will undergo a bone marrow biopsy and routine laboratory and imaging assessment of their MM. Eligible subjects will undergo steady-state apheresis to obtain large numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CART-19 manufacturing. The T cells will be purified from the PBMC, transduced with TCζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector, expanded in vitro and then frozen for future administration. The number of patients who have inadequate T cell collections, expansion or manufacturing compared to the number of patients who have T cells successfully manufactured will be recorded; feasibility of product manufacturing is not expected to be problematic in this patient population.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1363" num="1398">Subjects will generally have had adequate peripheral blood stem cells remaining stored from the mobilization/collection performed in preparation for their first ASCT to conduct two additional ASCT. Those who do not will undergo a second mobilization/collection procedure either before or after their steady-state apheresis with a regimen according to the treating physician's preference. Approximately two weeks after the initial leukapheresis, subjects will be admitted to the hospital and receive high-dose melphalan (day −2) followed by infusion of autologous stem cells two days later (day 0), and all subjects will receive infusion of CART-19 cells twelve to fourteen days later (day +12-14). Up to 10 patients will be enrolled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1364" num="1399">All subjects will have blood tests to assess safety, and engraftment and persistence of the CART-19 cells at regular intervals through week 4 of the study. At day +42 and day +100, subjects will undergo bone marrow aspirates/biopsies to assess the bone marrow plasma cell burden and trafficking of CART-19 cells to the bone marrow. A formal response assessment will be made at day 100 according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria136, and TTP will be monitored according to routine clinical practice for patients with multiple myeloma. The main efficacy outcome measured in this study will be a comparison of TTP after a patient's initial ASCT to TTP after the ASCT on this study.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1365" num="1400">As the primary endpoint of this study is safety and feasibility of infusion of CART-19 cells with ASCT, the study will employ an early stopping rule. Briefly, if less than 2 severe, unexpected adverse events occur among the first five subjects treated, the study will then accrue an additional five subjects towards a target enrollment of 10. We will observe treated subjects for 40 days after CART-19 infusion (i.e., through the first official response assessment at day 42) before enrolling a subsequent subject until five subjects have been enrolled and so observed. For treatment of the second group of five patients, no waiting period will be required between subjects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1366" num="1401">Following the 6 months of intensive follow-up, subjects will be evaluated at least quarterly for two years with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests. Following this evaluation, subjects will enter a roll-over study for annual follow-up by phone and questionnaire for up to additional thirteen years to assess for the diagnosis of long-term health problems, such as development of new malignancy.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1367" num="1402">This pilot trial is designed to test the safety and feasibility of the autologous T cells transduced with the CD19 TCζ/4-1BB in patients undergoing salvage ASCT for MM following early relapse after first ASCT.</div>

Maintenance therapy will continue until disease progression or intolerance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1391" num="1426">Preparation and Administration of Study Drug</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1392" num="1427">The CART-19 T cells are prepared in the CVPF and are not released from the CVPF until FDA approved release criteria for the infused cells (e.g., cell dose, cell purity, sterility, average copy number of vectors/cell, etc.) are met. Upon release, the cells are taken to the bedside for administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1393" num="1428">Cell thawing. The frozen cells will be transported in dry ice to the subject's bedside. The cells will be thawed at the bedside using a water bath maintained at 36° C. to 38° C. The bag will be gently massaged until the cells have just thawed. There should be no frozen clumps left in the container. If the CART-19 cell product appears to have a damaged or the bag to be leaking, or otherwise appears to be compromised, it should not be infused and should be returned to the CVPF as specified below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1394" num="1429">Premedication. Side effects following T cell infusions include transient fever, chills, and/or nausea; see Cruz et al. for review (Cytotherapy 2010; 12(6):743-749). It is recommended that the subject be pre-medicated with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine hydrochloride prior to the infusion of CART-19 cells. These medications may be repeated every six hours as needed. A course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed if the patient continues to have fever not relieved by acetaminophen. It is recommended that patients not receive systemic corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, methylprednisolone or dexamethasone at any time, except in the case of a life-threatening emergency, since this may have an adverse effect on T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1395" num="1430">Febrile reaction. In the unlikely event that the subject develops sepsis or systemic bacteremia following CAR T cell infusion, appropriate cultures and medical management should be initiated. If a contaminated CART-19 T cell product is suspected, the product can be retested for sterility using archived samples that are stored in the CVPF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1396" num="1431">Administration. The infusion will take place in an isolated room in Rhoads, using precautions for immunosuppressed patients. The transduced T cells will be administered by rapid intravenous infusion at a flow rate of approximately 10 mL to 20 ml per minute through an 18-gauge latex free Y-type blood set with a 3-way stopcock. The duration of the infusion will be based on the total volume to be infused and the recommended infusion rate. Each infusion bag will have affixed to it a label containing the following: “FOR AUTOLOGOUS USE ONLY.” In addition the label will have at least two unique identifiers such as the subject's initials, birth date, and study number. Prior to the infusion, two individuals will independently verify all this information in the presence of the subject and so confirm that the information is correctly matched to the participant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1397" num="1432">Emergency medical equipment (i.e., emergency trolley) will be available during the infusion in case the subject has an allergic response, or severe hypotensive crisis, or any other reaction to the infusion. Vital signs (temperature, respiration rate, pulse, and blood pressure) will be taken before and after infusion, then every 15 minutes for at least one hour and until these signs are satisfactory and stable. The subject will be asked not to leave until the physician considers it is safe for him or her to do so.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0089" num="0000">Packaging</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1398" num="1433">Infusion will be comprised of a single dose of 1-5×10<sup>7 </sup>CART19-transduced cells, with a minimal acceptable dose of 1×10<sup>7 </sup>CART-19 cells for infusion. Each bag will contain an aliquot (volume dependent upon dose) of cryomedia containing the following infusible grade reagents (% v/v): 31.25% plasmalyte-A, 31.25% dextrose (5%), 0.45% NaCl, up to 7.5% DMSO, 1% dextran 40, 5% human serum albumin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0090" num="0000">Apheresis</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1399" num="1434">A large volume (12-15 liters or 4-6 blood volumes) apheresis procedure is carried out at the apheresis center. PBMC are obtained for CART-19 during this procedure. From a single leukapheresis, the intention is to harvest at least 5×10<sup>9 </sup>white blood cells to manufacture CART-19 T cells. Baseline blood leukocytes for FDA look-back requirements and for research are also obtained and cryopreserved. The cell product is expected to be ready for release approximately 2-4 weeks later. Flow cytometry lymphocyte subset quantitation, including CD19 and CD20 B cell determination. Baseline assessment is made for human anti-VSV-G and anti-murine antibody (HAMA). If a subject has previously had an adequate apheresis collection banked according to current Good Manufacturing Practices at the Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility these cells may be used as the source of cells for CART-19 manufacturing. Using a banked apheresis product would avert the expense, time, and risk to the subject of undergoing an additional apheresis collection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0091" num="0000">Cytoreductive Chemotherapy</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1400" num="1435">The lymphodepleting chemotherapy will be high-dose melphalan as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0092" num="0000">CART-19 Infusion</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1401" num="1436">Infusion will begin on day +12-14 after stem-cell reinfusion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1402" num="1437">On day +12-14 prior to the first infusion, patients will have a CBC with differential, and assessment of CD3, CD4 and CD8 counts since chemotherapy is given in part to induce lymphopenia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1403" num="1438">The first dose will be administered using a single dose. The cells are thawed at the patient's bedside. The thawed cells will be given at as rapid an infusion rate as tolerated such that the duration of the infusion will be approximately 10-15 minutes. In order to facilitate mixing, the cells will be administered simultaneously using a Y-adapter. Subjects will be infused and premedicated as described herein. Subjects' vital signs will be assessed and pulse oxymetry done prior to dosing, at the end of the infusion, and every 15 minutes thereafter for 1 hour and until these are stable and satisfactory. A blood sample for determination of a baseline CART-19 level is obtained any time prior to the first infusion and 20 minutes to 4 hours after each infusion (and sent to TCSL).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1404" num="1439">Patients experiencing toxicities related to high-dose melphalan will have their infusion schedule delayed until these toxicities have resolved. The specific toxicities warranting delay of T cell infusions include: 1) Pulmonary: Requirement for supplemental oxygen to keep saturation greater than 95% or presence of radiographic abnormalities on chest x-ray that are progressive; 2) Cardiac: New cardiac arrhythmia not controlled with medical management 3) Hypotension requiring vasopressor support. 4) Active Infection: Positive blood cultures for bacteria, fungus, or virus within 48-hours of T cell infusion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0093" num="0000">Management of Toxicity</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1405" num="1440">Uncontrolled T cell proliferation. Toxicity associated with allogeneic or autologous T cell infusions has been managed with a course of pharmacologic immunosuppression. T body associated toxicity has been reported to respond to systemic corticosteroids. If uncontrolled T cell proliferation occurs (grade 3 or 4 toxicity related to CART-19 cells), subjects may be treated with corticosteroids. Subjects will be treated with pulse methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg i.v. divided q8 hr×2 days), followed by a rapid taper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1406" num="1441">In addition, based on the observations of subjects treated on another protocol, there is some concern for macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), though the CD19+ tumor burden is expected to be much lower in patients with myeloma than in patients with CLL. Treatment and timing of treatment of this toxicity will be at the discretion of the patient's physician and the study investigator. Suggested management might include: if the subject has a fever greater than 101° F. that lasts more than 2 consecutive days and there is no evidence of infection (negative blood cultures, CXR or other source), tocilizumab 4 mg/kg can be considered. The addition of corticosteroids and anti-TNF therapy can be considered at the physician's discretion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1407" num="1442">B cell depletion. It is possible that B cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia will occur. This is common with anti-CD20 directed therapies. In the event of clinically significant hypogammaglobulinemia (i.e. systemic infections), subjects will be given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) by established clinical dosing guidelines to restore normal levels of serum immunoglobulin levels, as has been done with Rituximab.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1408" num="1443">Primary graft failure. Primary graft failure (i.e., non-engraftment) may be more common after second ASCT compared to first ASCT. Eligibility criteria stipulate that sufficient stem cells must be available for rescue reinfusion at the discretion of the treating physician in the event of primary graft failure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0094" num="0000">Results</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1409" num="1444">Three treatment-refractory, advanced multiple myeloma patients have now been treated with CTL019 in this ongoing trial. Results for two of these patients show that both have had substantial anti-tumor effects from the CTL019 therapy based on the primary efficacy assessment at the three-month time-point. The third patient has not yet reached the three-month time point. The results for the two patients are described in more detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1410" num="1445">The first myeloma patient has completed her +100 day response assessment and she had a very good response to the CART19 therapy. The following tests were performed with the following results:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0012-0001" num="1446">SPEP/immunofixation: negative</li> <li id="ul0012-0002" num="1447">urine immunofixation: faint unmeasurable kappa light chain band on her immunofixation (also present at day 38, so not new)</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1411" num="1448">Otherwise, the patient meets the criteria for stringent complete remission including:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0014-0001" num="1449">serum free light chain ratio: normal</li> <li id="ul0014-0002" num="1450">bone marrow biopsy: negative</li> <li id="ul0014-0003" num="1451">IgA immunophenotyping: IgA is below the limit of detection</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1412" num="1452">Other than the faint unmeasurable kappa light chain result from urine immunofixation, the patient met all criteria for “stringent complete remission”. The summary of the plasma cell immunophenotyping at 3 time points (day −2, day +38, day +103) is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and demonstrates that the patient's IgA is below the limit of detection. The summary shows heavy myeloma burden at day −2 and none detectable at day +38 and +103, which classifies the patient as “MRD negative” by flow analysis. At day +103, the summary shows recovery of normal, polyclonal, CD19+ plasma cells and B cells. The patient had no symptoms of disease or therapy and is functioning like a normal person.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1413" num="1453">The second patient treated has not yet reached the +100 day time point. However, at this time point, she is doing well but it is too early to determine the effect of the CTL019 infusion.</div>
<heading id="h-0095">Example 2: CAR19 T Cell Therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1414" num="1454">CAR19 T cell therapy can also be used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by the presence of malignant Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells that are derived from clonal germinal center B cells. There are several factors that indicate the therapeutic efficacy of CAR19 T cell therapy for HL. CD19 staining of HL tumors shows CD19-expressing (CD19<sup>+</sup>) cells within the tumor and tumor microenvironment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). A study has shown that a clonal B cell population (CD20<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> ALDH<sup>+</sup>) that expresses CD19 is responsible for the generation and maintenance of Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines, and also circulates in the blood of most HL patients (Jones et al., Blood, 2009, 113(23):5920-5926). This clonal B cell population has also been suggested to give rise to or contribute to the generation of the malignant HRS cells. Thus, CART19 therapy would deplete this B cell population that contributes to tumorigenesis or maintenance of tumor cells. Another study showed that B cell depletion retards solid tumor growth in multiple murine models (Kim et al., J Immunotherapy, 2008, 31(5):446-57). In support of the idea that depletion of B cells in the HL tumor microenvironment results in some anti-tumor effect, current therapies, such as rituxan, are being clinically tested for targeting and depletion of tumoral B cells in HL (Younes et al., Blood, 2012, 119(18):4123-8). De novo carcinogenesis related to chronic inflammation has also been shown to be B-cell dependent (de Visser, et al., Cancer Cell, 2005, 7(5):411-23). The results from these studies indicate that targeting of the B cell population, particularly in the HL tumor microenvironment, would be useful for treating HL, by reducing or inhibiting disease progression or tumor growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1415" num="1455">In addition, normal CD19-expressing B cells also infiltrate the tumor microenvironment in HL. Previous studies with CART19 therapy in CLL and ALL (e.g., described in Examples 4 and 5) show that CART19 exposure to CD19+ targets leads to cytokine production and macrophage production. Thus, modulation of the HL tumor microenvironment from a pro-tumor microenvironment to an anti-tumor microenvironment can be achieved by infusing CART19 to interact with normal CD19+ B cells present in the HL. For example, CART19 exposure to CD19-expressing targets causes cytokine production, e.g., inflammatory cytokines, that promote anti-tumor activity through the expansion of cytotoxic T cells, activation of macrophages, and recruitment of other immune effector cells with various functions that inhibit tumor growth, such as leukocytes, macrophages, and antigen-presenting cells. Because the target CD19+ B cells may not be malignant (e.g., normally circulating B cells), a transient rather than protracted CART19 effect may be preferred for modulation of the tumor microenvironment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1416" num="1456">A study to examine the therapeutic efficacy of CART19 therapy in HL patients can be performed as described below (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of CART19 in HL subjects, and determine the effect of CART19 cells on the HL tumor microenvironment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1417" num="1457">8 patients with classical HL are treated in this study. Patients are of all ages, though separate protocols for drug delivery can be established for pediatric and adult patients. Patients in this study have no available potentially curative treatment options (such as autologous (ASCT) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation), or are not suitable for such curative treatment options. For example, patients can be any of the following: PET+ after salvage chemotherapy, PET+ after treatment with brentuximab, or PET+ after ASCT with or without prior brentuximab exposure. The patients will have a limited prognosis (several months to less than or equal to 2 year expected survival) with currently available therapies. And finally, the patients will not have received anti-CD20 antibody therapy. Patients are excluded due to lack of feasibility, e.g., if the patient has insufficient numbers of T cells for 6 infusions of CART19.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1418" num="1458">An mRNA CAR19 is produced by in vitro transcription. The CAR19 mRNA is electroporated into donor T cells, and the resulting cells are expanded and stimulated by incubation with CD3/CD28 beads. Dosages containing 1×10<sup>8</sup>-5×10<sup>8 </sup>RNA-electroporated CAR19 T cells are delivered to the patient three times a week for two weeks (e.g., at day 0, 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11). The overall response rate will be assessed by clinical, CT, and PET scanning at 1 month after treatment. Response and survival will be monitored monthly for the first 6 months, then every 3 months until 2 years after the first CART19 infusion (day 0). Monitoring techniques include biopsy of the tumor or lymph node (e.g., for immunohistochemical analysis and/or RNA for gene expression profiling) and PET scanning before and after CART19 treatment. For example, the effect of the CART19 cells on the HL tumor microenvironment are analyzed by comparing the results of gene expression profiling performed on accessible lymph node biopsies from selected patients before treatment and approximately one week after treatment (or the appropriate time after treatment to allow for alteration of cellular phenotype). To assess the safety and tolerability of CART19 treatment, the frequency and severity of adverse events are reported, including the frequency of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1419" num="1459">Chemotherapy may be administered concurrently with CART19 treatment. The first dose of CART19 can be preceded by lymphodepleting chemotherapy, e.g., cytoxan.</div>
<heading id="h-0096">Example 3: Non-Responder Subset of CLL Patients Exhibit Increased Expression of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Molecules</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1420" num="1460">In this study, CART19 cells from clinical manufacture from 34 CLL patients were assessed for expression of immune checkpoint inhibitor molecules, such as PD-1, LAGS, and TIM3. The response of this cohort to CART19 was known and hence a correlation between response and biomarker expression patterns could be assessed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1421" num="1461">Manufactured CART19 cells from CLL patients with different responses to CART therapy were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the expression of CAR and the immune checkpoint inhibitor molecules PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3. The CART19 cells were from: healthy donors (HD) (n=2); CLL patients that responded to CART therapy (CR) (n=5); CLL patients that partially responded to CART therapy (PR) (n=8); CLL patients that did not respond to CART therapy (NR) (n=21). Cells were stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies that specifically recognize CD3, CD4, CD8, CD27, CD45RO, the CAR19 molecule, and immune checkpoint molecules PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3, according to standard methods for flow cytometry analysis known in the art. Expression of each marker, e.g., CD4+, CD8+, etc., was determined by flow cytometry analysis software, and subpopulations (e.g., CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, or CAR19-expressing T cells) were further analyzed for the expression of immune checkpoint molecules PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1422" num="1462">An example of the flow cytometry profiles analysis used to determine surface marker expression is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. T cells expressing CD4 were determined using flow cytometry, and were further analyzed for CAR19 and PD-1 expression, such that the x-axis of the profiles indicate CAR19 expression (the top left (Q5) and bottom left (Q8) quadrants show the CAR19-negative CD4+ cells, while the top right (Q6) and bottom right (Q7) quadrants show the CAR19-expressing CD4+ cells) and the y-axis shows PD-1 expression (the bottom left (Q8) and right (Q7) quadrants show the PD-1 negative CD4+ cells and the top left (Q5) and right (Q6) quadrants show the PD-1-expressing CD4+ cells). In the CD4+ population from a CART responder, 44.7% of the CD4+ cells overall expressed PD-1, and about 22.3% of the CAR19-expressing cells were PD-1 positive, while 27.2% of CAR19-expressing cells were PD-1 negative (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). In contrast, in the CD4+ population from a non-responder, there was a significant decrease in CAR19-expressing cells overall (about 15.3% compared to the 49.5% in CR), with 14.7% of the CAR19-expressing cells being PD-1 positive while only 0.64% were PD-1 negative (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Comparison between the profiles in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows that a much higher percentage of the CD4+ cells from a non-responder express PD-1 (about 92.9%) compared to the CART responder (about 44.7%).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1423" num="1463">Using the methods and analysis described above, the percentage of PD-1 expressing (PD-1+) cells of the CD4+ population and the CD8+ population was determined for each patient in each response group. Non-responders were shown to have a greater percentage of PD-1+ cells in both the CD4+ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>) and CD8+ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>) populations compared to those that responded to CAR therapy (CR); the increase of average PD-1 percentage was statistically significant for both CD4+ and CD8+ populations. Partial responders (PR) exhibited higher percentages of PD-1+ cells than responders (CR) in both CD4+ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>) and CD8+ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>) populations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1424" num="1464">Next, the percentage of PD-1 expressing (PD-1+) cells of the CAR19-expressing CD4+ population and the CAR19-expressing CD8+ population was determined for each patient in each response group. Similar analysis was performed as above, with the additional step of analyzing the CD4+ and CD8+ cells for CAR19-expression, and after identification of the CAR19-expressing cells, determining the percentage of cells with PD-1 expression from the populations of CAR19-expressing cells. A similar trend as that observed in the CD4+ and CD8+ overall populations was observed for the CAR19 expressing CD4+ and CD8+ populations: non-responders were shown to have a greater percentage of PD-1+ cells in both the CD4+ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) and CD8+ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) populations compared to those that responded to CAR therapy (CR); the increase of average PD-1 percentage was statistically significant for both CD4+ and CD8+ populations. Partial responders (PR) exhibited higher percentages of PD-1+ cells than responders (CR) in both CD4+ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) and CD8+ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) populations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1425" num="1465">Further analysis was performed to determine the distribution of cells expressing PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3 from patients with different responses to CAR therapy. Representative cell profile analysis for PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3 expression in the CD4+ population is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The cell populations were first analyzed for CD4+ and CD8+ expression. The CD4+ population (or CD8+ population, not shown) was then analyzed for PD-1 and CAR19 expression (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, left profiles). As described previously, non-responders (NR) had a significantly increased percentage of cells that were PD-1+ overall compared to CART responders (CR) (about 92.9% PD-1 positive for NR compared to 44.7% PD-1 positive for CR). Moreover, in non-responders, CAR19-expressing cells were mostly PD-1 positive (14.7% PD-1 positive and CAR+ compared to 0.64% PD-1 negative and CAR+). Then the populations were analyzed for PD-1 and LAG3 co-expression (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, middle profiles). Cells that expressed both PD-1 and LAG3 are shown in the top right quadrant (Q2). Non-responders had a significantly increased percentage of cells that expressed both immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-1 and LAG3, compared to CART responders (67.3% compared to 7.31%). PD-1 expression was also analyzed with TIM3 expression. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, right profiles, the box indicates the cells that express both PD-1 and TIM3. Similar to the results obtained with PD-1 and LAG3, the non-responders had a significantly higher percentage of cells that expressed both immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-1 and TIM3, compared to CART responders (83.3% compared to 28.5%). The percentage of PD-1 expressing cells (PD1+), PD-1 and LAG3-expressing cells (PD1+LAG3+), and PD-1 and TIM3-expressing cells (PD1+ TIM3+) was determined for each patient in each response group using the flow cytometry analysis as described above. Non-responders were shown to have an increased percentage of PD1+ LAG3+ cells (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) and PD1+ TIM3+ cells (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>) compared to CART responders that was statistically significant for both cell populations. Partial responders also showed an increased percentage of both cell populations compared to CART responders, with the averages being decreased compared to the non-responders.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1426" num="1466">These results indicate that patients that do not respond to CAR therapy exhibit increased expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3) compared to patients that respond or partially respond to CAR therapy. Thus, these results show that agents that inhibit or decrease expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors, e.g., PD-1, LAG3, or TIM3, may be useful for administration to patients receiving CAR therapy to prevent immune suppression through immune checkpoint pathways (e.g., mediated by PD-1, LAG3, or TIM3), thereby increasing the efficacy of the CAR-expressing cells.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1431" num="1471">After adoptive transfer of CAR T cells, some patients experience limited persistence of the CAR T cells, which can result in suboptimal levels of anti-tumor activity. In this example, the effects of administration of exogenous human IL-7 is assessed in mouse xenograft models where an initial suboptimal response to CAR T cells has been observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1432" num="1472">Expression of the IL-7 receptor CD127 was first assessed in different cancer cell lines and in CAR-expressing cells. Two mantle cell lymphoma cell lines (RL and Jeko-1) and one B-ALL cell line (Nalm-6) were analyzed by flow cytometry for CD127 expression. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, out of the three cancer cell lines tested, RL was shown to have the highest expression of CD127, followed by Jeko-1 and Nalm-6. CART19 cells were infused into NSG mice and CD127 expression was assessed on the circulating CART19 cells by flow cytometry. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, CD127 is uniformly expressed on all circulating CART19 cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1433" num="1473">Next, the effect of exogenous IL-7 treatment on anti-tumor activity of CART19 cells was assessed in a lymphoma animal model. NSG mice were engrafted with a luciferase-expressing mantle cell line (RL luc) on Day 0 (D0), followed by treatment of CART19 cells on Day 6. The NSG mice were divided into groups, where one group received no CART19 cells, a second group received 0.5×10<sup>6 </sup>CART19 cells, a third group received 1×10<sup>6 </sup>CART19 cells, and a fourth group received 2×10<sup>6 </sup>CART19 cells. Tumor size was monitored by measuring the mean bioluminescence of the engrafted tumors over more than 80 days. Only mice receiving 2×10<sup>6 </sup>CART19 cells demonstrated rejection of the tumor and inhibition of tumor growth (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>). Mice from the two groups receiving 0.5×10<sup>6 </sup>CART19 cells or 1×10<sup>6 </sup>CART19 cells were shown to s a suboptimal anti-tumor response. Mice from these two groups were then randomized, where three mice (mouse #3827 and #3829 which received 0.5×10<sup>6 </sup>CART19 cells, and mouse #3815 which received 1×10<sup>6 </sup>CART19 cells) received exogenous recombinant human IL-7 at a dosage of 200 ng/mouse by intraperitoneal injection three times weekly starting at Day 85, and two mice did not. The tumor burden of mice receiving exogenous IL-7 from Day 85-125, as detected by mean bioluminescence, is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. All mice receiving IL-7 showed a dramatic response of 1-3 log reduction in tumor burden. Mice that originally received a higher dose of CART19 cells (mouse #3815 which received 1×10<sup>6 </sup>CART19 cells) showed a more profound response. When comparing the tumor burden of mice that received IL-7 treatment to control, before and after IL-7 treatment, tumor reduction in tumor burden was only seen in the mice that had received IL-7 treatment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1434" num="1474">T cell dynamics following IL-7 treatment in the lymphoma animal model was also examined. Human CART19 cells were not detectable in the blood prior to IL-7 treatment. Upon treatment of IL-7, there was rapid, but variable increase in the numbers of T cells in the treated mice (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>). The extent of T cell expansion observed in mice receiving the IL-7 also correlated with tumor response. The mouse with the highest number of T cells detected in the blood at peak expansion during IL-7 treatment (mouse #3815) had the most robust reduction in tumor burden (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>). Moreover, the time of peak expansion correlated with the T cell dose injected as baseline. The number/level CD3-expressing cells in the blood were also measured before and after IL-7 treatment. In control mice, very few CD3-expressing cells were detected, while IL-7-treated mice showed a significant increase in CD3+ cells after IL-7 treatment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1435" num="1475">Together, the results in this example demonstrate that exogenous IL-7 treatment increases T cell proliferation and anti-tumor activity in vivo, indicating that use of IL-7 in patients with suboptimal results after CAR therapy can improve anti-tumor response in these patients.</div>

The next day, luciferin substrate was added to each well of the 96 well plate and relative luminescence of the luciferase reporter was determined. In this assay, CD22 CAR constructs were compared to a CD19 CAR construct and a CD22 (m971-derived) CAR construct (m971-HL) that served as positive controls. A m971-LH CAR construct, which contains the VH and VL chains of m971-HL but in reverse orientation (L-H instead of H-L), contained a CAR but was unable to bind target due to lack of specificity and served as a negative control. Untransduced T-cells containing no CAR (Neg cnt) also served as a negative control. Luciferase activity from Jurkat T-cell activation was graphed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1441" num="1481">Primary T-cells activated and transduced as described above were mixed with target cell lines stably expressing luciferase at the ratios indicated (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A-20F</figref>). Target cell lines Raji, SEM, K562-hCD22, Daudi, and Nalm6 all expressed CD22 target, whereas the K562 cell line did not express CD22 and served as a negative control (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A-20F</figref>). The results presented herein demonstrate that several CD22 CAR clones (e.g., CD22 CAR clones 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 30, and 31) and positive control CD22 m971-HL CAR exhibited dose-dependent target cell killing, with extent of killing varying depending on target cell type.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1443" num="1483">The ability of CD22-expressing cell lines to induce release of proinflammatory cytokines from CD22-expressing CART cells was investigated. Proinflammatory cytokine concentration was determined using a cytokine bead array kit on samples taken from the primary T-cell killing assay. Interferon-g (IFN-g), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), and interleukin 2 (IL-2) were all measured on samples from 2.5:1 E:T and 10:1 E:T ratios. The results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A-21F</figref>. The results presented herein demonstrate that multiple CD22 CAR clones induced significantly more IFN-g, TNFa and IL-2 than the m971-LH CAR (negative control) or untransduced T-cells (UTD), with cytokine induction levels varying by target cell type.</div>
<heading id="h-0103">Example 10: Dose Escalation Study of CD22 CART Treatment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1444" num="1484">A phase 1 clinical trial is performed to determine the optimal dose of CD22 CART with or without CD19 CART in ALL subjects who have and have not previously received CART therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of producing anti-CD22 CAR engineered T cells meeting the established release criteria and to assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous anti-CD22 CAR engineered T cells in children and young adults with B cell malignancies following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion regimen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1445" num="1485">Subjects are between 1 and 30 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg with CD22+ ALL. Disease activity is measurable by bone marrow analysis or FDG-PET. Subjects with minimal residual disease activity are allowed. Subjects with a central nervous system (CNS) status of 1 or 2 are allowed. Subjects must have adequate organ function and adequate CD3 count.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1446" num="1486">A phase 1 dose escalation study with an expansion cohort is performed. Subjects are stratified according to whether they have or have not previously received CART therapy. Subjects are given one of four dose levels of four doses of autologous anti-CD22 CAR engineered T cells: 3×10<sup>5 </sup>cells/kg body weight, 1×10<sup>6 </sup>cells/kg body weight, 3×10<sup>6 </sup>cells/kg body weight and 1×10<sup>7 </sup>cells/kg body weight. A subset of the subjects receiving the 3×10<sup>6 </sup>cells/kg body weight dose are also given anti-CD19 CAR engineered T cells. The first 2 patients at each dose level are 16 years of age or older.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1447" num="1487">After eligibility is determined, apheresis is performed to isolate T cells. Subjects then undergo preparative chemotherapy. Subjects are treated with 25 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>fludarabine daily for three days and given a single dose of 900 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of cyclophosphamide. Anti-CD22 CAR engineered T cells are then administered and 28 days later response and toxicity are evaluated.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1448" num="1488">A Jurkat-NFAT-Luciferase (JNL) cell assay was performed to determine reactivity of specific CD20 CART clones. Jurkat cells stably expressing luciferase from an NFAT promoter (JNL cells) were lentivirally transduced with CAR constructs shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A-15C</figref>. CAR-expressing JNL cells (3e4) were mixed with CD20 expressing target cell lines Daudi (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>) and Raji (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>), and a non CD20 expressing negative control K562 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>) at effector cell:target cell (E:T) ratios of 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. Lentivirally transduced JNL cells were plated in a 96 well plate with CD20-expressing target cell lines (Daudi, Raji) and a non-CD20 expressing cell line (K562) as a negative control. The next day, luciferin substrate was added to each well of the 96 well plate, and relative luminescence of the luciferase reporter (from Jurkat T-cell activation) was determined. In this assay, CD20 CAR constructs were compared to a CD19 CAR construct and a CD22 (m971-derived) CAR construct described in Haso et al., Blood, 14 Feb. 2013, Vol. 121, No. 7 that served as positive controls. Isotype CAR, which contained a CAR but was unable to bind target due to lack of specificity, and untransduced T-cells containing no CAR (Neg cnt) served as negative controls. The results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A-15C</figref>. Several of the CD20 transduced JNL clones showed specific reactivity towards the CD20-expressing cell lines that increased in a dose-dependent manner.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1449" num="1489">The present Example describes, among other things, the identification of novel transcriptional gene signatures that predict patient relapse to CD19CART therapy (e.g., CTL019 therapy) in B cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-ALL), for use in accordance with the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1450" num="1490">Among other things, the present Example describes novel gene signatures based on mRNA expression levels of selected genes in the patient prior to CD19CART treatment (e.g., CTL019) (apheresis or bone marrow) or in manufactured CD19CART product samples (e.g., CTL019) prior to re-infusion. In an embodiment, the present example describes novel gene signatures that discriminate relapsers to CTL019 therapy in B-ALL from non-relapsers to CTL019 therapy in B-ALL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1451" num="1491">The present Example describes methods of unbiased feature selection to discover novel gene signatures that predict subject relapse to CD19CART therapy (e.g., CTL019) in B-ALL, for use in accordance with the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1452" num="1492">The present Example also describes methods of Gene Set Analysis to discover novel gene signatures, for use in accordance with the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1453" num="1493">Novel gene signatures based on mRNA expression levels in manufactured CD19CART product samples prior to re-infusion were identified that predict subject relapse to CD19CART therapy in B cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-ALL). The identified signatures were discovered in a whole genome RNAseq study of manufactured product samples which included 7 B-ALL subject samples. B-ALL subject samples (7 total) were stratified as follows: biological samples were taken from 4 subjects who did not relapse (“non-relapsers”) following CTL019 therapy, and 3 subjects who did relapse (“relapsers”) following CTL019 therapy. Several gene signatures discriminating responders from non-responders, and relapsers from non-relapsers, in manufactured product samples were discovered and are described further in detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1454" num="1494">Novel gene signatures were then discovered using various data analytical approaches: 1) unbiased feature selection; 2) gene set analysis; and 3) differential expression analysis of selected genes of interest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1455" num="1495">Novel gene signatures derived from unbiased feature selection were discovered by determining which genes were differentially expressed between the 2-group comparison of relapsers and non-relapsers which compared the 3 relapsers to the 4 non-relapsers. Genes were defined as differentially expressed if their differential expression was statistically significant in the 2-group comparison with a FDR p-value cutoff of 0.25. The gene list for the relapser versus non-relapser comparison (N=17) is tabulated in Table 29. 2-group statistical models were applied to determine whether the meta-gene was statistically different between the groups and an exemplary schematic illustrating the approach is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref> depict an exemplary heat map of genes upregulated in activated T<sub>EFF </sub>versus resting T<sub>EFF </sub>cells for complete responders (CR), partial responders (PR), and non-responders (NR) with CLL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1456" num="1496">Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, these data indicate that the differentiation state of T cells in CD19CART product (e.g., CTL019) correlate with subject response (i.e., CR, PR, or NR) and predict subject relapse to CD19CART therapy (e.g., CTL019 therapy) in B-ALL. Complete responders gene signatures are more like resting T<sub>REG </sub>and T<sub>EFF </sub>cells. Among other things, gene signatures for relapsers (e.g., a complete responder that relapses to CTL019 therapy) contain genes upregulated in T<sub>REG </sub>versus T<sub>EFF </sub>cells at resting. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, these data indicate that relapsers to CART therapy (e.g., CTL019) in B-ALL have higher levels of T<sub>REG </sub>compared to non-relapsers to CART therapy (e.g., CTL019). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> depicts exemplary results illustrating that T<sub>REG </sub>are differentially enriched in relapsers (R) versus non-relapsers, e.g., relapsers express high levels of T<sub>REG </sub>genes compared to complete responders (CR) (e.g., non-relapsers).</div>

For example, the meta-gene score for the gene set comprised of genes upregulated in T<sub>REG </sub>in comparison to T<sub>EFF </sub>cells is found to be correlated with patient relapse in product samples (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> depicts exemplary results (p=0.000215) illustrating that T<sub>REG </sub>genes have high expression levels in relapsers (R) compared to non-relapser, complete responders (CR). The x-axis is samples by response group where CR=complete responder and R=relapser. The y-axis is normalized meta-gene expression scores.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1464" num="1504">Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, these data indicate that decreasing the T<sub>REG </sub>signature in the patient prior to apheresis or during manufacturing of the CART product significantly reduces the risk of patient relapse.</div>
<heading id="h-0106">Example 13: Insertion Mutations are a Mechanism of Resistance to CTL019 Therapy in B Cell Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (B-ALL)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1465" num="1505">Several resistance mechanisms have been discovered by comparing the mRNA sequencing data from B-ALL patient samples taken at baseline and after relapse. Certain resistance mechanisms are referred to as “CD19− relapse”, i.e. the patient's tumor cells are characterized as CD19− since they do not bind to the FMC63 epitope used in CTL019 as measured by flow cytometry. Several resistance mechanisms have been discovered and are described in detail in this Example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1466" num="1506">mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed to compare the transcriptional profiles of B-ALL patients before CTL019 treatment and after relapse. Three patients were considered: one patient (Patient #29), who was CD19− at the time of relapse, and two patients (Patients #104 and #105), who were CD19+ at relapse. See Table 30 below for a list of patients, their classification, and percentage of leukemia at both time points.</div>

For cell number quantitation, Countbright (Invitrogen) beads were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. In all analyses, the population of interest was gated based on forward vs. side scatter characteristics followed by singlet gating, and live cells were gated using Live Dead Aqua (Invitrogen). Time gating was included for quality control. For animal studies the murine anti-CD45 antibody (Biolegend) was added to gate out murine leukocytes. Surface expression of CD22 was detected by staining with anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody from clone HIB22 (Biolegend). Surface expression of CD123 was detected by staining with anti-CD123 monoclonal antibody from clone 6H6 (ebioscience). Surface expression of FLT3 was detected by staining with anti-FLT3 monoclonal antibody from clone IM2234U (Beckman Coulter). Surface expression of ROR1 was detected by staining with anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody from clone 2H6 (Abcam).

<heading id="h-0124">Example 17: Combination of Anti-CD123 and Anti-CD19 CAR T Cells for the Treatment and Prevention of Antigen-Loss Relapse</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1513" num="1553">Chemo-refractory or relapsing (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is associated with a poor prognosis but, as demonstrated recently, remains exquisitely sensitive to the immune system. In particular, anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART19, CTL019) and bi-specific anti-CD19/CD3 antibodies (blinatumomab) generate unprecedented complete response rates of 45-90% in this patient population. Both approaches re-direct autologous T cells to recognize CD19-expressing cells. Blinatumomab uses a continuous long-term infusion of a bispecific construct that combines an anti-CD19 single chain variable fragment (scFv) with an anti-CD3 scFv; in the case of CART19 T cells are genetically modified to express an anti-CD19 scFv fused to the T cell receptor signaling with built-in co-stimulatory domains. A recent study showed that 90% of patients with r/r B-ALL treated with CTL019 reach complete remission (CR) with an overall survival (OS) of 78% at 6 months. Encouraging results with CART19 were also obtained in patients with other B-cell neoplasms, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1514" num="1554">However, a subset of patients treated with CART19 or blinatumomab develops relapse and a significant portion of these relapses are characterized by the loss of CD19. In B-ALL, CD19-negative relapses have been reported in 10-20% of patients following CART19 or blinatumomab therapies and it has not been described in the setting of other treatments; overall about 30% of relapses after blinatumomab and up to 50% after CART19 are CD19-negative. CD19 is a prototypic B-cell marker that is expressed from the very earliest stages of B cell development to the mature B-cell. CD19 plays an important role in B cell biology as CD19-deficient B cells exhibit selective growth disadvantage. Thus the absence of CD19 is a very unusual finding in B-ALL and it is has been reported in only rare patients prior to the era of potent CD19-directed immunotherapies. The possible mechanism of antigen loss is currently under investigation and is most likely caused by selective pressure on leukemia sub-clones by these powerful anti-CD19 agents. Because of the recent approval by the FDA of blinatumomab and the breakthrough status accorded to CTL019, it is likely that increasing numbers of patients with r/r B-ALL will be treated with these agents. Hence, novel effective strategies are needed in order to be able to treat those patients that will relapse with CD19-negative blasts after CART19 or blinatumomab. Ideally a new approach would not only treat patients with active antigen-loss relapse but if employed upfront could potentially prevent their occurrence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1515" num="1555">The interleukin-3 receptor alpha (or CD123) is involved in hematopoiesis and has been shown to be expressed in several hematologic neoplasms, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, hairy cell leukemia, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Unlike lineage-associated surface antigens such as CD33 (myeloid) or CD19 (B-lymphoid), CD123 is hierarchically expressed on hematopoietic progenitor cells and in AML CD123 is expressed on leukemic stem cells that are involved in resistance to chemotherapy and relapse after initial treatment. Due to these characteristics, CD123 has generated great interest for targeted therapy, and multiple agents are being developed such as the IL3-diphtheria toxin fusion protein (SL-401, DT3881L3), naked anti-CD123 monoclonal antibodies (CSL-360, CSL-362), antibody-drug conjugates, bi-specific antibodies or CD3Fv-IL3 fusion constructs, and more recently, anti-CD123 chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Some of these approaches are currently being validated in clinical trials and many more will be tested in the clinic in the next few years. Targeting CD123 with chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART123) can lead to deep and long-term responses in human primary AML xenografts and can establish an anti-leukemia T cell memory. Here, CD123 is expressed in CD19-negative B-ALL relapses occurring after CD19-directed therapies and that CAR-123 T cells combined with CART19 (CTL019) is an effective therapy for the treatment and for the prevention of antigen-loss relapses in B-ALL xenografts.</div>

All cell lines were tested for the presence of <i>mycoplasma </i>contamination (MycoAlert™ <i>Mycoplasma </i>Detection Kit, LT07-318, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). For some experiments, cell lines were transduced with firefly luciferase/eGFP and then sorted to obtain a &gt;99% positive population. The luciferase positive K-562 cell line was also transduced with truncated CD19 or truncated CD123 to obtain cell lines expressing neither of them, only CD19 or only CD123. MOLM-14 and K562 were used as controls as indicated in the relevant figures. The cell lines were maintained in culture with RPMI media 1640 (Gibco, 11875-085, LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gemini, 100-106, West Sacramento, Calif.), and 50 UI/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, LifeTechnologies, 15070-063). De-identified primary human ALL bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) specimens were obtained from the clinical practices of University of Pennsylvania/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia under an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-protocol, purchased from the Stem Cells and Xenograft Core of the University of Pennsylvania or from research samples of the current CTL019 clinical trials (Translation and Correlative Study Laboratory, at the University of Pennsylvania).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0127" num="0000">CD123 is Expressed in B-ALL, in the Leukemia Stem Cells and in CD19-Negative Relapses</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1542" num="1582">In order to evaluate the expression of CD123 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 42 samples from adult and pediatric ALL patients were analyzed, including 14 subjects enrolled in our current CTL019 clinical trials. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49A, 49B and 49A</figref>, CD123 is highly and homogeneously expressed on the surface of most ALL blasts, representing an ideal candidate for targeted therapy. Moreover, CD123 is also found to be expressed in the putative leukemia stem cells (LSC), identified as CD34+CD38− (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49C</figref>). Small subsets of CD19-negative blasts can be identified in some B-ALL patients and these cells could contribute to antigen-loss relapses, if they contained cells with a malignant phenotype. In order to evaluate the presence of disease in CD19-negative subsets, CD19− CD123+ cells from a Philadelphia chromosome positive B-ALL bulk population were sorted (CD45dim, gating strategy shown <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56B</figref>). It was found that these cells were clonal for the BCR-ABL translocation, albeit at a lower frequency than the CD19+ blasts (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49D</figref>). This finding indicates that targeting CD19 alone could, in some cases, lead to a subclonal relapse derived from CD19−CD123+ cells. Furthermore, this finding suggests that targeting CD123 could lead to deeper responses through the elimination of the LSC and possibly CD19-neg leukemia clones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1543" num="1583">Finally the expression of CD123 was also evaluated in the samples of B-ALL patients relapsing after CTL019 with loss of CD19. Importantly, in contrast to the complete loss of CD19, the majority of patients maintained CD123 expression at relapse (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49E, 49F and 56C</figref>). These findings indicate that CD123 represents an ideal marker to target CD19-neg ALL blasts occurring after CART19 or blinatumomab.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1544" num="1584">Anti-CD123 chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART123) were generated that were lentivirally transduced and expanded with anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic beads. The in vitro and in vivo activity of CART123 against B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia were evaluated as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1545" num="1585">The B-ALL cell line NALM-6 that is CD19++ and CD123+ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50A and 57A</figref>) and primary B-ALL samples were used. A head-to-head in vitro comparison between CART123 and CART19 revealed similar rates of CD107a degranulation when T cells were co-cultured with NALM-6 or primary ALL (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50B</figref>). CART123 were also able to kill NALM-6 cells with similar efficacy as CART19 in a dose-dependent manner (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50C</figref>). At more long-term experiments, CART123 proliferated (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50D and 50E</figref>) and produced multiple cytokines (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50F</figref>) when co-cultured with NALM-6 or primary ALL for 3-5 days. These results indicate that CART123 exhibit equivalent potency to CART-19 against multiple B-ALL targets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1546" num="1586">In order to confirm these data in an in vivo model, a primary ALL model was utilized. In this model, primary blasts obtained from B-ALL patients were passaged in NOD-SCID-γ chain knock-out (NSG) mice and transduced with a reporter construct containing eGFP and click beetle luciferase (GFP/Luc). NSG mice were injected with GFP/Luc+ primary ALL blasts i.v. (JH331, CD19+, CD123+, add phenotype) and after engraftment, mice were randomized to receive CART19, CART123 or control untransduced T cells (UTD). Mice treated with control T cells succumbed quickly to disease, while mice treated with either CART19 or CART123 showed tumor eradication and long term survival (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51A and 51B</figref>). CAR123 T cells significantly expanded in the peripheral blood (PB) of the mice compared to control T cells and expressed high levels of CAR123 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51C</figref>). The anti-leukemia activity of CART123 was specific and based on the recognition of CD123 in the surface of the blasts as when we engrafted mice with a CD123− CD19+ leukemia (AV576), only CART19 show anti-leukemia activity, while CART123 had no effect as compared to controls UTD (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57B and 57C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1547" num="1587">In order to detect a possible correlation of CART123 dose and anti-tumor activity, an in vivo model of high leukemia burden bearing mice (using the NALM-6 cell line) was developed. In this model standard doses of CART123 (2 million CAR+ cells) are not able to clear the tumor. These mice were injected with different doses of CART123 (1.25, 2 and 5 million CAR+ cells) and observed a dose-related anti-leukemia activity (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57D</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0129" num="0000">CART123 but not CART19 are Highly Active in a Novel Preclinical Model of Antigen-Loss Relapse</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1548" num="1588">In order to test new strategies to target CD19-negative relapses a novel in vivo model of antigen-loss relapse was developed. B cell blasts obtained from a patient (CHP101) enrolled in one of our CTL019 clinical trials were collected at baseline (before CTL019 therapy), when the disease was CD19++ and CD123+, and at relapse after CTL019 when the patient developed a CD19-negative disease (CD123 still expressed, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58A</figref>). Blasts were then expanded in NSG mice and transduced with click-beetle green luciferase (CBG) for baseline disease (CD19+) or click-beetle red luciferase (CBR) for relapse (CD19−) (see Methods section). Importantly, during in vivo expansion, the blasts retained markers of B cell identity other than CD19 (data not shown). In a first experiment NSG mice were engrafted with either the baseline disease CD19+ (CBG, green) or the CD19-neg (CBR, red) leukemia. Both groups were randomized to receive CART19 or control T cells (UTD) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52A</figref>). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52B</figref>, in both groups mice treated with UTD showed rapid progression of both the baseline and relapse disease, independently by the expression of CD19. Conversely, in the group of mice treated with CART19, only mice engrafted with the baseline disease (CD19-positive) responded to CART19 treatment while mice engrafted with the relapsed disease (CD19-negative) showed refractoriness as expected. This was also reproduced in vitro in a CD107a degranulation assay (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58B</figref>). In order to simulate in vivo the presence of different clones expressing CD19 or lacking it, NSG mice were engrafted with a 1:1 mixture of baseline and relapse disease; at day 8 mice were randomized to receive CART19 or control T cells. Tumor burden was monitored with bioluminescence imaging that could discriminate between CD19+ (CBG, green)/CD19− (CBR, red) leukemia relative growth in vivo. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52C</figref>, in mice receiving UTD both CD19+ (green) and CD19− (red) leukemia present at day 6 was similarly increased at day 11, while in mice treated with CART19 the baseline disease (green) was completely cleared while the relapsed disease (red) showed progression.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1549" num="1589">This unique xenograft model of primary CD19-negative B-ALL and CART19 failure was used to evaluate the role of CART123 in the treatment of antigen-loss relapses. Primary CD19-negative blasts (CBR positive) were injected into NSG mice (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52D</figref>) and mice were randomized to receive CART19, CART123 or control T cells. CART19 and control T cells showed complete lack of anti-tumor activity, while CART123 lead to complete eradication of the disease and long term survival in these mice (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52E and 52F</figref>). Indeed in a pre-clinical model of primary B-ALL refractory to CART19, the novel CART123 are able to eradicate the disease and confer long-term survival.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1550" num="1590">In order to understand the differential behavior of CART19 and CART123 in this in vivo model at a single cell level, a series of experiments was performed by injecting a mixture of differentially labelled CART19 (CellTrace Violet, blue) and CART123 (CellTracker Orange or TRITC, red) to mice bearing CD19-positive primary blasts (GFP) or CD19-negative relapsed blasts (GFP) and tracked their behavior using intravital 2-photon microscopy of calvarial marrow approximately 24 hours after injection (experiment schema, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref>). These studies showed that CART19 and CART123 trafficked to marrow spaces containing leukemia and that CART cell recognition of cognate antigen correlate with motility arrest. Specifically, in mice engrafted with the baseline CD19+CD123+ leukemia, 62.9%+/−3.8 of CART19 and 81.1%+/−1.2 of CART123 were found to be stalled with a rounded morphology adjacent to blasts, whereas in mice engrafted with the relapsed CD19-CD123+ leukemia, only CART123 cells arrested next to tumor cells (CART123 80.9%+/−5.1 vs CART19 12.4%+/−2.2) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53B and 53C</figref>). These findings indicate that in CD19-negative relapsed ALL only CART123 were able to establish productive synapses with the leukemia cells (GFP) and thus reduced their motility, whereas CART19 cells continued sampling and moving in the environment without recognizing the leukemia blasts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0130" num="0000">The Combination of CART123 and CART19 is Able to Prevent CD19-Negative Relapses</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1551" num="1591">CART123 proved to be effective in the treatment of CD19-negative relapses occurring after CD19-directed therapies in a preclinical model of CART19 resistance. However, a combinatorial approach could treat active CD19-positive disease while simultaneously preventing antigen-loss relapses. In order to test this hypothesis the emerging clinical problem of B-ALL with a potential for CD19-negative escape was modeled by injecting primary CD19− and CD19+ disease together into NSG mice. Mice were then randomized to receive control T cells (UTD), CART19 or the combination of CART19 and CART123, with the same total dose of T cells (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54A</figref>). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54B</figref>, mice treated with control T cells had progression of both leukemia clones and CART19 showed rapid progression mostly of the CD19-neg disease (red). On the contrary mice treated with the combination of CART123 and CART19 showed clearance of the disease and improved overall survival, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54C</figref>. Analysis of mice sacrificed at the end of the experiment showed no evidence of residual leukemia in the pooled CAR T cell group. In contrast, mice with progressive disease after CART19 monotherapy retained the expected CD19 negative phenotype (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54D</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1552" num="1592">Lastly, T cells were transduced with 2 lentiviruses, one carrying CAR19 and the other CAR123 in order to develop a CART able to be activated by both CD19 and/or CD123. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55A</figref>, four differently transduced T cell subsets were detected: CAR19 and CAR123 double negative, CAR19 single positive, CAR123 single positive and double positive CAR19/CAR123 T cells. These four subsets were sorted and their functionality and specificity was tested against K562-WT, K562 CD19+ or K562 CD123+. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55B</figref> shows the results of a CD107a degranulation assay where the single positive subsets respond to their specific target while only the double positive population is able to degranulate in the presence of both CD19 and CD123 expressing K562. In addition, dually-stimulated CART cells exhibited more potent cytotoxicity against a double-positive target in comparison with an equivalent number of single-stimulated CART cells, suggesting a potential increment in efficacy by using a CAR that is triggered by two different antigens (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0131" num="0000">Discussion</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1553" num="1593">CD19 directed immunotherapies are changing the paradigm of treatment of relapsing and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients with a previously dismal outcome now have a realistic potential to achieve a complete response and long-term disease remission. However, as shown under some circumstances for leukemia treated with other forms of potent targeted therapy, leukemia cells are able to develop antigen-loss mutations that lead to resistance and relapse. In the case of CART19, two main patterns of relapses have been observed. Patients with early loss of CART19 through failure of persistence are at risk for relapse of the original clone; indeed, minimal residual disease analyses indicate that between 1-6 months of sustained CART activity may be required to completely eradicate malignancy. In contrast, around 50% of relapses occur despite CART19 persistence and are characterized by the occurrence of aCD19-negative leukemia. The latter observation implicates potent selective pressure by CART19. Notably, CD19-negative relapses have also occurred after blinatumomab therapy although these represent the minority of relapse occurrences after this arguably less potent therapy. There are multiple potential mechanisms for the development of CD19-negative disease. One of these is the selection and relative survival advantage of CD19-negative clones that were present at baseline in very low frequency, and this was initially considered the most likely factor leading to CD19-negative relapses. More recently other mechanisms, such the dysregulation of the splicing of CD19 have also been considered important. Here it is shown for the first time that rare CD19-ve blasts in B-ALL can contain the hallmark cytogenetic abnormalities found in the more common CD19-positive leukemia blasts, confirming this as a potential mechanism of CD19-negative relapse. We confirmed these findings by demonstrating that CD123+CD19-ve blasts can engraft in immunodeficient mice, indicating that CD123 may be a marker of leukemic stem cells in B-ALL as it is in AML.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1554" num="1594">The goal of this study was to define novel strategies to treat patients relapsing with antigen loss after CD19-directed therapies. CD123 was highly expressed in the majority of B-ALL, and in particular CD123 remains expressed in those relapsing with CD19-negative disease. It was demonstrated the presence of clonal leukemic cells in the CD19− CD123+ population indicating that targeting CD123 in combination with CART19 can increase the likelihood of eradicating sub-clones that could proliferate due to a selective advantage upon CART19 pressure. CD123 has previously been validated as a marker of the leukemic stem cell in AML. Here it was shown that CD123 to be expressed in the immunophenotypically-defined leukemic stem cell (LSC) in ALL, raising the possibility that targeting CD123 on LSC could promote ALL eradication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1555" num="1595">To study the role of CART123 in antigen-loss relapses a novel xenograft model of CD19-negative relapses was developed from primary blasts derived from a B-ALL patient (CHP101) enrolled in one of the CTL019 trials of the University of Pennsylvania/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. This patient, at baseline had a classic CD19+CD123+ phenotype but then relapsed after CART19 treatment with CD19-CD123+ disease. Using this model, it was demonstrated CART123 could eradicate the relapsed disease, and in combination with CART19 could prevent antigen-loss relapse. This is the first demonstration of a dual CART combination in a clinically relevant, patient-derived model. In addition, through use of intravital imaging, it was shown that CART cells enter the marrow in less than 24 hours after intravenous injection, search for their targets, and slowdown in order to interact with cognate antigen-bearing cells. Furthermore, it was shown that a dual signaling CART123/19 was more effective than either CART alone or a pool of both CAR, consistent with previously published results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1556" num="1596">Previously, it was shown the pre-clinical efficacy of anti-CD123 chimeric antigen receptor for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. CART123 causes hematopoietic toxicity due to recognition of CD123 on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, a potentially major challenge to clinical translation as profound stem cell toxicity could lead to permanent myeloablation. It was hypothesized that to minimize hematopoietic toxicity, a novel construct that activated T cells only upon co-engagement of CD19 and CD123 simultaneously could obviate this hematopoietic toxicity. Here it was found that CART cells receiving an activating signal from CD19 recognition and a stimulatory signal from CD123 recognition could kill B-ALL cells as well as avoid the profound hematopoietic toxicity that we have previously described. Although this concept was previously published using an artificial system of CD19/PSMA recognition, this clinically relevant construct represents a major advance in the field with a relatively clear path to clinical translation. Notably, although such a dual CAR design will likely be associated with reduced toxicity, it may leave unaddressed the issue of antigen loss relapse by making CAR recognition more, rather than less restrictive. However, if targeting of CD123 successfully eradicates ALL stem cells, this approach could be both safe and efficacious.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1557" num="1597">In summary, demonstrated here is a novel and effective strategy to the treatment of B-ALL by targeting CD123. This approach is particularly attractive since CD123 is expressed in rare CD19-negative malignant cells in some patients with B-ALL and is retained in antigen-loss relapses occurring after CD19-directed immunotherapies. Moreover, the combination of CART19 with CART123 can prevent the occurrence of CD19-negative relapses.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1573" num="1613">CAR T cell dosing: Mice were administered 5×10<sup>6 </sup>CAR T cells 7 days after tumor implantation. Cells were partially thawed in a 37 degree Celsius water bath and then completely thawed by the addition of 1 ml of cold sterile PBS to the tube containing the cells. The thawed cells were transferred to a 15 ml falcon tube and adjusted to a final volume of 10 mls with PBS. The cells were washed twice at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes each time and then counted on a hemocytometer. T cells were then resuspended at a concentration of 50×10<sup>6 </sup>CAR T cells per ml of cold PBS and kept on ice until the mice were dosed. The mice were injected intravenously via the tail vein with 100 μl of the CAR T cells for a dose of 5×10<sup>6 </sup>CAR T cells per mouse. Eight mice per group were treated either with 100 μl of PBS alone (PBS), or humanized CD19 CAR T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1574" num="1614">RAD001 dosing: A concentrated micro-emulsion of 50 mg equal to 1 mg RAD001 was formulated and then resuspended in D5W (dextrose 5% in water) at the time of dosing. Mice were orally dosed daily (via oral gavage) with 200 μl of the desired doses of RAD001.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1575" num="1615">PK analysis: Mice were dosed daily with RAD001 starting 7 days post tumor implantation. Dosing groups were as follows: 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg. Mice were bled on days 0 and 14 following the first and last dose of RAD001, at the following time points for PK analysis: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1576" num="1616">Results:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1577" num="1617">The expansion and pharmacokinetics of RAD001 was tested in NSG mice with NALM6-luc tumors. Daily oral dosing of RAD001 alone did not have an impact on the growth of NALM6-luc tumors (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>). The pharmacokinetic analysis of RAD001 shows that it is fairly stable in the blood of tumor bearing mice (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 61A and 61B</figref>). Both the day 0 and day 14 PK analyses show that the RAD001 concentrations in the blood is above 10 nm even 24 hours after dosing at the lowest dose tested (0.3 mg/kg).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1578" num="1618">Based on these doses, huCAR19 CAR T cells were dosed with and without RAD001 to determine the proliferative ability of these cells. The highest dose used was 3 mg/kg based on the levels of RAD001 in the blood 24 hours after dosing. As the concentration of RAD001 was above 10 nM 24 hours after the final dose of RAD001, several lower doses of RAD001 were used in the in vivo study with CAR T cells. The CAR T cells were dosed IV one day prior to the start of the daily oral RAD001 dosing. Mice were monitored via FACS for T cell expansion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1579" num="1619">The lowest doses of RAD001 show an enhanced proliferation of the CAR T cells (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 62A and 62B</figref>). This enhanced proliferation is more evident and prolonged with the CD4+ CAR T cells than the CD8+ CAR T cells. However, with the CD8+ CAR T cells, enhanced proliferation can be seen at early time points following the CAR T cell dose.</div>
<heading id="h-0134">Example 20: Certain Patients with Primary DLBCL Show CD3+/PD1+ Dual Positive Cancer Cells</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1580" num="1620">Although there have been compelling advances in the cancer immunotherapy space recently in the form of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T-cells and checkpoint inhibitors, advanced tools to explore the therapeutic mechanisms of their combination are not widely available. To address this growing need, a robust quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemistry platform using multiplex AQUA (Automated Quantitative Analysis) technology was developed to evaluate checkpoint inhibitor expression, enumerate CAR T cells and determine the interaction between tumor cells and immune cells via novel co-localization algorithms. The utility of this method was characterized both in preclinical- and clinical model systems. In an immunodeficient mouse model of B-cell lymphoma, homing of CAR T cells to malignant B-cells in primary lymphoid organs was evaluated. The phenotype and functional status of the CAR T cells via multiplex analyses of CD4, CD8, PD1 and FOXP3 expression was determined. Additionally, to enable combination immunotherapies in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) setting, prevalence of adaptive immune resistance mechanisms in the form of PD1 and PD-L1 expression in immune- and tumor cell compartments was examined via landmarks created by cytoplasmic and nuclear stains in both primary and secondary biopsies from DLBCL patients (n=63). To support patient selection for CAR T trials, expression and prevalence of relevant tumor antigens that could not be scored reproducibly by traditional methods were quantified to yield objective cut points. These quantitative multiplexed MC methods for optimal selection of patients can be utilized in upcoming novel combination immunotherapy trials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1581" num="1621">Sample preparation, imaging, and analysis of imaging for DLBCL tissue samples was performed on primary DLBCL (n=49) and secondary DLBCL (15) human patients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1582" num="1622">Sample Preparation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1583" num="1623">Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples were dewaxed. The slides were then rehydrated through a series of xylene to alcohol washes before incubating in distilled water. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was then performed using elevated pressure and temperature conditions, allowed to cool, and transferred to Tris-buffered saline. Staining was then performed where the following steps were carried out. First, endogenous peroxidase was blocked followed by incubation with a protein-blocking solution to reduce nonspecific antibody staining. Next, the slides were stained with a mouse anti-PD1 primary antibody. Slides were then washed before incubation with an anti-mouse HRP secondary antibody. Slides were washed and then PD-1 staining was detected using TSA+Cy® 5 (Perkin Elmer). Primary and secondary antibody reagents were then removed via microwave. The slides were again washed before staining with a rabbit anti-CD3 primary antibody. Slides were washed and then incubated with a cocktail of anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibody plus 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Slides were washed and then CD3 staining was detected using TSA-Cy® 3 (Perkin Elmer). Slides were washed a final time before they were cover-slipped with mounting media and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature.</div>

First, monochrome imaging of the slide at 4× magnification using DAPI was conducted. An automated algorithm (developed using inForm) was used to identify areas of the slide containing tissue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1586" num="1626">The areas of the slide identified as containing tissue were imaged at 4× magnification for channels associated with DAPI (blue), Cy®3 (green), and Cy® 5 (red) to create RGB images. These 4× magnification images were processed using an automated enrichment algorithm (developed using inForm) in field of view selector to identify and rank possible 20× magnification fields of view according to the highest Cy® 3 expression.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1587" num="1627">The top 40 fields of view were imaged at 20× magnification across DAPI, Cy®3, and Cy® 5 wavelengths. Raw images were reviewed for acceptability, and images that were out of focus, lacked any tumor cells, were highly necrotic, or contained high levels of fluorescence signal not associated with expected antibody localization (i.e., background staining) were rejected prior to analysis. Accepted images were processed using AQUAduct (Perkin Elmer), wherein each fluorophore was spectrally unmixed by spectral unmixer into individual channels and saved as a separate file.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1588" num="1628">The processed files were further analyzed using AQUAnalysis™ or through a fully automated process using AQUAserve™. Each DAPI image was processed by cell masker to identify all cell nuclei within that image, and then dilated by 2 pixels to represent the approximate size of an entire cell. This resulting mask represented all cells within that image. Each Cy® 5 image was processed by biomarker masker to create a binary mask of all cells that are PD-1-positive. Each Cy® 3 image was processed by biomarker masker to create a binary mask of all cells that are CD3-positive. The binary masks for all cells PD-1-positive and CD3-positive were combined to create a binary mask of all cells that are double positive for PD-1 and CD3. The % biomarker positivity (PBP) for all CD3 cells expressing PD-1 was derived, using positivity calculator, by dividing the total area, measured in pixels and determined by area evaluator, of the mask of all PD-1-positive tumor cells with the total area, measured in pixels and determined by area evaluator, of the mask of all CD3-positive cells. Representative values of PBP for all CD3-positive cells expressing PD-1 in primary and secondary DLBCL human samples are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>. CD3 and PD-1 status showed that prevalence rates of CD3+/PD-1+ cells in primary is higher than secondary DLBCL setting, providing an opportunity to select patient for either single or combination treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1589" num="1629">A similar experiment was performed in which PD-L1 was detected using a rabbit anti-PDL1 primary antibody and TSA+Cy5 (Perkin Elmer) on DLBCL tissue samples from primary DLBCL human patients. PD1 and CD3 were also detected on the same samples. The experiment showed that tumor microenvironments comprise cells that express PD1, CD3, and PDL1. The experiment also identified a sub-population of cells that is CD3+PD1+ (data not shown). These results support the model that a tumor microenvironment fosters immune suppressive cells that can be targeted with agents specific to PD1+ or PD-L1+ cells.</div>

CD19 and PDL1 expression varied in DLBCL samples. CD19 and PDL1 expression tended to be mutually exclusive, i.e., in general, a given cell expressed CD19 or PD-L1 but not both. While not wishing to be bound by theory, this may be because CD19 is expressed in DLBCL tumor cells while PD-L1 is expressed in non-tumor cells, e.g., cells that support the tumor microenvironment. This observation suggests that a combination therapy of a CD19 inhibitor (e.g., a CD19 CAR-expressing cell) and an inhibitor of PD-L1 signalling may be useful for targeting these two populations of cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1598" num="1638">A similar experiment was performed to, e.g., demonstrate the capability of AQUA analysis to monitor CART19 efficacy. This study monitored CD19, CD3, and the CART19 nucleic acid in samples comprising mixed cells lines with CART19+ Jurkat cells and CD19+ REH cells. CD19 and CD3 proteins were detected by antibodies, and CART19 was detected using an RNA probe against the 3′ UTR of the CAR nucleic acid. The experiment showed that the cell line samples comprise cells that express CD19, CD3, and the CART19 (data not shown). The experiment also showed that the cell line samples comprise a sub-population of cells that is CD3+/CART19+ (data not shown). Proximity analysis was performed, which showed that CART19 cells were physically proximal to CD19+ cells (data not shown). These experiments support the model that CD3+ CART19 cells infiltrate a tumor microenvironment comprising CD19+ cells and physical locations of CD19 and CART19 cells translate into efficacy of the CART19 therapy.</div>
<heading id="h-0136">Example 22: Bicistronic Expression of CARs</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1599" num="1639">In this Example, the efficacy of two types of cell populations were compared. In the first cell population, referred to as “pooled”, each cell expresses one CAR. A first plurality of cells was transduced with CD19 CAR, a second plurality of cells was transduced with CD22 CAR or CD123 CAR, and then the two pluralities of cells were pooled. In the second type of cell population, a plurality of cells was transduced with a bicistronic vector expressing CD19 CAR and a second CAR, so that most or all of the cells expressed both constructs. The second CAR was CD22 CAR in some experiments and CD123 CAR in others. These cell populations are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1600" num="1640">Two novel constructs, diagrammed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>, were generated using the P2A system in order to express two full-length CARs in the same T cell using a single bicistronic lentiviral vector. T cells were expanded according to a standard protocol and transduced using a single lentiviruse carrying both CAR19 and CAR123 (multiplicity of infection, MOI=3). A similar transduction was performed for CAR19 and CAR22 in the same T cell population obtained using the described bicistronic lentiviral vector. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref> shows co-expression of CD19 and CD22 CARs. Distinct populations based on the specific expression of CAR19 and/or CAR123 can be recognized, including a Dual CAR19+/CAR123+ population and a double negative population (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68A</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1601" num="1641">The cells transduced with bicistronic CD19 CAR and CD123 CAR was compared with pooled cells expressing either CD19 or CD123 CAR (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68B</figref>). NSG mice were engrafted with a B-ALL cell line (NALM-6, CBG+). At day 7 mice were randomized based on tumor burden (BLI, bioluminescence) to receive control T cells (UTD), CART19, CART123, the 1:1 pooled combination of CART123 and CART19 or the Dual CART19/123 (same total number of CAR+ cells). CD19 CAR-expressing cells alone (squares) and CD123 CAR-expressing cells alone (triangles) both showed initial effectiveness compared to the control (circles) followed by rising levels of leukemic cells. Pooled cells expressing CD19 or CD123 (diamond) also showed initial effectiveness followed by rising levels of leukemic cells. In contrast, cells transfected with the bicistronic vector (inverted triangles, “dual CART”) maintained a prolonged response at least 60 days after treatment. This experiment indicates that dual CARTs exert a potent anti-leukemia effect that is not only superior to a single CART treatment but is superior to a pooled CART cells.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1602" num="1642">CD19-negative B-ALL cells were tested for responsiveness to CD19 CAR-expressing cells and CD22 CAR-expressing cells in an animal model. One million CD19-negative B-ALL cells were infused into mice on day 0, and 2e6 CAR+ T cells were infused on day 7 (after randomization). Tumor burden was measured by bioluminescence. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref>, while the cancer progressed in the negative control mice and CART19-treated mice, CART22 is able to clear CD19-negative ALL in NSG xenografts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1603" num="1643">The assay was conducted as follows: 1e6 CD19-neg ALL cells (CBG+) were injected in NSG mice. At day 5 mice were randomized to receive either 2e6 control untransduced T cells (UTD), CART19 or CART22 (m971 scFv). Mice were then followed uo for tumor burden (bioluminescence).</div>
<heading id="h-0138">Example 24: Low Levels of Immune Checkpoint Molecules are Associated with Improved Outcomes</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1604" num="1644">Immune checkpoint molecules (PD-L1, PD1, LAG3, and TIM3) were detected in samples from lymphoma patients by immunohistochemistry. Positive and negative control tissues and cell lines were also performed. The immune checkpoint expression analysis was performed using quantitative image analysis on a region of interest which can include tumor cells and non-tumor cells such as immune cells. Samples were taken from tissue, lymph node, or bone marrow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1605" num="1645">Immune checkpoint protein expression was compared in complete responders (CR) and patients having progressive disease (PD) following treatment with CD19-targeting CAR therapy. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref>, the CR patients tended to have low levels of PD-L1, PD1, LAG3, and TIM3 before and after treatment, while PD patients tended to have high levels of these molecules before and after treatment. This Example supports combination therapy with a CAR-expressing cell and an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and supports testing to determine immune checkpoint molecule levels in patients receiving a CAR therapy.</div>
<heading id="h-0139">Example 25: Functional Assays of CD22 CAR-Expressing Cells</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1606" num="1646">Several CD22 CAR constructs were functionally validated in an NFAT assay. Briefly the experiments were performed as follows. A lentiviral vector (pELPS) carrying a nucleic acid, encoding a CD22 CAR with a CD22-binding scFv domain was introduced by electroporation into a Jurkat T cell line modified to express luciferase under the control of an NFAT response element (JNL). The cells were cultured and allowed to express the CAR construct. The electroporated cells were applied to a plate coated with the target antigen (CD22). Detection of luciferase signal in the coated plate was indicative of binding activity of the CD22 CAR to its antigen, leading to activation of the T cells and expression of luciferase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1607" num="1647"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref> is a graph showing the activation (in RLU) of several CD22 CAR constructs in the presence and absence of a m971 scFv competitor. These results indicate that CD22-53 and CD22-12, and a subset of the other scFvs, bind the antigen approximately as well as the m971 positive control. The results also indicate that the different scFvs compete with m971 to different extents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1608" num="1648">Sixteen additional human CD22 binding domains were tested and found to have weak binding activity (data not shown), so were not pursued further.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1609" num="1649"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> is a graph showing the activation (in RLU) of several CD22 CAR-expressing JNL cells including CD22-57, CD22-58, CD22-59, CD22-60, CD22-61, CD22-62, and CD22-63, the scFv sequences of which are provided herein. Three different target proteins (CD22-FL-Fc, CD22-D567-Fc, and CD22-D67) were used to coat the tissue culture plates; a negative control (Fc) was also included. A mesothelin binding CAR (Meso-G07) was used as a negative control. CD22-12 and CD22-53 were used as positive controls. The experiment indicated that all CARs (CD22-57, CD22-58, CD22-59, CD22-60, CD22-61, CD22-62, and CD22-63) were functional in this assay. Furthermore, these results indicated that the CARs tested (including CD22-12 and -53) bind to the domains 6 and 7 of CD22. Domain mapping was performed on CD22 binding domains. Three different forms of antigens were used: CD22 full-length with all 7 external domains, Domain567 (in which domains 1-4 were deleted) and Domain67 (in which domains 1-5 were deleted). While not wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that the binding of various CD22 clones maps to the epitopes illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1610" num="1650">CD22 CAR constructs were also tested for the ability to promote secretion of IFN-gamma and IL-2. Briefly, transduced primary T cells from healthy donors expressing the different CD22 CARs were co-cultured with the CD22-positive target cells Raji-Luc and Daudi-Luc as well as the negative control K562-Luc. T cells and target cell were cultured in an effector-to-target cell ratio (E:T) of 10 to 1. Supernatants were harvested after 20-hr co-culture. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref> shows three bar graphs indicating IFN-gamma production in pg/mL. Co-culture with Raji-Luc (top panel) and Daudi-luc (center panel) cell lines induced IFN-gamma secretion by hCD22-12, hCD22-53 CAR T cells as well as the two positive controls CAR19 and m971-HL. Notably, highest amounts were observed when the hCD22-53 cells were tested, and to a lesser extent, when the hCD22-12 cells were tested. Similar results were observed when Nalm6-Luc, Pfeiffer-Luc, and K562-CD22-Luc, and SEM-Luc cells were tested (data not shown). Minimal IFN-gamma secretion was observed when the K562-Luc negative control cell line was tested (bottom panel).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1611" num="1651">CD22-12 showed activity comparable to m971 in cell killing and cytokine secretion assays (Example 9). Two scFvs, named CD22-64 and CD22-65, were produced by affinity maturation of hCD22-12. CAR constructs containing these scFvs were tested for activity in an NFAT assay as described above. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, both CD22-64 and CD22-65 bind CD22 as well or better than CD22-12 and CD22-53, leading to JNL activation. The bars in the figure represent, from left to right, CD22 full length-Fc; CD22 D567-Fc; and an Fc only negative control used for coating of the plates. Testing four variants of CD22-12 suggested that LCDR3 and HCDR3 contributed to binding to some extent (data not shown), and that HCDR3 may tolerate more mutations than LCDR3.</div>
