<div class="abstract">A system includes a resonant sensor in contact with oil within a gearbox of a rotor system, such as a wind turbine, and one or more processors. The sensor includes electrodes and a sensing circuit that generates electrical stimuli having frequencies applied to the oil at different times during a life of the gearbox. The processors receive electrical signals from the resonant sensor representative of impedance responses of the oil to the electrical stimuli. The processors analyze the impedance responses and determine a concentration of a polar analyte in the oil at different times. The processors calculate a degradation value for the gearbox based on the concentration of the polar analyte. Responsive to the degradation value exceeding a designated threshold, the processors at least one of schedule maintenance for the rotor system, provide an alert to schedule maintenance, or prohibit operation of the rotor system until maintenance is performed.</div>

<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">One or more embodiments are disclosed that relate to asset monitoring systems and methods using resonant sensors. The resonant sensors may include inductor-capacitor-resistor (LCR) resonant circuits that can be used for monitoring properties of fluids.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Many industrial machines (e.g., wind turbines, locomotives, trucks, earth-moving equipment, and the like) include assets or assemblies (e.g., mechanical drive trains, engines, gearboxes, and the like) that operate within difficult environments and/or endure substantial amounts of thermal or torsional stress as well as shock and vibration. It is often desirable to monitor a condition of an element or assembly so that it may be replaced or repaired before severe and permanent damage is sustained by the machine. Often, fluid lubricants are used to provide lubrication and cooling to increase performance of the machine and/or to increase the operational lifetime of the machine. Lubricants reduce the friction between two parts that engage each other and may also dissipate heat that is generated by the friction between the two parts. In addition to lubricants, machines may use other industrial fluid such as fuels, hydraulic media, drive fluids, power steering fluids, power brake fluids, drilling fluids, oils, insulating fluids, heat transfer fluids, or the like. Such fluids allow efficient and safe operation of machinery in transportation, industrial, locomotive, marine, automotive, construction, medical, and other applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The quality of a lubricant may decrease over time due to the introduction of contaminants and/or aging of the lubricant. Lubricants in a reservoir can become contaminated by contaminants such as water, metallic particles, and non-metallic particles. Contaminated fluids may lead to damaged parts or a decreased performance of the machine. Water is a common and destructive lubricant contaminant. The water may be introduced from a coolant leak, condensation from environmental exposure, equipment cleaning, and/or combustion. Water adversely affects the lubricant properties by increasing engine wear, causing corrosion of the reservoir, and/or accelerating oxidation of the lubricating fluid, such as oil. In addition, the repetitive thermal and viscous cycles in normal operation conditions may cause the lubricating fluid to age and chemically break down, which results in a reduction in lubricating performance of the fluid, such as an increased viscosity. Furthermore, stabilizing additives that are added to the lubricants to provide increased resilience within harsh environments, such as high temperatures, may begin to break down over time as well. The reduction in additive concentration provides less thermal stability for the lubricant, causing the lubricant to degrade at a faster rate. As the additive is depleted, acidic components, such as by-products from the degradation of the additive and/or the lubricant due to aging, may be introduced into the lubricant fluid. The acidic components, like water, are polar contaminants that reduce the effectiveness and performance of the lubricant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional methods of inspecting fluids of a machine include visual inspection of the fluid (e.g., dipsticks) or a sensor that is directly wired to a system. These methods may not be practical and/or may have limited capabilities. For example, due to the configuration of some machines, it may be difficult to visually inspect the fluid. Also, hardwired sensors may not be suitable for machines that frequently move and/or are exposed to harsh conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Robust sensing of fluids may be useful in mobile and stationary equipment applications. As an example, if the equipment is a vehicle engine and the fluid is engine oil, then knowledge about oil health may be used to help reduce or prevent unexpected downtime, provide savings from unnecessary oil replacement, extend the operating lifetime of the oil and/or the asset (e.g., gearbox, engine, etc.) in which the oil is disposed, and improve service intervals scheduling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Standard (classic) impedance spectroscopy is a technique that is employed to characterize aspects of material performance. In classic impedance spectroscopy, a material may be positioned between electrodes and probed over a wide frequency range (from a fraction of Hz to tens of GHz) to extract the fundamental information about dielectric properties of the material. Standard impedance spectroscopy may be limited due to its low sensitivity in reported measurement configurations and prohibitively long acquisition times over the broad frequency range. Therefore, standard impedance spectroscopy is difficult to perform in the field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">It may be desirable to have systems and methods for in-situ monitoring of fluid properties that differ from those systems and methods that are currently available.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Embodiments described herein include various systems, assemblies, devices, apparatuses, and methods that may be used in a connection with obtaining one or more measurements of a machine. The measurement(s) may be representative or indicative of an operative condition of the machine. As used herein, an “operative condition of the machine” may refer to an operative condition of the machine as a whole or an operative condition of a component (e.g., element, assembly, or sub-system) of the machine. As used herein, the term “operative condition” relates to a present state or ability of the component and/or a future state or ability. For example, the measurement may indicate that a component is not functioning in a sufficient manner, is damaged, is likely to be damaged if it continues to operate in a designated manner, is not likely to perform appropriately under designated circumstances, and/or is likely to cause damage to other components of the machine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">As an example with respect to locomotives or other rail vehicles, one or more measurements obtained from a locomotive or other rail vehicle may indicate that a lubricant in the component (e.g., drive train, gearbox, engine, and the like) is low or has an insufficient quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The measurement may be one of a plurality of measurements that are analyzed according to embodiments described herein. For instance, embodiments may comprise analyzing multiple measurements that were obtained at different times from a single sensor to determine an operative condition of the machine. By way of example, a series of measurements from a single sensor in a gear case may indicate that a lubricant level has substantially changed and, thus, the gear case is leaking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">The foregoing description of certain embodiments of the present inventive subject matter will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings. To the extent that the figures illustrate diagrams of the functional blocks of various embodiments, the functional blocks are not necessarily indicative of the division between hardware and circuit. Thus, for example, one or more of the functional blocks (for example, controllers or memories) may be implemented in a single piece of hardware (for example, a general purpose signal processor, microcontroller, random access memory, hard disk, and the like). Similarly, the programs may be stand-alone programs, may be incorporated as subroutines in an operating system, may be functions in an installed software package, and the like. The various embodiments are not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality shown in the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view of a drive train (or final drive) <b>150</b> in accordance with one embodiment. The drive train <b>150</b> includes a traction motor <b>152</b>, a first (or pinion) gear <b>154</b>, a second gear <b>156</b>, and a base portion or shell <b>160</b> of a gear case <b>158</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first gear <b>154</b> and the second gear <b>156</b> engage each other at a gear mesh <b>164</b>. During operation of the drive train <b>150</b> the traction motor <b>152</b> drives the first gear <b>154</b> by rotating an axle (not shown) coupled to the first gear <b>154</b> about an axis of rotation <b>166</b>. The first gear <b>154</b> may be rotated, for example, in a counter-clockwise direction as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Due to the engagement at the gear mesh <b>164</b>, the first gear <b>154</b> rotates the second gear <b>156</b> in a clockwise direction about an axis of rotation <b>168</b>. The second gear <b>156</b> is coupled to an axle (not shown) of a machine (not shown) that rotates with the second gear <b>156</b>. The machine may be a motive machine, such that the axle of the second gear <b>156</b> is coupled to wheels (not shown) of the machine that are rotated with the axle. The wheels engage a surface (e.g., rails or tracks) to move the machine. The machine may be an off-highway vehicle (e.g., vehicles that are not designed or allowed by law or regulation to travel on public roads, highways, and the like). Off-highway vehicles include locomotives, mining vehicles, construction equipment, agricultural equipment, industrial equipment, marine vessels, and the like. In some cases, the vehicle may be part of a vehicle consist in which multiple vehicles are linked directly or indirectly to one another in a common vehicle system (e.g., train). In some embodiments, the machine is an automobile. In alternative embodiments, the machine is not configured to travel. For example, the machine may be a power-generating turbine, such as a windmill or wind turbine, or a component thereof, such as a gearbox.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The gear case <b>158</b> includes a reservoir <b>172</b> that is configured to hold a lubricant liquid <b>180</b> (e.g., oil). The gear case <b>158</b> has a fill or inlet port <b>186</b> and a drain or outlet port <b>188</b>. The liquid <b>180</b> may be provided to the reservoir <b>172</b> through the fill port <b>186</b> and drained through the drain port <b>188</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second gear <b>156</b> has teeth <b>176</b> along an edge <b>174</b> of the second gear <b>156</b>. When the liquid <b>180</b> is held within the gear case <b>158</b>, the liquid <b>180</b> may have a fill level <b>184</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a first fill level <b>184</b>A and a second fill level <b>184</b>B. The second fill level <b>184</b>B is lower than the first fill level <b>184</b>A. In some embodiments, when the drive train <b>150</b> is operating properly, the quantity of the liquid <b>180</b> correlates to the first fill level <b>184</b>A such that the edge <b>174</b> of the second gear <b>156</b> is sufficiently submerged within or bathed by the liquid <b>180</b>. However, when the fill level is lowered to, for example, the fill level <b>184</b>B, the edge <b>174</b> and teeth <b>176</b> may be insufficiently lubricated. Such circumstances may occur when the gear case <b>158</b> has a leak. For example, the gear case may become worn and/or damaged over time such that the liquid <b>180</b> is permitted to escape the reservoir <b>172</b> and/or external contaminants are permitted to enter the reservoir <b>172</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Other embodiments described herein may be configured to detect other characteristics besides liquid level, such as quality (e.g., degree of contamination) of the liquid. Contaminants may include water, acid, metallic particles, and/or non-metallic particles. Furthermore, embodiments are not limited to the drive train or a gear case of the drive train. For example, measurements may be obtained for any machine including moving parts that use a lubricating fluid, such as a turbo-charger, an air compressor, an engine, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">Additional embodiments are disclosed that relate to sensing methods and systems. The sensors, such as resonant sensors, may include inductor-capacitor-resistor (LCR) sensors that can be used as sensors or transducers for sensing fluids. Provided herein are sensors having a part that is a resonant structure that exhibits resolvable changes in the presence of a fluid and various components or contaminants in the fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">In one embodiment, the sensor may include an inductor-capacitor-resistor (LCR) resonator circuit with a resonance frequency response provided by the resonant impedance (Z) of this circuit. The sensors as provided herein may be capable of sensing properties of interest in the presence of variable noise sources and operating over the variable temperature conditions to provide stable sensor performance over time. Disclosed herein are sensors that include inductor-capacitor-resistor (LCR) resonators, which may function as a sensor or as a transducer. The resonant impedance spectrum of the sensor may be measured either via inductive coupling between pick up coil and sensor or directly by connecting to a sensor reader. The electrical response of the sensor may be translated into the resonant impedance changes of the sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">Non-limiting examples of signal changes of an individual sensor may include combined and simultaneous resonant impedance change, inductance change, resistance change, and capacitance change (referred to herein as electrical characteristics). Suitable sensors and systems disclosed herein may enhance the ability to measure changes in a fluid, such as engine oil or fuel, by contacting it with the sensor between the electrodes that constitute a resonant circuit of the sensor. The resonant circuit of the sensor may be an electrical resonant circuit. Other resonant circuits may include a mechanical resonator, where a change of viscosity and/or density of the fluid cause a response of the mechanical resonators.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">Suitable mechanical resonators may include tuning fork resonators, thickness shear mode resonators, quartz crystal microbalance resonators, surface acoustic wave resonators, bulk acoustic wave resonators, and others. Unlike these and other mechanical resonators, the electrical resonators may be not predictably affected by the changes change of viscosity and/or density of the fluid. Instead, electrical resonators may be predictably affected by the changes in the complex permittivity of the fluid. Electrical resonators may be complicated in their design. For example, marginal oscillators require complicated multi-component circuits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The degradation of at least some oils and lubricants may generate molecules and/or other moieties that may be relatively more polar than the oil and lubricant from which they were formed. The base oil or lubricant may include long chain hydrocarbon molecules that are weakly polar. Thus, the presence of polar contaminants may increase of one or more parts of the oil's complex permittivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The degradation of at least some oils and lubricants may generate molecules and/or other moieties that may be relatively low molecular weight and may be in the form of volatiles or gases. For example, an insulating oil of an oil-fitted transformer is employed to insulate and suppress corona and arcing and to serve as a coolant. However, the insulating oil gradually deteriorates under the impact of electrical, thermal and environmental stresses during the life of the transformer. Different types of gases are generated in the insulating oil depending on the deterioration processes. Examples of these gases include hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene. For example, thermal decomposition of mineral oil produces hydrogen and methane. Thermal decomposition of cellulose and other solid insulation materials produces carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. Such gases are detected and monitored in real time using multivariable sensors as described in more detail below. For this application the sensor is coated with a sensing material that is responsive to one or more gases of interest. When the sensor is in operational contact with the oil, dissolved gases in oil also interact with the sensor and produce a predictable multivariable sensor response. The operational contact may be achieved by direct immersion of the sensor into oil when the sensing material is wetted by oil or through a gas permeable membrane that may allow dissolved gases in oil to diffuse through the membrane to the sensing material while the oil is not wetting the sensing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">According to one aspect, the resonant transducers operate as re-configurable resonant structures and operate at multiple frequencies for monitoring of a status of fluids (and, further, for example, the health of equipment in contact with such fluids). Monitoring the health of fluids involves a determination of composition or a determination of contamination of such fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a sensing system <b>1700</b> is shown that may be useful for assessing a fluid in contact with the sensing system <b>1700</b>. For purposes of illustration, a representative fluid may be engine oil. The system may include a fluid reservoir <b>1712</b> for a fluid and a sensor <b>1714</b> disposed in, on, or within the fluid reservoir <b>1712</b>. Alternatively, the sensor may be set in a flow path of the fluid outside of the reservoir <b>1712</b>, such as coupled to in-line connectors in fluid communication with the fluid reservoir that define a flow path. In one embodiment, the sensor may provide continuous monitoring of the fluid within the reservoir or flow path.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">Suitable fluids may include hydrocarbon fuels and lubricants. Suitable lubricants may include engine oil, gear oil, hydraulic fluid, lubricating oils, synthetic based lubricants, lubricating fluids, greases, silicones, and the like. Suitable fuels may include gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel or kerosene, bio-fuels, petrodiesel-biodiesel fuel blends, natural gas (liquid or compressed), and fuel oils. Still other fluids may be insulating oils in transformers, solvents, or mixtures of solvents. Still other fluids may be included with correspondingly appropriate sensor parameters, such as water, air, engine exhaust, biologic fluids, and organic and/or vegetable oils. The fluid may be a liquid, or may in a gaseous phase. Further contemplated are multiphase compositions. The fluids may be disposed in and/or used in connection with the operation of a machine, such as a movable vehicle or a wind turbine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Non-limiting examples of various fluid components include unintended leaks from proximate systems (e.g., radiator fluid into engine oil, or water condensation in diesel fuel or transformer oil) and/or from fluid-transport devices (e.g., valves, flanges, pipes, tubes). Other detectable fluid components may include degradation products of the fluid caused due to elevated temperature of operation, or due to contact with oxidants (air, others). System operation may introduce fluid components such as dirt, salt, soot or carbon, wear metal particles, wear products, and others. In some environments, fouling due to bacteria or the like may be the fluid component. And in all instances, indirect measurement may be useful, such as a pH decrease that indicates an increased presence of an acidic component. Other detectable fluid components may include external contaminants of the fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">The sensor may detect characteristics or properties of the fluid via a resonant impedance spectral response. One or more of the LCR resonators may measure the resonant impedance spectral response. As opposed to simple impedance measurements, the disclosed embodiments probe the sample with at least one resonant electrical circuit. The resonant impedance spectrum of the sensor in proximity to the sample (the sensor in operational contact with the fluid) varies based on sample composition and/or components and/or temperature. The measured resonant impedance values Z′ (which may be the real part of resonant impedance, Zre) and Z″ (which may be the imaginary part of resonant impedance, Zim) reflect the response of the fluid (for example, the portion of the fluid in proximity to the sensor) to a stimulus of the electric field of the resonant electrical circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">The electrical field may be applied by the sensor via electrodes. The electrodes may be in direct or indirect electrical contact with the sample. For example, a sensor may be a combination of a sensing region and associated circuits. The sensing region may be either bare or coated with a protective dielectric layer or a sensing layer. In each of the disclosed cases, the sensing region may be considered to be in operational contact with a fluid. In such embodiments, the sensor circuits may not contact the fluid directly. An example of indirect electrical contact with the sample may be when a sensing electrode structure is coated with a dielectric protective coating and when the electric field that may be generated between the electrodes interacts with the fluid after penetrating through the dielectric protective coating. A suitable dielectric protective coating may be conformally applied to the electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Suitable sensors may include single use or multi-use sensors. A suitable multi-use resonant sensor may be a re-usable sensor that may be used during the lifetime of a system in which it may be incorporated into. In one embodiment, the resonant sensor may be a single use sensor that may be used during all or part of a reaction or process. For example, the resonant sensor may include one or more pairs of electrodes and one or more tuning elements, e.g., a resistor, a capacitor, an inductor, a resonator, impedance transformer, or combinations of two or more thereof to form an inductor-capacitor-resistor (LCR) resonant circuit operated at one or more resonant frequencies. In certain embodiments, different resonant circuits of a plurality of resonant circuits of a resonant sensor may be configured to resonate at different frequencies. Different frequencies may be selected to be across the dispersion profile of the measured fluid composition. The dispersion profile may depend on the dielectric properties of the fluid composition on the probing frequency. Various components of the fluid have different dispersion profiles. When measured at multiple resonance frequencies, concentrations of different components of the fluid may be determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Data from the resonant sensor may be acquired via data acquisition circuitry <b>1716</b>, which may be associated with the sensor or which may be associated with a control system, such as a controller or workstation <b>1722</b> including data processing circuitry, where additional processing and analysis may be performed. The controller or workstation may include one or more wireless or wired components, and may also communicate with the other components of the system. Suitable communication models include wireless or wired. At least one suitable wireless model includes radio frequency devices, such as RFID wireless communications. Other wireless communication modalities may be used based on application specific parameters. For example, where there may be EMF interference certain modalities may work where others may not. The data acquisition circuitry can be disposed within the sensor <b>1714</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Other suitable locations may include disposition being within the workstation. Further, the workstation can be replaced with a control system of the whole process where the resonant sensor and its data acquisition circuitry may be connected to the control system of process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">The data acquisition circuitry may be in the form of a sensor reader, which may be configured to communicate wirelessly or wired with the fluid reservoir and/or the workstation.

The sensing region <b>1938</b> (shown with variable resistor and capacitor) is combined with tuning components <b>1942</b> (shown with variable inductor and capacitor). To realize sensor response at a different frequency range, additional circuit elements may be utilized to tune the frequency range.

These components may be connected in parallel or in series, as needed, to the sensor to vary the operating frequency range. The controller may control the impedance transformer ratio to affect the sensitivity. A sensor's frequency response and its magnitude may be based at least in part on the overall input resonant impedance changes due to the sensor's response to the fluid status, fluid behavior, and the like. Thus, the sensor's sensitivity may be controlled through the dynamic tunability of the transformer ratio.

Performing analysis of resonant impedance spectra of the sensor collected at different temperatures and determining two or more properties of the fluid per temperature based on the analyzed resonant impedance spectra allows an improvement of the sensor accuracy of determinations of properties of species of interest.

In another example, a series of experiments may be performed using a single sensor to determine the measured resonance parameters of a resonant impedance spectral response of the sensor in a given industrial fluid at various concentrations of water or other external contaminant in the fluid and at various age levels of the fluid, which are the two or more variables that change across the series of experiments. The measured resonance parameters for the series of experiments may be plotted as data points on a graph, and may be used to develop a quantitative model that is used to predict the water or other external contaminant concentration and the age level of monitored fluids (where the water concentration or other external contaminant and the age are unknown). The quantitative model may be a transfer function for the sensing region <b>5808</b> broadly or for the individual sensing sub-regions <b>5808</b>A, <b>5808</b>B, and <b>5808</b>C. Thus, measured resonance parameters from a resonance impedance spectral response may be input as variables into the quantitative model to predict water or other external contaminant concentration and aging level of the tested fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">The determination of the contaminant concentration in and/or age of the fluid of interest may be performed by establishing correlations between the spectral impedance responses of the sensing sub-regions <b>5808</b>A, <b>5808</b>B, and <b>5808</b>C at multiple frequencies across the dispersion profiles of the fluid and the experimental impedance responses as determined initially via independent reference laboratory methods.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">In an experimental example, quantitation of water leaks at various stages of oil aging was performed using the sensor of one or more of the embodiments disclosed herein. The industrial fluid was automotive oil 10W-30. Water was added into the oil at different levels ranging from 25 parts per million (ppm) to 900 ppm when oil had three different aging levels. The aging levels were fresh (0% aging), old (100% aging), and intermediate (50% aging). The fresh oil indicates new oil, the old oil indicates oil with a mileage of 5000 miles in an automotive, and the intermediate oil is a 50/50 ratio of fresh and old oil. The oil may be considered new or fresh at or proximate to a beginning of a recommended fluid life of the oil, the oil may be considered old at or proximate to an end of the recommended fluid life of the oil, and the oil may be considered intermediate at or proximate to the middle of the recommended fluid life. For example, for an oil with a recommended fluid life of 5000 miles in a vehicle, the oil may be considered as new or fresh during the first 10% of the recommended fluid life (e.g., during roughly the first 500 miles), the oil may be considered as old for the last 10% of the recommended life (e.g., during roughly the final 500 miles before reaching 5000 miles) and during any additional miles beyond the recommended life, and the oil may be considered as intermediate for the middle 10% of the recommended life (e.g., during the period roughly between miles <b>2250</b> and <b>2750</b>).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">In another experimental example, water leaks into oil were studied during the operation of a helicopter engine. The helicopter engine was a turboshaft CT7 helicopter engine made by GE. Water in the form of an emulsion was added to the oil sump prior to the engine start. A homogenizer was used to emulsify water with the CT7 engine oil. First, the loss of water in the oil during the helicopter engine operation was studied with the near-infrared spectroscopy using a Cary 500i UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.) using quartz cuvettes with a 1-cm path length. Initially, oil samples with known amounts of water were measured to establish the relationship between near-infrared absorbance and water content. Next, samples were taken between the runs of the helicopter engine and analyzed with near-infrared spectroscopy for the presence of residual water. The 500 ppm water was added to the sump of the engine, and then the engine was allowed to run for specified time periods in the ground idle mode. Oil samples were taken between the runs and analyzed with near-infrared spectroscopy for the presence of residual water. The water presence was deduced from the characteristic water absorption band at 1900 nm after the measurement setup calibration with oil-water mixtures with the known water content. The results indicated that for a given concentration of 500 ppm water, water was completely eliminated from the oil in around five minutes on the ground idle.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">At <b>6304</b>, an electrical or electromagnetic signal is received from the sensor. The electrical or electromagnetic signal is representative of a resonant impedance spectral response of the sensing region in operational contact with the industrial fluid in response to the electrical or electromagnetic stimulus being applied to the industrial fluid.

Although “water concentration” is mentioned, in other embodiments the concentration may be of another external contaminant other than water. The water or other external contaminant concentration in the industrial fluid and the aging level of the industrial fluid may be determined by comparing the extracted resonance parameters to known resonance parameters associated with various water or other external contaminant concentrations in the industrial fluid and various aging levels of the industrial fluid. The aging level of the fluid is determined by categorizing the fluid as three levels as one of fresh, old, or intermediate. The aging level of the fluid may be also determined by categorizing the fluid with more levels of aging where the number of levels of aging may be 8, 64, 128, or more. The number of aging levels determined by the sensor may depend on the developed transfer function between fluid aging and multivariable sensor response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">The determination of oil aging by levels is important for different applications. For example a two-level aging of oil means that level 1 is a fresh oil and level 2 is aged oil that requires oil replacement or some other action. The higher number of resolution levels of oil aging, the more accurate performed actions can be, including prognostic algorithms to predict the remaining life of oil and/or the machine or an industrial system or site.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">Analyzing the resonant impedance spectra may include extracting resonance parameters of the resonant impedance spectra. The resonance parameters are at least some of a frequency position (Fp) and magnitude (Zp) of a real part of the resonant impedance spectra, a resonant frequency (F1) and antiresonant frequency (F2) of an imaginary part of the resonant impedance spectra, an impedance magnitude (Z1) at the resonant frequency (F1) and an impedance magnitude (Z2) at the antiresonant frequency (F2), and a zero-reactance frequency (Fz) at the imaginary part of the resonant impedance spectra.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">In an alternative embodiment, the resonant impedance spectra are analyzed to determine both water concentration and acid concentration in the fluid. Acid concentration of an oil is useful for estimating an amount of depletion of additives, an amount of acidic contamination, and/or an amount of fluid degradation. Some industrial fluids such as engine oil may have additives added to the fluids that are designed to increase the stability of the fluids in extreme temperature environments. The additives may be acidic compounds that elevate the acid concentration of the fluid. However, as the fluid ages, the additives deplete over time. The reduced amount of additives in the fluid reduces the acidity or acid concentration of the fluid. On the other hand, acidic contamination and fluid degradation may have the reverse effect of increasing the acid concentration of the fluid. Acidic contamination refers to external acidic components that are undesirably introduced into the fluid via leak paths through the reservoir housing that holds the fluid. For example, acidic components may be introduced into the fluid through a leak path with other external contaminants, such as water. As the amount of acidic contaminants increase, the acid concentration of the fluid increases and the performance or effectiveness of the fluid, such as for providing lubrication and/or heat dissipation, may decrease. The acids in the fluid may reduce the performance of the fluid and/or the machine in which the fluid is used by increasing the viscosity of the fluid and forming gums and resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">Furthermore, the fluid may degrade over time as the fluid ages, such that the components of the fluid break up into smaller constituents. The rate of degradation may be affected by the high temperatures of the environment and/or the type and amount of additives and contaminants in the fluid. For example, the fluid may degrade at a higher rate once the stabilizing additives are depleted. The additives may include anti-oxidants, such that the fluid oxidizes at a greater rate once the additives are depleted. Typically, as the fluid degrades with age, the fluid may break down into corrosive acids or acidic components which increase the acid concentration of the fluid. The corrosive acids also reduce the performance of the fluid and can cause component failure (e.g., engine failure) if the fluid is not replaced by new fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">Monitoring the acid concentration of the fluid over time may be used to determine when to replace the fluid. For example, while a lubricating fluid that contains an acidic additive package is relatively new, the acid concentration of the fluid may gradually decrease over time as the acidic additives are gradually depleted. After the additives are depleted, the acid concentration may gradually increase due to at least one of acidic contaminants that leak into the fluid or fluid degradation. By monitoring the initial decrease and subsequent increase in the acid concentration, the sensing system can be used to predict the concentration of an additive package in the oil, when the additives are depleted, if there is a significant acid contamination, when the fluid should be replaced due to high acid concentration that exceeds a predetermined threshold level, and/or the like. For example, a low acid concentration may indicate that the concentration of the additive package is low or depleted. Based on the information provided by the sensing system, responsive actions may be taken to improve the fluid quality and/or increase the life of the fluid and/or machine in which the fluid is used. For example, additional additives may be added to the fluid responsive to the additives being depleted, the machine may be scheduled for repair and/or replacement responsive to detection of an acid contamination, and/or the fluid may be replaced responsive to determination of a high acid concentration that exceeds the predetermined threshold level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">Acidic components and water are both polar components. Conventional sensors, such as conventional capacitive sensors like the one described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, are not able to discriminate between different polar components in a signal response to identify the individual contributions of water and acidic components in the fluid. However, the multivariable resonant sensor of the embodiments described herein is able to individually detect both water concentration and acid concentration of a non-polar fluid such as oil using only the single sensor.</div>

The electrical signal may be transmitted from the sensor to one or more processors, such as the one or more processors of the sensor reader <b>5804</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. The resonant impedance response shows the response of the sensing region in contact with the oil over the frequency range that includes the multiple resonant frequencies of the LCR resonant circuits. As described above, the resonance parameters for the resonant impedance spectra (e.g., Ž(f)=Z<sub>re</sub>(f)+jZ<sub>im</sub>(f)) may include one or more of the frequency position F<sub>p </sub>and magnitude Z<sub>p </sub>of Z<sub>re</sub>(f), the resonant F<sub>1 </sub>and antiresonant F<sub>2 </sub>frequencies, the magnitudes Z<sub>1 </sub>and Z<sub>2 </sub>of Z<sub>im</sub>(f), and zero-reactance frequency F<sub>z </sub>of Z<sub>im</sub>(f). In an embodiment, at least four resonance parameters are extracted from the impedance response. The one or more processors are configured to analyze the resonance parameters to quantitatively determine (e.g., estimate) the concentrations of water and acid in the oil (as shown in steps <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>320</b>). The one or more processors optionally may also be configured to estimate a health of the oil and/or the machine in which the oil is used based on the concentrations of water and acid in the oil (as shown in steps <b>322</b> and <b>324</b>). Furthermore, the one or more processors may be configured to predict a remaining life of the oil and/or the machine based on the concentrations of water and acid in the oil (as shown in steps <b>326</b> and <b>328</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">At <b>306</b>, the electrical resonance parameters are classified, which may be done using an earlier-built classification model at <b>308</b>, to assess the water effects in the oil at <b>310</b> and the acid effect in the oil at <b>312</b>. The classification model may be built using spectral resonant parameters of a control group that is accumulated from previously-determined analyses of the effects of water and acid on the same or a similar type of oil. At <b>314</b>, the electrical resonance parameters may be quantified using an earlier-built quantitation model at <b>316</b>, to independently determine a concentration of water in the oil at <b>318</b> and a concentration of acid in the oil (e.g., a total acid number of the oil) at <b>320</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">In an embodiment, the analysis of the resonant impedance response may be performed by comparing the extracted resonance parameters from the measured resonant impedance response to known resonance parameters of a control group. The parameters in the control group may be recorded resonance parameters of the same or a similar type of oil at various controlled properties of the oil, such as at different specific concentrations of water in the oil and/or different specific concentrations of acid in the oil. For example, a first subset of the resonance parameters in the control group may be associated with the same type of oil having a negligible amount of water and a first concentration of acid; a second subset of the resonance parameters in the control group may be associated with the same type of oil having a first concentration of water and the first concentration of acid; and a third subset of the resonance parameters in the control group may be associated with the same type of oil having the first concentration of water and a negligible amount of acid. The data for the resonance parameters in the control group may be obtained via previous tests in the field and/or in the laboratory. The data for the previous tests may be stored and used to build the classification model and/or the quantitation model.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">For example, a series of experiments may be performed using a single multivariable resonant sensor to determine the measured resonance parameters of a resonant impedance spectral response of the sensor in a given type of oil at various concentrations of water and acid of the oil. The concentrations of water and acid are variable that are modified across the series of experiments. The measured resonance parameters for the series of experiments may be plotted as data points on a graph, and may be used to develop the quantitative model that is used to predict the water concentration and the acid concentration of monitored oil. The quantitative model may be a transfer function. Thus, the measured or extracted resonance parameters from a resonance impedance spectral response may be input as variables into the quantitative model to predict water concentration and acid concentration of the tested oil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">In an embodiment, the properties of the oil that is monitored by the sensor may be determined by comparing the extracted resonance parameters from the measured impedance response to the resonance parameters in the control group that are associated with known properties of the oil (e.g., known water and acid concentrations). For example, the water concentration and the acid concentration in the oil may be determined by matching the extracted resonance parameters to a specific subset of resonance parameters in the control group. For example, if the extracted resonance parameters more closely match or align with the resonance parameters of the second subset of resonance parameters described above (relative to the matching or alignment with the resonance parameters of the first and third subsets), then the measured oil is determined to have the first concentration of water and the first concentration of acid. Statistical methods may be used to compare and match the measured resonance parameters to the control group of known resonance parameters. The statistical method used may be a regression analysis, such as a linear regression, a nonlinear regression, or the like. Although only three subsets of resonance parameters are mentioned above, the quantitation model may have more than three subsets in order to provide more accurate determinations of the water concentration and acid concentration in a sample of oil. For example, the one or more processors may be configured to determine the concentration of water in an oil at 10, 30, 50, or more different levels or concentrations, and may be configured to independently determine the concentration of acid within the same oil sample at 10, 30, 50, or more different levels or concentrations in order to provide an accurate determination of both properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">At <b>322</b>, the concentrations of water and acid in the oil may be used to generate or update a model of oil health, which may be based on an earlier-built model using oil health descriptors at <b>324</b>. In general, a relatively high concentration of water and/or a relatively significant increase in the concentration of water in the oil may signal poor oil health. The significant increase in water concentration may indicate a leak condition that should be addressed. Furthermore, a relatively high concentration of acid and/or a relatively significant increase in the acid concentration may signal poor oil health, especially if the oil is not fresh or new. For example, if the oil is new, the high concentration of acid may be at least partially due to the presence of stabilizing additives added to the oil, such that the oil may be in good health. But, as the oil ages and the additives deplete, an increase in acid concentration may indicate the introduction of an acidic contaminant and/or degradation (e.g., oxidation) of the oil, indicating poor oil health. The oil health descriptors may include threshold levels or ranges of water and acid, and may also include threshold rates of change for the concentrations of water and acid. The oil may be considered to have good health if the determined concentrations of water and acid are both within the designated threshold levels. The oil health descriptors may include multiple thresholds for the water concentration and acid concentration. For example, if the acid concentration of the oil exceeds a first threshold, the model of oil health may indicate that the oil should be replaced within a designated period of time (or miles, revolutions, etc.) to avoid the oil degrading to a level of poor health that could damage the machine. Furthermore, if the acid concentration of the oil exceeds a second threshold that is greater than the first threshold, the model of oil health may indicate that the oil has a poor quality and should be replaced immediately without further operation of the machine until the oil is replaced and/or the machine is repaired (e.g., if a contamination leak is detected).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0222">At <b>326</b>, the concentrations of water and acid in the oil may be used to generate or update a model of the health of the engine (e.g., or another machine in which the oil is disposed), which may be based on an earlier-built model using engine health descriptors at <b>328</b>. For example, if the engine is operated with a poor quality of oil, the health of the engine may suffer, reducing the expected performance and/or operational lifetime of the engine. On the other hand, if the oil in the engine is maintained in good health such that the oil is replaced before the oil degrades to a poor health condition, then the engine may be determined to have a good health. The health of the oil and the engine may be used to predict the remaining operational lifetimes of the oil and the engine using the models at steps <b>322</b> and <b>326</b>.</div>

The rotor system <b>400</b> in the illustrated embodiment is a wind turbine or windmill, but in other embodiments the rotor system <b>400</b> may be a rotocraft (e.g., a helicopter, an airboat, etc.), a rotary-powered industrial machine, or the like. The rotor system <b>400</b> includes a hub <b>402</b> with three rotor blades <b>404</b> coupled thereto, a power conversion unit <b>406</b>, and a base <b>408</b>. The base <b>408</b> in the illustrated embodiment is a tower that holds the hub <b>402</b>, rotor blades <b>404</b>, and power conversion unit <b>406</b> suspended above the ground. The power conversion unit <b>406</b> includes a gearbox <b>410</b> and a generator <b>412</b>. The gearbox <b>410</b> is mechanically coupled to the hub <b>402</b>, such that rotational movement of the hub <b>402</b> rotates gears within the gearbox <b>410</b>. The gearbox <b>410</b> is mechanically coupled to the generator <b>412</b> via a shaft <b>414</b>. The gearbox <b>410</b> rotates the shaft <b>414</b>, and the generator <b>412</b> converts the mechanical energy of the rotating shaft <b>414</b> into electrical energy.

Typically, the generator <b>412</b> is configured to operate at higher rotational speeds than the hub <b>402</b>, so the gearbox <b>410</b> increases the speed of rotation from the hub <b>402</b> to the shaft <b>414</b>, but the gearbox <b>410</b> optionally may be configured to decrease or maintain the speed of rotation instead of increasing the speed of rotation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">Typical oils for gearboxes are synthetic oils such as hydrocarbon oils, polyglycol oils, ester oils, polyalphaolefin oils, and other oils. Oils for gearboxes of wind turbines include polyalphaolefin oils, polyglycol oils, and other oils. For high performance, the synthetic base oil stock is used as the main component and is blended with additives for protection against temperature effects, acid formation, oxidation, and long term wear. Mechanisms of oil aging include depletion of additives and build-up of external contaminants. Examples of external contaminants include molecular contaminants such as water and particulate contaminants such as wear particles. Emulsified and dissolved water in oil induce damage to gearbox components and reduced protection normally provided by lubricating oil. Water in the air within the headspace inside the gearbox accelerates corrosion of gearbox components. High levels of TAN drive the corrosion of seals and hoses of gearbox components. Thus, real-time monitoring of oil health provides the ability to eliminate asset downtime for repair and replacement, and unnecessary premature oil changes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0233">The gearbox <b>410</b> and the generator <b>412</b> are machine assets (also referred to herein as assets) of the rotor system <b>400</b>. The assets of the rotor system <b>400</b> may include industrial fluids for lubrication, heat-dissipation, pneumatics, or the like. For example, the gearbox <b>410</b> includes oil housed within a reservoir. The oil engages the gears to provide lubrication, reducing the frictional forces between the gears and providing improved efficiency (relative to gearboxes without lubricating fluids). However, as described above, the health of oil may diminish over time due to oil aging and/or the introduction of external contaminants, such as water and acidic components. As the health of the oil declines, not only does the lubricating performance of the oil suffer (e.g., due to oil contamination and aging), but so too may the health of the asset that uses the oil (e.g., the gearbox <b>410</b>). For example, contaminants such as acids and water may cause, or at least exacerbate, corrosion of the walls of the gearbox <b>410</b> that contain the oil. The water and acid may increase the rate of oxidation of the metallic walls of the gearbox <b>410</b>. The corrosion may result in cracks that allow additional contaminants into the gearbox <b>410</b>. Eventually, the corrosion may cause the gearbox <b>410</b> to operationally fail (e.g., the gears jam or become displaced), which can cause the rotor system to shut down until a replacement gearbox can be installed. The failure of the gearbox <b>410</b> due to corrosion may cause damage to other assets and/or components of the rotor system <b>400</b>, such as the generator <b>412</b>, increasing the cost of the repairs and possibly extending the down-time of the rotor system <b>400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">The external contaminant in the oil of the gearbox <b>410</b> may be water that enters the oil reservoir from the ambient environment due to condensation. For example, the gearbox <b>410</b> may not be hermetically sealed, and leak paths in the gearbox <b>410</b> may allow contaminants such as water from the ambient environment to interact with the oil. Besides condensation, water may be introduced into the oil via a coolant leak, equipment cleaning, or as a by-product of a reaction. The amount of water in the oil may vary based on multiple factors including the amount and size of the leak paths (e.g., the accessibility of the oil), the temperature of the oil, and the temperature and relative humidity of the ambient environment. For example, while the rotor system <b>400</b> operates, the temperature of the oil may exceed the temperature of the ambient environment and/or an evaporation temperature of water. At least some of the water within the oil may evaporate into the ambient environment, reducing the concentration of water within the oil. Conversely, when the temperature of the oil is less than the evaporation temperature of water, the concentration of water within the oil may increase due to condensation of water from the ambient environment into the oil. The condensation of water into the oil may typically occur when the rotor system is in a non-operating state, as the temperature of the oil decreases relative to the temperature of the oil while the rotor system is in an operating state. In order to avoid the costs associated with reduced performance of the rotor system <b>400</b>, repairs, shut-downs, and/or reduced operating lifetimes of assets such as the gearbox <b>410</b>, an asset monitoring system <b>500</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>) is configured to provide real-time monitoring of the health of the lubricating oil in an asset, such as the gearbox <b>410</b>, and the asset itself.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a relationship between operating state of the rotor system <b>400</b> (also referred to as turbine or wind turbine) and a change in water concentration within the oil of the rotor system <b>400</b> over time. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> plots the state of the turbine and the state of moisture (e.g., water) in the oil along an axis <b>420</b> representing time in relative units. During a first time period between times <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>, the turbine is in an OFF or non-operating state. For example, in the non-operating state the rotors <b>404</b> and hub <b>402</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref> are not rotating, or alternatively are rotating but the gearbox <b>410</b> and/or generator <b>412</b> are mechanically or electrically disconnected from the hub <b>402</b> such that electrical energy is not produced from the rotation of the rotors <b>404</b> and hub <b>402</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, moisture accumulates in the oil between times <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> (where time is in relative units) while the turbine is in the OFF state. The moisture may accumulate due to condensation from the ambient environment while the temperature of the oil is relatively low. In the subsequent time period between times <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the turbine is in an ON or operating state, such that the rotors <b>404</b> and the hub <b>402</b> rotate and the generator <b>412</b> converts the mechanical rotational energy into electrical energy for storage and/or powering a load or a power grid. While the turbine is ON between times <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the moisture evaporates from the oil into the ambient environment due to the high temperature of the oil. The diagram in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> illustrates a general trend that a concentration of water in the oil of the gearbox <b>410</b> increases or accumulates while the turbine <b>400</b> is OFF and the concentration of water in the oil decreases via evaporation while the turbine <b>400</b> is ON. The rates of water accumulation and/or reduction may change over time based on various factors such as temperature of the oil, temperature and relative humidity of the ambient environment, existing concentration of water in the gearbox <b>410</b>, size and/or amount of leak paths in the gearbox <b>410</b>, and the like. For example, if the turbine <b>400</b> operates for a sufficient duration and at a sufficient temperature, most if not all of the water may evaporate from the oil such that the rate of moisture evaporation may effectively stop due to the lack of moisture in the oil, although the turbine <b>400</b> continues to operate in the ON state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236">Since water may accumulate in the oil while the turbine <b>400</b> is OFF and evaporates from the oil while the turbine <b>400</b> is ON, the concentration of water in oil while the turbine <b>400</b> is OFF may be greater than the concentration of water while the turbine <b>400</b> is ON. As a result, the corrosive effect of water in the gearbox <b>410</b> may be more severe during the periods of time that the turbine <b>400</b> is OFF relative to when the turbine <b>400</b> is ON and operating. For example, a greater concentration of water in the oil and/or a greater amount of time that the turbine <b>400</b> is OFF cause an increased amount of corrosion or degradation of the gearbox <b>410</b> relative to a reduced concentration of water in the oil and/or a reduced amount of time that the turbine <b>400</b> is OFF. Therefore, the health of the oil and/or the gearbox <b>410</b> may be preserved by reducing the amount of water that is introduced into the oil and/or reducing the amount of time that the turbine <b>400</b> is OFF, such as by operating the turbine <b>400</b> in the ON state for longer durations of time. The asset monitoring system <b>500</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>) is configured to continuously (e.g., at set time intervals) monitor the operating states of the turbine <b>400</b> and the concentration of one or more polar analytes, such as water, in the oil to determine the health of the oil and the gearbox <b>410</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">One or more technical effects of the asset monitoring system <b>500</b> is the ability to provide maintenance on an asset based on a health or condition of the asset, such that the maintenance is performed when necessary. The asset monitoring system <b>500</b> is configured to avoid problems associated with monitoring the asset only on a fixed schedule, such as every twelve months, every six months, or every three months. For example, such maintenance may require an operator manually accessing the gearbox to inspect the health of the oil and the gearbox. If the oil and gearbox are determined to be in good health during an inspection, the effort and cost of manually inspecting the gearbox are unnecessary. On the other hand, leaks can quickly cause damage to the gearbox and the oil therein, and the fixed maintenance schedule may not be able detect a poor health condition of the oil and/or the gearbox in time to prevent reduced performance of the rotor system and/or damage to the rotor system. The asset monitoring system <b>500</b> is configured to continuously monitor the health of the oil and/or the gearbox, such as by obtaining a measurement every second, every minute, every hour, every day, or any other predetermined time interval. By estimating the remaining operational life of the oil and/or gearbox, the asset monitoring system <b>500</b> allows an operator to plan for future maintenance, such as by ordering replacement parts and scheduling a maintenance appointment, before such maintenance is necessary. Furthermore, by taking an automatic responsive action upon detecting a poor health of the oil and/or gearbox (instead of waiting until regularly-scheduled maintenance), the asset monitoring system <b>500</b> is configured to reduce damage to the gearbox which extends the operational lifetime of the gearbox and/or other components of the rotor system. Therefore, the condition-based maintenance provided by the asset monitoring system <b>500</b> provides the ability to operate the wind turbine more reliably and to avoid costly shut-downs and repairs.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">Some of the sensors of the asset monitoring system <b>500</b> may be configured to monitor properties that are used to determine the operating state of the rotor system <b>400</b>. For example, the temperature sensor <b>510</b> in the oil <b>508</b>, the temperature sensor <b>512</b> on the gearbox <b>410</b>, and the vibration sensor <b>514</b> may be used by the sensor processor(s) <b>504</b> to monitor whether the rotor system <b>400</b> is in the ON (or operating) state or the OFF (or non-operating) state. Such sensors <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> are referred to herein as operating condition sensors, as the sensors <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> are used to detect when the rotor system <b>400</b> is in the operating state and when the rotor system <b>400</b> is in the non-operating state. For example, if the vibration sensor <b>514</b> detects that the gearbox <b>410</b> is vibrating at an amount, characterized as a frequency or intensity, that exceeds a corresponding vibration threshold, the one or more sensor processors <b>504</b> may determine that the rotor system <b>400</b> is in the operating state because operation of the rotor system <b>400</b> may cause vibration due to the moving components. Conversely, if the vibration sensor <b>514</b> detects that the vibration of the gearbox <b>410</b> is below the vibration threshold, then the rotor system <b>400</b> may be determined to be in the non-operating state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">In another example, if at least one of the temperature of the oil <b>508</b> or the temperature of the gearbox <b>410</b> exceeds a corresponding threshold temperature, the one or more sensor processors <b>504</b> may determine that the rotor system <b>400</b> is in the operating state because operation of the rotor system <b>400</b> generally heats the gearbox <b>410</b> and the oil <b>508</b> therein. Conversely, detection of the temperature of the oil <b>508</b> or the temperature of the gearbox <b>410</b> falling below the corresponding threshold temperature may indicate that the rotor system <b>400</b> is in the non-operating state because the gearbox <b>410</b> and the oil <b>508</b> therein may generally cool down responsive to the rotor system <b>400</b> shutting down. Optionally, the corresponding threshold temperatures may vary dependent on the temperature of the ambient environment as detected by the temperature sensor <b>516</b>. For example, the one or more sensor processors <b>504</b> may analyze the temperature difference between the ambient environment and the oil <b>508</b> and/or the gearbox <b>410</b>. For example, if the ambient environment is hotter than an average or median temperature, then the corresponding threshold temperature may be raised to account for the temperature change of the oil <b>508</b> and/or gearbox <b>410</b> attributable to the ambient environment.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">In other embodiments, additional or different sensors may be used to determine and monitor the operating state of the rotor system <b>400</b>, such as an optical sensor, an electromagnetic sensor, an angular rotation sensor, or the like. The asset monitoring system <b>500</b> may be configured to continuously monitor the operating state of the rotor system <b>400</b> over time to determine durations of time periods that the rotor system <b>400</b> is ON, durations of time periods that the rotor system <b>400</b> is OFF, the frequency at which the rotor system <b>400</b> switches operating states, and the like. In an embodiment, the asset monitoring system <b>500</b> includes a time counter <b>520</b> that is configured to keep a record of time.

Therefore, the information about the times, durations, and frequency that the rotor system <b>400</b> is in the OFF state may be used to determine the health of the oil <b>508</b> and the gearbox <b>410</b>, because the corrosion of the gearbox <b>410</b> due to water may be more severe when the rotor system <b>400</b> is in the OFF state due to the higher water concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref> is a plot <b>600</b> of a concentration of water in oil over time according to an embodiment.

The oil may be the oil <b>508</b> within the gearbox <b>410</b> of the rotor system <b>400</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>. In an embodiment, water is a polar analyte that is measured by the resonant sensor <b>502</b> and one or more sensor processors <b>504</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>. The resonant sensor <b>502</b> and the one or more processors <b>504</b> are configured to measure the concentration of water within the oil at multiple times during the operational life of the gearbox (e.g., by applying an electrical stimulus to the oil at different times and analyzing the resonant impedance spectral responses to the electrical stimuli). The resonant sensor <b>502</b> and the one or more processors <b>504</b> may measure the concentration of water within the oil periodically at a regular interval, such that the data obtained can be plotted as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, between times <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>, the concentration of water is at a negligible amount, such that no water or only a residual amount of water is present in the oil. The time period between times <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> may represent a time period that the rotor system is in the operating (e.g., ON) state. For example, while the rotor system operates, the temperature of the oil may be sufficiently high that water from the ambient environment does not condense into the oil and water previously within the oil evaporates, resulting in a negligible amount of water. Between times <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the concentration of water increases to a non-negligible amount. For example, the concentration of water increases and then generally levels off. The time period between times <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> may represent a time period that the rotor system is in the non-operating (e.g., OFF) state. For example, after the rotor system shuts down, the temperature in the oil may decrease towards the temperature of the ambient environment. As described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, when the temperature of the oil is sufficiently low, water from the ambient environment may accumulate in the oil due to condensation and other known factors, causing the illustrated increase in the concentration of water. The concentration of water may level off due to various factors, such as the humidity of the ambient environment, the temperature of ambient environment, the temperature of the oil, and properties of the oil such as water solubility of the oil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">Between times <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, the concentration of water in the oil decreases until the concentration of water is at a negligible amount from time <b>3</b> to time <b>4</b>. The time period between times <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> may represent another time period that the rotor system is operating. In an initial period between times <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, the concentration of water in the oil decreases, which may be attributable to an increased temperature of the oil as the rotor system warms up and operates. The time period between times <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> may include a warm-up period of the rotor system. For example, as the oil heats up, the temperature of the oil may exceed an evaporation threshold temperature, causing the water in the oil to evaporate into the ambient environment or the headspace of the gearbox. Between times <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, most if not all of the water in the oil at time <b>2</b> has evaporated. Between times <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, the concentration of water in the oil increases again due to the rotor system switching back to the non-operating state. The rotor system may switch to the non-operating state based on weather conditions, such that the rotor system may be switched OFF responsive to severe weather or a lack of wind. Optionally, the rotor system additionally or alternatively be switched OFF responsive to a lack of a need for electrical power, such as if an electrical grid does not need the rotor system to generate electrical power. Furthermore, the rotor system may be switched OFF due to maintenance or other scheduled tasks. At time <b>5</b>, the rotor system may be switched ON again, which causes the resulting decrease in the concentration of water shown in the plot <b>600</b> after time <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">A high concentration of water in the oil of the gearbox generally reduces the health of the gearbox and the oil relative to a negligible amount of water in the oil. For example, the water causes corrosion of the gearbox and also increases oxidation and breakdown of various components in the oil, such as stabilizing additives. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, the time periods in which the rotor system is OFF, such as between times <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and between times <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, have a higher concentration of water relative to the time periods that the rotor system is ON, such as between times <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, and after time <b>5</b>. Therefore, the health of the oil and the health of the gearbox deteriorate more, due to water in the oil, when the rotor system is OFF than when the rotor system is ON.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">In one or more embodiments, the one or more sensor processors <b>504</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>) are configured to calculate a degradation value for the gearbox based on the concentration of one or more polar analytes of interest in the oil as a function of time. The degradation value represents a level of asset degradation. The degradation value is inversely proportional to the health and remaining life of the asset, such as the gearbox and/or the oil within the gearbox. For example, a low degradation value may represent a relatively healthy oil and/or gearbox with a long remaining life, and a high degradation value represents a relatively unhealthy oil and/or gearbox with a short remaining life. The remaining life represents an estimated amount of time before the asset should be replaced or repaired to avoid causing poor performance of the rotor system and/or damage to other components of the rotor system. The degradation value typically increases over time as the asset ages and the quality or health of the asset decreases. Optionally, the one or more processors <b>504</b> may calculate a degradation value of the oil and a separate degradation value of the gearbox. For example, an oil change in the gearbox may trigger a reset of the degradation value of the oil without resetting the degradation value of the gearbox.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">The degradation value is calculated based on the concentration of the polar analyte in oil over time during the operating life of the asset. For example, in embodiments in which water is the polar analyte of interest, the degradation value may be calculated as the product of the water concentration and the duration of time. Since the concentration of water in the oil fluctuates over time due to condensation, evaporation, and the like, the degradation value may be calculated as the integral of the water concentration over time during the life of the asset. The integral is calculated to determine the area under the curve <b>606</b> shown in the plot <b>600</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>. Since the water concentration may be measured periodically by the resonant sensor, the one or more processors may integrate using the trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under the curve <b>606</b> using the periodic measurements of water concentration in the oil. The degradation value of an asset can only increase or stay the same over time, such that the degradation value of the asset at time <b>5</b> is greater than the degradation value of the same asset earlier in time, such as at time <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">The degradation value is proportional to the concentration of water, so the degradation value increases when there is a non-negligible water concentration, which usually occurs when the rotor system is non-operating and the temperature of the oil is relatively cool. Due to the trend between water concentration in oil and operating state of the rotor system, in an embodiment, the degradation value may be calculated based on the concentration of water in the oil during the time periods that the rotor system is in the non-operating state. For example, the degradation value may be calculated as the integral of the concentration of water between times <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and between times <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. The times that the rotor system switches between operating states, such as at time <b>1</b> and at time <b>2</b>, may be determined based on one or more of the operating condition sensors of the rotor system, such as the vibration sensor <b>514</b>, the temperature sensors <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, or the like. In an alternative embodiment, the one or more sensor processors <b>504</b> may calculate the degradation value of the asset based on the entire duration from times <b>0</b> to <b>6</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, such as by calculating the integral of the concentration of water over the entire time period from 0 to 6. By including the entire duration in the calculation, some intermediate time periods in which the rotor system is operating while water is still present in the oil, such as between times <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> and times <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, are accounted for in the calculation of the degradation value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">In another embodiment, the one or more sensor processors <b>504</b> may calculate the degradation value of the asset based on temperature of the oil as monitored by the temperature sensor <b>510</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>). For example, the degradation value may be calculated based on the concentration of water in oil measured during time periods that the temperature of the oil is less than an evaporation threshold temperature. The evaporation threshold temperature of water in the oil may be approximately 60 or 80 or 100 degrees Celsius, depending on the vapor pressure of the ambient environment. Such time periods in which the oil temperature is less than the evaporation threshold temperature may be associated with the time periods that the rotor system is non-operating, such as between times <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and between times <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. It is recognized that the time periods in which the oil temperature is less than the evaporation threshold temperature may be offset at least slightly from the time periods that the rotor system is non-operating due to warming up and cooling down of the oil. For example, after switching from the operating state to the non-operating state, there may be a lag period before the oil temperature cools to a temperature below the evaporation threshold temperature and water from condensation begins to accumulate in the oil. Similarly, after switching from the non-operating state to the operating state, there may be another lag period before the oil temperature exceeds the evaporation threshold temperature and the concentration of water in the oil begins to decrease due to evaporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">In one or more embodiments herein, the calculation of the degradation value for the oil and/or the gearbox may account for intermediate states or sub-states of the asset system, such as turbine start, turbine warm-up, turbine cool-down, and turbine stop. For example, the degradation value may be calculated as the concentration of the polar analyte in the oil during time periods in which the rotor system is non-operating and during time periods in which the rotor system is warming up, since significant water may remain in the oil as the rotor system warms up after switching into the operating state from the non-operating state. The intermediate states of the rotor system may be determined using the one or more operating condition sensors, such as a temperature sensor, a vibration sensor, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref> is a plot <b>650</b> of a concentration of acid in oil over time according to an embodiment. The y-axis <b>652</b> represents the concentration of acid in oil, which may be in parts per million or the like, and/or the total acid number (TAN) of the oil as an equivalent of mg KOH/g. The x-axis <b>654</b> represents time. The duration of the x-axis <b>654</b> from times <b>0</b> to <b>2</b> and beyond may be months or years. The time values <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref> are not representative of regular, uniform time intervals. Between times <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>, the concentration of acid in the oil slowly decreases, which may be due to depletion of stabilizing additives in the oil. The stabilizing additives may be or include acidic compounds, such that the acid concentration in the oil may decrease as the additives are depleted due to use of the oil in the gearbox. Between times <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the concentration of acid in the oil increases due to one or more factors, such as breaking down of the oil into acidic compounds, introduction of acidic contaminants, and the like. For example, the oil may break down more rapidly after time <b>1</b> due to the lack of stabilizing additives in the oil due to depletion. The concentration of acid in the oil may begin to level out after time <b>2</b>. A greater level of acid in the oil, particularly after the additives have depleted, can increase the amount of degradation of the oil and/or the gearbox. For example, the acid can cause corrosion of the gearbox and oxidation or other chemical reactions with different compounds in the oil, reducing the health of the gearbox and the oil. The detrimental effect of the acid in the oil is more severe at time <b>2</b> than at times <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> due to the greater concentration of acid in the oil at time <b>2</b> and the lack of stabilizing additives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">In an embodiment in which acid is the polar analyte of interest, the degradation value may be calculated as the product of the water concentration and the duration of time. Since the concentration of acid in the oil changes over time, the degradation value may be calculated as the integral of the acid concentration over time during the life of the asset. The integral is calculated to determine the area under the curve <b>656</b> between times <b>0</b> and <b>3</b> as shown in the plot <b>650</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">Optionally, the degradation value of the asset (e.g., the gearbox and/or the oil in the gearbox) may account for degradation due to both water and acid. For example, a first component of the degradation value may be based on the concentration of water over time and a second component of the degradation value may be based on the concentration of acid over time. The first and second components may be weighted differently (e.g., using respective constants) in order to factor in the relative effect that each polar analyte has on the degradation of the asset. For example, the water may have a more severe detrimental effect on the asset than the acid, so the first component of the degradation value attributable to the water may be weighted greater than the weight of the second component of the degradation value attributable to the acid. Alternatively, the second component of the degradation value attributable to the acid may be weighted greater than the first component attributable to the water or the two components may be weighted equally.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref> is a plot <b>700</b> of a remaining life of an asset over a degradation value of the asset according to an embodiment. The y-axis <b>702</b> represents the remaining life of the asset, as demarcated by percentage of the remaining life. The x-axis <b>704</b> represents the degradation value. The degradation value may have units such as ppm<sub>analyte</sub>, ppm<sub>analyte</sub>*hour, or ppm<sub>analyte</sub>/hour, or alternatively may be unitless. The x-axis <b>704</b> extends from 0 to a max degradation value. Although only three different values X, Y, and Z are marked on the x-axis <b>704</b> between 0 and the max degradation value, the x-axis <b>704</b> may have any number of values. The plot <b>700</b> includes a plot line <b>706</b> that shows the relationship between the remaining life of the asset and the degradation value. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>, the plot line <b>706</b> has a negative slope, which indicates that the remaining life of the asset is inversely proportional to the degradation value. For example, a new asset, such as fresh oil and/or a new gearbox, has 100% remaining life and a degradation value of 0. As the degradation value of the asset increases, the estimated remaining life of the asset decreases as shown by the plot line <b>706</b>. In an embodiment, one or more processors (e.g., the one or more sensor processors <b>504</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>) may generate the function (e.g., slope) of the plot line <b>706</b> based on historical data that compares calculated degradation values to monitored amounts of time remaining in a life of a similar asset. For example, the plot line <b>706</b> may represent a transfer function that associates calculated degradation values to corresponding percentages of remaining life of the asset based on historical data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">In an embodiment, after calculating the degradation value of an asset, the one or more processors may be configured to estimate the remaining amount of time in the operational life of the asset by plugging the degradation value into the function represented by the plot line <b>706</b> to yield an estimated remaining life of the asset. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>, a degradation value of X for the gearbox translates to an estimated 80% of the life of the gearbox remaining. In another example, a greater degradation value of Y translated to an estimated 33% of the life of the gearbox remaining. During use of the asset, the degradation value gradually increases, moving along the x-axis <b>704</b> from 0 towards the max degradation value. The rate at which the degradation value increases (e.g., moves along the x-axis <b>704</b>) is based on factors such as the concentration of the one or more polar analytes in the oil and the length of time that the one or more polar analytes are present in the oil. For example, a first oil with a greater concentration of water and a greater amount of time that the water is in the oil would predictably degrade faster (e.g., reaching the max degradation value quicker) than a second oil having a lower concentration of water and a reduced amount of time that the water is present in the oil. Providing an estimate of the remaining life of an asset, such as a gearbox or oil within the gearbox, allows for planning maintenance in advance. Therefore, the maintenance is performed when desirable or necessary, instead of performing the maintenance before necessary (which may be wasteful) or after the maintenance is necessary (which may be harmful to performance or other components of the rotor system). The one or more processors may convey the estimated remaining life of the asset to an operator, such as via transmitting a message containing the estimated remaining life to a computer, workstation, or personal handheld device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">In one or more embodiments, the one or more processors may monitor the degradation value of an asset relative to one or more designated degradation thresholds. The one or more degradation thresholds may be selected based on historical data of the similar assets. The degradation thresholds may be stored in memory of the one or more processors. The degradation thresholds are designed to trigger the one or more processors to take remedial actions to prevent reduced performance of the rotor system, extended shut-downs, and/or damage to the rotor system. Therefore, responsive to the degradation value of an asset exceeding a designated degradation threshold, the one or more processors are configured to automatically take a specified remedial action. For example, the processors may schedule maintenance for the rotor system, such as to change the oil in the gearbox, repair the gearbox, or replace the gearbox or a part thereof. The processors may be communicatively coupled to a computer, server, or operating system that schedules maintenance for the asset.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">Additionally, or alternatively, the remedial action of the processors may be to provide an alert for an operator to schedule or perform maintenance for the rotor system. For example, the processors may trigger a message that is displayed to the operation via a workstation display screen or a handheld device display screen (e.g., a cell phone, tablet, wearable device, or the like). The alert for the operator may include visual text and/or graphics on a display, audible sounds or speaking via a speaker, and/or vibrations. Additionally, or alternatively, the remedial action may be to prohibit additional operation of the rotor system until maintenance is performed on the rotor system. The prohibition of operation of the rotor system may include the processors controlling the rotor system in the operating state to shut down and/or preventing the rotor system in the non-operating state from switching to the operating state. The rotor system may be prohibited from operating to protect the other components of the rotor system from possible damage due to the degraded oil and/or gearbox. For example, the rotor system is prohibited from operating to prevent a corroded gearbox from breaking down and damaging the generator, the hub connected to the rotors, or other components of the rotor system. The one or more processors may prevent the rotor system from operating by transmitting a message to a controller device of the rotor system and/or by triggering a switch that deactivates the operation of the rotor system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">Optionally, the one or more processors may monitor the degradation value of an asset relative to multiple degradation thresholds. For example, a first degradation threshold <b>708</b> may be the degradation value Y shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>, and a second degradation threshold <b>710</b> may be the degradation value Z, which is greater than the value Y. The first degradation threshold <b>708</b> is at 33% of the remaining life of the asset, and the second threshold <b>710</b> is at 20% of the remaining life of the asset. Responsive to the degradation value exceeding the first degradation threshold <b>708</b>, the processors may be configured to schedule replacement of the oil within the gearbox and/or provide an alert to schedule replacement of the oil within the gearbox. Replacing the oil in the gearbox may reduce the rate at which the gearbox degrades due to the reduced corrosive contaminants in the healthy oil. In an embodiment, responsive to the degradation value exceeding the second degradation threshold <b>710</b>, the processors may be configured to schedule servicing of the gearbox (e.g., repair or replacement of the gearbox) and/or provide an alert to schedule servicing of the gearbox. Although not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>, a third degradation threshold greater than the value Z may be associated with 10%, 5%, 2%, or 1% of the remaining life of the asset. Upon exceeding the third degradation threshold, the one or more processors may be configured to prevent additional operation of the rotor system until after maintenance is performed on the rotor system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0267"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>720</b> for monitoring an asset in a rotor system according to an embodiment. The asset may be a gearbox of the rotor system, oil within the gearbox, or another component or fluid of the rotor system. In the illustrated embodiment, the asset is the gearbox. At <b>722</b>, a concentration of a polar analyte in the oil of the gearbox is measured. The polar analyte may be at least one of water or acid (e.g., an acidic component within the oil). The concentration may be measured by a multivariable resonant sensor and one or more processors, such as the multivariable resonant sensor <b>502</b> and the one or more processors <b>504</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>. A measurement of the concentration may be obtained at different times during the operational life of the asset, such as periodically at a regular interval of one measurement every thirty seconds, every one minute, every two minutes, or the like. For each measurement, the multivariable resonant sensor generates an electrical stimulus having multiple different frequencies that is applied to the oil in contact with the multivariable resonant sensor, and an electrical signal representative of a resonant impedance spectral response to the electrical stimulus is conveyed to the one or more processors. The one or more processors analyze the impedance response and extract or calculate resonant parameters from the impedance response to determine the concentration of the polar analyte in the oil at the time that the electrical stimulus is applied to the oil. At <b>724</b>, the time is monitored, such as via the time counter <b>520</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>. Therefore, the measured concentrations of the polar analyte can be associated with time to track the concentration of the polar analyte over time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">Steps <b>726</b> and <b>728</b> are optional, such that the method <b>720</b> may be performed without either of steps <b>726</b> or <b>728</b>, with both steps <b>726</b> and <b>728</b>, or with only one of the steps <b>726</b> and <b>728</b>. At <b>726</b>, the operating state of the rotor system is detected, such as whether the rotor system is in an operating state or a non-operating state. In the case of a wind turbine, the wind turbine operates when the hub and rotors rotate and the generator generates electrical energy from the mechanical rotation of the hub and rotors. The operating state of the rotor system may be detected via an operating condition sensor, such as a vibration sensor mounted to the rotor system, an optical sensor that monitors the rotation of the hub and/or rotors, or an electromagnetic sensor that detects the flow of current from the generator. At least some of the measurements of the concentration of the polar analyte in the oil may be obtained while the rotor system is in the non-operating state. At <b>728</b>, the temperature of the oil within the gearbox is monitored, such as via a temperature sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">At <b>730</b>, a degradation value for the asset is calculated based on the concentration of the polar analyte in the oil as a function of time. The degradation value may be calculated by one or more processors, such as the one or more sensor processors <b>504</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>. The degradation value may be calculated based on the concentration of the polar analyte, and how the concentration changes, over time during the operating life of the asset. For example, the degradation value may be calculated as an integral of the concentration of the polar analyte in the oil over a time period that the concentration measurements are obtained. Optionally, if the polar analyte is water, the degradation value for the asset is calculated, at least in part, based on measurements of the concentration of water in the oil that are obtained during time periods that the rotor system is non-operating as determined in step <b>726</b>. The detrimental effect of water in the oil may be more significant in the non-operating state relative to the operating state because water can accumulate in the oil due to condensation when the rotor system is not operating. Optionally, the degradation value may be calculated based, at least in part, on measurements of the concentration of the polar analyte in the oil that are obtained during time periods that the temperature of the oil is less than an evaporation threshold temperature as determined in step <b>728</b>. For example, the detrimental effect of the polar analyte in the oil may be more significant when the temperature of the oil is below the evaporation threshold temperature because the polar analyte may be present. At a higher temperature of the oil above the evaporation threshold temperature, the polar analyte may evaporate from the oil, reducing the concentration of the analyte as well as the associated harmful effects of the analyte.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0270">At <b>732</b>, a remaining amount of time in the operational life of the asset is estimated based on the degradation value for the asset.

The estimated remaining life of the asset may be conveyed to an operator and/or to a remote control facility and used for planning future maintenance or other service for the rotor system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0271">At <b>734</b>, a determination is made whether the degradation value exceeds a designated degradation threshold. The one or more processors may determine whether one or more set degradation thresholds are exceeded.

For example, the remedial action may include scheduling maintenance for the rotor system (e.g., such as to replace the oil within the gearbox or replace the gearbox or a component thereof), providing an alert to schedule maintenance for the rotor system, and/or prohibiting operation of the rotor system until maintenance is performed on the rotor system. If, on the other hand, the degradation value does not exceed a designated degradation threshold, flow may return to step <b>722</b> for additional monitoring of the polar analyte concentration in the oil.</div>

Water in the form of emulsion was added to the oil sump prior to the engine start. The homogenizer was used to emulsify water with the CT7 engine oil. An Agilent E5062A network analyzer was used to acquire the sensor response. Reference measurements of water content in oil were done using near-infrared spectroscopy. The near-infrared measurements of water content in a CT7 helicopter engine oil were carried out using a Cary 500i UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.) using quartz cuvettes with a 1-cm pathlength. Initially, oil samples with known amounts of water were measured to establish the relationship between near-infrared absorbance and water content. Next, samples were taken between the runs of the CT7 helicopter engine and analyzed with near-infrared spectroscopy for the presence of residual water. The resonant sensor responses to different concentrations of water in oil were obtained by adding water concentrations of 1000, 3000, and 5000 ppm and observing the dynamic response patterns of the resonant sensor.

As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85A</figref>, Sensor I responded with a good signal-to-noise ratio to water additions being able to resolve well all steps of water additions. Sensor II, with its capacitor with air-humidity sensing film, also responded with a good signal-to-noise ratio to water additions being able to resolve well all steps of water additions, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85B</figref>. The impedance response of Sensor II at four frequencies did not produce significant response to water additions, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85C</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0288">In a fourth experiment, decanoic acid and water were added to generate nine levels of combination TAN and water concentrations. The nine levels include level 1 (0 mg KOH/g and 0 ppm), level 2 (0 mg KOH/g and 28 ppm), level 3 (0 mg KOH/g and 56 ppm), level 4 (3.9 mg KOH/g and 0 ppm), level 5 (3.9 mg KOH/g and 28 ppm), level 6 (3.9 mg KOH/g and 56 ppm), level 7 (7.6 mg KOH/g and 0 ppm), level 8 (7.6 mg KOH/g and 28 ppm), and level 9 (7.6 mg KOH/g and 56 ppm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0289">To discriminate between TAN and water, at least two partially independent responses (e.g., outputs) from a sensor may be required, where both responses have an adequate signal-to-noise ratio. In the fourth experiment, Sensor I had only one output from its capacitor with air-humidity sensing film and did not have capability to respond to TAN. Thus, Sensor I was unable to discriminate between TAN and water. Sensor II had only one output from its capacitor with air-humidity sensing film and four frequencies of impedance response. Sensor II responded to water but did not respond to TAN. Thus, Sensor II was also unable to discriminate between TAN and water. Sensor III had only one output from its dielectric readout that responded to water and TAN. Thus, Sensor III was unable to discriminate between TAN and water. The multivariable resonant sensor (Sensor IV) has several outputs, as described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, that respond differently to water and TAN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0290"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 87A-B</figref> plot an effect of molecularly dissolved water and TAN in wind turbine gearbox oil on Fp and Zp parameter sensor responses, respectively. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 87A-B</figref> depict responses Fp and Zp of the multivariable resonant Sensor IV when Sensor IV was exposed to six levels of TAN and nine levels of molecularly dissolved water. The six levels of TAN were 1.3, 2.6, 3.9, 5.1, 6.4, and 7.6 mgKOH/g. The nine levels of molecularly dissolved water were 28, 56, 83, 111, 139, 167, 194, 222, and 250 ppm. The effect of water was clearly visible in the Fp response shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87A</figref> and the Zp response shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87B</figref>, based on the slopes of the response curves as a function of different water concentrations. The effect of TAN was also clearly visible in the Fp response shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87A</figref> and negligible in the Zp response shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87B</figref> (due to the reduced slope of the Zp response as a function of different TAN concentrations). This difference in response sensitivities of Fp and Zp to TAN allows the Sensor IV to discriminate between TAN and water. TAN and water was quantitatively discriminated using Sensor IV by multivariate processing of the sensor responses (e.g., described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) using a multivariate transfer function. For each of the steps of TAN and water, three data points were used in the regions of the steady-state response of the sensor.</div>
