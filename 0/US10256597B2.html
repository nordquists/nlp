<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Regenerative amplifiers utilizing chirped pulse amplification (CPA) have been the dominant means for obtaining pulse energies greater than a microjoule with pulse durations in the femtosecond to picosecond range. Microjoule to millijoule pulse energies with pulse durations below 10 picoseconds have been found to be particularly useful for micromachining and for medical applications such as Lasik. However, a big stumbling block in the utilization of ultrafast sources for these applications has been that the regenerative amplifier is more of a piece of laboratory equipment and not conducive to the industrial setting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Alternative sources for microjoule level, ultrafast pulses are emerging; utilizing all fiber chirped pulse amplification designs. Such systems are inherently more stable since they are based on technology similar to that utilized in Telecomm systems. During the past decade, there has been intensive work and success in making such systems practical. However, for higher pulse energies in the millijoule range, regenerative amplifiers will continue to dominate for some time since pulse energies above a millijoule have not been demonstrated in an all fiber system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">For micromachining applications, more industrially compatible regenerative amplifiers are now being developed based on Nd: or Yb: doped materials, rather than the Ti:sapphire that has dominated the scientific market. There are two basic reasons for this change. Commercial markets typically do not require the shorter pulses that can only be obtained from the Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier, and the Nd: and Yb: based materials can be directly diode pumped, which makes these systems more robust and less expensive. An unresolved technical issue for Nd: or Yb: based regenerative amplifiers is the need for an equally robust seed source for femtosecond or picosecond pulses. The present seed lasers are mode-locked solid-state lasers with questionable reliability. It would be preferable to have a robust fiber seed source similar to that which has been developed for the Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier, and used where Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifiers are applied to more commercial applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In a copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/960,923, filed which is assigned to the common assignee and the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety, the design changes needed for a mode-locked Yb:doped fiber oscillator and amplifier to be utilized as a seed source for a Yb: or Nd: based solid-state regenerative amplifier are described. The purpose of this application is to modify and apply many of the improvements in all fiber chirped pulse amplification systems for application to the seed source of a regenerative amplifier.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The purpose of this invention is to incorporate the many recent improvements in femtosecond mode-locked fiber lasers and femtosecond fiber chirped pulse amplification systems to regenerative amplifier systems that incorporate femtosecond or picosecond pulse sources based on fiber seed-sources and/or fiber amplifiers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Yb: and Nd: mode-locked oscillators with fiber amplifiers can be utilized as sources of ultrafast pulses for regenerative amplifiers in order to obtain higher pulse energies than can be realized at this time from all fiber short pulse systems. A8827 (incorporated by reference herein) describes specifically how the sources can be configured to be implemented in such fiber based seed sources for solid state regenerative amplifiers. The femtosecond source and fiber amplifier need to be carefully configured in order to obtain optimum, reliable performance when incorporated into such a system. Recently there have been many improvements in mode-locked fiber sources implemented with fiber amplifiers in chirped pulse amplifier systems that can be utilized in a regenerative amplifier system that typically is based on chirped pulse amplification. Applicable improvements to fiber mode-locked sources are disclosed in Ser. Nos. 09/576,772, 09/809,248, 10/627,069, 10/814,502 and 10/814,319 (all incorporated by reference herein). Alternative suitable femtosecond sources that utilize fiber amplification for pulse conditioning and shortening are described in Ser. No. 10/437,057. One of the difficulties with chirped pulse amplification systems has been in producing reliable and compact pulse stretchers that can be dispersion matched to pulse compressors suitable for high pulse energies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Significant improvements for dispersion matched fiber stretchers for fiber based chirped pulse amplification are disclosed in 10/992,762, filed Nov. 22, 2004 (incorporated by reference herein). These improvements are also applicable to chirped pulse amplification systems even when solid state bulk mode-locked lasers are utilized as the seed source. Significant improvements have been made in packaging, electronic controls, fabrication processes and optical parameter controls in order to make fiber based femtosecond sources reliable. These engineering improvements can also be utilized in these regenerative amplifier systems and are disclosed in Ser. Nos. 10/606,829, 10/813,163, 10/813,173 and 11/024,948(all incorporated by reference herein).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Previously, Yb: and Nd: mode-locked oscillators and fiber amplifiers have been utilized as pulse sources for narrow bandwidth, bulk, solid-state amplifiers including regenerative amplifiers that can produce pulses 20 picoseconds or greater. In general, the configuration solutions for these longer pulse sources as described, for example in Ser. No. 10/927,374 (incorporated by reference herein) are different than those described here for sub-picosecond systems. However, the engineering improvements described here will also be applicable for the longer pulse systems, and the bulk amplifier operated as a regenerative amplifier has increased flexibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The first important element for a short pulse regenerative amplifier system is the source of short pulses. Femtosecond mode-locked fiber lasers are a good source of such pulses. Typically the fiber oscillator is low power and needs additional amplification for application as a seed source. Other important needs are pulse compression, wavelength flexibility, dispersion control and fiber delivery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to introduce a modular, compact, widely-tunable, high peak and high average power, low noise ultrafast fiber amplification laser system suitable for a seed source for a regenerative amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a further object of the invention to ensure modularity of the system by employing a variety of easily interchangeable optical systems, such as 1) short pulse seed sources, 2) wide bandwidth fiber amplifiers, 3) dispersive pulse stretching elements, 4) dispersive pulse compression elements, 5) nonlinear frequency conversion elements and 6) optical components for fiber delivery. In addition, any of the suggested modules can be comprised of a subset of interchangeable optical systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a further object of the invention to ensure system compactness by employing efficient fiber amplifiers, directly or indirectly pumped by diode lasers as well as highly integrated dispersive delay lines. The high peak power capability of the fiber amplifiers is greatly expanded by using parabolic or other optimized pulse shapes. In conjunction with self-phase modulation, parabolic pulses allow for the generation of large-bandwidth high-peak power pulses, as well as for well-controlled dispersive pulse stretching. High power parabolic pulses are generated in high-gain single or multi-mode fiber amplifiers operating at wavelengths where the fiber material dispersion is positive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Parabolic pulses can be delivered or transmitted along substantial fiber lengths even in the presence of self-phase modulation or general Kerr-effect type optical nonlinearities, while incurring only a substantially linear pulse chirp. At the end of such fiber delivery or fiber transmission lines, the pulses can be compressed to approximately their bandwidth limit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, the high energy capability of fiber amplifiers is greatly expanded by using chirped pulse amplification in conjunction with parabolic pulses or other optimized pulse shapes, which allow the toleration of large amounts of self-phase modulation without a degradation of pulse quality. Highly integrated chirped pulse amplification systems are constructed without compromising the high-energy capabilities of optical fibers by using fiber-based pulse stretchers in conjunction with bulk-optic pulse compressors (or low nonlinearity Bragg gratings) or periodically poled nonlinear crystals, which combine pulse compression with frequency-conversion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The dispersion in the fiber pulse stretcher and bulk optic compressor is matched to quartic order in phase by implementing fiber pulse stretchers with adjustable 2nd, 3rd and 4th order dispersion. Adjustable higher-order dispersion can be obtained by using high numerical aperture single-mode fibers with optimized refractive index profiles by itself or by using standard step-index high numerical aperture fibers in conjunction with linearly chirped fiber gratings. Alternatively, higher-order dispersion can be controlled by using the dispersive properties of the higher-order mode in a high numerical aperture few-moded fiber, by using nonlinearly chirped fiber gratings or by using linearly chirped fiber gratings in conjunction with transmissive fiber gratings. Adjustable 4th order dispersion can be obtained by controlling the chirp in fiber Bragg gratings, transmissive fiber gratings and by using fibers with different ratios of 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd </sup>and 4<sup>th </sup>order dispersion. Equally, higher-order dispersion control can be obtained by using periodically poled nonlinear crystals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The fiber amplifiers are seeded by short pulse laser sources, preferably in the form of short pulse fiber sources. For the case of Yb fiber amplifiers, Raman-shifted and frequency doubled short pulse Er fiber laser sources can be implemented as widely tunable seed sources. To minimize the noise of frequency conversion from the 1.5 μm to the 1.0 μm regime, self-limiting Raman-shifting of the Er fiber laser pulse source can be used. Alternatively, the noise of the nonlinear frequency conversion process can be minimized by implementing self-limiting frequency-doubling, where the center wavelength of the tuning curve of the doubling crystal is shorter than the center wavelength of the Raman-shifted pulses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The process of Raman-shifting and frequency-doubling can also be inverted, where an Er fiber laser is first frequency-doubled and subsequently Raman-shifted in an optimized fiber providing soliton-supporting dispersion for wavelengths around 800 nm and higher to produce a seed source for the 1 μm wavelength regime.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">As an alternative low-complexity seed source for an Yb amplifier, a modelocked Yb fiber laser can be used. The fiber laser can be designed to produce strongly chirped pulses and an optical filter can be incorporated to select near bandwidth-limited seed pulses for the Yb amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Presently the mode-locked Yb: doped fiber laser is the preferred oscillator. The preferred source is described Ser. No. 10/627,069 (incorporated herein).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention is similarly directed to a mass-producible passively modelocked fiber laser. By incorporating apodized fiber Bragg gratings, integrated fiber polarizers and concatenated sections of polarization-maintaining and non-polarization-maintaining fibers, a fiber pig-tailed, linearly polarized output can be readily obtained from the laser. By further matching the dispersion value of the fiber Bragg grating to the inverse, or negative, of the dispersion of the intra-cavity fiber, the generation of optimally short pulses with a large optical bandwidth can be induced. In this regard, either positive dispersion in conjunction with negative dispersion fiber gratings or negative dispersion in conjunction with positive dispersion fiber gratings can be implemented. Preferably, the dispersion characteristics of the fiber Bragg grating and the dispersion characteristics of the rest of the intra-cavity elements are matched to within a factor of three. Even more preferably, these characteristics are matched within a factor of two, or within a factor in the range of 1.0 to 2.0. Also preferably, the Bragg grating has a chirp rate greater than 80 nm/cm. More preferably, the Bragg grating has a chirp rate greater than 160 nm/cm. Most preferably, the Bragg grating has a chirp rater greater than 300 nm/cm. To maximize the output power and the pulse repetition rate, the use of wide-bandwidth fiber Bragg gratings with low absolute dispersion is preferable. These fiber Bragg gratings are also used as end-mirrors for the cavity and allow the transmission of pump light to the intra-cavity gain fiber. The fiber Bragg gratings are conveniently produced using phase masks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively, fiber couplers can be used inside the fiber cavity. Generally, sections of polarization-maintaining and non-polarization-maintaining fiber can be concatenated inside the fiber cavity. The non-polarization-maintaining section should then be short enough so as not to excessively perturb the polarization state. Intra-cavity sections of non-polarization-maintaining fiber preferably comprise all-fiber polarizers to lead to preferential oscillation of one linear polarization state inside the cavity. Similarly, when directly concatenating polarization-maintaining fiber sections, the length of the individual section should be long enough to prevent coherent interactions of pulses propagating along the two polarization axes of the polarization-maintaining fibers, thereby ensuring a maximum in pulse stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Saturable absorber mirrors (SAMs) placed inside the cavity enable passive modelocking. The saturable absorbers (SA) can be made from multiple quantum wells (MQW) or bulk semiconductor films. These saturable absorbers have preferably a bi-temporal life-time with a slow component (&gt;&gt;100 ps) and a fast component (&lt;&lt;20 ps). The realization of the bi-temporal dynamics of the optical nonlinearity is achieved by tailoring the depth profile of the ion-implantation in combination with the implantation dose and energy. The result is that the carriers trap at distinctively different rates in different depth regions of the SAM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Saturating semiconductor films can for example be grown from aluminum-containing material such as AlGaInAs, the exact composition can be selected depending on the sought band-gap (typically selected to be in the vicinity of the desired operating wavelength of the laser system) and it is also governed by the requirement of lattice-match between the saturating semiconductor film and an underlying Bragg mirror or any other adjacent semiconductor material. Compositional requirements enabling lattice match between semiconductors and/or a certain band gap are well known in the state of the art and are not further explained here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In aluminum containing semiconductors the surface area can induce a low optical damage threshold triggered by oxidization of the surface. In order to prevent optical damage of aluminum containing surface areas a passivation layer, e.g., InP, InGaAs or GaAs, is incorporated. SA degradation is further minimized by optimizing the optical beam diameter that impinges on the SAM. In one implementation the SAM and an intra-cavity fiber end can be either butt-coupled or brought into close contact to induce modelocking. Here, the incorporation of a precision AR-coating on the intra-cavity fiber end minimizes any bandwidth restrictions from etalon formation between the SAM and the fiber end. Etalons can also be minimized by appropriate wedging of the fiber ends. The beam diameter inside the SAM can be adjusted by implementing fiber ends with thermally expanded cores. Alternatively, focusing lenses can be directly fused to the fiber end. Moreover, graded-index lenses can be used for optimization of the focal size and working distance between the fiber tip and SA surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Wavelength tuning of the fiber lasers can be obtained by heating, compression or stretching of fiber Bragg gratings or by the incorporation of bulk optic tuning elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The use of bi-or multi-temporal saturable absorbers allows the design of dispersion compensated fiber laser operating in a single-polarization state, producing pulses at the bandwidth limit of the fiber gain medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Further improvement of the femtosecond Yb doped fiber oscillator can include an integral mass produced master oscillator, power amplifier design (MOPA) which is describe in Ser. No. 10/814,502 (incorporated by reference herein).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">One embodiment of the present invention comprises a master oscillator power amplifier comprising a mode-locked fiber oscillator and a fiber amplifier.

In this method, optical energy is propagated back and forth through a gain fiber by reflecting light from a pair of reflective elements on opposite ends of the gain fiber. Less than about 60% of the light in the gain fiber is reflected back into the gain fiber by one of the reflectors. The pair of reflective elements together form a resonant cavity that supports a plurality of resonant optical modes. The resonant optical modes are substantially mode-locking to produce a train of pulses. The train of optical pulses is propagated from the laser cavity through one of the reflectors to a fiber amplifier along a bi-directional optical path from the laser cavity to the fiber amplifier where the laser pulses are amplified.</div>

A first portion of the spontaneous emission enters the laser cavity.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">However, for most embodiments for a source for a regenerative amplifier the pulses need to be conditioned before amplification. Ser.

Other sources can also be utilized such a laser-diodes or microchip lasers. In Ser. No. 10/437,057 (incorporated by reference herein), it is disclosed how to modify these sources to give higher energy and shorter pulses through amplification and pulse compression in fiber amplifiers. An advantage of these sources that is mentioned in Ser. No. 10/437,057 is the repetition rate can be variable. It is a true advantage to match the repetition rate of the source to that of the regenerative amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, one object of this invention is to convert relatively long pulses from rep-rate variable ultrafast optical sources to shorter, high-energy pulses suitable for seed sources in high-energy ultrafast lasers including a regenerative amplifier. Another object of this invention is to take advantage of the need for higher pulse energies at lower repetition rates so that such sources can be cost effective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">A gain switched laser diode as is used in telecom systems can be used as the initial source of pulses. In this case, the diode is operated at a much lower repetition rate. The pulses are still amplified in fiber amplifiers. Fiber amplifiers can be used as constant output power devices. The upper-state lifetime in typical doped amplifier fibers such as Ytterbium and Erbium is in the millisecond range so that these amplifiers can amplify pulse trains with the same efficiency at repetition rates from 10's of kHz to 100's of GHz and beyond. If the amplifier is amplifying pulses at 10 kHz rather than at 10 GHz at constant power, then the pulse energy will be six orders of magnitude higher. Again, with such high peak powers, pulse compression methods need to be different and unique. One first embodiment uses conventional compression by spectral broadening the pulses in an optical fiber with positive group velocity dispersion (GVD) and then compressing the pulse with diffraction gratings. The object of the pulse compression is to convert the 3-25 picosecond pulses from the gain switched laser diode to pulses that are subpicosecond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Another source starts with pulses from a low cost Q-switched microchip laser. These lasers give pulses as short as 50 picoseconds but typically 250 picoseconds to 1.0 nanosecond. The pulse peak powers are typically 1-10 kW with pulse energies 6 orders of magnitude higher than from telecom laser diodes. Microchip lasers could be a very cost effective source for pulses less than 10 picoseconds with suitable pulse compression methods. Single mode fiber compression has thus far been limited to pulses shorter than 150 ps and peak powers less than 1 kW. Before compression the pulse can be further amplified in a regenerative amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Once a suitable femtosecond source has been identified further improvements have been made in the incorporation of these lasers in chirped pulse amplification systems where the amplifier has been a fiber amplifier. In Ser. No. 10/813,163, many improvements to the fiber chirped pulse amplification (FCPA) configuration have been made for a configuration that is more robust and suitable to an industrial environment. Here it has been realized that these improvements can be also utilized for fiber lasers seeding solid state amplifiers and particular solid state regenerative amplifiers. Specifically, the improvements for the FCPA configuration that are disclosed in Ser. No. 10/813,163 can be utilized in a regenerative amplifier seeded with a fiber laser configuration. The simplest embodiments are for the replacement of the power amplifier in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 11</figref> of this application with a regenerative amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The following topics that are covered in Ser. No. 10/813,163 are relevant to this configuration.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0052">1) Functional segmentation of opto-mechanical components into modular devices to produce manufacturable industrial laser systems with Telcordia-grade quality and reliability.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0053">2) Polarization fidelity within and between modules</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0054">3) Provision for tap units for test, monitoring or feedback</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0055">4) Spectral matching of oscillator to amplifier</li> <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0056">5) Selection of the length of an amplifier to cut ASE at the lasing wavelength</li> <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0057">6) Active stabilization of the optical performance of gain fiber in a laser or amplifier. The stabilization is realized by actively adjusting the pump source wavelength by changing the source temperature in order to match pump wavelength with the absorption spectrum of the gain medium. The temperature dependent spectrum in the gain fiber is cloned in the same type of fiber, and thus used as a monitor. Accurate control of the gain performance over a wide range of operating temperatures is possible implementing this method.</li> <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0058">7) Extraction of one or more chirped pulses from a series of such pulses using an acousto-optic deflector, and compensation for detrimental effects on the spatial characteristics of the extracted chirped pulse, caused by dispersion in that deflector.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0059">The invention thus relates to the technologies necessary to overcome the above problems and limitations of the prior art, to build a hybrid fiber and solid-state based chirped pulse amplification laser system suitable for industrial applications, with the fiber in a modular and compact laser design with all modules replaceable. The modules are designed and manufactured to telecom standards and quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0060">Environmentally stable laser design is crucial for industrial application. An industrial laser system can be, for example, characterized by an output power variation below 0.5 dB over an environmental temperature range from 0 to 50 degrees Celsius, and by compliance with the vibration, thermal shock, high temperature storage and thermal cycling test criteria in Telcordia GR-468-CORE and GR-1221-CORE. This target can be achieved by functional segmentation of the components and packaging the modular device with Telcordia-qualified packaging technology. Before the modules are assembled into a system, they are tested and assembled separately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0061">Included in the modules are tap units that allow taking out signals along the propagation path in an integrated design. This is necessary for the optimization of each module as it is assembled, and important in the spectral matching along the chain of modules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0062">Polarization units are provided to prevent the buildup of side-pulses from orthogonal polarization light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0063">The acousto-optical down counter module can be designed to operate as a bandwidth filter. For further modulation of the signal an additional pulse extractor can be included near the end of the output. This unit suffers from dispersion due to the large bandwidth of the pulse. The compressor can be used to correct for this dispersion as disclosed hereafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0064">The invention also relates to a means to extract one or more chirped pulses from a series of such pulses using an acousto-optic deflector, and to compensate for the detrimental effects on the spatial characteristics of the extracted chirped pulse caused by dispersion in that deflector. An important aspect of this system is to manage the spectrum of the pulse in the system while maintaining the ability to correct for dispersion and compress the pulse back to the femtosecond regime. Two principal embodiments of this type will be described. The first is the case where the spectral content of the seed pulse is small. In this case a nonlinear amplifier may be employed for the generation of additional spectrum while spectral filtering is employed to obtain a compressible pulse. The second case is where the spectrum from the source is larger than necessary. Nonlinear affects can be limited in the amplifier chain in this case, while spectral filtering is again employed to obtain a compressible pulse. An additional attribute that is necessary for many applications is the reduction of the ASE at the output. Specific amplifier designs are used to cut the ASE at the output wavelength. The compressor can be used as an optical spectral filter to this end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0065">Once gain performance is attained, a method for active stabilization of the optical performance of the gain fiber in a laser or amplifier is disclosed to maintain this performance. The present invention stabilizes the temperature dependent absorption of a gain fiber over a wide environmental temperature variation by an active feedback loop. A piece of fiber, optically identical with the gain fiber itself, is used as a spectral filter for monitoring the emission spectrum of the pump diode. The absorption spectrum of the filter fiber follows that of the gain fiber if both fibers are packaged so that the fibers are in proximity to each other. The transmission of the pump light through the filter fiber clones exactly the absorption characteristics of the gain fiber at a given package temperature. The temperature of the pump diode is controlled by a feedback loop such that the transmission through the filter fiber is maintained at the minimum. Importantly, the filter fiber functions as an active temperature sensor of the gain fiber. Precise spectral control of the gain at any fiber or package temperature can thus be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0066">As mentioned above, an important field of use for this system is in micromachining. An additional feature needed for this application field is the capability to start and stop the pulse stream while moving the targeted material in place. One method to do this is to control the down counter. However, this leads to problems with gain stabilization in the amplifier and excessive ASE on target. These problems have been addressed in Ser. No. 10/813,173 “Method and Apparatus for Controlling and Protecting Pulsed High Power Fiber Amplifier Systems” (incorporated by reference herein). However, another means to stop the pulse stream is to utilize an optical switch at the output.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0067">The invention extracts one or more chirped pulses from a series of such pulses using an acousto-optic deflector, and compensates for the detrimental effects on the spatial characteristics of the extracted chirped pulse caused by dispersion in that deflector. The instant invention has the additional advantage that the means to compensate for dispersion in the acousto-optic deflector can be used to compress the duration of the chirped pulse. This is accomplished by placing the AOM in proximity to a grating compressor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0068">Further improvements for correction of higher order dispersion terms in fiber chirped pulse amplification systems are disclosed in 10/992,762 (incorporated by reference herein). These can be applied to chirped pulse amplification systems with regenerative amplifiers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0069">Here, an ultra-compact high energy chirped pulse amplification systems based on linearly or nonlinearly chirped fiber grating pulse stretchers and photonic crystal fiber pulse compressors. Alternatively, photonic crystal fiber pulse stretchers and photonic crystal fiber compressors can also be implemented. For industrial applications the use of all-fiber chirped pulse amplification systems is preferred, relying on fiber-based pulse compressors and stretchers as well as fiber-based amplifiers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0070">Fiber-based high energy chirped pulse amplification systems of high utility can also be constructed from conventional optical components such as pulse stretchers based on long lengths of conventional fiber as well as bulk grating compressors. The performance of such ‘conventional’ chirped pulse amplification systems can be greatly enhanced by exploiting nonlinear cubicon pulse formation, i.e. by minimization of higher-order dispersion via control of self-phase modulation inside the amplifiers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0071">Finally, a particularly compact seed source for an Yb fiber-based chirped pulse amplification system can be constructed from an anti-Stokes frequency shifted modelocked Er fiber laser amplifier system, where a wavelength tunable output is obtained by filtering of the anti-Stokes frequency shifted output. The noise of such an anti-Stokes frequency shifted source is minimized by the amplification of positively chirped pulses in a negative dispersion fiber amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0072">The preceding improvements have been focused on systems operating close to 1 μm. These systems appear to be the most suitable for industrial applications. However, Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifiers are presently the dominant design. Frequency doubled erbium fiber lasers are utilized for the more industrial Ti:sapphire systems. FCPA front ends are suitable for higher repetition rates utilizing an electro-optic pulse selector as is disclosed in Ser. No. 10/960,923. FCPA systems operating in the 1.5 telecomm wavelength which are then frequency doubled would be suitable for a Ti:sapphire amplifier or regenerative amplifier system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0073">The invention in Ser. No. 10/606,829 (incorporated by reference herein) provides an erbium fiber (or erbium-ytterbium) based chirped pulse amplification system operating at a wavelength of approximately 1550 nanometers. The use of fiber amplifiers operating in the telecommunications window enables telecommunications components and telecommunications compatible assembly procedures to be used, with superior mechanical stability</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0074">It is found that electronic controls are needed for reliable operation for these complex systems. In Ser. No. 10/813,173 (incorporated by reference herein), the implementation of electronic controls are described which prevent catastrophic damage in a short pulse amplifier system as well as maintaining constant output power over the life of the system. These systems are very applicable in a regenerative amplifier system seeded by a fiber laser. The damage issues will also be a concern in a regenerative amplifier system. However, more importantly these front end systems normally will encompass nonlinear optical processes in the fiber amplifiers. These nonlinear optical processes are very dependent on laser intensity. Thus, to maintain the desired results over the life of the system, careful control of the optical powers is needed particularly in the nonlinear optical components in the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0075">It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a high power fiber amplifier system with means for controlling the pump diode current and the gain of the fiber amplifier such that the output pulse energy is constant as the pulse width and repetition rate are adjusted during operation. This includes keeping the pulse energy constant during turn-on of the pulse train.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0076">It is a further object of the invention to provide means for controlling the temperature of the fiber amplifier pump diode such that the pump diode wavelength is maintained at a fixed value with changes in diode current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0077">It is also an object of the invention to provide means for protecting the high power amplifier from damage due to gain buildup in excess of the damage threshold of the amplifier by monitoring the repetition rate of the injected oscillator pulses or external signal, and shutting off or reducing the pump diode current if the repetition rate falls below this threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0078">It is also an object of the invention to provide for monitoring of the amplitude of the seed pulses and to protect the high power fiber amplifier from damage by shutting off the pump diode if the amplitude of the injected pulses falls outside a safe threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0079">It is also an object of the invention to provide a high power amplifier system with means for controlling the amplitude of the seed pulse such that the output energy of the power amplifier is constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0080">The above and other objects of the invention are met by providing a device and method for controlling the diode current of the pump diode in a high power fiber amplifier, the device comprising a means for setting the pump diode current or power, monitoring such current or power, and maintaining the diode current or power at a constant value. Typically the current of the diode is controlled to correct for long term decrease on its output due to aging. In contrast, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the pump diode current is controlled to dynamically control the gain of the power amplifier to maintain uniform pulse energy as the repetition rate and the pulse temporal width is changed. This includes turning the pump diode on sufficiently in advance and ramping up the current to produce equal power for the first pulses when the unit is turned on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0081">The device also provides a means for calculating and/or storing the desired pump diode current setting as a function of system pulse width and repetition rate, such that the energy of the output pulse is maintained at a desired value as the pulse width and repetition rate are varied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0082">A device in accordance with an embodiment of the invention also provides a means for calculating and storing the appropriate pump diode temperature setting as a function of the pump diode current setting, such that the emission wavelength of the pump diode is maintained at a wavelength that provides maximum absorption of the pump diode energy by the fiber amplifier medium as the pump diode current is varied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0083">Means are also provided to monitor the repetition rate of the injected pulses into the amplifier system, to compare it to the predetermined repetition rate, and if lower than this repetition rate, to disable or reduce the current to the amplifier pump diode to prevent it from being damaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0084">The exemplary device discussed above also provides a means for comparing the amplitude of the pulse being injected into the fiber amplifier with a predetermined minimum amplitude value and if lower than this predetermined minimum, a means to disable or reduce the current to the amplifier pump diode to prevent it from being damaged. A device in accordance with an embodiment of the invention also provides a means of selecting and attenuating the seed pulses such that the amplified output pulses are of uniform energy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0085">It is an even further object of the invention to monitor the repetition rate of the oscillator and to provide a means for calculating the required down counter divide ratio needed to obtain a lower repetition rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0086">It is also an object of the invention to synchronize the oscillator with an external reference signal. It is also an object of the invention to vary this external reference in frequency, and have the oscillator repetition rate vary accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0087">It is an even further object of the invention to vary the external reference in frequency, and have the oscillator repetition rate vary accordingly, and also have the down counted repetition rate vary accordingly. However, this variation will be of a limited range compared to an all fiber system due to the operation repetition rate of a regenerative amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0088">Finally, these regenerative amplifier systems will be utilized in many cases for micromachining. Improvements for FPCA systems have been developed that are unique for a fiber seed source. Ser. No. 10/813,389 (incorporated by reference herein), describes the benefit for changing the pulse shapes that allow the change of the material processing properties of that laser. These methods include allowing the addition of heat by the addition of longer pulses. The physical means for changing these pulse shapes and building a all fiber chirped pulse amplification system suitable for material processing is described Ser. No. 10/813,269 (incorporated by reference herein). As is mentioned in Ser. No. 10/813,269 some of these changes in the seed source for a fiber chirped pulse amplification systems will also be suitable for regenerative amplifier systems. Herein further methods of obtaining various pulse changes are described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0089">The invention thus provides methods of materials processing using bursts of laser light comprised of ultrashort pulses in the femtosecond, picosecond and nanosecond ranges, wherein parameters of the pulses comprising the burst, such as pulse width, pulse separation duration, pulse energy, wavelength and polarization, are manipulated to induce desirable properties in the processed material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0090">While a precise and controlled removal of material is achieved using ultrashort pulses, there are situations when having a small amount of thermal effect retained by the material from the previous pulse prior to being irradiated by a subsequent ultrashort pulse is beneficial. In addition, it is well known that the properties of most materials have some dependence on temperature. For example, the absorption of light by silicon is very dependent on temperature. Hence, heating such a target material can help initiate the ablation process at lower threshold fluence and may produce a smoother surface. In general, the thermal and physical effect or any change in structure caused by the prior pulse influences the laser matter interaction with the next pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0091">The ablation threshold energy density, as a function of pulse width, can vary significantly from the square root of t as pulse widths enter the femtosecond range. These ultrashort pulses can be used to micro-machine cleanly without causing significant heat. These ultrashort pulses also have deterministic thresholds compared to the statistical thresholds of longer pulses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0092">The present invention may be used in micro-machining with bursts of pulses having pulse shapes that cannot be quantified by a single pulse width in order to describe their micro-machining properties. For example, a burst comprises a 100 femtosecond pulse and a one nanosecond pulse, where the one nanosecond pulse contains ninety percent of the energy and the 100 femtosecond pulse contains ten percent of the energy. The threshold for ablation of gold is a little over 0.3 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>for the 100 femtosecond pulse and 3.0 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>for the one nanosecond pulse. Thus, if the burst is focused to output 0.3J/cm<sup>2</sup>, then ablation will occur during the 100 femtosecond pulse, and not during the one nanosecond pulse. If the one nanosecond pulse impinges upon the surface first, it will have no affect while the 100 femtosecond pulse will ablate. Thus, the one nanosecond predominant pulse will not leave a heat affected zone. However, if the 100 femtosecond pulse is right before the one nanosecond pulse, then the 100 femtosecond pulse will change the absorption properties of the material so the one nanosecond pulse will also interact with the material. In this case, the ablation process would be predominantly heat related. If the one nanosecond pulse is increased to 100 nanoseconds, then the pulse energy content in the long pulse can be increased by ten-fold but the threshold is still determined by the ultrashort pulse and remains fixed even with one percent of the total energy in the ultrafast pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0093">Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, the long pulse is before the ultrafast pulse if the pulse repetition rate is substantially greater than or equal 100 kilohertz. In another embodiment of the present invention, a portion of the long pulse follows after the ultrafast pulse, and adding a pedestal on the short pulse can create the long pulse. Micro-machining can be accomplished with an ultrashort pulse, where substantial energy is in a long pulse pedestal (&gt;ten picoseconds) and where the long pulse pedestal adds a thermal machining mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0094">The present invention can perform laser machining on material using a burst of ultrashort laser pulses and tailors the pulse width, pulse separation duration, wavelength and polarization to maximize the positive effect of thermal and physical changes achieved by the previous pulse on the laser matter interaction in a burst-machining mode. Better processing results can be achieved by manipulating the pulse width, the pulse separation duration and the pulse energies of pulses within a burst. The wavelength and polarization of a laser beam also strongly affect the absorption of the laser beam, and have to be varied pulse-to-pulse in a burst in order to produce maximum laser-matter interaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0095">Besides the methods of manipulating laser beam parameters described above to achieve desired results, the present invention also includes methods to achieve the thermal and physical enhancement of a material during laser processing. In an embodiment of the present invention, the background light (commonly referred to as Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE)) is controlled to provide a constant source of energy for achieving thermal and physical changes to enhance the machining by individual ultrashort pulses. ASE is often emitted simultaneously and co-linearly with the ultrashort pulse from an amplified fiber laser. There are a number of ways to change the ASE ratio in the laser. Examples are changing the ultrashort pulse input energy into the amplifier, changing its center wavelength or changing the diode pump power to the amplifier. Another means more variable is within the compressor of the laser. As disclosed in application Ser. No. 10/813,163 the spectral output of the ASE can be designed to be at a different wavelength then that of the ultrashort pulse. Thus, in the compressor, where the spectral components are physically separated, a component can be placed to block or partially block the ASE, as disclosed in application Ser. No. 10/813,163. The ratio between the ASE and the ultrashort pulse energy can be controlled to vary the amount of preheating applied to the target material. In another embodiment of the invention, a pedestal of an ultrashort pulse is controlled. The pedestal is similar to a superimposed long-pulse with lower amplitude.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0096">The invention is based on the interaction with a material of laser pulses of different pulse widths, pulse separation duration, energy, wavelength and polarization in a burst mode. The positive aspects of pulses having different pulse widths, pulse separation duration, energies, wavelengths and polarization are utilized, and a negative aspect of one pulse complements a positive aspect of another pulse. The coupling of laser energy during interaction of successive laser pulses with a material induces various thermal, physical and chemical couplings. The induced coupling involves microscopic change of electronic structure, phase transition, structural disintegration and/or other physical changes. For example, pulses with different pulse widths in a burst induce coupling that is different from a burst having pulses with the same pulse width.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0097">An aspect of the invention provides a method of materials processing using laser light. The method comprises applying bursts of laser light to a target area of a material at a predetermined repetition rate. Preferably, the burst repetition rate is large enough for multipulse pulses generated within the round trip time of the regenerative amplifier, although lower repetition rates can be used. The burst of laser light comprises a first pulse and a second pulse of laser light displaced in time, although more pulses could be used in the burst as necessary. The first pulse has a first pulse width and the second pulse has a second pulse width, and predetermined parameters of the first pulse are selected to induce a change in a selected property of the processed material. The second pulse has a second pulse width, and predetermined parameters of the second pulse are selected based upon the property change induced by the first pulse. The first pulse width is generally in the nanosecond range, and the second pulse width is generally in the picosecond to femtosecond range. However, as stated previously it can be reversed. Predetermined parameters include pulse energy, pulse wavelength, pulse separation duration and pulse polarization vector. These parameters of the first and second pulses are controlled as well to machine the target area of the processed material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0098">A still further aspect of the present invention provides a method of materials processing that is similar to the previous aspect, except that the first and second pulses of the burst of laser light are overlapped in time, instead of being displaced in time. More pulses could be used in the burst as necessary. The first pulse has a first pulse width and the second pulse has a second pulse width, and the first pulse width can be greater than the second pulse width. The first pulse has a first pulse width and predetermined parameters of the first pulse are selected to induce a change in a selected property of the processed material. The second pulse has a second pulse width, and predetermined parameters of the second pulse are selected on based upon the property change induced by the first pulse. The first pulse width is generally in the nanosecond range, and the second pulse width is generally in the picosecond to femtosecond range. Predetermined parameters include pulse energy, pulse wavelength, pulse separation duration and pulse polarization vector which are controlled as well to machine the target area of the processed material. In addition, the second pulse may include a pedestal to facilitate thermally heating the processed material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0099">In yet another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for generating optical pulses, wherein each pulse may have individualized characteristics, is provided. The apparatus comprises a laser means for generating the bursts of pulses, a control means that controls the laser means and a beam manipulation means for monitoring the pulse width, wavelength, repetition rate, polarization and/or temporal delay characteristics of the pulses comprising the pulse bursts. The apparatus generates feedback data based on the measured pulse width, wavelength, repetition rate, polarization and/or temporal delay characteristics for the control means. In one embodiment of the present invention, the laser means may comprise a fiber amplifier that uses stretcher gratings and compressor gratings. The beam manipulation means can comprise a variety of devices, e.g., an optical gating device that measures the pulse duration of the laser pulses, a power meter that measures the power of the laser pulses output from the laser means or a photodiode that measures a repetition rate of the laser pulses. Another beam manipulation means optically converts the fundamental frequency of a percentage of the generated laser pulses to one or more other optical frequencies, and includes at least one optical member that converts a portion of the fundamental of the laser pulses into at least one higher order harmonic signal. The optical member device may comprise a non-linear crystal device with a controller that controls the crystal's orientation. Preferably, the means for converting an optical frequency includes a spectrometer that measures predetermined parameters of pulses output from the non-linear crystal device and generates feedback for the control means.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0150">A generalized illustration of the system of the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The pulses are generated in a short pulse source. <b>11</b>. These are coupled into a pulse conditioner <b>12</b> for spectral narrowing, broadening or shaping, wavelength converting, temporal pulse compression or stretching, pulse attenuation and/or lowering the repetition rate of the pulse train. The pulses are subsequently coupled into an Yb: or Nd: fiber amplifier <b>13</b>. Pulse stretcher <b>14</b> provides further pulse stretching before the amplification in the regenerative amplifier <b>15</b> that is based on an Nd: or Yb: doped solid-state laser material. The compressor <b>16</b> compresses the pulse back to near transform limit. The six basic subsystems described here are each subject to various implementations, as is described in the subsequent embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0151">A generalized illustration of one embodiment of the short pulse source <b>11</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The pulses generated in a laser seed source <b>1</b> (seed module; SM) are coupled into a pulse stretcher module <b>2</b> (PSM), where they are dispersively stretched in time. The stretched pulses are subsequently coupled into the fundamental mode of a cladding-pumped Yb fiber amplifier <b>3</b> (amplifier module, AM<b>1</b>), where the pulses are amplified by at least a factor of 10. Finally, the pulses are coupled into a pulse compressor module <b>4</b> (PCM), where they are temporally compressed back to approximately the bandwidth limit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0152">The embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is modular and four sub-systems; the SM <b>1</b>, PSM <b>2</b>, AM<b>1</b> <b>3</b> and PCM <b>4</b>. The sub-systems can be used independently as well as in different configurations, as described in the alternative embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0153">In the following, discussion is restricted to the SM-PSM-AM<b>1</b>-PCM system. The SM <b>1</b> preferably comprises a femtosecond pulse source (seed source <b>5</b>). The PSM preferably comprises a length of fiber <b>6</b>, where coupling between the SM and the PSM is preferably obtained by fusion splicing. The output of the PSM is preferably injected into the fundamental mode of the Yb amplifier <b>7</b> inside the AM<b>1</b> module <b>3</b>. Coupling can be performed by fusion splicing, a fiber coupler or a bulk-optic imaging system between PSM <b>2</b> and the fiber amplifier <b>7</b>. All fibers are preferably selected to be polarization maintaining. The PCM <b>4</b> is preferably a dispersive delay line constructed from one or two bulk optic diffraction gratings for reasons of compactness. Alternatively, a number of bulk optic prisms and Bragg gratings can be used inside the PCM <b>4</b>. Coupling to the PCM <b>4</b> can be performed by a bulk optic lens system as represented by the single lens <b>8</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the case of a PCM that contains fiber Bragg gratings, a fiber pig-tail can be used for coupling to the PCM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0154">As an example of a femtosecond laser seed source, a Raman-shifted, frequency-doubled Er fiber laser is shown within an SM <b>1</b> <i>b </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The femtosecond fiber laser <b>9</b> can be a commercial high energy soliton source (IMRA America, Inc., Femtolite B-60™) delivering ≈200 fs pulses at a wavelength of 1.57 μm and a pulse energy of 1 nJ at a repetition rate of 50 MHz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0155">For optimum Raman-shifting from 1.5 μm to the 2.1 μm wavelength region, a reduction in the core diameter (tapering) along the length of the polarization maintaining Raman-shifting fiber <b>10</b> is introduced. A reduction of the core diameter is required to keep the 2nd order dispersion in the Raman-shifter close to zero (but negative) in the whole wavelength range from 1.5 to 2.1 μm. By keeping the absolute value of the 2nd order dispersion small, the pulse width inside the Raman shifter is minimized, which leads to a maximization of the Raman frequency shift (J. P. Gordon, “Theory of the Soliton Self-frequency Shift,” Opt. Lett., 11, 662 (1986)). Without tapering, the Raman frequency-shift is typically limited to around 2.00 μm, which even after frequency-doubling is not compatible with the gain bandwidth of Yb fiber amplifiers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0156">In this particular example, a two-stage Raman shifter 10 consisting of 30 and 3 m lengths of silica ‘Raman’ fiber (single-mode at 1.56 μm) with core diameters of 6 and 4 μm respectively, was implemented. Due to the onset of the infrared absorption edge of silica at 2.0 μm, it is beneficial to increase the rate of tapering towards the end of the Raman shifter <b>10</b>. In the present example, conversion efficiencies up to 25% from 1.57 μm to 2.10 μm were obtained. Even better conversion efficiencies can be obtained by using a larger number of fibers with smoothly varying core diameter, or by implementing a single tapered fiber with smoothly varying core diameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0157">Frequency-conversion of the Raman-shifted pulses to the 1.05 μm region can be performed by a length of periodically poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) crystal <b>11</b> with an appropriately selected poling period. (Although throughout this specification, the preferable material for frequency conversion is indicated as PPLN, it should be understood that other periodically-poled ferroelectric optical materials such as PP lithium tantalate, PP MgO:LiNbO<sub>3</sub>, PP KTP, or other periodically poled crystals of the KTP isomorph family can also be advantageously used.) Coupling with the PPLN crystal <b>11</b> occurs through the use of a lens system, represented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by lenses <b>12</b>. The output of the PPLN crystal <b>11</b> is coupled by lenses <b>12</b> into output fiber <b>13</b>. Conversion efficiencies as high as 16% can so be obtained for frequency-doubling of 2.1 μm resulting in a pulse energy up to 40 pJ in the 1 μm wavelength region. The spectral width of the frequency-converted pulses can be selected by an appropriate choice of the length of the PPLN crystal 11; for example a 13 mm long PPLN crystal produces a bandwidth of 2 nm in the 1.05 μm region corresponding to a pulse width of around 800 fs. The generated pulse width is approximately proportional to the PPLN crystal length, i.e., a frequency converted pulse with a 400 fs pulse width requires a PPLN length of 6.5 mm. This pulse width scaling can be continued until the frequency-converted pulse width reaches around 100 fs, where the limited pulse width of 100 fs of the Raman-shifted pulses limits further pulse width reduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0158">In addition, when the frequency-converted pulse width is substantially longer than the pulse width of the Raman-shifted pulses, the wide bandwidth of the Raman-pulses can be exploited to allow for wavelength-tuning of the frequency-converted pulses, i.e., efficient frequency conversion can be obtained for pulses ranging in frequency from 2(ω<sub>1</sub>−δω) to 2(ω<sub>1</sub>+δω), where 2δω is the spectral width at half maximum of the spectrum of the Raman-shifted pulses. Continuous wavelength tuning here is simply performed by tuning the temperature of the frequency-conversion crystal <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0159">The amplified noise of the Raman-shifter, PPLN-crystal combination is minimized as follows. Self-limiting Raman-shifting of the Er fiber laser pulse source can be used by extending the Raman shift out to larger than 2 μm in silica-based optical fiber. For wavelengths longer than 2 μm, the infrared absorption edge of silica starts to significantly attenuate the pulses, leading to a limitation of the Raman shift and a reduction in amplitude fluctuations, i.e., any increase in pulse energy at 1.5 μm tends to translate to a larger Raman-shift and thus to a greater absorption in the 2 μm wavelength region, which thus stabilizes the amplitude of the Raman-shifted pulses in this region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0160">Alternatively, the noise of the nonlinear frequency conversion process can be minimized by implementing self-limiting frequency-doubling, where the center wavelength of the tuning curve of the doubling crystal is shorter than the center wavelength of the Raman-shifted pulses. Again, any increase in pulse energy in the 1.5 p.m region translates into a larger Raman-shift, producing a reduced frequency conversion efficiency, and thus the amplitude of the frequency-doubled pulses is stabilized. Therefore a constant frequency-converted power can be obtained for a large variation in input power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0161">This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, where the average frequency-converted power in the 1 μm wavelength region as a function of average input power at 1.56 μm is shown. Self-limiting frequency-doubling also ensures that the frequency-shifted wavelength in the 1 μm wavelength region is independent of average input power in the 1.56 μm wavelength region, as also demonstrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0162">Several options exist for the PSM <b>2</b>. When a length of fiber <b>6</b> (stretching fiber) is used as a PSM as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an appropriate dispersive delay line can then be used in the PCM <b>4</b> to obtain near bandwidth-limited pulses from the system. However, when the dispersive delay line in the PCM <b>4</b> consists of bulk diffraction gratings <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a possible problem arises. The ratio of |3<sup>rd</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup>|-order dispersion is typically 1-30 times larger in diffraction grating based dispersive delay lines compared to the ratio of |3<sup>rd</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup>|-order dispersion in typical step-index optical fibers operating in the 1 μm wavelength region. Moreover, for standard step-index fibers with low numerical apertures operating in the 1 μm wavelength regime, the sign of the third-order dispersion in the fiber is the same as in a grating based dispersive delay line. Thus a fiber stretcher in conjunction with a grating-based stretcher does not typically provide for the compensation of 3<sup>rd</sup>-and higher-order dispersion in the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0163">For pulse stretching by more than a factor of 10, the control of third-order and higher-order dispersion becomes important for optimal pulse compression in the PCM <b>4</b>. To overcome this problem, the stretcher fiber <b>6</b> in the PSM <b>2</b> can be replaced with a length of fibers with W-style multi-clad refractive index profiles, i.e., ‘W-fibers’ (B. J. Ainslie et al.) or holey fibers (T. M. Monroe et al., ‘Holey Optical Fibers’ An Efficient Modal Model, J. Lightw. Techn., vol. 17, no. 6, pp. 1093 - 1102). Both W-fibers and holey fibers allow adjustable values of 2nd, 3rd and higher-order dispersion. Due to the small core size possible in W and holey fibers, larger values of 3rd order dispersion than in standard single-mode fibers can be obtained. The implementation is similar to the one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and is not separately displayed. The advantage of such systems is that the PSM can work purely in transmission, i.e., it avoids the use of dispersive Bragg gratings operating in reflection, and can be spliced into and out of the system for different system configurations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0164">An alternative PSM <b>2</b> with adjustable values of 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd </sup>and 4<sup>th </sup>order dispersion is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The PSM <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is based on the principle that conventional step-index optical fibers can produce either positive, zero or negative 3rd order dispersion. The highest amount of 3rd order dispersion in a fiber is produced by using its first higher-order mode, the LP<sub>11 </sub>mode near cut-off. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the 4<sup>th </sup>and 3<sup>rd </sup>order dispersion of the PSM <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is adjusted by using three sections <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> of pulse stretching fiber. The 1st stretcher fiber <b>15</b> can be a length of fiber with zero 3rd-order and appropriate 4<sup>th </sup>-order dispersion. The 1st stretcher fiber <b>15</b> is then spliced to the 2<sup>nd </sup>stretcher fiber <b>16</b>, which is selected to compensate for the 3<sup>rd</sup>-order dispersion of the grating compressor as well as the whole chirped-pulse amplification system. To take advantage of the high 3<sup>rd</sup>-order dispersion of the LP<sub>11 </sub>mode the 1st stretcher fiber <b>15</b> is spliced to the 2<sup>nd </sup>stretcher fiber <b>16</b> with an offset in their respective fiber centers, leading to a predominant excitation of the LP<sub>11 </sub>mode in the 2nd stretcher fiber <b>16</b>. To maximize the amount of 3rd-order dispersion in the 2nd stretcher fiber <b>16</b>, a fiber with a high numerical aperture NA&gt;0.20 is preferred. At the end of the 2nd stretcher fiber <b>16</b>, a similar splicing technique is used to transfer the LP<sub>11 </sub>mode back to the fundamental mode of the 3<sup>rd </sup>stretcher fiber <b>17</b>. By an appropriate choice of fibers, the 4th-order dispersion of the whole amplifier compressor can be minimized. The 3<sup>rd </sup>stretcher fiber <b>17</b> can be short with negligible dispersion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0165">The transfer loss of the whole fiber stretcher assembly is at least 25% due to the unavoidable 50% or greater loss incurred by transferring power from the LP<sub>11 </sub>mode to the LP<sub>01 </sub>mode without the use of optical mode-converters. Any residual energy in the LP<sub>01 </sub>mode in the 2nd stretcher fiber can be reflected with an optional reflective fiber grating <b>18</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Due to the large difference in effective index between the fundamental and the next higher-order mode, the grating resonance wavelength varies between 10-40 nm between the two modes, allowing for selective rejection of one mode versus the other for pulses with spectral widths between 10-40 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0166">The energy loss of the fiber stretcher assembly can be made to be insignificant by turning the 3<sup>rd </sup>stretcher fiber <b>17</b> into an Yb amplifier. This implementation is not separately shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0167">When 4th-order dispersion is not significant, the 1st stretcher fiber <b>15</b> can be omitted. 4<sup>th </sup>order dispersion can also be compensated by using a 1st stretcher fiber with non-zero 3<sup>rd </sup>order dispersion, as long as the ratio of 3<sup>rd </sup>and 4<sup>th </sup>order dispersion is different between the 1<sup>st </sup>and 2<sup>nd </sup>stretcher fiber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0168">The Yb—doped fiber inside the AM<b>1</b> <b>3</b> can have an Yb doping level of 2.5 mole % and a length of 5 m. Both single-mode and multi-mode Yb-doped fiber can be used, where the core diameter of the fiber can vary between 1-50 μm; though the fundamental mode should be excited in case of a MM fiber to optimize the spatial quality of the output beam. Depending on the amount of required gain, different lengths of Yb—doped fiber can be used. To generate the highest possible pulse energies, Yb fiber lengths as short as 1 m can be implemented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0169">Pulse compression is performed in the PCM <b>4</b>. The PCM <b>4</b> can contain conventional bulk optic components (such as the bulk diffraction grating pair shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), a single grating compressor, or a number of dispersive prisms or grisms or any other dispersive delay line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0170">Alternatively, a fiber or bulk Bragg grating can be used, or a chirped periodically poled crystal. The chirped periodically poled crystal combines the functions of pulse compression and frequency doubling (A. Galvanauskas, et al., ‘Use of chirped quasi-phase matched materials in chirped pulse amplification systems,’ U.S. application Ser. No. 08/822,967, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference) and operates in transmission providing for a uniquely compact system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0171">Other modifications and variations to the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure and teachings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0172">In particular, the SM <b>1</b> can be used as a stand-alone unit to produce near bandwidth limited femtosecond pulses in the frequency range from 1.52-2.2 μm, and after frequency conversion in a nonlinear crystal also in the frequency range from 760 nm to 1.1 μm. The frequency range can be further extended by using a fluoride Raman-shifting fiber or other optical fibers with infrared absorption edges longer than silica. Using this technique wavelengths up to around 3-5 μm can be reached. In conjunction with frequency-doubling, continuous tuning from 760 nm to 5000 nm can be achieved. The pulse power in the 2 μm region can be further enhanced by using Tm or Ho-doped fiber. With such amplifiers, near bandwidth-limited Raman-soliton pulses with pulse energies exceeding 10 nJ can be reached in single-mode fibers in the 2 μm wavelength region. After frequency-doubling, femtosecond pulses with energies of several nJ can be obtained in the 1 μm region without the use of any dispersive pulse compressors. Such pulses can be used as high energy seed pulses for large-core multi-mode Yb amplifiers, which require higher seed pulse energies than single-mode Yb amplifiers to suppress amplified spontaneous emission.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0179">Most straight-forward to implement, however, is an Yb oscillator operating in the positive dispersion regime, which does not require any special cavity components such as negative dispersion fiber Bragg gratings or holey fiber to control the cavity dispersion.

The Yb fiber <b>44</b> is assumed to be polarization maintaining and a polarizer <b>31</b> is inserted to select a single polarization state. The fiber Bragg grating <b>37</b> has a reflection bandwidth small compared to the gain bandwidth of Yb and ensures the oscillation of pulses with a bandwidth small compared to the gain bandwidth of Yb.

Pulse generation or passive modelocking inside the Yb oscillator is initiated by the saturable absorber <b>28</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0181">To optimize the formation of parabolic pulses inside the Yb amplifier <b>40</b> inside the SM <b>1</b> <i>f, </i>the input pulses should have a bandwidth small compared to the gain bandwidth of Yb; also the input pulse width to the Yb amplifier <b>40</b> should be small compared to the output pulse width and the gain of the Yb amplifier <b>40</b> should be as high as possible, i.e., larger than <b>10</b>. Also, gain saturation inside the Yb amplifier <b>40</b> should be small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0182">As an example of a parabolic amplifier a Yb amplifier of 5 m in length can be used. Parabolic pulse formation is ensured by using a seed source with a pulse width of around 0.2 - 1 ps and a spectral bandwidth on the order of 3- 8 nm. Parabolic pulse formation broadens the bandwidth of the seed source to around 20 - 30 nm inside the Yb amplifier 40, whereas the output pulses are broadened to around 2-3 ps. Since the chirp inside parabolic pulses is highly linear, after-compression pulse widths on the order of 100 fs can be obtained. Whereas standard ultrafast solid state amplifiers can tolerate a nonlinear phase shift from self-phase modulation only as large as pi (as well known in the state of the art), a parabolic pulse fiber amplifier can tolerate a nonlinear phase shift as large as 10*pi and higher. For simplicity, we thus refer to a large gain Yb amplifier as a parabolic amplifier. Parabolic amplifiers obey simple scaling laws and allow for the generation of parabolic pulses with spectral bandwidths as small as 1 nm or smaller by an appropriate increase of the amplifier length. For example, a parabolic pulse with a spectral bandwidth of around 2 nm can be generated using a parabolic amplifier length of around 100 m.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0183">Since a parabolic pulse can tolerate large values of self-modulation and a large amount of spectral broadening without incurring any pulse break up, the peak power capability of a parabolic amplifier can be greatly enhanced compared to a standard amplifier. This may be explained as follows. The time dependent phase delay φ<sub>nl</sub>(t) incurred by self-phase modulation in an optical fiber of length L is proportional to peak power, i.e.

Φ<sub>nl</sub>(<i>t</i>)=γ<i>P</i>(<i>t</i>)<i>L, </i>

Further, the pulse pickers <b>52</b> inserted in later amplifier stages also suppress the build up of amplified spontaneous emission in the amplifiers allowing for a concentration of the output power in high-energy ultra-short pulses.

This may be understood, since a chirped pulse with a parabolic pulse profile can evolve asymptotically into a parabolic pulse with a parabolic spectrum in a length of fiber. The parabolic pulse shape maximizes the amount of tolerable self-phase modulation in the subsequent amplification stages, which in turn minimizes the amount of dispersive pulse stretching and compression required in the PSM <b>2</b> and PCM <b>4</b>.

Thus by accurately controlling the spectrum of strongly chirped pulses with an amplitude filter as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, any amount of higher-order dispersion can be introduced to compensate for the values of higher-order dispersion in a chirped pulse amplification system.

Since very high energy pulses require large core multi-mode fibers for their amplification, the control of the fundamental mode in a single-pass polarization maintaining fiber amplifier may be difficult to accomplish. In this case, it may be preferred to use a highly centro-symmetric non-polarization maintaining amplifier to minimize mode-coupling and to obtain a high-quality output beam. To obtain a deterministic environmentally stable polarization output from such an amplifier, a double-pass configuration as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> may be required. Here a single-mode fiber <b>55</b> is used as a spatial mode filter after the first pass through the amplifier <b>56</b>; alternatively, an aperture could be used here. The spatial mode filter <b>55</b> cleans up the mode after the first pass through the multi-mode amplifier <b>56</b>, and also suppresses amplified spontaneous emission in higher-order modes that tends to limit the achievable gain in a multi-mode amplifier. Lenses <b>60</b> can be used for coupling into and out of amplifier <b>56</b>, spatial mode filter <b>55</b>, and pulse pickers <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b. </i>The Faraday rotator <b>57</b> ensures that the backward propagating light is polarized orthogonal to the forward propagating light; the backward propagating light is coupled out of the system at the shown polarization beam splitter <b>58</b>. To optimize the efficiency of the system, a near-diffraction limited source is coupled into the fundamental mode of the multi-mode fiber <b>56</b> at the input of the system, where gain-guiding can also be used to further improve the spatial quality of the beam amplified in the multi-mode fiber. To count-down the repetition rate of the pulse train delivered from a SM and to suppress amplified spontaneous emission in the multi-mode amplifier, a 1st optical modulator <b>52</b> <i>a </i>can be inserted after the first pass through the multi-mode amplifier. An ideal location is just in front of the reflecting mirror <b>59</b> as shown. As a result a double-pass gain as large as 60-70 dB could be obtained in such a configuration, minimizing the number of amplification stages required from amplifying seed pulses with pJ energies up to the mJ energy level. This type of amplifier is fully compatible with the SMs, PSMs and PCMs as discussed before, allowing for the generation of femtosecond pulses with energies in the mJ regime.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0203">Neglecting any depolarization in the all-fiber polarizer itself, it can be shown by applying a Jones matrix calculation method that for a misalignment of the polarization axes of gain fiber <b>101</b> and fiber polarizer <b>105</b> by a degrees, the linear reflectivity R from the right-hand side of the cavity varies approximately between R=1−0.5 sin<sup>2 </sup>2α and R=1 depending on the linear phase in the gain fiber <b>101</b>. If the group delay along the two polarization axes of the gain fiber is larger than the intra-cavity pulse width, any satellite pulse is suppressed by sin<sup>4</sup>α after transmission through the polarizer. Typical fiber splicing machines can align polarization-maintaining fibers with an angular accuracy of less than ±2°; hence any reflectivity variation due to drifts in the linear phase between the two polarization eigenmodes of fiber <b>101</b> can be kept down to less than 3×10<sup>−3</sup>, whereas (for sufficiently long fibers) any satellite pulses obtained after transmission through the polarizer can be kept down to less than 6×10<sup>−6 </sup>when using an integrated polarizer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0204">The chirped fiber Bragg grating <b>106</b> is preferably spliced to the PF <b>105</b> at splice position <b>108</b> and written in non-polarization-maintaining fiber. In order to avoid depolarization in the fiber Bragg grating, the Bragg grating pig-tails are preferably kept very short, e.g., a length smaller than 2.5 cm is preferable between splice locations <b>108</b> and <b>109</b>. To obtain a linear polarization output, a polarization-maintaining fiber pig-tail is spliced to the left-side of the fiber Bragg grating at splice location <b>109</b>. The laser output is obtained at a first fiber (or cavity) end <b>111</b>, which is preferably angle-cleaved to avoid back-reflections into the cavity. An alternative preferred design is with the fiber grating written in polarization-maintaining fiber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0205">Fiber Bragg grating <b>106</b> serves two functions. First, it is used as an output mirror (i.e., it feeds part of the signal back to the cavity) and, second, it controls the amount of cavity dispersion. In the present implementation, the chirped fiber Bragg grating has a negative (soliton-supporting) dispersion at the emission wavelength in the wavelength region near 1060 nm and it counter-balances the positive material dispersion of the intra-cavity fiber. To produce the shortest possible pulses (with an optical bandwidth comparable to or larger than the bandwidth of the gain medium), the absolute value of the grating dispersion is selected to be within the range of 0.5-10 times the absolute value of the intra-cavity fiber dispersion. Moreover, the fiber Bragg grating is apodized in order to minimize any ripple in the reflection spectrum of the grating. Accordingly, the oscillation of chirped pulses is enabled in the cavity, minimizing the nonlinearity of the cavity and maximizing the pulse energy. Chirped pulses are characterized in having a pulse width which is longer than the pulse width that corresponds to the bandwidth limit of the corresponding pulse spectrum. For example the pulse width can be 50%, 100%, 200% or more than 1000% longer than the bandwidth limit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0206">Alternatively, the oscillation of chirped pulses is also enabled by using negative dispersion fiber in conjunction with positive dispersion chirped fiber Bragg gratings. Pulses with optical bandwidth comparable to the bandwidth of the gain medium can also be obtained with this alternative design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0207">A SAM <b>112</b> at a second distal fiber end <b>113</b> completes the cavity.

Etalon formation between the fiber end <b>113</b> and the SAM <b>112</b> is prevented by an anti-reflection coating deposited on fiber end <b>113</b> (not separately shown).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0208">The pump laser <b>104</b> is coupled into the gain fiber <b>101</b> via a lens system comprising, for example, two lenses <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> and a V-groove <b>117</b> cut into fiber <b>101</b>. Such side-coupling arrangements are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,865 ('865) to L. Goldberg et al. Alternatively, fiber couplers can be used for pump light coupling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0209">An exemplary design for a SAM in accordance with the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18<i>a</i> </figref>. For example, SAM <b>200</b> includes an InGaAsP layer <b>201</b> with a thickness of 50-2000 nm. Further, layer <b>201</b> is grown with a band edge in the 1 μm wavelength region; the exact wavelength is defined by the sought emission wavelength of the fiber laser and can vary between 1.0-1.6 μm. The InGaAsP layer <b>201</b> is further coated or processed with a reflective material such as Au or Ag. A dielectric mirror or semiconductor Bragg reflector <b>202</b> is located beneath layer <b>201</b> and the entire structure is attached to heat sink <b>203</b>, based on, for example, metal, diamond or sapphire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0210">In order to cover a broad spectral range (e.g., greater than 100 nm) metallic mirrors are preferred. When using a metallic mirror it is advantageous to remove the substrate (InP) by means of etching. When using HCl as an etching solvent the etching selectivity between InGaAsP and InP can be low, depending on the compound composition of InGaAsP. An etch-stop layer is beneficial between the substrate and the InGaAsP layer. InGaAs can be a proper etch-stop layer. When adding an InGaAs layer with a band-gap wavelength shorter than 1.03 μm, lattice relaxations can be avoided by keeping the thickness below 10 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0211">The InGaAsP layer can further be anti-reflection coated with layer <b>204</b> on its upper surface to optimize the performance of the SAM. Because of the saturable absorption by InGaAsP, the reflectivity of the SAM increases as a function of light intensity, which in turn favors the growth of short pulses inside the laser cavity. The absence of Al in the saturable absorber layer prevents oxidization of the semiconductor surfaces in ambient air and thus maximizes the life-time and power handling capability of the structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0212">Instead of InGaAsP, any other Al-free saturable semiconductor can also be used in the construction of the SAM. Alternatively, Al-containing semiconductors can be used in the SAM with appropriately passivated surface areas. Surface passivation can, for example, be accomplished by sulfidization of the semiconductor surface, encapsulating it with an appropriate dielectric or with an Al-free semiconductor cap layer. An AlGaInAs absorber layer grown lattice-matched on InP can be surface- passivated with a thin (about 10 nm range) cap layer of InP. AlGaInAs with a higher band gap energy than the absorber layer can also be used for a semiconductor Bragg reflector in combination with InP. Among concepts for semiconductor Bragg mirrors lattice-matched to InP, an AlGaInAs/InP combination has an advantage over an InGaAsP/InP Bragg reflector due to its high refractive index contrast.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0213">Instead of a bulk semiconductor saturable absorber, a MQW saturable absorber structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18<i>b </i> </figref>may also be used. In this case, the SAM <b>205</b> conveniently comprises MQW structures <b>206</b>, <b>207</b> and <b>208</b> separated by passive spacer layers <b>209</b>-<b>212</b> in order to increase the saturation fluence and depth-selective ion-implantation concentration of each MQW section. Additional MQW structures can further be used, similarly separated by additional passive spacer layers. To reduce the wavelength and location sensitivity of the MQW saturable absorbers, the width of the spacer layers varies from spacer layer to spacer layer. Furthermore, multiple bulk layers with thicknesses larger than 500 Å can replace the MQW structure. The MQW layers, in turn, can contain several layers of quantum wells and barriers such as, for example, InGaAs and GaAs, respectively. Top surface <b>209</b> can further be anti-reflection coated (not shown); a reflective structure is obtained by including mirror structure <b>213</b>. The entire structure can be mounted on heat sink <b>214</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0214">The control of the response time of the saturable absorption for concomitant existence of fast and slow time constants is realized by introducing carrier trap centers with depth controlled H+ (or other ions) implantation. The implantation energy and dose are adjusted such that part of the absorbing semiconductor film contains a minimal number of trap centers. For example the semiconductor layer with the minimal number of trap centers can be selected to be at the edge of the optical penetration range of exciting laser radiation. Such a design serves only as an example and alternatively any semiconductor area within the optical penetration range can be selected to contain a minimal number of trap centers. Hence distinctive bi-temporal carrier relaxation is obtained in the presence of optical excitation. As an illustration of depth selective ion implantation, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows the measurement of the depth profile of H+ion implantation of an InGaAsP absorber film taken from secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0215">The obtained bi-temporal carrier life-time obtained with the semiconductor film with a proton concentration as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, is further illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Here the reflectivity modulation (dR/R0) of a semiconductor saturable mirror due to excitation of the saturable mirror with a high energy short pulse at time t=0 is shown as a function of time delay. The measurement was obtained with a pump-probe technique, as well known in the art. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> clearly displays the bi-temporal response time due to fast (&lt;1 ps) and slow (&gt;&gt;100 ps) recovery. The distinctive fast response originates from the depth region with high trap concentration, while the slow component results from the rear depth region with a much lower trap center concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0216">When employing this absorber in the laser system described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, Q-switched mode-locking is obtained at intracavity power levels of a few mW. At the operating pump power level, stable cw mode-locking evolving from Q-switch mode-locking is observed. In contrast, no Q-switching and no mode-locking operation is obtained with the same semiconductor material implanted uniformly with protons without bi-temporal carrier relaxation (exhibiting only fast carrier relaxation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0217">We emphasize that the description for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is to serve as an example in controlling 1) the fast time constant, 2) the slow time constant, 3) the ratio of the fast and slow time constants, 4) the amplitude of the fast response, 5) the amplitude of the slow response, and finally 6) the combination of all of the above by ion implantation in a saturable absorber. Thus, the concept depicted hereby can be applicable for any type of laser modelocked with a saturable absorber. Specifically, in the presence of un-avoidable large spurious intra-cavity reflections such as in fiber lasers or thin disk lasers (F. Brunner et al., Sub-50 fs pulses with 24 W average power from a passively modelocked thin disk Yb:YAG laser with nonlinear fiber compression, Conf. on Advanced Solid State Photonics, ASSP, 2003, paper No.: TuAl), the disclosed engineerable bi-temporal saturable absorbers can greatly simplify and stabilize short pulse formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0218">The preferred implantation parameters for H+ ions in GaAs or InP related materials including MQW absorbers are as follows: The doses and the implantation energies can be selected from 10<sup>12 </sup>cm<sup>−2 </sup>to 10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>−2 </sup>and from 5 keV to 200 keV, respectively, for an optically absorbing layer thickness between 50 nm and 2000 nm. For MQW absorbers, the selective ion-implantation depth is rather difficult to measure because the shallow MQW falls into the implantation peak in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. However, with the separation of MQW sections with spacers <b>209</b>-<b>212</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) it is feasible to employ depth selective ion implantation. For arsenic implantation, the implantation parameters for 50-2000 nm absorbing layer spans from 10<sup>12 </sup>cm<sup>−2 </sup>to 10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>−2 </sup>for the dosage and an implantation energy range of 100 keV to 1000 keV. In case of MQW saturable absorbers, the implantation range is preferably selected within the total thickness of the semiconductor layer structure containing MQW sections and spacers. In addition to H<sup>+</sup> and arsenic, any other ions such as for example Be can be implanted with controlled penetration depth by adjusting the above recipes according to the stability requirements of the desired laser.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0220">Instead of TEC cores, more conventional lenses or graded index lenses can be incorporated between the fiber end and the SAM to optimize the beam diameter on the SAM. Generally, two lenses are required. A first lens collimates the beam emerging from the fiber end, and a second lens focuses the beam onto the SAM. According to present technology, even conventional lenses allow the construction of a very compact package for the second fiber end. An implementation with two separate collimation and focusing lenses is not separately shown. To minimize unwanted back reflections into the fiber cavity and to minimize the number of components, a single lens can be directly fused to the fiber end as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21<i>b</i> </figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0221">To minimize aberrations in assembly <b>306</b>, an additional lens can also be incorporated between lens <b>307</b> and SAM <b>303</b>.

Alternatively, a lens can be directly polished onto fiber <b>304</b>; however, such an arrangement has the disadvantage that it only allows a beam size on the SAM which is smaller than the beam size inside the optical fiber, thereby somewhat restricting the design parameters of the laser. To circumvent this problem, a lens surface can be directly polished onto the surface of a TEC; such an implementation is not separately shown. Another alternative is to exploit a graded-index lens design attached directly onto the fiber tip to vary the beam size on the SAM. In the presence of air-gaps inside the oscillator a bandpass filter <b>308</b> can be incorporated into the cavity, allowing for wavelength tuning by angular rotation as shown, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> <i>b. </i> </div>

In a specific, exemplary, implementation, polarization- maintaining fiber <b>101</b> was doped with Yb with a doping level of 2 weight %; the doped fiber had a length of 1.0 m; the core diameter was 8 um and the cladding diameter was 125 um. An additional 1.0 m length of undoped polarization-maintaining fiber was also present in the cavity. The overall (summed) dispersion of the two intra-cavity fibers was approximately +0.09 ps<sup>2</sup>. In contrast, the fiber grating <b>106</b> had a dispersion of −0.5 ps<sup>2</sup>, a spectral bandwidth of 10 nm and a reflectivity of 50%.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0223">When pumping with an optical power of 1.0 W at a wavelength of 910 nm, the laser produced short chirped optical pulses with a full width half maximum width of 1.5 ps at a repetition rate of 50 MHz.

The pulse bandwidth was around 2 nm and hence the pulses were more than two times longer than the bandwidth-limit which corresponds to around 800 fs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0224">Alternatively, a fiber grating <b>106</b> with a dispersion of −0.1 ps<sup>2</sup>, closely matching the dispersion of the intra-cavity fiber, was implemented.

The laser then produced chirped optical pulses with a full-width half maximum width of 1.0 ps at a repetition rate of 50 MHz with an average power of 25 mW. The pulse spectral bandwidth was around 20 nm and thus the pulses were around 10 times longer than the bandwidth limit, which corresponds to around 100 fs. The generation of pulses with a pulse width corresponding to the bandwidth limit was enabled by the insertion of a pulse compressing element; such elements are well known in the state of the art and are not further discussed here.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0231">Briefly, due to the environmental sensitivity of the phase delay between the polarization eigenmodes of each fiber section, for N directly concatenated polarization-maintaining fibers the reflectivity of a fiber Fabry-Perot cavity can vary between R=1 and R=1−(N×α)<sup>2</sup>, where a is the angular misalignment between each fiber section. Further, it is assumed that α is small (i.e., α&lt;&lt;10°) and identical between each pair of fiber sections. Also, any cavity losses are neglected. In fact, it is advantageous to analyze the possible leakage L into the unwanted polarization state at the output of the fiber cavity. L is simply given by L=1−R. For the case of N concatenated fiber sections, the maximum leakage is thus (N×α)<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0232">In contrast, a cavity containing N−1 polarizers in-between N sections of polarization-maintaining fiber is more stable, and the maximum leakage is L=2×(N−1)α<sup>2</sup>. Here, any depolarization in the fiber polarizers itself is neglected. For instance, in a case where N=3, as in cavity <b>600</b>, the leakage L into the wrong polarization axis is 2×(3−1)/3<sup>3</sup>=4/9 times smaller compared to a cavity with three directly concatenated fiber sections. This increase in stability is very important in manufacturing yield as well as in more reproducible modelocked operation in general.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0233">In constructing a stabe laser, it is also important to consider the construction of WDM <b>605</b> as well as output coupler <b>609</b>.

For example, assuming a birefringent fiber operating at a wavelength of 1550 nm with a birefringence of 3×10<sup>−4 </sup>corresponding to a polarization beat length of 5 mm at 1550 nm, the stable oscillation of soliton pulses with a FWHM width of 300 fs requires pig-tails with a length greater than 29 cm.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0245">The wide-bandwidth grating is preferably selected to approximately match the dispersion of the intra-cavity fibers. The wide-bandwidth grating can be made in short non-polarization maintaining fibers and it can be made also in polarization maintaining fibers. In order to suppress detrimental effects from cross coupling between the two polarization axes of the fiber grating, coupling to cladding modes in such large bandwidth fiber gratings should be suppressed. Gratings with suppressed coupling to cladding modes can be made in optical fibers with photosensitive core and cladding area, where the photosensitive cladding area is index-matched to the rest of the cladding. Such fiber designs are well known in the state of the art and can for example be manufactured with an appropriate selection of germania and fluorine doping in the core and cladding regions and such fiber designs are not further discussed here. Because of the large generated bandwidth, splicing of such polarization maintaining gratings to the rest of the cavity without coherent coupling between the linear polarization eigenmodes is no problem.

Essentially, any of the prior art modelocked fiber laser systems described above (that were using saturable absorbers) can be improved with engineered bi- and multi-temporal saturable absorbers. Specifically, any of the cavity designs described in U.S. Pat.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0251">An embodiment with the fewest bulk optic components in the optical path is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. The source of ultrashort pulses is a fiber-based MOPA <b>100</b>. This source is described in detail in Ser. No. 10/814,502 which is incorporated herein. A polarization-maintaining gain fiber <b>101</b> has a core <b>102</b> and cladding region <b>103</b>. The fiber core <b>102</b> is doped with rare-earth ions, preferably Yb, to produce gain at a signal wavelength when the laser is pumped with diode laser <b>104</b>. The pump diode is coupled into the cladding region <b>103</b> of fiber <b>101</b> using for example two lenses <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> and V-groove <b>107</b>, though coupling systems comprising more than two lenses can be used. Alternatively a WDM and a single mode laser diode can be used for in core optical pumping. The fiber core can be single-mode or multi-mode. The multi-mode fiber is designed to propagate single mode as is described in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/785,944 (incorporated by reference herein). The multi-mode fiber can also be multi-mode photonic crystal fiber as is described in Ser. No. 10/844,943 (incorporated herein). The fiber laser cavity <b>100</b> further contains a fiber Bragg grating <b>108</b>, written in polarization maintaining fiber, an optional polarizer (fiber or bulk) <b>109</b> and a saturable absorber assembly <b>110</b>. A bulk polarizer such as a cube polarizer is preferred. Fiber grating <b>108</b> can be chirped or un-chirped, where the polarization cross talk between the two polarization axes of the polarization maintaining fiber containing the fiber gratings is preferably less than 15 dB. Fiber end face <b>111</b> completes the basic MOPA system. The fiber Bragg grating can be written directly into fiber <b>101</b> or it can be spliced into the MOPA system at splice positions <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>, where the polarization axes of all involved fibers are aligned with respect to each other. The MOPA comprises an oscillator assembly <b>114</b> and an amplifier assembly <b>115</b>. The oscillator assembly <b>114</b> is bounded on the left hand side by fiber grating <b>108</b> and on the right hand side by saturable absorber assembly <b>110</b>. The amplifier assembly <b>115</b> is bounded by fiber grating <b>108</b> and fiber end <b>111</b> on the two opposite distal ends. In the present example fiber <b>101</b> is used both in the amplifier section and in the amplifier section. In general, however, different fibers can be used in the oscillator and amplifier, though to avoid feedback from the amplifier into the oscillator, the refractive index of both oscillator and amplifier fiber should be closely matched. The chirp of the output pulses can be conveniently compensated with the delivery fiber <b>118</b>, where lenses <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> are used to couple the output from the MOPA into the delivery fiber. Other pulse modification elements can be placed between the lenses such as an isolator, tunable filter or fiber gratings. The delivery fiber can comprise standard silica step-index fiber, holey fiber or photonic crystal fiber. The use of photonic crystal for dispersion compensation and pulse delivery was previously disclosed in Ser. No. 10/608,233. The delivery fiber <b>118</b> can also be spliced directly to fiber end face <b>111</b>, enabling a further integration of the laser assembly. The delivery fiber can also be sufficiently long to stretch the pulse sufficiently for amplification in the regenerative amplifier.

These pulse conditioning methods can be utilized in a regenerative amplifier system. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a laser system <b>550</b> having a monitoring and feedback control capability.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0255">The monitoring of the system performed by the exemplary monitors <b>570</b> and/or <b>574</b> may comprise for example an optical detector and electronics that monitors optical intensity or power or other relevant parameter such as, e.g., frequency and spectrum. In response to such measurement, the monitor and the driver may induce changes in the oscillator and/or the amplifier by for example adjusting the pump intensity and/or rate, or adjusting the operating temperature. Temperature control of the oscillator can stabilize the gain dynamics as well as frequency fluctuations. Temperature control of the amplifier can also be used to stabilize the gain dynamics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0256">Other configurations for providing feedback to control the operation of the laser system may also be employed. For example, more or less feedback loops may be included. The electronics associated with these feedback loops are further described in Ser. No. 10/813,173 (incorporated by reference herein). A particularly important electronic control is to control the gain of the fiber amplifier. At 1 KHz repetition rate and lower, the gain of the fiber amplifier could be reduced between pulses to conserve the lifetime of the laser diode. Also the gain needs to be reduced on the fiber amplifier if a signal is lost from the short pulse source to protect from optical damage to the fiber amplifier or subsequent optical elements. The loops may involve electronics that perform operations such as calculations to determine suitable adjustments to be introduced. Examples are the mode-lock start-up and search algorithms that are disclosed in Attorney Docket No. A8828 (incorporated by reference herein). The start-up algorithm is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. The feedback may be obtained from other locations in the system and may be used to adjust other components as well.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0257">A good Polarization Extinction Ratio (PER) is an important factor in maintaining good temporal pulse quality in a fiber-based ultrafast source for a regenerative amplifier. Poor polarization extinction creates ripple on the spectrum and on the chirped pulse. In various preferred embodiments, the light in the laser is linearly polarized. The degree of the linear polarization may be expressed by the polarization extinction ratio (PER), which corresponds to a measure of the maximum intensity ratio between two orthogonal polarization component. In certain embodiments, the polarization state of the source light may be maintained by using polarization-maintaining single-mode fiber. For example, the pigtail of the individual modular device may be fabricated with a polarization-maintaining fiber pigtail. In such cases, the PER of each modular stage may be higher than about 23 dB. Ensuring a high polarization extinction ratio throughout a series of modules is challenging despite the use of single mode polarization maintaining fiber. Degradation of the PER can occur at the fiber ferrule, fiber holder, or fusion splice in the series of modules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0258">Levels of PER above 23 dB may be obtained in a system by utilizing linear-polarizing optical components in the modules. Use of linear-polarizing components in the modules within systems that contain polarization degrading elements such as a fiber ferrule, fiber holder, or fusion splice is advantageous. The linear polarizers counter the superposition of the phase shift from each polarization degrading element. A superposed phase shift of 10 degrees may reduce the PER to about 15 dB in which case intensity fluctuation through a linear polarizer might be more than about 4%. In contrast, by embedding linear polarizers throughout the series of modules, the PER of the aggregate system can be substantially controlled such that the intensity fluctuation is below about 1%, provided that the PER of the individual module and splice is above about 20 dB.</div>

The mode-locking means is a saturable absorber mirror (<b>2001</b>). The gain is provided by a Yb: doped fiber (<b>2002</b>). The other output coupler is a chirped fiber grating (<b>2003</b>) that also provides for dispersion compensation. The center wavelength is between 1030-1040 nm with a bandwidth between 5-20 nm. The pulse is compressible to 100-300 fs. It is pumped in core by a conventional laser diode (<b>2005</b>) through a polarization maintaining WDM (<b>2004</b>). Side pumping the cladding is also suitable. The pulse energy is nearly 1 nJ after amplification. The fiber amplifier (<b>2300</b>) is slightly nonlinear.

If a fiber with an order of magnitude higher mode area (mode field diameter of 19.5 μm) is used, then the parameters in the fiber will be the same as in the case with 1 microjoule input. So the fiber length would again be 2 meters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0264">Since there is no interplay between dispersion and self-phase modulation in this design, the pulse width stays the same as the original pulse width. The nearly linear chirp is created by the shape of the pulse. Such a fiber is normally called a “compression fiber”. We propose to replace this “compression fiber” with an amplifier fiber. The output of the amplifier will be a chirped pulse that can be compressed in a compressor. This saves the need of a stretcher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0265">For pulse energies significantly greater than 1 microjoule, the single mode beam should be further amplified in a multimode fiber. This chirped pulse source is ideal for amplification of ultrashort pulses by chirped pulse amplification in a regenerative amplifier. The pulse is then compressed after amplification. In this case the microchip 71 was operated at 0.5 0, and produced 250 ps, pulses and operating at the repetition rate of the regenerative amplifier. The compression fiber 62 is now a multimode amplifier fiber that amplified a single mode with a mode-field diameter of 17 μm. The pulse was then amplified to 30 microjoules where Raman limited the amplification. This pulse is now a chirped 250 ps pulse. It is further amplified in a solid state regenerative amplifier and compressed in a bulk grating compressor to typically less than 1 ps. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> illustrates the source generally described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of US Published Application 20040240037A1, incorporated by reference herein, with modification made to the chirped fiber grating at the end of the source to further stretch the pulses prior to amplification in the regenerative amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0266"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> illustrates a chirped pulse amplification system that utilizes conventional fiber stretchers, fiber amplifiers, bulk regenerative amplifiers and bulk grating compressors. In order to obtain high quality pulses from such systems, the control of higher-order dispersion and self-phase modulation is critical. A chirped pulse amplification system allowing for independent control of second-and third order dispersion is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. In an exemplary embodiment, a seed source <b>101</b> based on a passively modelocked Yb fiber laser was used. Such passively modelocked Yb fiber lasers were previously described in application Ser. No. 10/627069 and are not further described here. The seed source <b>101</b> produces positively chirped optical pulses with a bandwidth of 16 nanometers at a repetition rate of 43 megahertz with an average power of 16 milliwatts. The peak emission wavelength of the oscillator was 1053 nanometers. The pulses from the seed source were compressible to a pulse width of less than 150 femtoseconds, demonstrating that the chirp from the seed source was approximately linear. The output from the seed laser passed through an isolator (not shown) and a tunable bandpass filter <b>119</b> with a 15 nanometer bandwidth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0267">After the bandpass filter <b>119</b>, an output power of 5 milliwatts was obtained and a fiber stretcher <b>120</b> was used to stretch the pulses to a width of approximately 100 picoseconds. The fiber stretcher employed for producing stretched pulses had a length of approximately 200 meters and was based on conventional polarization maintaining single-mode step-index fiber. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the tunable bandpass filter <b>119</b> is shown inserted before the fiber stretcher <b>120</b>; alternatively, the tunable bandpass filter <b>119</b> can also be inserted after the fiber stretcher <b>120</b> (system implementation is not separately shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0268">A subsequent Yb-based polarization maintaining pre-amplifier <b>121</b> amplifies the stretched pulses to an average power of 500 milliwatts. A pulse picker <b>122</b>, based on an acousto-optic modulator and pig-tailed with polarization maintaining fiber, reduces the repetition rate of the pulses to 200 kilohertz, resulting in an average power of 1 milliwatt. The pulses from the pulse picker <b>122</b> were subsequently injected into a large-mode polarization maintaining Yb fiber power amplifier <b>123</b> and amplified to an average power of 950 milliwatts. The Yb power amplifier had a length of 3 meters and the fundamental mode spot size in the Yb power amplifier was around 25 micrometers. All fibers were either spliced together with their polarization axes aligned or connected to each other (with their polarization axes aligned) with appropriate mode-matching optics (not shown). The power amplifier <b>123</b> was cladding pumped via a lens <b>124</b> with a pump source <b>125</b>, delivering a pump power of about 10 watts at a wavelength of 980 nanometers. A beam splitting mirror <b>126</b> was implemented to separate the pump light from the amplified signal light. The amplified and stretched pulses from the power amplifier <b>123</b> are further amplified in a bulk solid state regenerative amplifier <b>129</b>. The output pulses from the regenerative amplifier <b>129</b> were compressed in a conventional bulk optics compressor <b>127</b> based on a single diffraction grating with a groove density of 1200 lines/mm, operating near the Littrow angle. Such bulk optics compressors are well known in the state of the art and are not further explained here. After the bulk optics compressor <b>127</b>, the output <b>128</b> will contain pulses with a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) width of around 330 femtoseconds and pulse energies around 1 millijoule. Alternative designs should be feasible including a system without the power amplifier. However, in this case the power amplifier is operating as the nonlinear fiber amplifier that is able to correct for higher order dispersion mismatch between the fiber stretcher and the bulk compressor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0269">Because stretched pulses can accumulate significant levels of third-order dispersion in the presence of self-phase modulation, gain-narrowing, gain-pulling and gain depletion, we refer to such pulses as cubicons. More generally, we can define a cubicon as a pulse that produces controllable levels of at least linear and quadratic pulse chirp in the presence of at least substantial levels of self-phase modulation (corresponding to a nonlinear phase delay &gt;1) that can be at least partially compensated by dispersive delay lines that produce significant levels of second and third-order dispersion as well as higher-order dispersion. (Please note that for the compensation of linear pulse chirp, a dispersive delay line with second order dispersion is required, whereas for the compensation of quadratic pulse chirp, a dispersive delay line with third order dispersion is required and so on for higher orders of pulse chirp.) For a dispersive delay line to produce a significant level of 2<sup>nd </sup>and 3<sup>rd </sup>as well as possibly higher-order dispersion, the stretched pulses are typically compressed by more than a factor of 30. In addition cubicons can also be formed in the presence of resonant amplifier dispersion, gain narrowing, gain pulling as well as gain depletion, where we refer to gain depletion as an appreciable reduction in gain due to a single pulse. If a high power mode-locked oscillator an undoped fiber can be utilized to create the self-phase modulation. Spectral filtering will most likely be necessary to obtain the appropriate pulse shape to the chirped pulse. The chirped pulse width will need to be further expanded before amplification in the regenerative amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0270">The importance of the pulse picker <b>122</b> has been described in Ser. No. 10/960,923 in that it alleviates the specifications on the optical switch in the regenerative amplifier. A further advantage is that it can be utilized as a variable attenuator for controlling the buildup time in the regenerative amplifier. An AO switch can be used here, however EO switches and EA switches are available in modules that conform to Telcordia standards and specifications. As pointed out in Ser. Nos. 10/437,057 and 10/606,829, it often takes two switches since the standard on off discrimination is 30 db while for lowering the rep rate from 30 MHz to 1 KHz requires an on off discrimination of more than 50 db for the majority of the energy to be in the one pulse operating at the lower repetition rate. Another use of the pulse picker is as a variable attenuator to control the nonlinearities in the fiber for dispersion correction. In cubicon amplification the nonlinearities are critical for dispersion control and the variable attenuation feature of the pulse pickers is a means for controlling the nonlinear affects in the fibers. Other variable attenuators can be used such as described in Ser. No. 10/814,319. Other means of controlling the nonlinearities of the fiber amplifier are utilizing the control of the fiber amplifier output as described above. These include varying the gain or temperature of the fiber amplifier by measuring the spectrum and or the output intensity from the fiber amplifier. Controlling the spectrum and the intensity accurately for cubicon amplification can be implemented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0271">The embodiment of a short pulse source in the picosecond and nanosecond range amplified in a fiber amplifier and amplified in a bulk amplifier is disclosed in application Ser. No. 10/927,374 (incorporated by reference herein) This system in some cases will have better performance when the bulk amplifier is utilized as a regenerative amplifier. This embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. Fiber amplifier system <b>501</b> is described in detail in Ser. No. 10/927,374. The output pulse of the fiber amplifier system <b>501</b> is mode-matched by beam conditioning optics <b>506</b> to the fundamental mode of the solid state regenerative amplifier <b>505</b>. The regenerative amplifier <b>505</b> utilizes a bulk crystal gain material which is preferably directly diode pumped. The embodiment displayed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> has the advantage that the gain bandwidth of the regenerative amplifier can be matched to the fiber amplifier system. For example 1 ns pulses with a spectral bandwidth of 0.6 nm and a pulse energy exceeding 100 μJ, centered at a wavelength of 1064 nm can be generated in a fiber amplifier chain in conjunction with a diode seed laser, for injection into a Nd:YVO<sub>4 </sub>amplifier, which has a spectral bandwidth of approximately 0.9 nm. As another example a modelocked Yb-fiber oscillator with center wavelength of 1064nm and a bandwidth of several nm can be amplified and spectrally narrowed and matched to the gain bandwidth of the Nd:YVO<sub>4 </sub>solid state amplifier. Thus 100 ps pulses with an energy of around 100 μJ and higher can be generated in a fiber amplifier chain and efficiently amplified in the regenerative amplifier. Without exploitation of spectral narrowing, the pulse energies from fiber amplifier chains designed for the amplification of 100 ps pulses in bulk Nd:YVO<sub>4 </sub>amplifiers has to be reduced to avoid spectral clipping in the bulk amplifiers. Spectral narrowing is indeed universally applicable to provide high energy seed pulses for narrow line-width solid state amplifiers. For the example of bulk Nd:YVO<sub>4 </sub>amplifiers, spectral narrowing is preferably implemented for pulse widths in the range of 20 ps-1000 ps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0272">Bulk solid-state regenerative amplifiers are also useful to increase the energy of pulses generated with fiber based chirped pulse amplification systems. Chirped pulse amplification is generally employed to reduce nonlinearities in optical amplifiers. The implementation of chirped pulse amplification is most useful for the generation of pulses with a width &lt;50 ps. Due to the limited amount of pulse stretching and compression that can be achieved with chirped pulse amplification schemes, stretched pulses with an initial pulse width exceeding 1-5 ns are generally not implemented. Hence optical damage limits the achievable pulse energies from state of the art fiber based chirped pulse amplification systems (assuming fiber power amplifiers with a core diameter of 30 μm) to around 1 mJ. Single stage bulk solid state amplifiers can increase the achievable pulse energies normally by a factor of 10 while a regenerative amplifier has a gain of 10<sup>6</sup>. Therefore a regenerative amplifier can be preferable and give flexibility at a cost of complexity. One advantage is significantly lower pulse energies can be utilized from the fiber amplifier. A generic scheme <b>500</b> for the amplification of the output of a fiber based chirped pulse amplification system in a bulk optical amplifier is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. Here short fs—ps pulses with pulse energies of a few nJ are generated in fiber oscillator <b>501</b>. The pulses from the oscillator are stretched in pulse stretcher <b>502</b> to a width of 100 ps-5 ns. The pulse stretcher is preferably constructed from a chirped fiber grating pulse stretcher as discussed with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and can also be constructed from bulk optical gratings as well known in the state of the art. A pulse picker 503 reduces the repetition rate of the oscillator to the 1 kHz-1 MHz range to increase the pulse energy of the amplified pulses. A fiber amplifier chain represented by a single fiber <b>504</b> is further used to increase the pulse energy to the μJ-mJ level. Appropriate mode matching optics <b>506</b> is then used to couple the output of amplifier chain <b>504</b> into the bulk solid state amplifier <b>505</b>. Here bulk solid state amplifiers based on rods, slabs as well as thin disk concepts can be implemented. Appropriate bulk amplifier material are based for example on Yb:YAG, Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF or Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>, Nd:glass, Yb, glass, Nd:KGW and others. Appropriate bulk amplifier materials and designs are well known in the state of the art and not further discussed here. A collimation lens <b>507</b> directs the output of the bulk solid state amplifier to the input of the compressor assembly. To minimize the size of a chirped pulse amplification system employing narrow bandwidth Nd-based crystals such as Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF, Nd:YVO<sub>4 </sub>or Nd:KGW the use of a grism based compressor is preferred. The optical beam is directed to via mirror <b>508</b> to the grism <b>509</b> and an additional folding prism <b>510</b> is used to minimize the size of the compressor. Mirror <b>511</b> completes the compressor assembly. Such compressor assemblies have previously been used to compensate for third-order dispersion in wide-bandwidth chirped pulse amplification systems (i.e. chirped pulse amplification systems with a bandwidth &gt;5 nm); no prior art exists applying grism technology to narrow bandwidth chirped pulse amplification systems (i.e. chirped pulse amplification systems comprising amplifiers with a spectral bandwidth &lt;5 nm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0273">In an exemplary embodiment, fiber oscillator <b>501</b> generates 5 ps pulses, which are stretched by a chirped fiber grating stretcher to a width of 1 ns. After amplification in the fiber amplifier chain a pulse energy of 50 μJ is obtained at a repetition rate of 10 kHz. Further amplification in a Nd:YVO<sub>4 </sub>solid state booster amplifier generates a pulse energy of 2 mJ. After recompression in the bulk grating compressor 10 ps pulses with an energy of 1 mJ are obtained. To ensure a compact design for the bulk grating compressor, preferably grisms with a groove density of 2800 l/mm are implemented. The whole compressor can then fit into an area of about 0.6×0.2 m by folding the optical beam path only once.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0274">As discussed above, a burst of multiple pulses with different wavelengths, different pulse widths and different temporal delays may be desired. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, an embodiment of the laser means <b>51</b> is illustrated, which increasing the increasing the possible energy and average power from ultrafast fiber lasers. A longer pulse envelope can be obtained by utilizing a series of chirped gratings that reflect at different wavelengths. After amplification, a similar series of gratings can be placed to recombine/compress the pulses. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, pulses from a femtosecond pulse source are passed through an acousto-optic modulator, a polarized beam-splitter and a Faraday rotator, and are then supplied to a series of chirped fiber stretcher gratings that operate on different portions of the input pulse spectrum. The spacings between the stretcher gratings can be l<sub>1</sub>, l<sub>2</sub>, l<sub>3 </sub>. . . . In order to reconstruct the pulses after amplification in the fiber amplifier and the regenerative amplifier the spacings between a series of complementary bulk glass Bragg grating compressors are set to nl<sub>1</sub>, nl<sub>2</sub>, nl<sub>3</sub>, . . . , where n is the refractive index of the fiber between the stretcher fiber gratings, assuming that the bulk Bragg compression gratings are separated by air. The reconstructed pulse is output via a second beam splitter. As previously mentioned, the reconstructed pulse is generally the result of incoherent addition of the separately amplified spectral components of the input pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0275">If the distances between the compression and stretcher gratings are not equalized as described above, then multiple pulses will appear at the output. If the distances are not equal between the different sections than the temporal delays will not be equal. This can be beneficial for applications such as micro-machining. By varying the stretching and compression ratios, pulses with different pulse widths can be generated. A single broadband compression grating can be used when generating multiple pulses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0276">The utilization of the regenerative amplifier is not as flexible as an all fiber amplifier system for modification of the pulse shape. For example, long pulse widths are limited to repetitive features equal to the round trip time of the regenerative amplifier, e.g., approximately 10 nanoseconds. For a regenerative amplifier, the pulse train created by the gratings needs to be less than the round trip time of the regenerative amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0277">Another embodiment of a multiple pulse source is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. This source is utilized in the laser system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>. The Ytterbium amplifier is normally needed for the pulse intensity to be sufficient for amplification in the regenerative amplifier. The pulse compressor is optional. The multiple pulse source is a laser diode and multiple electronic drivers. In this case there are three sources with a delay generator that allows different delays to each electronic driver. A long pulse is generated by a conventional pulse driver for a laser diode. The shorter pulses are derived from short pulse laser diode drivers such as are available from Avtech. These signals are added through electronic mixers. The output is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43<i>a</i> </figref>. This is an oscilloscope screen measured with a sufficiently fast photodiode. There are three peaks observable. The output for one of the short pulses is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43<i>b</i> </figref>. The pulse width is approximately 100 ps. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43<i>c </i> </figref>illustrates a three peak pulse that is formed by changing the delay between the pulses so the electronic signals overlap. The short pulses can also be chirped and then recompressed to femtosecond pulses by the final compressor as described in Ser. No. 08/312,912 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,400,350 (incorporated by reference herein). By appropriately choosing the chirp rates and frequency ranges a single bulk grating can compress a plurality of pulses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0278">Another embodiment of this is to utilize laser diodes at different wavelengths or polarization states and then combine these optically either with wavelength fiber combiners such as the wavelength router utilized in multiple wavelength telecomm systems or by fiber splitters as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. It is also possible to utilize conventional mode-locked sources to give multiple pulses. The methods for utilizing fiber gratings and etalons as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Another method is to use fiber splitters with different path lengths as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>. Four pulses are output for each pulse from the Ultrashort pulse source. The four pulses are sequentially, temporally delayed by:
