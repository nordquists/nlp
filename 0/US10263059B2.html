<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an OLED (organic light emitting diode) panel in which an OLED formed over a substrate is sealed between the substrate and a sealing member. The invention also relates to an OLED module obtained by mounting an IC to the OLED panel. In this specification, a light emitting device is used as the generic term for the OLED panel and the OLED module. Also included in the present invention is electronic appliance using the light emitting device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Being self-luminous, OLEDs eliminate the need for a backlight that is necessary in liquid crystal display devices (LCDs) and thus make it easy to manufacture thinner devices. Also, the self-luminous OLEDs are high in visibility and have no limit in terms of viewing angle. These are the reasons for attention that light emitting devices using the OLEDs are receiving in recent years as display devices to replace CRTs and LCDs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">An OLED has a layer containing an organic compound that provides luminescence (electro luminescence) when an electric field is applied (the layer is hereinafter referred to as organic light emitting layer), in addition to an anode layer and a cathode layer. Luminescence obtained from organic compounds is classified into light emission upon return to the base state from singlet excitation (fluorescence) and light emission upon return to the base state from triplet excitation (phosphorescence). A light emitting device according to the present invention can use one or both types of light emission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In this specification, all the layers that are provided between an anode and a cathode is defined as an organic light emitting layer. Specifically, the organic light emitting layer includes a light emitting layer, a hole injection layer, an electron injection layer, a hole transporting layer, an electron transporting layer, etc. A basic structure of an OLED is a laminate of an anode, a light emitting layer, and a cathode layered in this order. The basic structure can be modified into a laminate of an anode, a hole injection layer, a light emitting layer, and a cathode layered in this order, or a laminate of an anode, a hole injection layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transporting layer, and a cathode layered in this order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">One of methods of driving a light emitting device having an OLED is analog driving in which an analog video signal is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In analog driving, an analog video signal is inputted to a gate electrode of a TFT that controls a current flowing into the OLED (driving TFT). The amount of drain current of the driving TFT is controlled by the electric potential of the inputted analog video signal. When the drain current flows into the OLED, the OLED emits light at a luminance determined in accordance with the amount of the drain current. A gray scale is thus obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">A detailed description will be given with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> on how the amount of current supplied to the OLED is controlled by the gate voltage of the driving TFT in the above analog driving.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a graph showing a transistor characteristic of the driving TFT. The characteristic is called I<sub>DS</sub>−V<sub>GS </sub>characteristic (or I<sub>DS</sub>−V<sub>GS </sub>curve). IDS represents the drain current and V<sub>GS </sub>represents the voltage between the gate electrode and the source region (gate voltage). V<sub>TH </sub>represents the threshold voltage and V<sub>∞</sub> means that V<sub>GS </sub>is infinite. From the graph, one can tell how much current flows when the gate voltage takes an arbitrary value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">An exclusive relation is formed between gate voltage and drain current in accordance with the I<sub>DS</sub>−V<sub>GS </sub>characteristic shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. In other words, the drain current is determined in accordance with the electric potential of an analog video signal inputted to the gate electrode of the driving TFT. The drain current flows into the OLED, which emits light at a luminance determined in accordance with the amount of the drain current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">When the voltage between the source region and the drain region is given as V<sub>DS</sub>, the transistor characteristic of the driving TFT which is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is divided into two ranges by values of V<sub>GS </sub>and V<sub>DS</sub>. A range where |V<sub>GS</sub>−V<sub>TH</sub>|&lt;|V<sub>DS</sub>| is satisfied is a saturation range, whereas a range where |V<sub>GS</sub>−V<sub>TH</sub>|&gt;|V<sub>DS</sub>| is satisfied is a linear range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The following equation 1 is satisfied in the saturation range.
<br/>
<i>I</i> <sub>DS</sub>=β(<i>V</i> <sub>GS</sub> <i>−V</i> <sub>TH</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/2  Equation 1
<br/>
wherein β=μC<sub>o</sub>W/L, μ represents the mobility, C<sub>o </sub>represents the gate capacitance per unit area, and W/L represents the ratio of a channel width W to a channel length L of a channel formation region.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">As Equation 1 shows, the current value in the saturation range is hardly changed by V<sub>DS </sub>and is determined solely by V<sub>GS</sub>. Therefore, it is relatively easy to control the gray scale by the electric potential of an analog signal. Accordingly, the driving TFT is operated mainly in the saturation range in analog driving in general.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In the saturation range, however, a change in gate voltage causes an exponential change in drain current as is apparent in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. For that reason, the drain current in analog driving could be changed greatly by the slightest change in gate voltage due to leakage or other causes during a period started with input of an analog video signal and ending with input of the next analog video signal. A great change in drain current is accompanied by a great change in luminance of the OLED. This can therefore lead to a problem of flickering of screen, depending on the frame frequency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to avoid the problem above, it is important to hold the gate voltage securely. Increasing the capacity of the capacitor storage can be one of measures for holding the gate voltage securely. However, when the capacitor storage is increased, the aperture ratio is lowered to reduce the area of a pixel where light emission is actually obtained (area of effective light emission). The term area of effective light emission refers to the area of a region in which light emitted from an OLED is not blocked by objects that do not transmit light, such as a TFT and wiring line formed on the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In recent years in particular, demands for images of higher definition are increasing and how to solve the problem of lowered aperture ratio which accompanies enhancement of pixel definition is becoming ever important. Accordingly, increasing the area that a capacitor storage occupies in a pixel is not desirable.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention has been made in view of the problems above, and an object of the present invention is therefore to provide a light emitting device which can prevent a change in gate voltage due to leakage or other causes and at the same time can prevent the aperture ratio from lowering.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to attain the above object, the present invention uses a connection wiring line, an insulating film, and a capacitance wiring line to form a capacitor storage. The connection wiring line is formed over a gate electrode and an active layer of a TFT of a pixel, and is connected to the active layer. The insulating film is formed on the connection wiring line. The capacitance wiring line is formed on the insulating film. Alternatively, the capacitance wiring line may be formed on the same interlayer insulating film on which a pixel electrode is formed. In this case, the capacitance wiring line and the pixel electrode may be formed from the same conductive film. A power supply line may double as the capacitance wiring line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">This structure enables the capacitor storage to overlap the TFT, thereby increasing the capacity of the capacitor storage while keeping the aperture ratio from lowering. Accordingly, a change in gate voltage due to leakage or other causes can be controlled to prevent a change in luminance of an OLED and flickering of screen in analog driving.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Keeping the aperture ratio from lowering also leads to preventing the area of effective light emission of a pixel from being reduced. As the area of effective light emission is larger, the luminance of the screen is higher. Therefore, the structure of the present invention is effective in reducing power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The structure of the present invention may also be used in digital driving.</div>

The capacitor storage of the present invention can be obtained as long as it is formed from: a wiring line (connection wiring line) that is formed over a gate electrode and an active layer of a TFT of a pixel and is connected to the active layer; an insulating film formed on the connection wiring line; and a wiring line (capacitance wiring line) formed on the insulating film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">With the above structure, the present invention can make the capacitor storage overlap the TFT and therefore can increase the capacity of the capacitor storage while keeping the aperture ratio from lowering. Accordingly, a change in gate voltage due to leakage or other causes can be avoided to thereby prevent a change in luminance of the OLED and flickering of screen in analog driving.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Keeping the aperture ratio from lowering also leads to preventing the area of effective light emission of a pixel from being reduced. As the area of effective light emission is larger, the luminance of the screen is higher. Therefore, the structure of the present invention is effective in reducing power consumption.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">First, a glass substrate <b>200</b> is prepared. Barium borosilicate glass, typical example of which is Corning #7059 glass or #1737 glass (product of Corning Incorporated), or alumino borosilicate glass is usable as the substrate <b>200</b>. The substrate <b>200</b> can be any light-transmissive substrate, and a quartz substrate may also be used. A plastic substrate may be employed if it has heat resistance against the process temperature of this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a base film <b>201</b> is formed on the substrate <b>200</b> from an insulating film such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, or a silicon oxynitride film. In this embodiment, the base film <b>201</b> has a two-layer structure. However, a single layer or more than two layers of the insulating films listed above may be used as the base film. The first layer of the base film <b>201</b> is a silicon oxynitride film <b>201</b> <i>a </i>formed to have a thickness of 10 to 200 nm (preferably 50 to 100 nm) by plasma CVD using as reaction gas SiH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O. The silicon oxynitride film <b>201</b> <i>a </i>(composition ratio: Si=32%, O=27%, N=24%, H=17%) formed in this embodiment has a thickness of 50 nm. The second layer of the base film <b>201</b> is a silicon oxynitride film <b>201</b> <i>b </i>formed to have a thickness of 50 to 200 nm (preferably 100 to 150 nm) by plasma CVD using as reaction gas SiH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O. The silicon oxynitride film <b>201</b> <i>b </i>(composition ratio: Si=32%, O=59%, N=7%, H=2%) formed in this embodiment has a thickness of 100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">On the base film <b>201</b>, semiconductor layers <b>202</b> to <b>204</b> are formed. The semiconductor layers <b>202</b> to <b>204</b> are formed by patterning into a desired shape a crystalline semiconductor film that is obtained by forming a semiconductor film with an amorphous structure through a known method (sputtering, LPCVD, plasma CVD, or the like) and then subjecting the film to known crystallization treatment (e.g., laser crystallization, thermal crystallization, or thermal crystallization using nickel or other catalysts). The semiconductor layers <b>202</b> to <b>204</b> are each 25 to 80 nm in thickness (preferably 30 to 60 nm). The material of the crystalline semiconductor film is not limited but silicon or a silicon germanium (Si<sub>x</sub>Ge<sub>1-x </sub>(X=0.0001 to 0.02)) alloy is preferable. In this embodiment, an amorphous silicon film with a thickness of 55 nm is formed by plasma CVD and then a solution containing nickel is held to the top face of the amorphous silicon film. The amorphous silicon film is subjected to dehydrogenation (at 500° C., for an hour), then to thermal crystallization (at 550° C., for four hours), and then to laser annealing treatment for improvement of crystallinity to obtain a crystalline silicon film. Patterning treatment using photolithography is conducted on this crystalline silicon film to form the semiconductor layers <b>202</b> to <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The semiconductor layers <b>202</b> to <b>204</b> may be doped with a minute amount of impurity element (boron or phosphorus) in order to control the threshold of the TFTs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">If laser crystallization is used to form the crystalline semiconductor film, a pulse oscillating or continuous wave excimer laser, YAG laser, or YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser can be employed. Laser light emitted from these laser oscillators is preferably collected into a linear beam by an optical system before irradiating the semiconductor film. Though conditions of crystallization can be set suitably by an operator, there are some preferred conditions. When an excimer laser is used, preferable conditions include setting the pulse oscillation frequency to 300 Hz, and the laser energy density to 100 to 400 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>(typically, 200 to 300 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>). When a YAG laser is used, preferable conditions include using the second harmonic thereof, and setting the pulse oscillation frequency to 30 to 300 kHz and the laser energy density to 300 to 600 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>(typically, 350 to 500 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>). The laser light is collected into a linear beam having a width of 100 to 1000 μm, 400 μm, for example, to irradiate the entire surface of the substrate with the beam. In the irradiation, the overlap ratio of the linear laser light is set to 50 to 98%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, a gate insulating film <b>205</b> is formed to cover the semiconductor layers <b>202</b> to <b>204</b>. The gate insulating film <b>205</b> is formed from an insulating film containing silicon by plasma CVD or sputtering to have a thickness of 40 to 150 nm. This embodiment uses a silicon oxynitride film (composition ratio: Si=32%, O=59%, N=7%, H=2%) formed by plasma CVD to have a thickness of 110 nm. The gate insulating film is not limited to the silicon oxynitride film, of course, but may be a single layer or a laminate of other insulating films containing silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">When a silicon oxide film is used for the gate insulating film, the film is formed by plasma CVD in which TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate) and O<sub>2 </sub>are mixed, the reaction pressure is set to 40 Pa, the substrate temperature is set to 300 to 400° C., and the high frequency (13.56 MHz) power density is set to 0.5 to 0.8 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>for electric discharge. The silicon oxide film thus formed can provide excellent characteristics as the gate insulating film when the film receives subsequent thermal annealing at 400 to 500° C. The device that has finished the steps above presents the sectional view shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Resist masks <b>206</b> are formed next and the semiconductor layers are doped with an n type impurity element (phosphorus, in this embodiment) to form impurity regions <b>207</b> to <b>209</b> that contain high concentration of phosphorus. These regions each contain phosphorus in a concentration of 1×10<sup>20 </sup>to 5×10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, typically, 2×10<sup>20 </sup>to 1×10<sup>22 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">A heat-resistant conductive layer for forming a gate electrode is formed on the gate insulating film <b>205</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). A heat-resistant conductive layer <b>210</b> may be a single layer or a laminate of two, three, or more layers if necessary. In this embodiment, a laminate of a conductive film (A) <b>210</b> <i>a </i>and a conductive film (B) <b>210</b> <i>b </i>makes the heat-resistant conductive layer. The heat-resistant conductive layer may be a film containing an element selected from the group consisting of tantalum (Ta), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), chromium (Cr), and silicon (Si). Alternatively, the heat-resistant conductive layer may be a conductive film mainly containing one of the elements listed above (typically a tantalum nitride film, a tungsten nitride film, a titanium nitride film, or the like), or an alloy film containing a combination of the elements listed above (typically a Mo—W alloy film, a Mo—Ta alloy film, a tungsten silicide film, or the like). This embodiment uses a TaN film for the conductive film (A) <b>210</b> <i>a </i>and a W film for the conductive film (B) <b>210</b> <i>b</i>. These films that constitute the heat-resistant conductive layer are formed by sputtering or CVD. In order to reduce the resistance of the films, the concentration of impurities contained in the films should be lowered and the oxygen concentration in particular is preferably reduced to 30 ppm or less. The W film may be formed by sputtering with W as the target, or by thermal CVD using tungsten hexafluoride (WF<sub>6</sub>). In either case, the W film has to have a low resistivity in order to use the W film as a gate electrode. A desirable resistivity of the W film is 20 μΩcm or lower. The resistivity of the W film can be reduced by increasing the crystal grain size but, if there are too many impurity elements such as oxygen in the W film, crystallization is inhibited to raise the resistivity. Accordingly, when the W film is formed by sputtering, a W target with a purity of 99.99% or 99.9999% is used and a great care is taken not to allow impurities in the air to mix in the W film that is being formed. As a result, the W film can have a resistivity of 9 to 20 μΩcm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Sputtering can also be used to form a Ta film for the heat-resistant conductive layer <b>210</b>. The Ta film is formed by using Ar as sputtering gas. If an appropriate amount of Xe or Kr is added to the sputtering gas, the internal stress of the obtained Ta film is eased to prevent the Ta film from peeling off. The resistivity of a Ta film in a phase is about 20 μΩcm and is usable as a gate electrode. On the other hand, the resistivity of a Ta film in β phase is about 180 μΩcm and is not suitable for a gate electrode. A Ta film in α phase can readily be obtained by forming, as a base of a Ta film, a TaN film that has a crystal structure approximate to that of the α phase. Though not shown in the drawings, it is effective to form a silicon film doped with phosphorus (P) to have a thickness of 2 to 20 nm under the heat-resistant conductive layer <b>210</b>. This improves adherence to the conductive film to be formed thereon and prevents oxidization. At the same time, the silicon film prevents a minute amount of alkaline metal element contained in the heat-resistant conductive layer <b>210</b> from diffusing into the first shape gate insulating film <b>205</b>. Whatever material is used, a preferable resistivity range for the heat-resistant conductive layer <b>210</b> is 10 to 50 μΩcm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The conductive film (A) <b>210</b> <i>a </i>and the conductive film (B) <b>210</b> <i>b </i>are then patterned into desired shapes to form gate electrodes <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> and a capacitance electrode <b>213</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>).

In any case, the first interlayer insulating film <b>226</b> is formed from an inorganic insulating material. The thickness of the first interlayer insulating film <b>226</b> is set to 100 to 200 nm. If a silicon oxide film is used for the first interlayer insulating film <b>226</b>, the film is formed by plasma CVD in which TEOS and O<sub>2 </sub>are mixed, the reaction pressure is set to 40 Pa, the substrate temperature is set to 300 to 400° C., and the high frequency (13.56 MHz) power density is set to 0.5 to 0.8 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>for electric discharge.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">Then an activation step is conducted to activate the impurity elements that are used to dope the semiconductor layers in different concentrations and impart them the n type or p type conductivity (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">After a second interlayer insulating film <b>303</b> is formed, contact holes are formed in the second interlayer insulating film <b>303</b>, a gate insulating film <b>307</b>, and a first interlayer insulating film <b>306</b>. Formed next is a conductive layer for forming connection wiring lines <b>305</b> and <b>320</b>, a source line <b>304</b>, and a power supply line <b>321</b>. The conductive layer in this embodiment has a laminate structure in which a 300 to 500 nm thick conductive film mainly containing aluminum (Al) is laid on a 50 to 100 nm thick conductive film mainly containing titanium (Ti). A conductive film for forming connection wiring lines is a laminate of a combination of a film mainly containing tantalum (Ta), a conductive film mainly containing aluminum (Al), or a film mainly containing titanium (Ti).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">On the surface of the conductive layer, an insulating film <b>310</b> is formed by anodization or plasma oxidization (anodization, in this embodiment) to have a thickness of 20 to 100 nm (preferably 30 to 50 nm). The insulating film serves as dielectric. In this embodiment, the connection wiring line <b>305</b> is a laminate of a film mainly containing aluminum and a film mainly containing titanium, and the film mainly containing aluminum is anodized to form an aluminum oxide film (alumina film) that is an anodized film. The anodized film in this embodiment corresponds to the insulating film <b>310</b>, and is used as the dielectric of the capacitor storage. An insulating oxide film obtained by anodization of a tantalum (Ta) film or a titanium (Ti) film also has high dielectric constant and therefore is suitable as the dielectric of the capacitor storage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">For the anodization treatment, a tartaric acid ethylene glycol solution with a low enough alkaline ion concentration is prepared first. The solution is obtained by mixing a 15% tartaric acid ammonium aqueous solution and ethylene glycol at a ratio of 2:8. Ammonia water is added to the mixture to adjust pH thereof to 7±0.5. A platinum electrode that serves as a cathode is set in the thus prepared solution, and the substrate on which the conductive layer is formed is immersed in the solution. The conductive layer works as an anode and a direct current of a given amount (several mA to several tens mA) is caused to flow. In this embodiment, a 200 mA current flows in one substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">Though the voltage between the cathode and the anode in the solution changes with time as the anodized substance grows, the voltage is raised at a given rate until it reaches 45 V while keeping the current constant. Then, the anodization treatment is ended. In this way, the insulating film <b>310</b> with a thickness of about 50 nm is formed on the surface of the connection wiring line <b>305</b>. The numeric values given here regarding the anodization are merely an example, and the optimal values naturally vary depending on the size of the element to be manufactured, and other factors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">When an anodized film is formed on an aluminum film under the anodization conditions of this embodiment, a Al<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>film with a thickness of 51.4 nm is obtained. A 1 mmϕ ITO film is formed on the Al<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>film and a voltage of 5 V is applied between the Al film, the Al<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>film, and the ITO film. As a result, a leakage current as minute as 1×10<sup>−11 </sup>A is measured. This shows that the Al<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>film can be used as dielectric of a capacitor storage of a light emitting device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">Although the insulating film <b>310</b> is formed by anodization here, the insulating film may be formed by a vapor phase method such as plasma CVD, thermal CVD, or sputtering. The insulating film may be a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon nitride oxide film, a DLC (diamond like carbon) film, a tantalum oxide film, or an organic insulating film.

A period it takes for the first set of one bit digital video signals to be inputted to the pixels of all the lines after all the gate lines (G<b>1</b> to Gy) are selected is a writing period Ta<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">As the writing period Ta<b>1</b> is ended, a display period Tr<b>1</b> is started. In the display period Tr<b>1</b>, the power supply electric potential of the power supply lines is set to a level that produces an electric potential difference with the electric potential of the opposite electrode large enough to cause the OLED to emit light when the power supply electric potential is given to the pixel electrode of the OLED.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">In the display period Tr<b>1</b>, whether the OLED <b>603</b> emits light or not is determined by the digital video signals that have been written in the pixels in the writing period Ta<b>1</b>. The driving TFT <b>602</b> is turned OFF when a digital video signal contains information of ‘0’. Accordingly, the power supply electric potential is not given to the pixel electrode of the OLED <b>603</b>. Therefore no light is emitted from the OLED <b>603</b> of a pixel to which a digital video signal having information of ‘0’ is inputted. When a digital video signal has information of ‘1’, on the other hand, the driving TFT <b>602</b> is turned ON. Then, the power supply electric potential is given to the pixel electrode of the OLED <b>603</b>. Therefore, light is emitted from the OLED <b>603</b> of a pixel to which a digital video signal having information of ‘1’ is inputted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">Thus, the OLED <b>603</b> emits or does not emit light in the display period Tr<b>1</b> and all the pixels are used to display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">As the display period Tr<b>1</b> is ended, a writing period Ta<b>2</b> is started and the power supply electric potential of the power supply lines is set to the same level as the electric potential of the opposite electrode of the OLED. Similar to the writing period Ta<b>1</b>, all the gate lines are selected one by one and a second set of one bit digital video signals are inputted to all of the pixels in order. The writing period Ta<b>2</b> is a period it takes for the second set of one bit digital video signals to be inputted to pixels of all the lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">As the writing period Ta<b>2</b> is ended, a display period Tr<b>2</b> is started. In this period, the power supply electric potential of the power supply lines is set to a level that produces an electric potential difference with the electric potential of the opposite electrode large enough to cause the OLED <b>603</b> to emit light when the power supply electric potential is given to the pixel electrode of the OLED <b>603</b>. Then, all of the pixels are used to display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">The above operation is repeated until inputting an n-th set of one bit digital video signals to the pixels is finished, alternating one writing period Ta with one display period Tr. When all display periods (Tr<b>1</b> to Trn) are completed, one image is displayed. In the driving method of this embodiment, a period required to display one image is called one frame period (F). When one frame period is ended, the next frame period is started. Then, the writing period Ta<b>1</b> is started again to repeat the operation described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">In a usual light emitting device, preferably sixty or more frame periods are provided in one second. If the number of images displayed in one second is less than sixty, flickering of image may become noticeable to the eye.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">In this embodiment, the lengths of all writing periods in total have to be shorter than the length of one frame period and it is necessary to set the ratio of lengths of display periods to satisfy Tr<b>1</b>:Tr<b>2</b>:Tr<b>3</b>: . . . :Tr(n−1):Trn=2<sup>0</sup>:2<sup>1</sup>:2<sup>2</sup>: . . . : 2<sup>(n-2)</sup>:2<sup>(n-1)</sup>. A desired gray scale out of 2<sup>n </sup>gray scales can be displayed by combining the display periods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">The gray scale of a pixel in one frame period is determined by the sum of lengths of display periods in the one frame period in which the OLED of that pixel emits light. For example, if n=8, a pixel obtains 100% of luminance when the pixel emits light in all display periods. When the pixel emits light in Tr<b>1</b> and Tr<b>2</b>, the luminance thereof is 1%. When the pixel emits light in Tr<b>3</b>, Tr<b>5</b>, and Tr<b>8</b>, the luminance thereof is 60%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">The display periods Tr<b>1</b> to Trn may be run in any order. For instance, in one frame period started by Tr<b>1</b>, Tr<b>3</b>, Tr<b>5</b>, Tr<b>2</b>, . . . may follow Tr<b>1</b> in this order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">In this embodiment, the power supply electric potential of the power supply lines is set to different levels in a writing period and in a display period. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. The power supply electric potential and the electric potential of the opposite electrode may always keep an electric potential difference large enough to cause the OLED to emit light when the power supply electric potential is given to the pixel electrode of the OLED. In this case, the OLED can emit light also in a writing period. Then, the gray scale of a pixel in one frame period is determined by the sum of lengths of writing periods and display periods in the one frame period in which the OLED of that pixel emits light. Here, lengths of writing periods and display periods for digital video signals of the respective bits have to be set to satisfy the following ratio. (Ta<b>1</b>+Tr<b>1</b>):(Ta<b>2</b>+Tr<b>2</b>):(Ta<b>3</b>+Tr<b>3</b>): . . . :(Ta(n−1)+Tr(n−1)):(Tan+Trn)=2<sup>0</sup>:2<sup>1</sup>:2<sup>2</sup>: . . . :2<sup>(n-2)</sup>:2<sup>(n-1)</sup>.</div>

The electric appliances of this embodiment can employ any light emitting device disclosed in Embodiments 1 through 9.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0237">With the above structure, the present invention allows the capacitor storage to overlap the TFT, thereby increasing the capacity of the capacitor storage while keeping the aperture ratio from lowering. Accordingly, a change in gate voltage due to leakage or other causes can be avoided to prevent a change in luminance of an OLED and flickering of screen in analog driving.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">Keeping the aperture ratio from lowering also leads to preventing the area of effective light emission of a pixel from being reduced. As the area of effective light emission is larger, the luminance of the screen is higher. Therefore, the structure of the present invention is effective in reducing power consumption.</div>
