<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="docdb" mxw-id="PA298327256" source="national office">
<div class="abstract">A privacy display comprises a polarized output spatial light modulator, reflective polarizer, switchable liquid crystal retarder and polarizer. In a privacy mode of operation, on-axis light from the spatial light modulator is directed without loss, whereas off-axis light has reduced luminance. Further, display reflectivity is reduced for on-axis reflections of ambient light, while reflectivity is increased for off-axis light. The visibility of the display to off-axis snoopers is reduced by means of luminance reduction and increased frontal reflectivity to ambient light. In a wide angle mode of operation, the liquid crystal retardance is adjusted so that off-axis luminance and reflectivity are unmodified.</div>

<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure generally relates to illumination from light modulation devices, and more specifically relates to reflective optical stacks for use in a display including a privacy display.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Privacy displays provide image visibility to a primary user that is typically in an on-axis position and reduced visibility of image content to a snooper, that is typically in an off-axis position. A privacy function may be provided by micro-louvre optical films that transmit a high luminance from a display in an on-axis direction with low luminance in off-axis positions, however such films are not switchable, and thus the display is limited to privacy only function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Switchable privacy displays may be provided by control of the off-axis optical output.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Control may be provided by means of luminance reduction, for example by means of switchable backlights for a liquid crystal display (LCD) spatial light modulator. Display backlights in general employ waveguides and light sources arranged along at least one input edge of the waveguide. Certain imaging directional backlights have the additional capability of directing the illumination through a display panel into viewing windows. An imaging system may be formed between multiple sources and the respective window images. One example of an imaging directional backlight is an optical valve that may employ a folded optical system and hence may also be an example of a folded imaging directional backlight. Light may propagate substantially without loss in one direction through the optical valve while counter-propagating light may be extracted by reflection off tilted facets as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,519,153, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Control of off-axis privacy may further be provided by means of contrast reduction, for example by adjusting the liquid crystal bias tilt in an In-Plane-Switching LCD.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Terms related to optical retarders for the purposes of the present disclosure will now be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">In a layer comprising a uniaxial birefringent material there is a direction governing the optical anisotropy whereas all directions perpendicular to it (or at a given angle to it) are optically equivalent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Optical axis refers to the direction of propagation of an unpolarised light ray in the uniaxial birefringent material in which no birefringence is experienced by the ray. For light propagating in a direction orthogonal to the optical axis, the optical axis is the slow axis when linearly polarized light with an electric vector direction parallel to the optical axis travels at the slowest speed. The slow axis direction is the direction with the highest refractive index at the design wavelength. Similarly the fast axis direction is the direction with the lowest refractive index at the design wavelength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">For positive dielectric anisotropy uniaxial birefringent materials the slow axis direction is the extraordinary axis of the birefringent material. For negative dielectric anisotropy uniaxial birefringent materials the fast axis direction is the extraordinary axis of the birefringent material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The terms half a wavelength and quarter a wavelength refer to the operation of a retarder for a design wavelength λ<sub>0 </sub>that may typically be between 450 nm and 570 nm. In the present illustrative embodiments exemplary retardance values are provided for a wavelength of 550 nm unless otherwise specified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">The retarder provides a phase shift between two perpendicular polarization components of the light wave incident thereon and is characterized by the amount of relative phase, Γ, that it imparts on the two polarization components; which is related to the birefringence Δn and the thickness d of the retarder by:
<br/>
Γ=2·π·Δ<i>n·d/λ</i> <sub>0</sub>  eqn. 1
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">where Δn is defined as the difference between the extraordinary and the ordinary index of refraction, i.e.
<br/>
Δ<i>n=n</i> <sub>e</sub> <i>−n</i> <sub>o</sub>  eqn. 2
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">For a half wave retarder, the relationship between d, Δn, and λ<sub>0 </sub>is chosen so that the phase shift between polarization components is Γ=π. For a quarter wave retarder, the relationship between d, Δn, and λ<sub>0 </sub>is chosen so that the phase shift between polarization components is Γ=π/2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">The term half wave retarder herein typically refers to light propagating normal to the retarder and normal to the spatial light modulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">In the present disclosure an ‘A-plate’ refers to an optical retarder utilizing a layer of birefringent material with its optical axis parallel to the plane of the layer. The plane of the retarders refers to the slow axis of the retarders extend in a plane, that is the x-y plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">A ‘positive A-plate’ refers to positively birefringent A-plates, i.e. A-plates with a positive Δn.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">In the present disclosure a ‘C-plate’ refers to an optical retarder utilizing a layer of birefringent material with its optical axis perpendicular to the plane of the layer. A ‘positive C-plate’ refers to positively birefringent C-plate, i.e. a C-plate with a positive Δn. A ‘negative C-plate’ refers to a negatively birefringent C-plate, i.e. a C-plate with a negative Δn.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">In the present disclosure an ‘O-plate’ refers to an optical retarder utilizing a layer of birefringent material with its optical axis having a component parallel to the plane of the layer and a component perpendicular to the plane of the layer. A ‘positive O-plate’ refers to positively birefringent O-plates, i.e. O-plates with a positive Δn.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Achromatic retarders may be provided wherein the material of the retarder is provided with a retardance Δn·d that varies with wavelength λ as:
<br/>
Δ<i>n·d/λ=κ</i>  eqn. 3
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">where κ is substantially a constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Examples of suitable materials include modified polycarbonates from Teijin Films. Achromatic retarders may be provided in the present embodiments to advantageously minimise colour changes between polar angular viewing directions which have low luminance reduction and polar angular viewing directions which have increased luminance reductions as will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Various other terms used in the present disclosure related to retarders and to liquid crystals will now be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">Homogeneous alignment refers to the alignment of liquid crystals in switchable liquid crystal displays where molecules align substantially parallel to a substrate. Homogeneous alignment is sometimes referred to as planar alignment. Homogeneous alignment may typically be provided with a small pre-tilt such as 2 degrees, so that the molecules at the surfaces of the alignment layers of the liquid crystal cell are slightly inclined as will be described below. Pretilt is arranged to minimise degeneracies in switching of cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In the present disclosure, homeotropic alignment is the state in which rod-like liquid crystalline molecules align substantially perpendicularly to the substrate. In discotic liquid crystals homeotropic alignment is defined as the state in which an axis of the column structure, which is formed by disc-like liquid crystalline molecules, aligns perpendicularly to a surface. In homeotropic alignment, pretilt is the tilt angle of the molecules that are close to the alignment layer and is typically close to 90 degrees and for example may be 88 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Liquid crystal molecules with positive dielectric anisotropy are switched from a homogeneous alignment (such as an A-plate retarder orientation) to a homeotropic alignment (such as a C-plate or O-plate retarder orientation) by means of an applied electric field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Liquid crystal molecules with negative dielectric anisotropy are switched from a homeotropic alignment (such as a C-plate or O-plate retarder orientation) to a homogeneous alignment (such as an A-plate retarder orientation) by means of an applied electric field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Rod-like molecules have a positive birefringence so that n<sub>e</sub>&gt;n<sub>o </sub>as described in equation 2. Discotic molecules have negative birefringence so that n<sub>e</sub>&lt;n<sub>o</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Positive retarders such as A-plates, positive O-plates and positive C-plates may typically be provided by stretched films or rod-like liquid crystal molecules. Negative retarders such as negative C-plates may be provided by stretched films or discotic like liquid crystal molecules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">Parallel liquid crystal cell alignment refers to the alignment direction of homogeneous alignment layers being parallel or more typically antiparallel. In the case of pre-tilted homeotropic alignment, the alignment layers may have components that are substantially parallel or antiparallel. Hybrid aligned liquid crystal cells may have one homogeneous alignment layer and one homeotropic alignment layer. Twisted liquid crystal cells may be provided by alignment layers that do not have parallel alignment, for example oriented at 90 degrees to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">Transmissive spatial light modulators may further comprise retarders between the input display polariser and the output display polariser for example as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,237,876, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Such retarders (not shown) are in a different place to the passive retarders of the present embodiments. Such retarders compensate for contrast degradations for off-axis viewing locations, which is a different effect to the luminance reduction for off-axis viewing positions of the present embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Optical isolation retarders provided between the display polariser and an OLED display emission layer are described further in U.S. Pat. No. 7,067,985. Optical isolation retarders are in a different place to the passive retarders of the present embodiments. Isolation retarder reduces frontal reflections from the OLED display emission layer which is a different effect to the luminance reduction for off-axis viewing positions of the present embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">Reflective polarisers are polarisers that reflect one polarisation component of incident light and transmit a second orthogonal polarisation component. Examples of reflective polarisers are multilayer polymeric film stacks such as DBEF™ or APF™ from 3M Corporation, or wire grid polarisers such as ProFlux™ from Moxtek.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">The structure and operation of various switchable display devices will now be described. In this description, common elements have common reference numerals. It is noted that the disclosure relating to any element applies to each device in which the same or corresponding element is provided. Accordingly, for brevity such disclosure is not repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in side perspective view an optical stack of a display device for use in ambient illumination; <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in side perspective view a switchable privacy display for use in ambient illumination comprising an emissive spatial light modulator and compensated switchable retarder; and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in front view alignment of optical layers in the optical stack of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">A display device <b>100</b> for use in ambient illumination <b>604</b> comprises: a spatial light modulator <b>48</b> arranged to output light <b>400</b>; wherein the spatial light modulator <b>48</b> comprises an output polariser <b>218</b> arranged on the output side of the spatial light modulator <b>48</b>; an additional polariser <b>318</b> arranged on the output side of the output polariser <b>218</b>; a reflective polariser <b>302</b> arranged between the output polariser <b>218</b> and the additional polariser <b>318</b>; and plural retarders <b>300</b> arranged between the reflective polariser <b>302</b> and the additional polariser <b>318</b>. The electric vector transmission direction <b>303</b> of the reflective polariser <b>302</b> is parallel to the electric vector transmission direction <b>319</b> of the additional polariser <b>318</b>. The electric vector transmission direction <b>303</b> of the reflective polariser <b>302</b> is parallel to the electric vector transmission direction <b>219</b> of the output polariser <b>218</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">Thus a display device for use in ambient illumination <b>604</b> comprises a spatial light modulator <b>48</b> arranged to output light <b>400</b>. In the present disclosure, spatial light modulator <b>48</b> may comprise a liquid crystal display comprising input polariser <b>210</b>, output polariser <b>218</b> with substrates <b>212</b>, <b>216</b>, liquid crystal layer <b>214</b> and red, green and blue pixels <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>. Backlight <b>20</b> may be arranged to illuminate the spatial light modulator <b>48</b> and may comprise input light sources <b>15</b>, waveguide <b>1</b>, rear reflector <b>3</b> and optical stack <b>5</b> comprising diffusers, light turning films and other known optical backlight structures. Asymmetric diffusers, that may comprise asymmetric surface relief features for example, may be provided in the optical stack <b>5</b> with increased diffusion in the elevation direction in comparison to the lateral direction may be provided. Advantageously image uniformity may be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">In the present embodiments, the backlight <b>20</b> may be arranged to provide an angular light distribution that has reduced luminance for off-axis viewing positions in comparison to head-on luminance. A typical wide angle backlight has a roll-off at higher angles such that the full width half maximum of relative luminance may be preferably greater than 40°, more preferably greater than 60° and most preferably greater than 80°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">The backlight <b>20</b> may be a directional backlight that provides a luminance at polar angles to the normal to the spatial light modulator greater than 45 degrees that is at most 30% of the luminance along the normal to the spatial light modulator, preferably at most 20% of the luminance along the normal to the spatial light modulator, and more preferably at most 10% of the luminance along the normal to the spatial light modulator. In an illustrative embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the luminance at polar angles to the normal to the spatial light modulator greater than 45 degrees may be at most 18%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">Backlight <b>20</b> may further comprise a switchable backlight arranged to switch the output angular luminance profile in order to provide reduced off-axis luminance in a privacy mode of operation and higher off-axis luminance in a wide angle mode of operation. Such a directional backlight provides some off-axis luminance reduction, advantageously increasing head-on efficiency and reducing display visibility and stray light for off-axis locations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">The display may further comprise a reflective recirculation polariser <b>208</b> arranged between the backlight <b>20</b> and spatial light modulator <b>48</b>. The reflective recirculation polariser <b>208</b> is different to the reflective polariser <b>302</b> of the present embodiments. Reflective recirculation polariser <b>208</b> provides reflection of polarised light from the backlight that has a polarisation that is orthogonal to the electric vector transmission direction of the dichroic input polariser <b>210</b>. Reflective recirculation polariser <b>208</b> does not reflect ambient light <b>604</b> to a snooper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the spatial light modulator <b>48</b> may alternatively be provided by other display types that provide output light <b>400</b> by emission, such as organic LED displays (OLED), with output polariser <b>218</b>. Output polariser <b>218</b> may provide reduction of luminance for light reflected from the OLED pixel plane by means of one or more retarders <b>518</b> inserted between the output display polariser <b>218</b> and OLED pixel plane. The one or more retarders <b>518</b> may be a quarter waveplate and is different to the retarder <b>330</b> of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Thus the spatial light modulator <b>48</b> comprises an output polariser <b>218</b> arranged on the output side of the spatial light modulator <b>48</b>. The output polariser <b>218</b> may be arranged to provide high extinction ratio for light from the pixels <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> of the spatial light modulator <b>48</b> and to prevent back reflections from the reflective polariser <b>302</b> towards the pixels <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">An additional polariser <b>318</b> is arranged on the output side of the output polariser <b>218</b>. Typical polarisers <b>210</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>318</b> may be polarisers such as dichroic polarisers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">Reflective polariser <b>302</b> is arranged between the output polariser <b>218</b> and the additional polariser <b>318</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Plural retarders <b>300</b> is arranged between the reflective polariser <b>302</b> and the additional polariser <b>318</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, the plural retarders <b>300</b> comprise passive retarder <b>330</b> and switchable liquid crystal retarder <b>301</b>, but in general may be replaced by other configurations of at least one retarder, some examples of which are present in the devices described below.

Correction retarder <b>630</b> may comprise birefringent material, represented by refractive index ellipsoid <b>632</b> with optical axis direction <b>634</b> at 0 degrees to the x-axis, and have a thickness <b>631</b>. Normal light rays <b>636</b> propagate so that the path length in the material is the same as the thickness <b>631</b>. Light rays <b>637</b> are in the y-z plane have an increased path length; however the birefringence of the material is substantially the same as the rays <b>636</b>. By way of comparison light rays <b>638</b> that are in the x-z plane have an increased path length in the birefringent material and further the birefringence is different to the normal ray <b>636</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0362" num="0361">The retardance of the retarder <b>630</b> is thus dependent on the angle of incidence of the respective ray, and also the plane of incidence, that is rays <b>638</b> in the x-z will have a retardance different from the normal rays <b>636</b> and the rays <b>637</b> in the y-z plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0363" num="0362">The interaction of polarized light with the retarder <b>630</b> will now be described. To distinguish from the first and second polarization components during operation in a directional backlight <b>101</b>, the following explanation will refer to third and fourth polarization components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0364" num="0363"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33B</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in perspective view illumination of a retarder layer by off-axis light of a third linear polarization state at 90 degrees to the x-axis and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33C</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in perspective view illumination of a retarder layer by off-axis light of a fourth linear polarization state at 0 degrees to the x-axis. In such arrangements, the incident linear polarization states are aligned to the optical axes of the birefringent material, represented by ellipse <b>632</b>. Consequently, no phase difference between the third and fourth orthogonal polarization components is provided, and there is no resultant change of the polarization state of the linearly polarized input for each ray <b>636</b>, <b>637</b>, <b>638</b>. Thus, the retarder <b>630</b> introduces no phase shift to polarisation components of light passed by the polariser on the input side of the retarder <b>630</b> along an axis along a normal to the plane of the retarder <b>630</b>. Accordingly, the retarder <b>630</b> does not affect the luminance of light passing through the retarder <b>630</b> and polarisers (not shown) on each side of the retarder <b>630</b>. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A-C</figref> relate specifically to the retarder <b>630</b> that is passive, a similar effect is achieved by the retarders in the devices described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0365" num="0364"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33D</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in perspective view illumination of a retarder <b>630</b> layer by off-axis light of a linear polarization state at 45 degrees. The linear polarization state may be resolved into third and fourth polarization components that are respectively orthogonal and parallel to optical axis <b>634</b> direction. The retarder thickness <b>631</b> and material retardance represented by refractive index ellipsoid <b>632</b> may provide a net effect of relatively shifting the phase of the third and fourth polarization components incident thereon in a normal direction represented by ray <b>636</b> by half a wavelength, for a design wavelength. The design wavelength may for example be in the range of 500 to 550 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0366" num="0365">At the design wavelength and for light propagating normally along ray <b>636</b> then the output polarization may be rotated by 90 degrees to a linear polarization state <b>640</b> at −45 degrees. Light propagating along ray <b>637</b> may see a phase difference that is similar but not identical to the phase difference along ray <b>637</b> due to the change in thickness, and thus an elliptical polarization state <b>639</b> may be output which may have a major axis similar to the linear polarization axis of the output light for ray <b>636</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0367" num="0366">By way of contrast, the phase difference for the incident linear polarization state along ray <b>638</b> may be significantly different, in particular a lower phase difference may be provided. Such phase difference may provide an output polarization state <b>644</b> that is substantially circular at a given inclination angle <b>642</b>. Thus, the retarder <b>630</b> introduces a phase shift to polarisation components of light passed by the polariser on the input side of the retarder <b>630</b> along an axis corresponding to ray <b>638</b> that is inclined to a normal to the plane of the retarder <b>630</b>. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29D</figref> relates to the retarder <b>630</b> that is passive, a similar effect is achieved by the retarders described above, in a switchable state of the switchable liquid crystal retarder corresponding to the privacy mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0368" num="0367">To illustrate the off-axis behaviour of retarder stacks, the angular luminance control of C-plates <b>308</b>A, <b>308</b>B between an additional polariser <b>318</b> and output display polariser <b>218</b> will now be described for various off-axis illumination arrangements with reference to the operation of a C-plate between the parallel polarisers <b>500</b>, <b>210</b> will now be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0369" num="0368"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in perspective view illumination of a C-plate layer by off-axis polarised light with a positive elevation. Incident linear polarisation component <b>704</b> is incident onto the birefringent material <b>632</b> of the retarder <b>560</b> that is a C-plate with optical axis direction <b>507</b> that is perpendicular to the plane of the retarder <b>560</b>. Polarisation component <b>704</b> sees no net phase difference on transmission through the liquid crystal molecule and so the output polarisation component is the same as component <b>704</b>. Thus a maximum transmission is seen through the polariser <b>210</b>. Thus the retarder <b>560</b> having an optical axis <b>561</b> perpendicular to the plane of the retarder <b>560</b>, that is the x-y plane. The retarder <b>560</b> having an optical axis perpendicular to the plane of the retarder comprises a C-plate.</div>

As with the arrangement of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref>, polarisation state <b>704</b> sees no net phase difference and is transmitted with maximum luminance. Thus, the retarder <b>560</b> introduces no phase shift to polarisation components of light passed by the polariser on the input side of the retarder <b>560</b> along an axis along a normal to the plane of the retarder <b>560</b>.

The resultant elliptical polarisation component <b>656</b> is transmitted through polariser <b>210</b> with reduced luminance in comparison to the rays illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A-B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0372" num="0371"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34D</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in perspective view illumination of a C-plate layer by off-axis polarised light with a positive elevation and positive lateral angle.

Thus, the retarder <b>560</b> introduces a phase shift to polarisation components of light passed by the polariser on the input side of the retarder <b>560</b> along an axis that is inclined to a normal to the plane of the retarder <b>560</b>. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29D</figref> relates to the retarder <b>560</b> that is passive, a similar effect is achieved by the retarders described above, in a switchable state of the switchable liquid crystal retarder corresponding to the privacy mode.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0374" num="0373">To illustrate the off-axis behaviour of retarder stacks, the angular luminance control of crossed A-plates <b>308</b>A, <b>308</b>B between an additional polariser <b>318</b> and output display polariser <b>218</b> will now be described for various off-axis illumination arrangements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0375" num="0374"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in perspective view illumination of crossed A-plate retarder layers by off-axis polarised light with a positive elevation. Linear polariser <b>218</b> with electric vector transmission direction <b>219</b> is used to provide a linear polarisation state <b>704</b> that is parallel to the lateral direction onto first A-plate <b>308</b>A of the crossed A-plates <b>308</b>A, <b>308</b>B. The optical axis direction <b>309</b>A is inclined at +45 degrees to the lateral direction. The retardance of the retarder <b>308</b>A for the off-axis angle θ<sub>1 </sub>in the positive elevation direction provides a resultant polarisation component <b>650</b> that is generally elliptical on output. Polarisation component <b>650</b> is incident onto the second A-plate <b>308</b>B of the crossed A-plates <b>308</b>A, <b>308</b>B that has an optical axis direction <b>309</b>B that is orthogonal to the optical axis direction <b>309</b>A of the first A-plate <b>308</b>A.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0376" num="0375">The output polarisation component is aligned to the electric vector transmission direction of the additional polariser <b>318</b>, and thus is transmitted efficiently.
