<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The term “nanoparticle” as used herein indicates a composite structure of nanoscale dimensions. In particular, nanoparticles are typically particles of a size in the range of from about 1 to about 1000 nm, and are usually spherical although different morphologies are possible depending on the nanoparticle composition. The portion of the nanoparticle contacting an environment external to the nanoparticle is generally identified as the surface of the nanoparticle. In nanoparticles herein described, the size limitation can be restricted to two dimensions and so that nanoparticles herein described include composite structure having a diameter from about 1 to about 1000 nm, where the specific diameter depends on the nanoparticle composition and on the intended use of the nanoparticle according to the experimental design. For example, nanoparticles to be used in several therapeutic applications typically have a size of about 200 nm or below, and the ones used, in particular, for delivery associated to cancer treatment typically have a diameter from about 1 to about 100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Additional desirable properties of the nanoparticle, such as surface charges and steric stabilization, can also vary in view of the specific application of interest. Exemplary properties that can be desirable in clinical applications such as cancer treatment are described in Davis et al, 2008, Duncan 2006 and Allen 2002 each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Additional techniques suitable to detect other chemical properties comprise by <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>11</sup>B, and <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>19</sup>F NMR, UV/Vis and infrared/Raman spectroscopies and fluorescence spectroscopy (when nanoparticle is used in combination with fluorescent labels) and additional techniques identifiable by a skilled person.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Nanoparticles and related compositions, methods, and systems herein described can be used to deliver a compound of interest and in particular an agent to a predetermined target.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The term “deliver” and “delivery” as used herein indicates the activity of affecting the spatial location of a compound, and in particular controlling said location. Accordingly, delivering a compound in the sense of the present disclosure indicates the ability to affect positioning and movement of the compound at a certain time under a certain set of conditions, so that the compound's positioning and movement under those conditions are altered with respect to the positioning and movement that the compound would otherwise have.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In particular, delivery of a compound with respect to a reference endpoint indicates the ability to control positioning and movement of the compound so that the compound is eventually positioned on the selected reference endpoint. In an in vitro system, delivery of a compound is usually associated to a corresponding modification of the chemical and/or biological detectable properties and activities of the compound. In an in vivo system, delivery of a compound is also typically associated with modification of the pharmacokinetics and possibly pharmacodynamics of the compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Pharmacokinetic of a compound indicates absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the compound from the system, typically provided by the body of an individual.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Several polymers containing polyols are commercially available and/or can be produced using techniques and procedures identifiable by a skilled person. Exemplary procedures for the synthesis of an exemplary polyol polymer are described in Liu et al 2005, and others are illustrated in Examples 1-4. Additional procedures for making polymer containing polyols will be identifiable by a skilled person in view of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The term “polymer containing a boronic acid” or “BA polymer” as used herein indicates polymer containing at least one boronic acid group presented for binding to a hydroxyl group of a polymer containing polyols. In particular, polymers containing boronic acids of the nanoparticles herein described include a polymer comprising in at least one structural unit an alkyl or aryl substituted boronic acid containing a carbon to boron chemical bond. Suitable BA polymers comprise polymers wherein boronic acid is in a terminal structural unit or in any other suitable position to provide the resulting polymer with hydrophilic properties. Exemplary polymers containing polyols comprise polymers of about 40,000 or less molecular weight and in particular of about 20,000 or less, or about 10,000 or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Several polymer containing a boronic acids are commercially available and/or can be produced using techniques and procedures identifiable by a skilled person.

The term “coupled” or “coupling” as used herein with reference to attachment between two molecules indicates an interaction forming a reversible covalent linkage. In particular, in presence of a suitable medium, a boronic acid presented on the BA polymer interact with hydroxyl groups of the polyols via a rapid and reversible pair-wise covalent interaction to form boronic esters in a suitable medium. Suitable medium include water and several aqueous solutions and additional organic media identifiable by a skilled person. In particular, when contacted in an aqueous medium BA polymers and polyols polymers react, producing water as a side product. The boronic acid polyol interaction is generally more favorable in aqueous solutions but is also known to proceed in organic media. In addition, cyclic esters formed with 1,2 and 1,3 diols are generally more stable than their acyclic ester counterparts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Accordingly, in a nanoparticle herein described, at least one boronic acid of the polymer containing a boronic acid is bound to hydroxyl groups of the polymer containing a polyol with a reversible covalent linkage. Formation of a boronic ester between BA polymers and polyols polymers can be detected by methods and techniques identifiable by a skilled person such as boron-11 nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>11</sup>B NMR), potentiomeric titration, UV/Vis and fluorescent detection techniques whereby the technique of choice is dependent on the specific chemical nature and properties of the boronic acid and polyol composing the nanoparticle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">A nanoparticle resulting from coupling interactions of a BA polymer herein described with a polyol polymer herein described presents the BA polymer on the surface of the particle. In several embodiments the nanoparticles can have a diameter from about 1 to about 1000 nm and a spherical morphology although the dimensions and morphology of the particle are largely determined by the specific BA polymer and polyol polymers used to form the nanoparticles and by the compounds that are carried on the nanoparticles according to the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In several embodiments the compound of interest carried by the nanoparticle forms part of the BA polymer and/or the polyol polymers. Examples of such embodiments are provided by nanoparticles wherein one or more atoms of a polymer is replaced by a specific isotope e.g. <sup>19</sup>F and <sup>10</sup>B, and are therefore suitable as agent for imaging the target and/or providing radiation treatment to the target.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In several embodiments, the compound of interest carried the nanoparticle is attached to a polymer, typically a polyol polymer, through covalent or non covalent linkage. Examples of such embodiments are provided by nanoparticles wherein one or more moieties in at least one of the polyol polymer and BA polymer attaches one or more compounds of interest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The term “attach”, “attached” or “attachment” as used herein, refers to connecting or uniting by a bond, link, force or tie in order to keep two or more components together, which encompasses either direct or indirect attachment such that for example where a first compound is directly bound to a second compound, and the embodiments wherein one or more intermediate compounds, and in particular molecules, are disposed between the first compound and the second compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In particular, in some embodiments a compound can be attached to the polyol polymer or BA polymer through covalent linkage of the compound to suitable moieties of the polymer. Exemplary covalent linkages are illustrated in Example 19 where, attachment of the drug Camptothecin to Mucic Acid polymer is performed through biodegradable ester bond linkage, and in Example 9, wherein attachment of transferrin to BA-PEG<sub>5000 </sub>is performed through pegylation of the transferrin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the polymer can be designed or modified to enable the attachment of a specific compound of interest, for example by adding one or more functional groups able to specifically bind a corresponding functional group on the compound of interest. For example, in several embodiments it is possible to PEGylate the nanoparticle with a BA-PEG-X, where X can be a Maleimide or an iodoacetyl group or any leaving group that will react specifically with a thiol or non-specifically with an amine. The compound to be attached can then react to the maleimide or iodoacetyl groups after modification to express a thiol functional group. The compound to be attached can also be modified with aldehydes or ketone groups and these can react via a condensation reaction with the diols on the polyols to give acetals or ketals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, a compound of interest can be attached to the polyol polymer or BA polymer through non covalent bonds such as ionic bonds and intermolecular interactions, between a compound to be attached and a suitable moiety of the polymer. Exemplary non covalent linkages are illustrated in Example 10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">A compound of interest can be attached to the nanoparticle before, upon or after formation of the nanoparticle, for example via modification of a polymer and/or of any attached compound in the particulate composite. Exemplary procedures to perform attachment of a compound on the nanoparticle are illustrated in the Examples section. Additional procedures to attach a compound to a BA polymer polyol polymer or other components of the nanoparticle herein described (e.g. a previously introduced compound of interest) can be identified by a skilled person upon reading of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, at least one compound of interest attached to a BA polymer presented on the nanoparticle herein described is an agent that can be used as a targeting ligand. In particular, in several embodiments, the nanoparticle attaches on the BA polymer one or more agents to be used as a targeting ligand, and on the polyol polymer and/or the BA polymer, one or more agents to be delivered to a target of choice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The term “targeting ligand” as used in the present disclosure indicates any molecule that can be presented on the surface of a nanoparticle for the purpose of engaging a specific target, and in particular specific cellular recognition, for example by enabling cell receptor attachment of the nanoparticle. Examples of suitable ligands include, but are not limited to, vitamins (e.g. folic acid), proteins (e.g. transferrin, and monoclonal antibodies), monosaccharides (e.g. galactose), peptides, and polysaccharides. In particular targeting ligands can be antibodies against certain surface cell receptors such as anti-VEGF, small molecules such as folic acid and other proteins such as holo-transferrin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The choice of ligand, as one of ordinary skill appreciates, may vary depending upon the type of delivery desired. As another example, the ligand may be membrane permeabilizing or membrane permeable agent such as the TAT protein from HIV-1. The TAT protein is a viral transcriptional activation that is actively imported into the cell nucleus. Torchilin, V. P. et al, PNAS. 98, 8786 8791, (2001). Suitable targeting ligands attached to a BA polymer typically comprise a flexible spacer such as a poly(ethylene oxide) with a boronic acid attached to its distal end (see Example 9).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In several embodiments, at least one of the compounds comprised or attached to the polyol polymer and/or BA polymer (including a targeting ligand) can be an agent and in particular a drug, to be delivered to a target, for example an individual, to which the chemical or biological activity, e.g. the therapeutic activity, is to be exerted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Selection of a polyol polymer and a BA polymer suitable to form a nanoparticle herein described can be performed in view of the compound and the target of interest. In particular, selection of a suitable polymer containing a polyol and a suitable BA polymer to form a nanoparticle herein described can be performed by providing candidate polyol polymers and BA polymer, and selecting the polyol polymer and the BA polymer able to form a coupling interaction in the sense of the disclosure, wherein the selected BA polymer and polyol polymer have a chemical composition such that in view of the compound of interest and targeting ligand to comprised or attached to the polyol polymers and/or the BA polymers, the polyol polymers is less hydrophilic than the BA polymer. Detection of the BA polymer on the surface of the nanoparticle and related presentation on the environment external to the nanoparticle can be performed by detection of the zeta potential which can demonstrate modification of the surface of the nanoparticle as illustrated in Example 12. (see in particular <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) Additional procedures to detect the surface charge of the particles and the stability of the particles in salt solutions, include detection of changes of the particle size such as the ones exemplified in Example 12 (see in particular <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and additional procedures identifiable by a skilled person.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0154">Exemplary agents and targeting ligands that can be attached to nanoparticles of the present disclosure comprise organic or inorganic molecules, including polynucleotides, nucleotides, aptamers polypeptides, proteins, polysaccharides macromolecular complexes including but not limited to those comprising a mixture of protein and polynucleotides, saccharides and/or polysaccharides, viruses, molecules with radioisotopes, antibodies or antibody fragments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0155">The term “polynucleotide” as used herein indicates an organic polymer composed of two or more monomers including nucleotides, nucleosides or analogs thereof. The term “nucleotide” refers to any of several compounds that consist of a ribose or deoxyribose sugar joined to a purine or pyrimidine base and to a phosphate group and that is the basic structural unit of nucleic acids. The term “nucleoside” refers to a compound (such as guanosine or adenosine) that consists of a purine or pyrimidine base combined with deoxyribose or ribose and is found especially in nucleic acids. The term “nucleotide analog” or “nucleoside analog” refers respectively to a nucleotide or nucleoside in which one or more individual atoms have been replaced with a different atom or a with a different functional group. Accordingly, the term “polynucleotide” includes nucleic acids of any length, and in particular DNA, RNA, analogs and fragments thereof. A polynucleotide of three or more nucleotides is also called “nucleotidic oligomer” or “oligonucleotide.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0156">The term “aptamers” as used here indicates oligonucleic acid or peptide molecules that bind a specific target. In particular, nucleic acid aptamers can comprise, for example, nucleic acid species that have been engineered through repeated rounds of in vitro selection or equivalently, SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to bind to various molecular targets such as small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, and even cells, tissues and organisms. Aptamers are useful in biotechnological and therapeutic applications as they offer molecular recognition properties that rival that of the antibodies. Peptide aptamers are peptides that are designed to specifically bind to and interfere with protein-protein interactions inside cells. In particular, peptide aptamers can be derived, for example, according to a selection strategy that is derived from the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. In particular, according to this strategy, a variable peptide aptamer loop attached to a transcription factor binding domain is screened against the target protein attached to a transcription factor activating domain. In vivo binding of the peptide aptamer to its target via this selection strategy is detected as expression of a downstream yeast marker gene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0157">The term “polypeptide” as used herein indicates an organic linear, circular, or branched polymer composed of two or more amino acid monomers and/or analogs thereof. The term “polypeptide” includes amino acid polymers of any length including full length proteins and peptides, as well as analogs and fragments thereof. A polypeptide of three or more amino acids is also called a protein oligomer, peptide or oligopeptide. In particular, the terms “peptide” and “oligopeptide” usually indicate a polypeptide with less than 50 amino acid monomers. As used herein the term “amino acid”, “amino acidic monomer”, or “amino acid residue” refers to any of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids, non-natural amino acids, and artificial amino acids and includes both D an L optical isomers. In particular, non-natural amino acids include D-stereoisomers of naturally occurring amino acids (these including useful ligand building blocks because they are not susceptible to enzymatic degradation). The term “artificial amino acids” indicate molecules that can be readily coupled together using standard amino acid coupling chemistry, but with molecular structures that do not resemble the naturally occurring amino acids. The term “amino acid analog” refers to an amino acid in which one or more individual atoms have been replaced, either with a different atom, isotope, or with a different functional group but is otherwise identical to original amino acid from which the analog is derived. All of these amino acids can be synthetically incorporated into a peptide or polypeptide using standard amino acid coupling chemistries. The term “polypeptide” as used herein includes polymers comprising one or more monomer, or building blocks other than an amino acid monomer. The terms monomer, subunit, or building blocks indicate chemical compounds that under appropriate conditions can become chemically bonded to another monomer of the same or different chemical nature to form a polymer. The term “polypeptide” is further intended to comprise a polymer wherein one or more of the building blocks is covalently bound to another by a chemical bond other than amide or peptide bond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0158">The term “protein” as used herein indicates a polypeptide with a particular secondary and tertiary structure that can participate in, but not limited to, interactions with other biomolecules including other proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, metabolites, hormones, chemokines, and small molecules. Exemplary proteins herein described are antibodies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0159">The term “antibody” as used herein refers to a protein of the kind that is produced by activated B cells after stimulation by an antigen and can bind specifically to the antigen promoting an immune response in biological systems. Full antibodies typically consist of four subunits including two heavy chains and two light chains. The term antibody includes natural and synthetic antibodies, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies or fragments thereof. Exemplary antibodies include IgA, IgD, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgM and the like. Exemplary fragments include Fab Fv, Fab′ F(ab′)2 and the like. A monoclonal antibody is an antibody that specifically binds to and is thereby defined as complementary to a single particular spatial and polar organization of another biomolecule which is termed an “epitope”. In some forms, monoclonal antibodies can also have the same structure. A polyclonal antibody refers to a mixture of different monoclonal antibodies. In some forms, polyclonal antibodies can be a mixture of monoclonal antibodies where at least two of the monoclonal antibodies binding to a different antigenic epitope. The different antigenic epitopes can be on the same target, different targets, or a combination. Antibodies can be prepared by techniques that are well known in the art, such as immunization of a host and collection of sera (polyclonal) or by preparing continuous hybridoma cell lines and collecting the secreted protein (monoclonal).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0160">In several embodiments, polyol polymers form a non-covalent complex or linkage with one or more compounds of interest to be delivered according to the schematic illustration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0161">In several embodiments, a nanoparticle structure comprises an agent and a polymer containing a polyol, where the agent is linked to a polyol polymer by a covalent bond. An example of a polyol polymer conjugated to an agent is detailed in Examples 16-21. In these embodiments, polyol polymers conjugated to an agent (herein referred to as “polyol polymer-agent conjugate”) form nanoparticles whose structure presents sites on their surface for interaction with BA molecules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0162">In several of those embodiments, the nanoparticle further comprises BA polymers configured to provide steric stabilization and/or targeting functionality to the nanoparticle. In particular, in those embodiments the addition of a BA polymer allows minimizing of self-aggregation and undesired interactions with other nanoparticles, thus providing enhanced salt and serum stability. For example, steric stabilization is herein provided by the BA polymer having PEG as illustrated by the exemplary nanoparticle described in Example 12.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0163">In such embodiments, the structure of this nanoparticle affords several advantages over agents delivery methods of the prior art, such as the ability to provide controlled release of one or more agents. This feature can be provided, for example, by the use of a biodegradable ester linkage between the agent and the polyol polymer. A person skilled in the art will recognize other potential linkages suitable for this purpose. In these embodiments, another advantage is the ability to provide specific targeting of the agent through the BA polymer moiety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0164">In several embodiments, BA polymers may comprise a fluorinated boronic acid (Example 7) or a fluorinated cleavable boronic acid (Example 8) capable of being used as an imaging agent in MRI or other similar techniques.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0225">When a polymer of Example 4 is assembled with nucleic acids, e.g., siRNAs, they will form nanoparticles. These nanoparticles will need to have steric stabilization to be used in mammals and optionally they could have targeting agents included. To perform these two functions, the nanoparticles can be decorated with PEG for steric stabilization and PEG-targeting ligands. To do so, PEG compounds containing boronic acids are prepared. For example, a PEG containing boronic acid can be synthesized according the example below.</div>
