<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to on-line operations and, more particularly, to operations pertaining to on-line forms and registrations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Today, the Internet has facilitated electronic transmission and filing of documents. Various business or legal forms and documents are available on-line via the Internet. Electronic filing of certain documents or forms (including registrations) is permitted, such as patent or trademark applications, product or user registrations, or court filings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Nevertheless, the sophistication often required to prepare or file such documents or forms is significant and thus renders ordinary lay persons seriously disadvantaged in utilizing such on-line documents or forms. Many times the documents or forms require careful wording for clarity or legal purposes. As an example, legal documents need to be carefully crafted to provide the legal protection sought. Given the complexities often involved, the creation and filing of electronic documents is largely still manually performed by skilled or experienced persons. There are many books and sample documents (both on-line and off-line) that can be found after some effort, but it is difficult to not only locate the appropriate samples or forms but also to complete or alter the samples or forms for a user's particular situation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is a need for improved techniques for improved approaches to enable and assist unsophisticated persons to utilize on-line forms or documents.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Broadly speaking, the invention pertains to improved approaches to completing, submitting and updating on-line forms or registrations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the invention pertains to techniques for completing on-line forms, on-line filings or registrations. In one embodiment, the invention is an on-line form completion agent or an on-line registration agent for intelligently guiding on-line form completion or registration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the invention pertains to techniques for automatically monitoring a registration to determine whether the registration needs updated. While the type of registration can vary widely, e.g., registration form, the registrations have identify registrations information or registration content that may need monitoring to insure that the registration is up-to-date. The invention is particularly useful for monitoring copyright registrations, more particularly, copyright registrations for on-line works, for example, websites.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">One aspect of the invention is that domain name monitoring. The monitoring of domain names, e.g., registrations therefor, is beneficial to holders of similar domain names, trademark owners, and competitors. Such monitoring can be automatically performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Another aspect of the invention pertains to techniques for completing on-line forms, on-line filings or registrations. In one embodiment, the invention is an on-line form completion agent or an on-line registration agent for intelligently guiding on-line form completion or registration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Still another aspect of the invention pertains to techniques for automatically monitoring a registration to determine whether the registration needs updated. While the type of registration can vary widely, e.g., registration form, the registrations have identify registrations information or registration content that may need monitoring to insure that the registration is up to date. The invention is particularly useful for monitoring copyright registrations, more particularly, copyright registrations for on-line works, for example, websites.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Embodiments of this aspect of the invention are discussed below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-10</figref>. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">As previously noted, one aspect of the invention pertains to techniques for completing on-line forms, on-line filings or registrations. In one embodiment, the invention is an on-line form completion agent or an on-line registration agent for intelligently guiding an on-line registration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a block diagram of a web agent system <b>100</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The web agent system <b>100</b> includes a primary server <b>102</b> and an agent server <b>104</b>. The primary server <b>102</b> and the agent server <b>104</b> are coupled to the Internet <b>106</b>. Typically, the primary server <b>102</b> and the agent server <b>104</b> are coupled to the Internet <b>106</b> through high speed connections, such as T1 lines, ISDN lines, etc. The web agent system <b>100</b> also includes an Internet service provider (ISP) <b>108</b> and a computer <b>110</b>. A computer <b>110</b> includes, among other things, a browser <b>112</b> (i.e., network browser) that facilitates a user's access to servers provided on the Internet. In the case of this embodiment, the browser <b>112</b> is used to facilitate user access to the agent server <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The web agent system <b>100</b> operates to provide an improved graphical user interface (GUI) to the user of the browser <b>112</b> of the computer <b>110</b>. In particular, the general scenario is that the user of the browser <b>112</b> of the computer <b>110</b> desires to interact with the primary server <b>102</b> through the Internet <b>106</b>. However, according to the invention, to provide an enhanced graphical user interface and/or greater sophistication, the browser <b>112</b> is instead directed to the agent server <b>104</b>. The agent server <b>104</b> then in turn communicates with the primary server <b>102</b> on behalf of the user of the browser <b>112</b>. As a result, the user of the browser <b>112</b> achieves the same results by interacting with the agent server <b>104</b> that would be obtained if the user directly interacted with the primary server <b>102</b>. By communicating with the agent server <b>104</b> the browser <b>112</b> can receive an improved GUI, can receive additional guidance than provided by the primary server <b>102</b>, and/or can be required to enter less data than if accessing the primary server <b>102</b>. Hence, by using the agent server <b>104</b> in place of the primary server <b>102</b>, the user of the browser <b>112</b> on the computer <b>110</b> is advantageously provided with an enhanced interaction with the agent server <b>104</b> than would be available if the browser <b>112</b> interacted with the primary server <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a flow diagram of agent processing <b>120</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The agent processing <b>120</b> is, for example, performed by the web agent system <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The agent processing <b>120</b> initially accesses an agent web interface. The agent web interface is provided by the agent server <b>104</b>. The agent web interface is a GUI offered by the agent server <b>104</b> to a visiting user. As an example, the agent web interface can be implemented as a markup language document or page that is displayed by the browser. Examples of markup language are HTML and XML. Next, user input is provided <b>124</b> to the agent web interface. Here, the user of the browser <b>112</b> inputs data that is supplied to the agent server <b>104</b>. The agent server <b>104</b> then processes <b>126</b> the user input to determine input data. The resulting input data is then forwarded <b>128</b> from the agent server <b>104</b> to the primary server <b>102</b>. At the primary server <b>104</b>, the input data is processed <b>130</b> to produce response data. Then, the response data is forwarded <b>132</b> from the primary server <b>102</b> to the agent server <b>104</b>. Thereafter, the agent server <b>104</b> forwards <b>134</b> the response data to the user. The agent processing <b>120</b> is then complete and ends.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In this arrangement, the agent server is acting as an intermediary between the user and the primary server. The agent server can assist the user in accessing information from the primary server or submitting information to the primary server. Although the agent processing <b>120</b> is useful in many situations, one particular situation in which the agent processing <b>120</b> is particularly useful is for on-line registrations or electronic filings. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> pertain to an embodiment of the invention concerning electronic filings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a block diagram of an electronic filing system <b>200</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The electronic filing system <b>200</b> includes an electronic filing server <b>202</b> and an electronic filing agent server <b>204</b>. The electronic filing server <b>202</b> and the electronic filing agent server <b>204</b> are coupled to the Internet <b>206</b>. Typically, the electronic filing server <b>202</b> and the electronic filing agent server <b>204</b> couple to the Internet <b>206</b> through high speed connections. In addition, the electronic filing system <b>200</b> includes an ISP <b>208</b> that couples to the Internet <b>206</b>, typically also through a high speed connection. The ISP <b>208</b> provides access to the internet <b>206</b> to user's computers through a dial-up modem access to the ISP <b>208</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a user A's computer <b>210</b> and a user B's computer <b>212</b> are able to couple to the ISP <b>208</b> to access the Internet <b>206</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The electronic filing system <b>200</b> is capable of achieving electronic filing with the electronic filing server <b>202</b>. In other words, the electronic filing server <b>202</b> supports electronic filing of a document. Either the user A or the user B is able to have a document electronically filed using the electronic filing system <b>200</b>. According to the invention, the user A or the user B can achieve the electronic filing of a document by accessing the electronic filing agent server <b>204</b>. Here, the user interacts with the electronic filing agent server <b>204</b> and not the electronic filing server <b>202</b>. This is advantageous for the user because the electronic filing agent server <b>204</b> is a much more friendly server and offers enhanced support or guidance in the electronic filing of documents. Once the electronic filing agent server <b>204</b> understands the actions taken for the user, the electronic filing agent server <b>204</b> interacts with the electronic filing server <b>202</b> to effectuate the electronic filing of the document.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a flow diagram of agent processing <b>220</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The agent processing <b>220</b> begins with a decision <b>222</b> that determines whether an agent filing request has been received. As long as no agent filing request has been received, the agent processing <b>220</b> awaits such a request. In other words, the agent processing <b>220</b> is effectively invoked when an agent filing request has been received.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In any case, once an agent filing request has been received, the agent server determines <b>224</b> the filing type from the agent filing request. The filing type represents the type of electronic filing to be formed. For example, the filing type can distinguish between different documents being electronically filed. Here, in this embodiment, the filing type is assumed to identify a form document (or form page) that is to be electronically submitted or filed, namely a predetermined electronic filing form. Then, a questionnaire is retrieved <b>226</b> based on the filing type. The questionnaire is then forwarded <b>228</b> to the requester. Here, the requester is a user of the user computer <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>. The questionnaire can then be presented to the user by a browser or other application executing on the user computer <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">A decision <b>230</b> then determines whether a response has been received. Here, the agent processing <b>220</b> awaits a response from the user, namely, the completion and submission of the questionnaire. Once the response has been received, form fields for the predetermined electronic filing form are determined <b>232</b> based on the response data and predetermined logic. The predetermined logic typically includes expert logic and is usually at least partially specific to the predetermined electronic filing form. Then, a completed electronic filing form is automatically created <b>234</b> using the determined form fields. Thereafter, the completed electronic filing form is submitted <b>236</b> to the electronic filing server. Here, the agent server submits the completed electronic filing form to the electronic filing server on behalf of the requestor. The agent processing <b>220</b> is then complete and ends. However, the agent processing <b>220</b> could also wait for verification or acknowledgement from the electronic filing server and then forwarded a message or an acknowledgement to the requestor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The web agent system <b>100</b> and the agent processing <b>120</b> can be for various purposes, such as online registrations or online document generation. The electronic filing system <b>200</b> and the agent processing <b>220</b> can be used in electronic filing of various types of documents. The documents or registrations can pertain to many different applications. One particularly useful application is in legal documents or registrations, such legal documents or registrations can be generated online or electronically filed. The invention enables the legal document or registrations to be prepared properly with ease. As an example, the web agent system <b>100</b> or the electronic filing system <b>200</b> can be used to generate and/or file electronic documents (including pages or forms), such as (i) a trademark application form which after being prepared can be electronically filed (or downloaded, printed and manually filed) with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, (ii) a copyright registration form which after being prepared can be electronically filed (or downloaded, printed and manually filed) with the U.S. copyright office, (iii) a license registration form which after being completed can be electronically filed (or downloaded, printed and manually filed) with the licensor, and (iv) various other documents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">As noted above, another aspect of the invention pertains to techniques for automatically monitoring a registration to determine whether the registration needs updated. While the type of registration can vary widely, e.g., registration form, the registrations have registration information or registration content that may need monitoring to insure that the registration is up-to-date.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The invention is particularly useful for monitoring copyright registrations, more particularly, copyright registrations for on-line works, for example, websites. Specifically, when an initial copyright registration for a website is initially obtained (e.g., through electronic submission), the initial copyright registration should be updated as the content of the website is changed. The invention can be used to automatically determine and notify a webmaster (or other appropriate person) that an updated copyright registration is needed. The submission of the updated copyright registration can also be automated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of a registration monitoring system <b>300</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The registration monitoring system <b>300</b> includes a monitoring server <b>302</b> that connects to the Internet <b>304</b>. The monitoring server <b>302</b> operates to monitor various websites provided on the Internet <b>304</b> and to initiate a registration process when a monitored website requires or requests a subsequent registration. The monitoring server <b>302</b> is coupled to a monitoring database <b>306</b>. The monitoring database <b>306</b> stores information pertaining to those websites on the Internet <b>304</b> to be monitored, i.e., the monitored websites. The information pertaining to the websites includes at least contact information and prior registration information. Although it is assumed that the monitored website has been previously registered, much of the processing can also be used for websites not yet registered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The registration monitoring system <b>300</b> also includes a monitored website A <b>308</b> and a monitored website B <b>310</b> which are also coupled to the Internet <b>304</b>. The monitored website A <b>308</b> and the monitored website B <b>310</b> represent exemplary websites that are coupled to the Internet <b>304</b> and monitored by the monitoring server <b>302</b>. A website is deemed to contain content that is accessible through the Internet <b>304</b>. The content is provided in pages, i.e., web pages, which can include text, images, video, links, etc. Typically, a webmaster updates (e.g., alters or modifies) the content of the website.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The registration monitoring system <b>300</b> also includes a requester <b>312</b> that couples to the Internet <b>304</b> through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) <b>314</b>. The requester <b>312</b> is a client device that is operated automatically or by user interaction with the monitoring server <b>302</b> to request that the monitored website A <b>308</b> and/or the monitored website B <b>310</b> be monitored. By monitoring the websites, the monitoring server <b>302</b> can determine when an updated registration would be appropriate or recommended. When an updated registration for a particular website is deemed appropriate or recommended, an updated registration can be automatically pursued or the requestor can receive a notification from the monitoring server <b>302</b> advising that an updated registration is deemed appropriate or recommended. When an updated registration is to be pursued, an updated registration can be submitted on-line to a registration server <b>316</b>. For example, when the monitoring server <b>302</b> is monitoring to determine when an updated copyright registration is needed, then the registration server <b>316</b> can pertain to an agent server or a primary server. As examples, the agent server can be the agent server <b>104</b>, <b>204</b>, and the primary server can be the primary server <b>102</b> or the filing server <b>202</b> (e.g., the Copyright Office's server).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The requestor <b>312</b> can request the monitoring of websites in advance. For example, the requestor <b>312</b> could interact with the monitoring server <b>302</b> to request monitoring of a particular website. The monitoring server <b>302</b> performs processing to process such requests for monitoring from various requestors. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram of server-side request monitoring processing <b>400</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The server-side request monitoring processing <b>400</b> is, for example, performed by the monitoring server <b>302</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The server-side request monitoring processing <b>400</b> begins with a decision <b>402</b> that determines whether a request for monitoring has been received. When the decision <b>402</b> determines that a request for monitoring has not yet been received, the server-side request monitoring processing <b>400</b> effectively awaits a monitoring request. Typically, the monitoring request will be provided by a requester, such as the requester <b>312</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Once the decision <b>402</b> determines that a monitoring request has been received, the server-side request monitoring processing <b>400</b> continues. In other words, the server-side request monitoring processing <b>400</b> is invoked when a monitoring request is received.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">After the monitoring request is received, a monitoring request page is forwarded <b>404</b> to the requestor. The monitoring request page requests information from the requestor detailing the monitoring to be performed. The requestor then operates to complete or provide information with respect to the monitoring request page. For example, the information requested by the monitoring request pages can include identification of website to be monitored, name, address and electronic mail address of requestor, type of monitoring desired, etc. To the extent that the monitoring server <b>302</b> already knows information, the monitoring request page can either not request such information or request confirmation of such information. Once the requester has completed providing the information requested by the monitoring request page, the requester submits the form back to the monitoring server <b>302</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Following the submission of the monitoring request page, a decision <b>406</b> determines whether a submission has been made. Here, the server-side request monitoring processing <b>400</b> determines whether the monitoring request page has been submitted back to the monitoring server <b>302</b>. If the monitoring request page has not been submitted, then the decision <b>406</b> causes the server-side request monitoring processing <b>400</b> to await the submission of the monitoring request page. Once the decision <b>406</b> determines that the monitoring request page has been submitted, data verification is performed <b>408</b>. The data verification can verify or check the information provided in the monitoring request page for common errors, such as incomplete information or improper selections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, a decision <b>410</b> determines whether the data verification has determined that the submitted monitoring request page was complete and proper. When the decision <b>410</b> determines that the submitted monitoring request page was not complete and proper, a defective data page is formed and forwarded <b>412</b> to the requester so that needed information can be obtained. Then, the server-side request monitoring processing <b>400</b> returns to repeat the decision <b>406</b> and subsequent blocks so that the needed data can be provided by the requestor and then verified. On the other hand, when the decision <b>410</b> determines that the submitted monitoring request page is complete and proper, the information provided in the monitoring request page (and defective data page), i.e., monitoring request information, is stored <b>414</b> in the monitoring database <b>306</b>. Thereafter, the server-side request monitoring processing <b>400</b> is complete and ends.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Once one or more websites have requested monitoring, an update determination process can be performed by the monitoring server <b>302</b> to determine when the monitored websites should be registered. Typically, the monitored websites have been previously registered so that the update determination process determines whether an updated registration is deemed appropriate or recommended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram of update determination processing <b>500</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The update determination processing <b>500</b> is, for example, performed by the monitoring server <b>302</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The update determination processing <b>500</b> initially identifies <b>502</b> entries in the monitoring database to be monitored. Then, one of the identified entries to be processed is selected <b>504</b>. Next, prior website information for the website associated with the selected entry is retrieved <b>506</b> from a storage location, such as the monitoring database <b>306</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The website associated with the selected entry is then accessed <b>508</b> to obtain current website information. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, discussed below, provides additional details on the generation of the current website information for the website associated with the selected entry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">After the current website information has been obtained, the current website information is compared <b>510</b> with the prior website information to produce a comparison value. Here, the comparison value reflects the degree or likelihood that the website associated with the selected entry has been altered or changed since the time at which the prior website information was obtained. The comparison can be performed in a variety of ways as discussed in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, a decision <b>512</b> determines whether the comparison value exceeds a predetermined threshold. When the comparison value does exceed the predetermined threshold, an update flag is set <b>514</b> in the monitoring database for the selected entry. Here, by setting the update flag, the registration monitoring system has effectively concluded that an updated registration should be pursued for the website associated with the selected entry. The update flag is utilized to mark the selected entry for further processing that achieves the updated registration (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In addition, the requestor for the website associated with the selected entry is notified <b>516</b> of the update condition. In other words, the requestor is notified that it is desirable to perform an updated registration for the website associated with the selected entry. The notification provided to the requester can take many forms including electronic mail, regular mail carrier mail, telephone message, etc. Preferably, however, the notification is provided by electronic mail and includes a link to an update registration process. Such electronic mail notifications can provide information on the amount of content change and a recommendation for a registration. Still further, the electronic mail notifications can further provide an indication of where the content change occurs within the website.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In any case, after the notification <b>516</b>, or directly following the decision <b>512</b> when the comparison value does not exceed the predetermined threshold, a decision <b>518</b> determines whether there are more entries to be processed. If the decision <b>518</b> determines that all of the entries have not been processed, then the update determination processing <b>500</b> returns to repeat the block <b>504</b> and subsequent blocks so that additional entries can be processed. On the other hand, once the decision <b>518</b> determines that all of the entries have been processed, the update determination processing <b>500</b> is complete and ends. However, it should be recognized that the update determination processing <b>500</b> can, for example, be performed on a periodic basis such as daily, weekly or monthly to periodically evaluate the websites being monitored by the registration monitoring system for the need to pursue an updated registration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The registration monitoring system also includes an update registration process that serves to process updated registrations for the websites that have been determined to desire such updates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow diagram of update registration processing <b>600</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The update registration processing <b>600</b> is, for example, performed by the monitoring server <b>302</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The update registration processing <b>600</b> initially identifies <b>602</b> entries in the monitoring database having the update flag set. As noted above, the update determination processing <b>500</b> can, for example, be used to set the update flags to indicate that an updated registration should be pursued for the website associated with the selected entry. Next, one of the identified entries is selected <b>604</b> for processing. A decision <b>606</b> then determines whether update registration has been authorized. The authorization can obtained in a variety of ways including, for example, in advance, in response to a notification, or by a specific request. When the decision <b>606</b> determines that update registration has not been authorized, the processing is complete for the selected entry because the updated registration is not obtained because such has not been authorized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">On the other hand, when the decision <b>606</b> determines that update registration has been authorized, prior registration information is retrieved <b>608</b>. Typically, the prior registration information would be retrieved from a database, such as the monitoring database <b>306</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Then, updated website content is retrieved <b>610</b> for the website associated with the selected entry. The updated website content can, for example, be obtained by accessing the website directly and retrieving the content, or the updated website content could be submitted with a specific request or in response to a notification. Prior processing could have also previously stored the updated web content in the database (e.g., monitoring database <b>306</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">After the updated website content is retrieved <b>610</b>, registration information is determined <b>612</b> based on the prior registration information. Here, the registration information that is determined <b>612</b> is for use with an update registration. By utilizing the prior registration information in determining <b>612</b> the registration information, the amount of additional information that needs to be newly provided is substantially reduced because much of the registration information remains the same as it was with the prior registration information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, an update registration is initiated <b>614</b>. In one implementation, the update registration can be initiated <b>614</b> by submitting a request to an on-line registration server (e.g., registration server <b>316</b>). A decision <b>616</b> then determines whether registration has been confirmed. When the decision <b>616</b> determines the registration has not yet been confirmed, a time-out decision <b>618</b> determines whether a time-out has occurred. If the decision <b>618</b> determines that a time-out has not yet occurred, the update registration processing <b>600</b> returns to repeat the decision <b>616</b> until either the registration has been confirmed or the time-out event has occurred. When the decision <b>616</b> determines that registration has been confirmed, the update flag for the selected entry is cleared <b>620</b>. Further, the registration information for the selected entry is stored <b>622</b> for subsequent usage. For example, during a subsequent update registration processing, the registration information that is stored <b>622</b> at this point will become the prior registration information or at least a portion thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Following the storage <b>622</b> of the registration information, as well as following the time-out decision <b>618</b> when the time-out has occurred or following the decision <b>606</b> when update registration is not authorized, a decision <b>624</b> determines whether additional entries are to be processed. When the decision <b>624</b> determines that all of the entries have not yet been processed, the update registration processing <b>600</b> returns to repeat the block <b>604</b> and subsequent blocks so that each of the entries in the database having the update flag set can be processed. Once the decision <b>624</b> determines that all of the entries have been processed, the update registration processing <b>600</b> is complete and ends. The update registration processing <b>600</b> can, for example, be periodically performed to process the update registrations for those of the websites being monitored that were indicated as desirable candidates for an updated registration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The current website information can take a variety of forms and include vastly different types of information describing some attributes or parameters of the website. For example, in one implementation, the current website information could merely obtain the names of all of the pages associated with the website. Alternatively, the current website information could obtain all the page names and page sizes for the pages associated with the website. Then, if a certain percentage of the pages of the current website information have different names or different sizes as compared to the prior website information, the current website could be determined to likely require or be desirous of an updated registration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The nature and acquisition of the current website information can be performed in a variety of ways. The approaches can also vary in complexity from simple to complex. Websites follow the HTTP protocol and HTML protocols and thus header information or META data can be examined. For example, the META data can include a date associated with a HTML file. The pages of the website could also be retrieved and scanned to produce information on the websites organization, the contents of the pages, or checksums. Comparison programs or algorithms could also be used to perform more sophisticated comparisons between prior and current websites.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram of website examination processing <b>700</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The website examination processing <b>700</b> is, for example, performed by the block <b>508</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The website examination processing <b>700</b> initially accesses <b>702</b> the main page of the website to be examined. Next, the website's main page is examined <b>704</b> to determine page defining information for the main page. The page defining information can include a variety of different characteristics or parameters of the main page. For example, the page defining information can include one or more of file date, file size, word count, number of links, frame layout, tables, color, number of inputs, number of buttons and types of buttons, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, a decision <b>706</b> determines whether the main page includes local links. The local links are other pages of the website that are associated with the main page. When the decision <b>706</b> determines that the page does have local links, each of the local links are processed to obtain page defining information. In particular, a local link is selected <b>708</b>. Then, the link page associated with the selected local link is accessed <b>710</b>. After the link page has been accessed, the link page is examined <b>712</b> to determine page defining information for the linked page. The page defining information determined for the linked page can be similar to the page defining information for the main page. In addition, the page defining information for the linked page might also include information as to its location in a website tree, namely, its level and parent. After the page defining information has been determined, a decision <b>714</b> determines whether there are more local links to be processed. When a decision <b>714</b> determines that there are more local links to be processed, the website examination processing <b>700</b> returns to repeat the block <b>708</b> and subsequent blocks so that additional links can be processed. On the other hand, when the decision block <b>714</b> determines that there are no more local links to be processed, or when the decision <b>706</b> determines that the web page does not have local links, the current website information is formulated <b>716</b> from the page defining information. Here, the current website information is formulated <b>716</b> based on the page defining information that has been obtained for the main page and any pages associated with local links of the website. Thereafter, the website examination processing <b>700</b> is complete and ends.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Within a website, there are often graphical links to images that are to be retrieved and provided with a page of the website. The website examination processing <b>700</b> could also monitor these graphic images as part of the page defining information. Alternatively, the website examination processing <b>700</b> could ignore graphical images. In some cases, it may be beneficial for the requestor to indicate whether or not graphical images should be part of the examination processing, as such may depend on the content and uniqueness to the website.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In an example provided below an initial website version is compared to a current website version. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a representative tree diagram of the initial website version. The initial website includes five (5) pages, including index.htm, products.htm, widget1.htm, widget2.htm and about.htm. The page defining information for each of the pages in this example includes file name, position, file size, file date, and local links. The position is represented by level, parent level, number. For example, the position of widget2.htm is “2-1-3” because the file is at level two in the tree diagram, its parent file is at level 1, and its sequential number is 3. The initial website information then results from the page defining information. Table 1 below indicates the page defining information for the initial website.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Hence, following website examination processing, the system can compare the page defining information for the initial website with the page defining information of the current website. When the degree or type of change to the website from the initial website to the current website exceeds a minimum threshold, than update registration can be triggered. Accordingly, update registrations are pursued or recommended only when beneficial to the website owner. With respect to the example provided above, two new files have been added to the website (i.e., widget3.htm and press.htm), three files were modified, and one additional local link has been added. Also, two of the three modified files were increased in size by 1 kilobyte (kB). Given these changes to the website, the system can determine that the degree or types of change to the website indicate that an updated registration be pursued or recommended. A weighting scheme can be used to weight each of the different attributes of the page defining information differently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In more simplified embodiments, the website examination could just consider a particular page, such as a home page, overall all website size, the file names of the website, tree structure, or modification dates. Checksums of some or all of the pages could also be used to identify when any change is made to a page of a website. However, better result can be had by considering the whole website because degree of change in the content of the website is important. For example, if certain pages were updated (e.g., contact page) to update an address change for the business associated with the website, then an updated registration would not be necessary. However, the addition of a new product page to the website would make an updated registration more important.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In any case, the minimum threshold that triggers or recommends the updated registration can be selectively set to different levels. For example, the different levels can reflect the aggressiveness with which the website owner desires to update its registration. An owner desiring more aggressiveness would lower the minimum threshold, whereas the owner desiring less aggressiveness would increase the minimum threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Still another aspect of the invention is that the above-mentioned monitoring processing can be used to monitoring for unauthorized copying of websites. By monitoring the World Wide Web (WWW) for websites that have similar website information (e.g., content) using the examination techniques mentioned above, the invention can determine those websites that have copied content from one's website. This is an automated processes that compares an original website with numerous other websites on the WWW and notifies the administrator of the original website when websites with similar content are found.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Yet another aspect of the invention is that domain name monitoring can be automatically performed. Automatic monitoring of domain names is beneficial to holders of similar domain names, trademark owners, and competitors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> is a block diagram of a domain monitoring system <b>850</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The domain monitoring system <b>850</b> monitors the registration of domain names. The domain monitoring system <b>850</b> includes a domain monitoring server <b>852</b> that couples to the Internet <b>854</b>. The domain monitoring server <b>852</b> also couples to a monitoring database <b>856</b>. The monitoring database <b>856</b> stores information regarding the domains to be monitored by the domain monitoring system <b>850</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The domain monitoring system <b>850</b> also includes a requestor's computer <b>858</b> that couples to the Internet <b>854</b> through an ISP <b>860</b>. A requestor operates the requestor's computer <b>858</b> to request that a domain name be monitored and that notifications be provided to the requestor when similar registrations to the domain name have been registered. The domain monitoring server <b>852</b> stores information describing monitoring requested by the requestor and performs the requested monitoring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">The domain monitoring system <b>850</b> also includes a domain registrations search server <b>862</b>. The domain registrations search server <b>862</b> is coupled to the Internet <b>854</b>. The domain registrations search server <b>862</b> is also coupled to a registrations database <b>864</b>. In one embodiment, the domain registration search server <b>862</b> and the domain registration database <b>864</b> are provided by a registrar of a registry system that controls the registration of domain names. For example, in the United States, Network Solutions, Inc. was the original registrar and remains a registrar today along with several other registrars. The registrations database <b>864</b> stores information on domain names that have been registered. For example, for each domain name that has been registered, the registration database <b>864</b> stores information such as registrant, date of registration, technical contact, administrative contact, billing contact, and host server. The technical contact information, the billing contact information and the administrative contact information normally include at least an individual's name and electronic mail address.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">The domain monitoring system <b>850</b> operates by a requestor's computer <b>858</b> initiating (on behalf of the requestor) a request to the domain monitoring server <b>852</b> to monitor a particular domain name. The monitoring request can be achieved by a requestor utilizing a network browser (e.g., HTML browser) to complete a form that identifies the name and email address for the requestor as well as identifies the domain name to be monitored. In addition, the monitoring request can also provide an indication of the depth of monitoring requested. For example, the monitoring could be for U.S. variations of the requestor's domain name or watching of international registrations for the requestor's domain name. The domain monitoring server <b>852</b> stores the request in the monitoring database <b>856</b>. Thereafter, periodically, the domain monitoring server <b>852</b> retrieves the domain names to be monitored from the monitoring database <b>856</b>. For each of the domain names to be monitored, the domain monitoring server <b>852</b> queries the registration database <b>864</b> for an indication of whether or not similar domain names have been registered. Typically, the domain name being monitored has already been registered by the requestor, and thus the monitoring of the domain names searches for new registrations of domain names that are substantially similar to the domain name being monitored. For example, if the requestor had registered the domain name “amazon.com”, the monitoring of the domain names could determine whether any amazon?.? are newly registered, where “?” represents one or more wildcard characters. Such monitoring could instead also search for more specific, and perhaps predetermined, domain names to limit the processing overhead. In any case, the monitoring for this example might flag new registrations for amazon.net, amazon.org, amazon.co.uk, amazon.org.uk, amazon.to, amazons.com, amazons.net, and amazons.org.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The domain monitoring server <b>852</b> can search the registrations database <b>864</b> through the domain registration search server <b>862</b> provided by the registrar in one embodiment of the invention. In another embodiment of the invention, the domain monitoring server <b>852</b> would be able to effectively bypass the domain registration search server <b>862</b> (or flow through) to access the registrations database <b>864</b>. Typically, however, the domain monitoring server <b>852</b> will have to satisfy security requirements and parameters required by the domain registration search server <b>862</b> when attempting to access the registrations database <b>864</b>.</div>

The domain monitoring processing <b>900</b> is, for example, performed by the domain monitoring server <b>852</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">The domain monitoring processing <b>900</b> initially identifies <b>902</b> domains to be monitored. Here, the domains to be monitored represent a particular domain name that the requestor desires to search about and to be notified when similar domain names have been registered. After the domains to be monitored have been identified <b>902</b>, one of the domains to be processed is selected <b>904</b>. Then, the domain space to be monitored is retrieved or determined <b>906</b>. In one embodiment, the domain space about a domain name to be monitored can be predetermined by the requestor and in such case is simply retrieved <b>906</b>. On the other hand, when the domain space about a domain name to be monitored is not predetermined by the requestor, then the domain space can be determined by the domain monitoring server <b>852</b>. In some cases, the domain monitoring server <b>852</b> may need to access different registrations databases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">After the domain space has been obtained, a domain variation is selected <b>908</b> from the domain space. In other words, the domain space includes various domain variations associated with the primary domain. Then, the domain registration database is searched <b>910</b> for the selected domain variation. A decision <b>912</b> then determines whether the selected domain variation has been registered. When the decision <b>912</b> determines that the selected domain variation has not been registered, then an unregistered flag is stored <b>914</b> for the selected domain variation. On the other hand, when the decision <b>912</b> determines that the selected domain variation has been registered, a registered flag is stored <b>916</b> for the selected domain variation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Next, following either the storing operations <b>914</b> or <b>916</b>, a decision <b>918</b> determines whether there are more domain variations within the domain space to be processed. When the decision <b>918</b> determines that there are more domain variations to be processed, then the domain monitoring processing <b>900</b> returns to repeat the selecting operation <b>908</b> and subsequent operations. On the other hand, when the decision <b>918</b> determines that there are no more domain variations to be processed, then a decision <b>920</b> determines whether there are other domains to be monitored. When the decision <b>920</b> determines that there are other domains to be monitored, then the domain monitoring processing <b>900</b> returns to repeat the operation <b>904</b> and subsequent operations. Alternatively, when the decision <b>920</b> determines that there are no other domains to be monitored, then the domain monitoring processing <b>900</b> is complete and ends.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">The domain monitoring process <b>900</b> can operate continuously or can be periodically invoked. It is likely that periodic invocation of the domain monitoring process <b>900</b> will be adequate to sufficiently monitor the registration of domains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow diagram of registration notification processing <b>1000</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The registration notification processing <b>1000</b> is, for example, performed by the domain monitoring server <b>852</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">The registration notification processing <b>1000</b> serves to notify the requestor when domain variations of the monitored domain are registered. Specifically, the registration notification processing <b>1000</b> initially identifies <b>1002</b> domains being monitored. Then, one of the domains being monitored is selected <b>1004</b>. A decision <b>1006</b> then determines whether any of the domain variations associated with the selected domain have a registered flag. When the decision <b>1006</b> determines that none of the domain variations has a registered flag, then there is no need to notify the requestor for the selected domain because none of the domain variations has been registered. In one embodiment, the operations <b>1002</b>-<b>1006</b> can be performed by a database query in the cases where a database (e.g., monitoring database <b>856</b>) holds the registered/unregistered flags.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">On the other hand, when the decision <b>1006</b> determines that there are one or more registered flags for the domain variations of the selected domain, then the registration notification processing <b>1000</b> performs additional processing to not only notify the requestor but also possibly warning the new registrant. More particularly, a registration report is produced <b>1008</b>. In one embodiment, the registration report contains information on the recent registrations that are similar (e.g., domain variations) to the domain name being monitored. The information in the registration report for each of these recent registrations can, for example, include registrant, date of registration, technical contact, administrative contact, billing contact, and host server. Then, the registration report is transmitted <b>1010</b> to the requestor for the selected domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Next, a decision <b>1012</b> determines whether automatic warnings have been requested. In one embodiment, automatic warnings can be requested when the domain monitoring is requested. When the decision <b>1012</b> determines that automatic warnings have been requested, then a warning message is produced <b>1014</b>. After the warning message has been produced <b>1014</b>, the warning message is transmitted <b>1016</b> to the offending registrant. Alternatively, when the decision <b>1012</b> determines that the automatic warning has not been requested, then the operations <b>1014</b> and <b>1016</b> are bypassed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">In any case, following the transmission <b>1016</b> of the warning message, or following the decisions <b>1006</b> or <b>1012</b> when their conditions are not satisfied, a decision <b>1018</b> determines whether there are other domains to be processed. When the decision <b>1018</b> determines that there are other domains to be processed, the registration notification processing <b>1000</b> returns to repeat the operation <b>1004</b> and subsequent operations so that other monitoring requests can be processed. Alternatively, when the decision <b>1018</b> determines that there are no other domains to be processed, the registration notification processing <b>1000</b> is complete and ends.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">The transmission <b>1010</b> of the registration report can be achieved in a variety of ways, including electronic mail or facsimile. Also, the warning messages can be automatically sent according to the invention. Alternatively, the warning letters could not be sent automatically but, instead, be sent following consent of the requestor. For example, the requestor could be informed by a registration report via email that a similar domain has been registered by an offending registrant, then in a reply to the electronic mail registration report or by particular request, the requestor can authorize the sending of a warning message to the offending registrant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Although the domain monitoring discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref> monitors for recent domain registrations, domain monitoring can also monitor for implementation of an active website using a domain name that is similar to the domain name being monitored. Here, periodically the domain monitoring server <b>852</b> could search the Internet <b>854</b> for a website at domain names deemed similar to the domain name being monitored. Receiving back an error when the website is not found indicates that the offending domain name, even if registered, is not in use (i.e., inactive). The requestor can also be notified when active website with offending domain names are discovered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">Such monitoring can also be used with the monitoring for new registrations. For example, after a new registration for an offending domain name is found, the offending domain name can be monitored for activation of its website. In such case, the registration report can become a registration and activation report.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">The various aspect of the invention can be used separately or in any combination. Although the invention has been described in context of the Internet, more generally, the invention can use any network, including a local, wide-area, or global network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">The invention is preferably implemented in software, but can be implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware and software. The invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data which can be thereafter be read by a computer system.
