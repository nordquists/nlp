<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">One embodiment of the present invention relates to a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor and a display device including the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Note that one embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the above technical field. The technical field of one embodiment of the invention disclosed in this specification and the like relates to an object, a method, or a manufacturing method. In addition, the present invention relates to a process, a machine, manufacture, or a composition of matter. In particular, the present invention relates to a semiconductor device, a display device, a light-emitting device, a power storage device, a storage device, a driving method thereof, or a manufacturing method thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In this specification and the like, a semiconductor device generally means a device that can function by utilizing semiconductor characteristics. A semiconductor element such as a transistor, a semiconductor circuit, an arithmetic device, and a memory device are each an embodiment of a semiconductor device. An imaging device, a display device, a liquid crystal display device, a light-emitting device, an electro-optical device, a power generation device (including a thin film solar cell, an organic thin film solar cell, and the like), and an electronic device may each include a semiconductor device.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Attention has been focused on a technique for forming a transistor using a semiconductor thin film formed over a substrate having an insulating surface (also referred to as thin film transistor (TFT)). The transistor is used in a wide range of electronic devices such as an integrated circuit (IC) or an image display device (display device). A semiconductor material typified by silicon is widely known as a material for a semiconductor thin film that can be used for a transistor. As another material, an oxide semiconductor has been attracting attention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a technique in which a transistor is manufactured using an amorphous oxide containing In, Zn, Ga, Sn, and the like as an oxide semiconductor.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">As a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film, an inverted staggered transistor (also referred to as a transistor having a bottom-gate structure), a planar transistor (also referred to as a transistor having a top-gate structure), and the like are given. In the case where a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film is used for a display device, an inverted staggered transistor is used more often than a planar transistor because a manufacturing process thereof is relatively simple and manufacturing cost thereof can be kept low. However, signal delay or the like is increased by parasitic capacitance that exists between a gate electrode and source and drain electrodes of an inverted staggered transistor and accordingly image quality of a display device degrades, which has posed a problem, as an increase in screen size of a display device proceeds, or as a display device is provided with a higher resolution image (for example, a high-resolution display device typified by 4 k×2 k pixels (3840 pixels in the horizontal direction and 2160 pixels in the perpendicular direction) or 8 k×4 k pixels (7680 pixels in the horizontal direction and 4320 pixels in the perpendicular direction)). Furthermore, as another problem, the occupation area of an inverted staggered transistor is larger than that of a planar transistor. Thus, with regard to a planar transistor including an oxide semiconductor film, development of a transistor which has a structure with stable semiconductor characteristics and high reliability and which is formed by a simple manufacturing process is desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing problems, one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a novel semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor, particularly to provide a planar type semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor. Furthermore, an object is to provide a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor in which on-state current is high, provide a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor in which off-state current is low, provide a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor which occupies a small area, provide a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor which has stable electrical characteristics, provide a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor which has high reliability, provide a novel semiconductor device, or provide a novel display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Note that the description of the above object does not preclude the existence of other objects. In one embodiment of the present invention, there is no need to achieve all the objects. Objects other than the above objects will be apparent from and can be derived from the description of the specification and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">One embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor device including a first transistor provided in a driver circuit portion and a second transistor provided in a pixel portion; the first transistor and the second transistor have different structures. Furthermore, the first transistor and the second transistor are transistors having a top-gate structure. In an oxide semiconductor film of each of the transistors, an impurity element is contained in regions which do not overlap with a gate electrode. The regions of the oxide semiconductor film which contain the impurity element function as low-resistance regions. Furthermore, the regions of the oxide semiconductor film which contain the impurity element are in contact with a film containing hydrogen. In addition, conductive films functioning as a source electrode and a drain electrode which are in contact with the regions containing the impurity element through openings in the film containing hydrogen may be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Note that the first transistor provided in the driver circuit portion includes two gate electrodes overlapping with each other with the oxide semiconductor film provided therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">As the impurity element, hydrogen, boron, carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, chlorine, or a rare gas element is given.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">When containing hydrogen and at least one of a rare gas element, boron, carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, and chlorine as an impurity element, the oxide semiconductor film has higher conductivity. Thus, when regions containing the impurity element are provided in a region which does not overlap with the gate electrode in the oxide semiconductor film and the regions containing the impurity element are in contact with the source electrode and the drain electrode, the parasitic resistance and parasitic capacitance of the transistor can be reduced, and the transistor having high on-state current is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, the first transistor provided in the driver circuit portion and the second transistor provided in the pixel portion may include the oxide semiconductor films having different atomic ratios of metal elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The first transistor provided in the driver circuit portion and the second transistor provided in the pixel portion may each include a multilayer film including a first film and a second film, instead of the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">One embodiment of the present invention can provide a novel semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor. In particular, a planar type semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor can be provided. Alternatively, a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor in which on-state current is high can be provided, a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor in which off-state current is low can be provided, a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor which occupies a small area can be provided, a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor which has stable electrical characteristics can be provided, a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor which has high reliability can be provided, a novel semiconductor device can be provided, or a novel display device can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Note that the description of these effects does not preclude the existence of other effects. One embodiment of the present invention does not necessarily achieve all the effects listed above. Other effects will be apparent from and can be derived from the description of the specification, the drawings, the claims, and the like.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention disclosed in this specification will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Note that the present invention is not limited to the following description and it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that modes and details can be modified in various ways without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to the content of the embodiments below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Note that the position, the size, the range, or the like of each structure illustrated in drawings and the like is not accurately represented in some cases for simplification. Therefore, the disclosed invention is not necessarily limited to the position, the size, the range, or the like disclosed in the drawings and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In this specification and the like, ordinal numbers such as “first”, “second”, and “third” are used in order to avoid confusion among components, and the terms do not mean limitation of the number of components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Note that the term such as “over” or “below” in this specification and the like does not necessarily mean that a component is placed “directly on” or “directly under” another component. For example, the expression “a gate electrode over a gate insulating film” can mean the case where there is an additional component between the gate insulating film and the gate electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, in this specification and the like, the term such as an “electrode” or a “wiring” does not limit a function of a component. For example, an “electrode” is used as part of a “wiring” in some cases, and vice versa. Further, the term “electrode” or “wiring” can also mean a combination of a plurality of “electrodes” and “wirings” formed in an integrated manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Functions of a “source” and a “drain” are sometimes replaced with each other when a transistor of opposite polarity is used or when the direction of flow of current is changed in circuit operation, for example. Therefore, the terms “source” and “drain” can be used to denote the drain and the source, respectively, in this specification and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Note that in this specification and the like, the term “electrically connected” includes the case where components are connected through an object having any electric function. There is no particular limitation on an “object having any electric function” as long as electric signals can be transmitted and received between components that are connected through the object. Examples of an “object having any electric function” are a switching element such as a transistor, a resistor, an inductor, a capacitor, and elements with a variety of functions as well as an electrode and a wiring.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">When the impurity element is added to the oxide semiconductor, a bond between a metal element and oxygen in the oxide semiconductor is cut, whereby an oxygen vacancy is formed. When hydrogen is added to an oxide semiconductor in which an oxygen vacancy is formed by addition of an impurity element, hydrogen enters an oxygen vacant site and forms a donor level in the vicinity of the conduction band; thus, the conductivity of the oxide semiconductor is increased. Consequently, an oxide conductor can be formed. Accordingly, the oxide conductor has a light-transmitting property.

The insulating film <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, the insulating film <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, and the insulating film <b>116</b> each have a sufficiently larger energy gap than the channel region <b>105</b> <i>a</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">Next, a method for manufacturing the transistors <b>100</b> <i>a </i>and <b>100</b> <i>b </i>illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">The films included in the transistors <b>100</b> <i>a </i>and <b>100</b> <i>b </i>(i.e., the insulating film, the oxide semiconductor film, the conductive film, and the like) can be formed by any of a sputtering method, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, a vacuum evaporation method, and a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. Alternatively, a coating method or a printing method can be used. Although the sputtering method and a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method are typical examples of the film formation method, a thermal CVD method may be used. As the thermal CVD method, a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method or an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method may be used, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">Deposition by a thermal CVD method may be performed in such a manner that the pressure in a chamber is set to an atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure, and a source gas and an oxidizer are supplied to the chamber at a time and react with each other in the vicinity of the substrate or over the substrate. Thus, no plasma is generated in the deposition; therefore, the thermal CVD method has an advantage that no defect due to plasma damage is caused.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">Deposition by the ALD method may be performed in such a manner that the pressure in a chamber is set to an atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure, source gases for reaction are sequentially introduced into the chamber, and then the sequence of the gas introduction is repeated. For example, two or more kinds of source gases are sequentially supplied to the chamber by switching respective switching valves (also referred to as high-speed valves). For example, a first source gas is introduced, an inert gas (e.g., argon or nitrogen) or the like is introduced at the same time as or after the introduction of the first source gas so that the source gases are not mixed, and then a second source gas is introduced. Note that in the case where the first source gas and the inert gas are introduced at a time, the inert gas serves as a carrier gas, and the inert gas may also be introduced at the same time as the introduction of the second source gas. Alternatively, the first source gas may be exhausted by vacuum evacuation instead of the introduction of the inert gas, and then the second source gas may be introduced. The first source gas is adsorbed on the surface of the substrate to form a first single-atomic layer; then the second source gas is introduced to react with the first single-atomic layer; as a result, a second single-atomic layer is stacked over the first single-atomic layer, so that a thin film is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">The sequence of the gas introduction is repeated plural times until a desired thickness is obtained, whereby a thin film with excellent step coverage can be formed. The thickness of the thin film can be adjusted by the number of repetition times of the sequence of the gas introduction; therefore, an ALD method makes it possible to accurately adjust a thickness and thus is suitable for manufacturing a minute FET.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the conductive film <b>102</b> is formed over the substrate <b>101</b>, and the insulating film <b>104</b> is formed over the conductive film <b>102</b>. Next, the oxide semiconductor film <b>105</b> is formed over the insulating film <b>104</b> in the driver circuit portion, and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is formed over the insulating film <b>104</b> in the pixel portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">The conductive film <b>102</b> is formed as follows: a conductive film is formed by a sputtering method, a vacuum evaporation method, a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, a thermal CVD method, or the like, a mask is formed over the conductive film by a lithography process, and then etching treatment is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">Alternatively, a tungsten film can be formed as the conductive film with a deposition apparatus employing ALD. In that case, a WF<sub>6 </sub>gas and a B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>gas are sequentially introduced more than once to form an initial tungsten film, and then a WF<sub>6 </sub>gas and an H<sub>2 </sub>gas are introduced at a time, so that a tungsten film is formed. Note that an SiH<sub>4 </sub>gas may be used instead of a B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">Note that the conductive film <b>102</b> may be formed by an electrolytic plating method, a printing method, an inkjet method, or the like instead of the above formation method.</div>

The insulating film <b>104</b> can be formed in the following manner: an insulating film is formed over the substrate <b>101</b>, and then oxygen is added to the insulating film. Examples of the oxygen that is added to the insulating film include an oxygen radical, an oxygen atom, an oxygen atomic ion, an oxygen molecular ion, and the like. As a method for adding the oxygen, an ion doping method, an ion implantation method, plasma treatment, or the like can be given. Alternatively, after a film which suppresses release of oxygen is formed over the insulating film, oxygen may be added to the insulating film through the film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">As the insulating film <b>104</b>, a silicon oxide film or a silicon oxynitride film from which oxygen can be released by heat treatment can be formed under the following conditions: the substrate placed in a treatment chamber of the plasma CVD apparatus that is vacuum-evacuated is held at a temperature higher than or equal to 180° C. and lower than or equal to 280° C., or higher than or equal to 200° C. and lower than or equal to 240° C., the pressure is greater than or equal to 100 Pa and less than or equal to 250 Pa, or greater than or equal to 100 Pa and less than or equal to 200 Pa with introduction of a source gas into the treatment chamber, and a high-frequency power of greater than or equal to 0.17 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to 0.5 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, or greater than or equal to 0.25 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to 0.35 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>is supplied to an electrode provided in the treatment chamber.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">A formation method of the oxide semiconductor films <b>105</b> and <b>108</b> is described below. An oxide semiconductor film is formed over the insulating film <b>104</b> by a sputtering method, a coating method, a pulsed laser deposition method, a laser ablation method, a thermal CVD method, or the like. Next, oxygen contained in the insulating film <b>104</b> is moved to the oxide semiconductor film by heat treatment. Then, after a mask is formed over the oxide semiconductor film by a lithography process, the oxide semiconductor film is partly etched using the mask. Thus, the oxide semiconductor films <b>105</b> and <b>108</b> can be formed as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. After that, the mask is removed. Note that heat treatment may be performed after the oxide semiconductor films <b>105</b> and <b>108</b> are formed by etching part of the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Alternatively, by using a printing method for forming the oxide semiconductor films <b>105</b> and <b>108</b>, the oxide semiconductor films <b>105</b> and <b>108</b> subjected to element isolation can be formed directly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">As a power supply device for generating plasma in the case of forming the oxide semiconductor film by a sputtering method, an RF power supply device, an AC power supply device, a DC power supply device, or the like can be used as appropriate. Note that a CAAC-OS film can be formed using an AC power supply device or a DC power supply device. In forming the oxide semiconductor film, a sputtering method using an AC power supply device or a DC power supply device is preferable to a sputtering method using an RF power supply device because the oxide semiconductor film can be uniform in film thickness, film composition, or crystallinity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">As a sputtering gas, a rare gas (typically argon), an oxygen gas, or a mixed gas of a rare gas and oxygen is used as appropriate. In the case of using the mixed gas of a rare gas and oxygen, the proportion of oxygen to a rare gas is preferably increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">Furthermore, a target may be appropriately selected in accordance with the composition of the oxide semiconductor film to be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">For example, in the case where the oxide semiconductor film is formed by a sputtering method at a substrate temperature higher than or equal to 150° C. and lower than or equal to 750° C., higher than or equal to 150° C. and lower than or equal to 450° C., or higher than or equal to 200° C. and lower than or equal to 350° C., a CAAC-OS film can be formed. In the case where the substrate temperature is higher than or equal to 25° C. and lower than 150° C., a microcrystalline oxide semiconductor film can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">For the deposition of the CAAC-OS film to be described later, the following conditions are preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">By suppressing entry of impurities during the deposition, the crystal state can be prevented from being broken by the impurities. For example, the concentration of impurities (e.g., hydrogen, water, carbon dioxide, or nitrogen) which exist in the deposition chamber may be reduced. Furthermore, the concentration of impurities in a deposition gas may be reduced. Specifically, a deposition gas whose dew point is −80° C. or lower, or −100° C. or lower is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">Furthermore, it is preferable that the proportion of oxygen in the deposition gas be increased and the power be optimized in order to reduce plasma damage at the deposition. The proportion of oxygen in the deposition gas is 30 vol. % or higher, or 100 vol. %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">Furthermore, after the oxide semiconductor film is formed, heat treatment may be performed so that the oxide semiconductor film is subjected to dehydrogenation or dehydration. The heat treatment is performed typically at a temperature higher than or equal to 150° C. and lower than the strain point of the substrate, higher than or equal to 250° C. and lower than or equal to 450° C., or higher than or equal to 300° C. and lower than or equal to 450° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">The heat treatment is performed under an inert gas atmosphere containing nitrogen or a rare gas such as helium, neon, argon, xenon, or krypton. Alternatively, the heat treatment may be performed under an inert gas atmosphere first, and then under an oxygen atmosphere. It is preferable that the above inert gas atmosphere and the above oxygen atmosphere do not contain hydrogen, water, and the like. The treatment time is from 3 minutes to 24 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">An electric furnace, an RTA apparatus, or the like can be used for the heat treatment. With the use of an RTA apparatus, the heat treatment can be performed at a temperature of higher than or equal to the strain point of the substrate if the heating time is short. Therefore, the heat treatment time can be shortened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">By forming the oxide semiconductor film while it is heated or performing heat treatment after the formation of the oxide semiconductor film, the hydrogen concentration in the oxide semiconductor film which is measured by SIMS can be 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower, 1×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower, 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower, 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower, 5×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower, or 1×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">For example, in the case where an oxide semiconductor film, e.g., an InGaZnO<sub>X </sub>(X&gt;0) film is formed using a deposition apparatus employing ALD, an In(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>gas and an O<sub>3 </sub>gas are sequentially introduced more than once to form an InO<sub>2 </sub>layer, a Ga(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>gas and an O<sub>3 </sub>gas are introduced at a time to form a GaO layer, and then a Zn(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>gas and an O<sub>3 </sub>gas are introduced at a time to form a ZnO layer. Note that the order of these layers is not limited to this example. A mixed compound layer such as an InGaO<sub>2 </sub>layer, an InZnO<sub>2 </sub>layer, a GaInO layer, a ZnInO layer, or a GaZnO layer may be formed by mixing of these gases. Note that although an H<sub>2</sub>O gas which is obtained by bubbling with an inert gas such as Ar may be used instead of an O<sub>3 </sub>gas, it is preferable to use an O<sub>3 </sub>gas, which does not contain H. Instead of an In(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>gas, an In(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>gas may be used. Instead of a Ga(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>gas, a Ga(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>gas may be used. Furthermore, a Zn(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>gas may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">Here, a 35-nm-thick oxide semiconductor film is formed by a sputtering method, and then, oxygen contained in the insulating film <b>104</b> is moved to the oxide semiconductor film by heat treatment. Next, a mask is formed over the oxide semiconductor film, and part of the oxide semiconductor film is selectively etched. In this manner, the oxide semiconductor films <b>105</b> and <b>108</b> are formed. As the oxide semiconductor film, an In—Ga—Zn oxide film (In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1.2) is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">When the heat treatment is performed at a temperature higher than 350° C. and lower than or equal to 650° C., or higher than or equal to 450° C. and lower than or equal to 600° C., it is possible to obtain an oxide semiconductor film whose proportion of CAAC, which is described later, is greater than or equal to 60% and less than 100%, greater than or equal to 80% and less than 100%, greater than or equal to 90% and less than 100%, or greater than or equal to 95% and less than or equal to 98%. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain an oxide semiconductor film having a low content of hydrogen, water, and the like. That is, an oxide semiconductor film with a low impurity concentration and a low density of defect states can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, an insulating film <b>115</b> is formed over the insulating film <b>104</b> and the oxide semiconductor films <b>105</b> and <b>108</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">In the case where the conductive films <b>119</b> and <b>120</b> are formed using, for example, a low-resistance material, entry of the low-resistance material into the oxide semiconductor films leads to poor electrical characteristics of the transistors. In this embodiment, the insulating film <b>115</b> is formed before the conductive films <b>119</b> and <b>120</b> are formed; thus, the channel region in each of the oxide semiconductor films <b>105</b> and <b>108</b> is not in contact with the conductive films <b>119</b> and <b>120</b>. Therefore, the variation in the electrical characteristics, typically threshold voltage, of the transistors can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">As the insulating film <b>115</b>, a silicon oxide film or a silicon oxynitride film can be formed by a CVD method. In this case, a deposition gas containing silicon and an oxidizing gas are preferably used as a source gas. Typical examples of the deposition gas containing silicon include silane, disilane, trisilane, and silane fluoride. Examples of the oxidizing gas include oxygen, ozone, dinitrogen monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">The insulating film <b>115</b> can be formed by a plasma CVD method using a microwave. The microwave refers to a wave in the frequency range of 300 MHz to 300 GHz. In the case of using a microwave, electron temperature is low and electron energy is low. Furthermore, in supplied power, the proportion of power used for acceleration of electrons is low, and therefore, power can be used for dissociation and ionization of more molecules. Thus, plasma with high density (high-density plasma) can be excited. Therefore, a deposition surface and a deposit are less damaged by plasma, and the insulating film <b>115</b> with few defects can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">Alternatively, the insulating film <b>115</b> can be formed by a CVD method using an organosilane gas.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">By using the transistor with high field-effect mobility, a demultiplexer circuit can be formed in a signal line driver circuit which is an example of the driver circuit portion. A demultiplexer circuit distributes one input signal to a plurality of outputs; thus, using the demultiplexer circuit can reduce the number of input terminals for input signals. For example, when one pixel includes a red sub-pixel, a green sub-pixel, and a blue sub-pixel and a demultiplexer circuit corresponding to each pixel is provided, an input signal can be distributed by the demultiplexer circuit to be input to each sub-pixel.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0287">When a gate voltage is set to be higher than or equal to the threshold voltage of the transistor, an electron flows preferentially in the channel region <b>105</b> <i>a </i>owing to the difference between the energies of the conduction band minimums of the channel region <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and the channel region <b>105</b> <i>a</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0288">Accordingly, in the transistor of one embodiment of the present invention, the embedment of an electron reduces the influence of interface scattering.

Here, the resistivity was measured by the Van der Pauw method using four terminals.

Measurement results of the oxide conductor film (OC_SiN<sub>x</sub>) are plotted as squares, measurement results of the oxide conductor film (OC_Ar dope+SiN<sub>x</sub>) are plotted as circles, and measurement results of the oxide conductor film (OC_Ar plasma+SiN<sub>x</sub>) are plotted as triangles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0455" num="0454">Note that although not shown, the oxide semiconductor film which is not in contact with the silicon nitride film had high resistivity, which was difficult to measure.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0456" num="0455">According to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, in the case where the oxide conductor film (OC_Ar dope+SiN<sub>x</sub>) and the oxide conductor film (OC_Ar plasma+SiN<sub>x</sub>) contain an oxygen vacancy and hydrogen, variation in resistivity is small. Typically, the variation in resistivity at temperatures from 80 K to 290 K is lower than ±20%. Alternatively, the variation in resistivity at temperatures from 150 K to 250 K is lower than ±10%. In other words, the oxide conductor is a degenerate semiconductor and it is suggested that the conduction band edge agrees with or substantially agrees with the Fermi level. Thus, when the oxide conductor film is used as a source region and a drain region of a transistor, an ohmic contact occurs at a portion where the oxide conductor film is in contact with conductive films functioning as a source electrode and a drain electrode, and the contact resistance between the oxide conductor film and the conductive films functioning as a source electrode and a drain electrode can be reduced. Furthermore, the oxide conductor has low temperature resistance of resistivity; thus, a fluctuation of contact resistance between the oxide conductor film and conductive films functioning as a source electrode and a drain electrode is small, and a highly reliable transistor can be obtained.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0460" num="0459">A structure of an oxide semiconductor is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0461" num="0460">An oxide semiconductor is classified into a single crystal oxide semiconductor and a non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor. Examples of a non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor include a CAAC-OS, a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor, a nanocrystalline oxide semiconductor (nc-OS), an amorphous-like oxide semiconductor (a-like OS), and an amorphous oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0462" num="0461">From another perspective, an oxide semiconductor is classified into an amorphous oxide semiconductor and a crystalline oxide semiconductor. Examples of a crystalline oxide semiconductor include a single crystal oxide semiconductor, a CAAC-OS, a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor, and an nc-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0463" num="0462">It is known that an amorphous structure is generally defined as being metastable and unfixed, and being isotropic and having no non-uniform structure. In other words, an amorphous structure has a flexible bond angle and a short-range order but does not have a long-range order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0464" num="0463">This means that an inherently stable oxide semiconductor cannot be regarded as a completely amorphous oxide semiconductor. Moreover, an oxide semiconductor that is not isotropic (e.g., an oxide semiconductor that has a periodic structure in a microscopic region) cannot be regarded as a completely amorphous oxide semiconductor. Note that an a-like OS has a periodic structure in a microscopic region, but at the same time has a void and has an unstable structure. For this reason, an a-like OS has physical properties similar to those of an amorphous oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0028" num="0000">&lt;CAAC-OS&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0465" num="0464">First, a CAAC-OS is described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0466" num="0465">A CAAC-OS is one of oxide semiconductors having a plurality of c-axis aligned crystal parts (also referred to as pellets).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0467" num="0466">In a combined analysis image (also referred to as a high-resolution TEM image) of a bright-field image and a diffraction pattern of a CAAC-OS, which is obtained using a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a plurality of pellets can be observed. However, in the high-resolution TEM image, a boundary between pellets, that is, a grain boundary is not clearly observed. Thus, in the CAAC-OS, a reduction in electron mobility due to the grain boundary is less likely to occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0468" num="0467">A CAAC-OS observed with TEM is described below. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref> shows a high-resolution TEM image of a cross section of the CAAC-OS which is observed from a direction substantially parallel to the sample surface. The high-resolution TEM image is obtained with a spherical aberration corrector function. The high-resolution TEM image obtained with a spherical aberration corrector function is particularly referred to as a Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM image. The Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM image can be obtained with, for example, an atomic resolution analytical electron microscope JEM-ARM200F manufactured by JEOL Ltd.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0469" num="0468"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref> is an enlarged Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM image of a region (I) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref> shows that metal atoms are arranged in a layered manner in a pellet. Each metal atom layer has a configuration reflecting unevenness of a surface over which the CAAC-OS is formed (hereinafter, the surface is referred to as a formation surface) or a top surface of the CAAC-OS, and is arranged parallel to the formation surface or the top surface of the CAAC-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0470" num="0469">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref>, the CAAC-OS has a characteristic atomic arrangement. The characteristic atomic arrangement is denoted by an auxiliary line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41C</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41B and 41C</figref> prove that the size of a pellet is approximately 1 nm to 3 nm, and the size of a space caused by tilt of the pellets is approximately 0.8 nm. Therefore, the pellet can also be referred to as a nanocrystal (nc). Furthermore, the CAAC-OS can also be referred to as an oxide semiconductor including c-axis aligned nanocrystals (CANC).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0471" num="0470">Here, according to the Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM images, the schematic arrangement of pellets <b>5100</b> of a CAAC-OS over a substrate <b>5120</b> is illustrated by such a structure in which bricks or blocks are stacked (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41D</figref>). The part in which the pellets are tilted as observed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41C</figref> corresponds to a region <b>5161</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0472" num="0471"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref> shows a Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM image of a plane of the CAAC-OS observed from a direction substantially perpendicular to the sample surface. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42B, 42C, and 42D</figref> are enlarged Cs-corrected high-resolution TEM images of regions (<b>1</b>), (<b>2</b>), and (<b>3</b>) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>, respectively. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42B, 42C, and 42D</figref> indicate that metal atoms are arranged in a triangular, quadrangular, or hexagonal configuration in a pellet. However, there is no regularity of arrangement of metal atoms between different pellets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0473" num="0472">Next, a CAAC-OS analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) is described. For example, when the structure of a CAAC-OS including an InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal is analyzed by an out-of-plane method, a peak appears at a diffraction angle (<b>26</b>) of around 31° as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref>. This peak is derived from the (009) plane of the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal, which indicates that crystals in the CAAC-OS have c-axis alignment, and that the c-axes are aligned in a direction substantially perpendicular to the formation surface or the top surface of the CAAC-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0474" num="0473">Note that in structural analysis of the CAAC-OS by an out-of-plane method, another peak may appear when 2θ is around 36°, in addition to the peak at 2θ of around 31°. The peak at 2θ of around 36° indicates that a crystal having no c-axis alignment is included in part of the CAAC-OS. It is preferable that in the CAAC-OS analyzed by an out-of-plane method, a peak appear when 2θ is around 31 and that a peak not appear when 2θ is around 360.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0475" num="0474">On the other hand, in structural analysis of the CAAC-OS by an in-plane method in which an X-ray beam is incident on a sample in a direction substantially perpendicular to the c-axis, a peak appears when 2θ is around 56°. This peak is attributed to the (110) plane of the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal. In the case of the CAAC-OS, when analysis (ϕ scan) is performed with 2θ fixed at around 56° and with the sample rotated using a normal vector of the sample surface as an axis (ϕ axis), as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</figref>, a peak is not clearly observed. In contrast, in the case of a single crystal oxide semiconductor of InGaZnO<sub>4</sub>, when ϕ scan is performed with 2θ fixed at around 56°, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43C</figref>, six peaks which are derived from crystal planes equivalent to the (110) plane are observed. Accordingly, the structural analysis using XRD shows that the directions of a-axes and b-axes are irregularly oriented in the CAAC-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0476" num="0475">Next, a CAAC-OS analyzed by electron diffraction is described. For example, when an electron beam with a probe diameter of 300 nm is incident on a CAAC-OS including an InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal in a direction parallel to the sample surface, a diffraction pattern (also referred to as a selected-area transmission electron diffraction pattern) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44A</figref> can be obtained. In this diffraction pattern, spots derived from the (009) plane of an InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal are included. Thus, the electron diffraction also indicates that pellets included in the CAAC-OS have c-axis alignment and that the c-axes are aligned in a direction substantially perpendicular to the formation surface or the top surface of the CAAC-OS. Meanwhile, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref> shows a diffraction pattern obtained in such a manner that an electron beam with a probe diameter of 300 nm is incident on the same sample in a direction perpendicular to the sample surface. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref>, a ring-like diffraction pattern is observed. Thus, the electron diffraction also indicates that the a-axes and b-axes of the pellets included in the CAAC-OS do not have regular alignment. The first ring in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref> is considered to be derived from the (010) plane, the (100) plane, and the like of the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal. The second ring in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref> is considered to be derived from the (110) plane and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0477" num="0476">As described above, the CAAC-OS is an oxide semiconductor with high crystallinity. Entry of impurities, formation of defects, or the like might decrease the crystallinity of an oxide semiconductor. This means that the CAAC-OS has small amounts of impurities and defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0478" num="0477">Note that the impurity means an element other than the main components of the oxide semiconductor, such as hydrogen, carbon, silicon, or a transition metal element. For example, an element (specifically, silicon or the like) having higher strength of bonding to oxygen than a metal element included in an oxide semiconductor extracts oxygen from the oxide semiconductor, which results in disorder of the atomic arrangement and reduced crystallinity of the oxide semiconductor. A heavy metal such as iron or nickel, argon, carbon dioxide, or the like has a large atomic radius (or molecular radius), and thus disturbs the atomic arrangement of the oxide semiconductor and decreases crystallinity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0479" num="0478">The characteristics of an oxide semiconductor having impurities or defects might be changed by light, heat, or the like. Impurities contained in the oxide semiconductor might serve as carrier traps or carrier generation sources, for example. Furthermore, oxygen vacancies in the oxide semiconductor serve as carrier traps or serve as carrier generation sources when hydrogen is captured therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0480" num="0479">The CAAC-OS having small amounts of impurities and oxygen vacancies is an oxide semiconductor with low carrier density (specifically, lower than 8×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than 1×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than 1×10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, and is higher than or equal to 1×10<sup>−9</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>). Such an oxide semiconductor is referred to as a highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor. A CAAC-OS has a low impurity concentration and a low density of defect states. Thus, the CAAC-OS can be referred to as an oxide semiconductor having stable characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0029" num="0000">&lt;nc-OS&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0481" num="0480">Next, an nc-OS will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0482" num="0481">An nc-OS has a region in which a crystal part is observed and a region in which a crystal part is not clearly observed in a high-resolution TEM image. In most cases, the size of a crystal part included in the nc-OS is greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, or greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm. Note that an oxide semiconductor including a crystal part whose size is greater than 10 nm and less than or equal to 100 nm is sometimes referred to as a microcrystalline oxide semiconductor. In a high-resolution TEM image of the nc-OS, for example, a grain boundary is not clearly observed in some cases. Note that there is a possibility that the origin of the nanocrystal is the same as that of a pellet in a CAAC-OS. Therefore, a crystal part of the nc-OS may be referred to as a pellet in the following description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0483" num="0482">In the nc-OS, a microscopic region (for example, a region with a size greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 10 nm, in particular, a region with a size greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 3 nm) has a periodic atomic arrangement. There is no regularity of crystal orientation between different pellets in the nc-OS. Thus, the orientation of the whole film is not ordered. Accordingly, the nc-OS cannot be distinguished from an a-like OS or an amorphous oxide semiconductor, depending on an analysis method. For example, when the nc-OS is analyzed by an out-of-plane method using an X-ray beam having a diameter larger than the size of a pellet, a peak which shows a crystal plane does not appear. Furthermore, a diffraction pattern like a halo pattern is observed when the nc-OS is subjected to electron diffraction using an electron beam with a probe diameter (e.g., 50 nm or larger) that is larger than the size of a pellet. Meanwhile, spots appear in a nanobeam electron diffraction pattern of the nc-OS when an electron beam having a probe diameter close to or smaller than the size of a pellet is applied. Moreover, in a nanobeam electron diffraction pattern of the nc-OS, regions with high luminance in a circular (ring) pattern are shown in some cases. Also in a nanobeam electron diffraction pattern of the nc-OS, a plurality of spots is shown in a ring-like region in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0484" num="0483">Since there is no regularity of crystal orientation between the pellets (nanocrystals) as mentioned above, the nc-OS can also be referred to as an oxide semiconductor including random aligned nanocrystals (RANC) or an oxide semiconductor including non-aligned nanocrystals (NANC).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0485" num="0484">The nc-OS is an oxide semiconductor that has high regularity as compared with an amorphous oxide semiconductor. Therefore, the nc-OS is likely to have a lower density of defect states than an a-like OS and an amorphous oxide semiconductor. Note that there is no regularity of crystal orientation between different pellets in the nc-OS. Therefore, the nc-OS has a higher density of defect states than the CAAC-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0030" num="0000">&lt;a-like OS&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0486" num="0485">An a-like OS has a structure intermediate between those of the nc-OS and the amorphous oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0487" num="0486">In a high-resolution TEM image of the a-like OS, a void may be observed. Furthermore, in the high-resolution TEM image, there are a region where a crystal part is clearly observed and a region where a crystal part is not observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0488" num="0487">The a-like OS has an unstable structure because it includes a void. To verify that an a-like OS has an unstable structure as compared with a CAAC-OS and an nc-OS, a change in structure caused by electron irradiation is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0489" num="0488">An a-like OS (referred to as Sample A), an nc-OS (referred to as Sample B), and a CAAC-OS (referred to as Sample C) are prepared as samples subjected to electron irradiation. Each of the samples is an In—Ga—Zn oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0490" num="0489">First, a high-resolution cross-sectional TEM image of each sample is obtained. The high-resolution cross-sectional TEM images show that all the samples have crystal parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0491" num="0490">Note that which part is regarded as a crystal part is determined as follows. It is known that a unit cell of an InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal has a structure in which nine layers including three In—O layers and six Ga—Zn—O layers are stacked in the c-axis direction. The distance between the adjacent layers is equivalent to the lattice spacing on the (009) plane (also referred to as d value). The value is calculated to be 0.29 nm from crystal structural analysis. Accordingly, a portion where the lattice spacing between lattice fringes is greater than or equal to 0.28 nm and less than or equal to 0.30 nm is regarded as a crystal part of InGaZnO<sub>4</sub>. Each of lattice fringes corresponds to the a-b plane of the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0492" num="0491"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> shows change in the average size of crystal parts (at 22 points to 45 points) in each sample. Note that the crystal part size corresponds to the length of a lattice fringe. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> indicates that the crystal part size in the a-like OS increases with an increase in the cumulative electron dose. Specifically, as shown by (<b>1</b>) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, a crystal part of approximately 1.2 nm (also referred to as an initial nucleus) at the start of TEM observation grows to a size of approximately 2.6 nm at a cumulative electron dose of 4.2×10<sup>8 </sup>e<sup>−</sup>/nm<sup>2</sup>. In contrast, the crystal part size in the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS shows little change from the start of electron irradiation to a cumulative electron dose of 4.2×10<sup>8 </sup>e<sup>−</sup>/nm<sup>2</sup>. Specifically, as shown by (<b>2</b>) and (<b>3</b>) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, the average crystal sizes in an nc-OS and a CAAC-OS are approximately 1.4 nm and approximately 2.1 nm, respectively, regardless of the cumulative electron dose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0493" num="0492">In this manner, growth of the crystal part in the a-like OS is induced by electron irradiation. In contrast, in the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS, growth of the crystal part is hardly induced by electron irradiation. Therefore, the a-like OS has an unstable structure as compared with the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0494" num="0493">The a-like OS has a lower density than the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS because it includes a void. Specifically, the density of the a-like OS is higher than or equal to 78.6% and lower than 92.3% of the density of the single crystal oxide semiconductor having the same composition. The density of each of the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS is higher than or equal to 92.3% and lower than 100% of the density of the single crystal oxide semiconductor having the same composition. Note that it is difficult to deposit an oxide semiconductor having a density of lower than 78% of the density of the single crystal oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0495" num="0494">For example, in the case of an oxide semiconductor having an atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1, the density of single crystal InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>with a rhombohedral crystal structure is 6.357 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Accordingly, in the case of the oxide semiconductor having an atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1, the density of the a-like OS is higher than or equal to 5.0 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and lower than 5.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. For example, in the case of the oxide semiconductor having an atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1, the density of each of the nc-OS and the CAAC-OS is higher than or equal to 5.9 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and lower than 6.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0496" num="0495">Note that there is a possibility that an oxide semiconductor having a certain composition cannot exist in a single crystal structure. In that case, single crystal oxide semiconductors with different compositions are combined at an adequate ratio, which makes it possible to calculate density equivalent to that of a single crystal oxide semiconductor with the desired composition. The density of a single crystal oxide semiconductor having the desired composition can be calculated using a weighted average according to the combination ratio of the single crystal oxide semiconductors with different compositions. Note that it is preferable to use as few kinds of single crystal oxide semiconductors as possible to calculate the density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0497" num="0496">As described above, oxide semiconductors have various structures and various properties. Note that an oxide semiconductor may be a stacked layer including two or more of an amorphous oxide semiconductor, an a-like OS, an nc-OS, and a CAAC-OS, for example.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0544" num="0543">The transistors used in this embodiment each include an oxide semiconductor film which is highly purified and in which formation of oxygen vacancies is suppressed. In the transistor, the current in an off state (off-state current) can be made small. Accordingly, an electrical signal such as an image signal can be held for a longer period, and a writing interval can be set longer in an on state. Accordingly, frequency of refresh operation can be reduced, which leads to an effect of suppressing power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0545" num="0544">In addition, the transistor used in this embodiment can have relatively high field-effect mobility and thus is capable of high speed operation. For example, with such a transistor which can operate at high speed used for a liquid crystal display device, a switching transistor in a pixel portion and a driver transistor in a driver circuit portion can be formed over one substrate. That is, a semiconductor device formed using a silicon wafer or the like is not additionally needed as a driver circuit, by which the number of components of the semiconductor device can be reduced.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0554" num="0553">The conductive film <b>772</b> is connected to the conductive films functioning as a source electrode and a drain electrode included in the transistor <b>750</b>. The conductive film <b>772</b> is formed over the planarization insulating film <b>770</b> to function as a pixel electrode, i.e., one electrode of the display element.

The display devices <b>700</b> and <b>700</b> <i>a </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A and 35B</figref> are what is called reflective color liquid crystal display devices in which external light is reflected by the conductive film <b>772</b> to display an image through the coloring film <b>736</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0555" num="0554">A conductive film that transmits visible light or a conductive film that reflects visible light can be used for the conductive film <b>772</b>. For example, a material including one kind selected from indium (In), zinc (Zn), and tin (Sn) is preferably used for the conductive film that transmits visible light. For example, a material including aluminum or silver may be used for the conductive film that reflects visible light. In this embodiment, the conductive film that reflects visible light is used for the conductive film <b>772</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0556" num="0555">Note that projections and depressions are provided in part of the planarization insulating film <b>770</b> of the pixel portion <b>702</b> in the display devices <b>700</b> and <b>700</b> <i>a </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A and 35B</figref>. The projections and depressions can be formed in such a manner that the planarization insulating film <b>770</b> is formed using an organic resin film or the like, and projecting portions or depressed portions are formed on the surface of the organic resin film. The conductive film <b>772</b> functioning as a reflective electrode is formed along the projections and depressions. Therefore, when external light is incident on the conductive film <b>772</b>, the light is reflected diffusely at the surface of the conductive film <b>772</b>, whereby visibility can be improved.</div>

For example, a transmissive color liquid crystal display device in which the conductive film <b>772</b> is a conductive film that transmits visible light may be used. In the case of a transmissive color liquid crystal display device, projections and depressions are not necessarily provided on the planarization insulating film <b>770</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0558" num="0557">Although not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A and 35B</figref>, an alignment film may be provided on a side of the conductive film <b>772</b> in contact with the liquid crystal layer <b>776</b> and on a side of the conductive film <b>774</b> in contact with the liquid crystal layer <b>776</b>. Although not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A and 35B</figref>, an optical member (an optical substrate) and the like such as a polarizing member, a retardation member, or an anti-reflection member may be provided as appropriate. For example, circular polarization may be employed by using a polarizing substrate and a retardation substrate. In addition, a backlight, a sidelight, or the like may be used as a light source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0559" num="0558">In the case where a liquid crystal element is used as the display element, a thermotropic liquid crystal, a low-molecular liquid crystal, a high-molecular liquid crystal, a polymer dispersed liquid crystal, a ferroelectric liquid crystal, an anti-ferroelectric liquid crystal, or the like can be used. Such a liquid crystal material exhibits a cholesteric phase, a smectic phase, a cubic phase, a chiral nematic phase, an isotropic phase, or the like depending on conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0560" num="0559">Alternatively, in the case of employing a horizontal electric field mode, a liquid crystal exhibiting a blue phase for which an alignment film is unnecessary may be used. A blue phase is one of liquid crystal phases, which is generated just before a cholesteric phase changes into an isotropic phase while temperature of cholesteric liquid crystal is increased. Since the blue phase appears only in a narrow temperature range, a liquid crystal composition in which several weight percent or more of a chiral material is mixed is used for the liquid crystal layer in order to improve the temperature range. The liquid crystal composition which includes a liquid crystal exhibiting a blue phase and a chiral material is preferable because it has a short response time, has optical isotropy, which makes the alignment process unneeded, and has a small viewing angle dependence. An alignment film does not need to be provided and rubbing treatment is thus not necessary; accordingly, electrostatic discharge damage caused by the rubbing treatment can be prevented and defects and damage of the liquid crystal display device in the manufacturing process can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0561" num="0560">In the case where a liquid crystal element is used as the display element, a twisted nematic (TN) mode, an in-plane-switching (IPS) mode, a fringe field switching (FFS) mode, an axially symmetric aligned micro-cell (ASM) mode, an optical compensated birefringence (OCB) mode, a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) mode, an antiferroelectric liquid crystal (AFLC) mode, or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0562" num="0561">Further, a normally black liquid crystal display device such as a transmissive liquid crystal display device utilizing a vertical alignment (VA) mode may also be used.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0568" num="0567">In this embodiment, one embodiment of a light-emitting device using the semiconductor device of one embodiment of the present invention is described. Note that in this embodiment, a structure of a pixel portion of a light-emitting device is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0569" num="0568">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, a plurality of FETs <b>500</b> is formed over a first substrate <b>502</b>, and each of the FETs <b>500</b> is electrically connected to a light-emitting element (<b>504</b>R, <b>504</b>G, <b>504</b>B, or <b>504</b>W). Specifically, each of the FETs <b>500</b> is electrically connected to a first conductive film <b>506</b> included in the light-emitting element. Note that the light-emitting elements (<b>504</b>R, <b>504</b>G, <b>504</b>B, and <b>504</b>W) each include the first conductive film <b>506</b>, a second conductive film <b>507</b>, an EL layer <b>510</b>, and a third conductive film <b>512</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0570" num="0569">Furthermore, coloring layers (<b>514</b>R, <b>514</b>G, <b>514</b>B, and <b>514</b>W) are provided in positions facing the corresponding light-emitting elements (<b>504</b>R, <b>504</b>G, <b>504</b>B, and <b>504</b>W). Note that the coloring layers (<b>514</b>R, <b>514</b>G, <b>514</b>B, and <b>514</b>W) are provided in contact with a second substrate <b>516</b>. Furthermore, a sealing film <b>518</b> is provided between the first substrate <b>502</b> and the second substrate <b>516</b>. For example, a glass material such as a glass frit, or a resin that is curable at room temperature such as a two-component type resin, a light curable resin, a heat-curable resin, and the like can be used for the sealing film <b>518</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0571" num="0570">A partition wall <b>508</b> is provided so as to cover end portions of adjacent stacks of the first conductive film <b>506</b> and the second conductive film <b>507</b>. A structure <b>509</b> is provided over the partition wall <b>508</b>. Note that the first conductive film <b>506</b> has a function as a reflective electrode and a function as an anode of the light-emitting element. The second conductive film <b>507</b> has a function of adjusting the optical path length of each light-emitting element. The EL layer <b>510</b> is formed over the second conductive film <b>507</b>, and the third conductive film <b>512</b> is formed over the EL layer <b>510</b>. The third conductive film <b>512</b> has a function as a semi-transmissive and semi-reflective electrode and a function as a cathode of the light-emitting element. The structure <b>509</b> is provided between the light-emitting element and the coloring layer and has a function as a spacer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0572" num="0571">The EL layer <b>510</b> can be shared by the light-emitting elements (<b>504</b>R, <b>504</b>G, <b>504</b>B, and <b>504</b>W). Note that each of the light-emitting elements (<b>504</b>R, <b>504</b>G, <b>504</b>B, and <b>504</b>W) has a micro optical resonator (or microcavity) structure which allows light emitted from the EL layer <b>510</b> to resonate by the first conductive film <b>506</b> and the third conductive film <b>512</b>; thus, spectra of light with different wavelengths can be narrowed and extracted even when they include the same EL layer <b>510</b>. Specifically, by adjusting the thickness of each of the second conductive films <b>507</b> provided under the EL layer <b>510</b> in the light-emitting element (<b>504</b>R, <b>5040</b>, <b>504</b>B, or <b>504</b>W), a desired emission spectrum can be obtained from the EL layer <b>510</b>, so that light emission with high color purity can be obtained. Therefore, the structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> does not require a process of separately forming EL layers with different colors, and facilitates achieving high resolution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0573" num="0572">The light-emitting device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> includes the coloring layer (color filter); thus, light with a desired emission spectrum can be emitted. Therefore, by using the microcavity structure and the color filter in combination, light emission with higher color purity can be obtained. Specifically, the optical path length of the light-emitting element <b>504</b>R is adjusted so that red light emission is provided; red light is emitted in the direction indicated by an arrow through the coloring layer <b>514</b>R. Furthermore, the optical path length of the light-emitting element <b>504</b>G is adjusted so that green light emission is provided; green light is emitted in the direction indicated by an arrow through the coloring layer <b>514</b>G. Furthermore, the optical path length of the light-emitting element <b>504</b>B is adjusted so that blue light emission is provided; blue light is emitted in the direction indicated by an arrow through the coloring layer <b>514</b>B. Furthermore, the optical path length of the light-emitting element <b>504</b>W is adjusted so that white light emission is provided; white light is emitted in the direction indicated by an arrow through the coloring layer <b>514</b>W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0574" num="0573">Note that a method for adjusting the optical path length of each light-emitting element is not limited thereto. For example, the optical path length may be adjusted by controlling the film thickness of the EL layer <b>510</b> in each light-emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0575" num="0574">The coloring layers (<b>514</b>R, <b>514</b>G, and <b>514</b>B) may have a function of transmitting light in a particular wavelength region. For example, a red (R) color filter for transmitting light in a red wavelength range, a green (<b>0</b>) color filter for transmitting light in a green wavelength range, a blue (B) color filter for transmitting light in a blue wavelength range, or the like can be used. The coloring layer <b>514</b>W may be formed using an acrylic-based resin material which does not contain a pigment or the like. The coloring layers (<b>514</b>R, <b>514</b>G, <b>514</b>B, and <b>514</b>W) can be formed using any of various materials by a printing method, an inkjet method, an etching method using a photolithography technique, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0576" num="0575">The first conductive film <b>506</b> can be formed using, for example, a metal film having high reflectivity (reflection factor of visible light is 40% to 100%, preferably 70% to 100%). The first conductive film <b>506</b> can be formed using a single layer or a stacked layer using aluminum, silver, or an alloy containing such a metal material (e.g., an alloy of silver, palladium, and copper).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0577" num="0576">The second conductive film <b>507</b> can be formed using, for example, conductive metal oxide. As the conductive metal oxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, indium tin oxide (also referred to as ITO), indium zinc oxide, or any of these metal oxide materials in which silicon oxide or tungsten oxide is contained can be used. Providing the second conductive film <b>507</b> is preferable because the formation of an insulating film between the EL layer <b>510</b> to be formed later and the first conductive film <b>506</b> can be suppressed. Furthermore, conductive metal oxide which is used as the second conductive film <b>507</b> may be formed in layer lower than the first conductive film <b>506</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0578" num="0577">The third conductive film <b>512</b> is formed using a conductive material having reflectivity and a conductive material having a light-transmitting property, and visible light reflectivity of the film is preferably 20% to 80%, more preferably 40% to 70%. As the third conductive film <b>512</b>, for example, silver, magnesium, an alloy of such a metal material, or the like is formed to be thin (e.g., 10 nm or less), and then, conductive metal oxide which can be used for the second conductive film <b>507</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0579" num="0578">The above-described light-emitting device has a structure in which light is extracted from the second substrate <b>516</b> side (a top emission structure), but may have a structure in which light is extracted from the first substrate <b>501</b> side where the FETs <b>500</b> are formed (a bottom emission structure) or a structure in which light is extracted from both the first substrate <b>501</b> side and the second substrate <b>516</b> side (a dual emission structure). In the case of the bottom emission structure, the coloring layers (<b>514</b>R, <b>514</b>G, <b>514</b>B, and <b>514</b>W) may be formed under the first conductive film <b>506</b>. Note that a light-transmitting substrate may be used for the substrate through which light is transmitted, and a light-transmitting substrate and a light-blocking substrate may be used for the substrate through which light is not transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0580" num="0579">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the structure in which the light-emitting elements emit light of red (R), green (G), blue (B), and white (W) is illustrated as an example.
