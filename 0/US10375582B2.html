<heading id="h-0006">Overview</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">A method is provided for a mobile device to transmit data over a shared spectrum in an uplink channel to a base station. The mobile device obtains data to be wirelessly transmitted over a shared spectrum in an uplink channel to a base station. The uplink channel comprises a plurality of frames and subframes with a predetermined timing. The method involves determining whether the shared spectrum is free for transmission according to a Listen Before Transmit procedure. Responsive to a determination that the shared spectrum is free for transmission, the mobile device selects a start time in the uplink channel that mitigates interference from other mobile devices in proximity to the mobile device. Beginning at the start time, the mobile device transmits the data over the shared spectrum in the uplink channel to the base station.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Presented herein are techniques for uplink channel access, medium reservation and uplink transmission for LTE operation in the unlicensed spectrum. These schemes ensure that LTE-LAA UEs contend for medium access in a fair manner with respect to other devices (e.g. Wi-Fi®) in unlicensed frequencies. Unlike existing solutions that typically try to reuse the scheduled uplink access principles of an LTE uplink (which can be sub-optimal when LBT is considered), these schemes may use randomized, contention-based uplink channel access.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">LTE devices can experience (and create) dynamic and unpredictable interference when receiving (and transmitting) in unlicensed spectrum. Examples of such interface are: cross-radio access technology (RAT) interference from unmanaged devices (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.), interference between UE devices belonging to different operators but served by an eNodeB with identical Physical Layer Cell ID (PCI collision), potential de-sense when a UE carries multiple RAT devices (e.g. receiving a Wi-Fi signal can be impaired if the same device transmits on LTE on the same channel).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Presented herein are modifications to uplink channel access for Licensed Assisted Access LTE (LAA-LTE) operation in unlicensed spectrum. Due to Listen-Before-Talk mechanism employed at both eNodeB (eNB) and UE, the following may no longer apply:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">1. A fixed latency (=4 ms in LTE-Frequency Division Duplex (FDD)) between the time of reception of scheduling grant and time of sending of uplink data (via PUSCH).</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0019">2. Synchronous Uplink HARQ operation.</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0020">3. PUSCH transmission starts at subframe boundary.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0021">Thus, presented herein are techniques for uplink channel access, medium reservation and uplink transmission for LAA-LTE operation in the unlicensed spectrum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0022">To mitigate interference from/to LTE devices, 3GPP has agreed to the following.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0023">License-Assisted Access (LAA) to ensure that the LTE operation over unlicensed frequency channel is tethered via a licensed primary carrier;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0024">LAA-LTE shall abide by region specific regulation (Europe, Japan) concerning transmission over unlicensed frequencies;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0025">Listen-before-talk (LBT) to ensure that LTE devices monitor the background energy on the medium before transmitting any signal; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0026">Limit maximum transmit burst duration to prevent persistent background LTE interference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a simplified block diagram of LAA-LTE system <b>100</b> is shown. LAA-LTE system includes LTE eNB <b>110</b> and mobile wireless nodes <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> that communicate over a shared spectrum of wireless frequencies. A Wi-Fi access point <b>130</b> also uses the shared spectrum to communicate with mobile wireless node <b>124</b>. In one example, one or more of the wireless nodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and/or <b>124</b> may be capable of communicating using both LAA-LTE transmissions and Wi-Fi transmissions. Wireless nodes <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> receive wireless transmissions from the LTE eNB <b>110</b> in downlink channels <b>140</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively. Wireless nodes <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> send wireless transmissions to the LTE eNB <b>110</b> in uplink channels <b>150</b> and <b>152</b>, respectively. Wi-Fi access point <b>130</b> and wireless node <b>124</b> communicate back and forth through a channel <b>160</b> on the shared spectrum, which may interfere with LAA-LTE transmissions to/from the LTE eNB <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0028">In one example, a typical LTE uplink <b>150</b> obeys the following principles:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0029">Given a scheduling grant at time slot “n”, the Physical Uplink Shared Control Channel (PUSCH) is transmitted at (n+k) where k=4 (for Frequency Division Duplex (FDD)) and k depends on the subframe configuration for Time Division Duplex (TDD); and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0030">LTE uplink <b>150</b> may employ synchronous HARQ with an 8 HARQ process in FDD. By synchronous, it is meant that the HARQ process number is implicitly determined by the index of the subframe on which the scheduling grant takes place.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0031">In another example, uplink channel access in LAA-LTE may not reuse the channel access mechanism over licensed carrier because LBT is required at both eNB <b>110</b> (prior to sending a Downlink Control Information (DCI), i.e., a scheduling grant) and wireless node <b>120</b> (prior to PUSCH transmission). Thus, the latency between the time of the scheduling grant and the time of channel access may be unpredictable if the wireless node <b>120</b> is unable to transmit due to the medium being busy. Additionally, due to the LBT process prior to transmission over the unlicensed channel, synchronous uplink HARQ operation may not work. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, if wireless node <b>120</b> detects a transmission from wireless node <b>124</b> (i.e., a client of Wi-Fi access point <b>130</b>) to access point <b>130</b>, its LBT mechanism would prevent the wireless node <b>120</b> from transmitting in response to the UL scheduling grant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0032">Presented herein are uplink enhancements for LAA-LTE in terms of channel access, data scheduling and data transmission for unlicensed operation.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Listen Before Talk (LBT)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0033">In one example, a wireless node <b>120</b> monitors the energy of the shared spectrum/medium and declares the medium is BUSY if the energy exceeds a threshold, Edmresh. This consists of an Initial Clear Channel Assessment (ICCA) followed by (optional) Extended CCA (ECCA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0034">The LBT mechanism presented in this example proceeds in two stages:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0035">ICCA: Continuously listen to the medium for a time duration D<sub>icca</sub>. If the medium is free, the wireless node <b>120</b> is free to transmit as long as the subframe is a valid uplink subframe (in case of TDD). Otherwise, the wireless node <b>120</b> follows an Extended CCA procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0036">ECCA: For each ECCA slot (slot duration=D<sub>ecca</sub>) in which the medium is idle, the counter (initially set to a suitably chosen number N) is decremented by one. N is chosen to be either a fixed value or adjusted dynamically (e.g. truncated exponential back-off). If the wireless node <b>120</b> detects that the medium is busy with N&gt;0 or if the transmission is only for downlink transmissions, the wireless node <b>120</b> freezes the counter N. The wireless node <b>120</b> resumes counting down the backoff counter N once the medium is free and once the subframe is a valid uplink subframe. Once N=0, the wireless node <b>120</b> stops the counter and declares and end of the LBT process. The wireless node <b>120</b> is now free to transmit data (via PUSCH), and optionally a reservation signal, as described hereinafter.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">Reservation Signal</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0037">When the wireless node <b>120</b> has performed contention back-off and is ready to transmit PUSCH, it is desirable that the wireless node <b>120</b> informs its neighbor devices (via a signal) that it is going to radiate energy on the medium. The neighbors (e.g., wireless nodes <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and/or Wi-Fi access point <b>130</b>), upon hearing the signal, will refrain from transmitting on the medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0038">A reservation signal (RS) is transmitted by the wireless node <b>120</b> to inform neighbor LTE devices (e.g., wireless node <b>122</b>) and non-LTE devices (e.g., Wi-Fi access point <b>130</b>) of an impending transmission. The RS is transmitted on the uplink after an LBT process is performed at the wireless node <b>120</b>. The RS occupies K&gt;=1 LTE OFDM symbols (K is a function of the time gap until nearest available PUSCH segment). In one example, the RS transmission is wide-band to obtain frequency diversity. Alternatively, the RS may be transmitted over the set of resource blocks (RBs) over which the wireless node <b>120</b> transmits its PUSCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0039">The RS serves two purposes:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0040">1. Alerts neighbor LAA-LTE devices (including the eNB <b>110</b> serving the wireless node <b>120</b>) regarding an impending uplink transmission from the wireless node <b>120</b>. The signal may also contains information such as the Cell Radio Network Temporary Identifier (C-RNTI) of the wireless node <b>120</b>, the start time of PUSCH transmission and the Public Land Mobile Network Identity (PLMN-ID) which may be useful for inter-operator operation in same unlicensed frequency channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0041">2. Alerts Wi-Fi devices (e.g., Wi-Fi access point <b>130</b> and wireless node <b>124</b>) for which the uplink transmissions of the mobile device <b>120</b> are received above a predetermined threshold, Ed-Threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0042">In one example, the contents of the RS may include a substantially identical format and transmission structure as Wi-Fi Request-to-Send (RTS) with dedicated media access control (MAC) addresses for wireless node <b>120</b> (i.e., as a sender) and LTE eNB <b>110</b> (i.e., as a receiver). This informs neighbor Wi-Fi devices (e.g., Wi-Fi access point <b>130</b> and wireless node <b>124</b>) of an impending LTE transmission. The duration field may be populated by the time duration for which the PUSCH transmission occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0043">Alternatively, the contents of the RS may include a dedicated signal communicating one or more of the following information: Modulation Coding Scheme (MCS) of the uplink transmission, C-RNTI, PLMN-ID of the carrier network to which the wireless node <b>120</b> belongs, transmission duration and starting OFDM symbol (PUSCH segment) of the PUSCH transmission, HARQ process ID of the Uplink Shared Channel (UL-SCH), and/or redundancy version.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0044">In one example, the C-RNTI may be sent explicitly. Alternatively, the C-RNTI may be included in the RS implicitly, e.g., by applying a scrambling sequence that is a function of the C-RNTI and the Physical Layer Cell ID of the LTE eNB <b>110</b>.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Modifications to the LTE Uplink</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0045">The time of completion of LBT (i.e., initial defer time and contention-backoff time) may not align with the start of a valid subframe for an uplink transmission. The asynchronous nature of channel access for uplink transmission may cause the starting time of PUSCH to not align with an uplink subframe boundary. Additionally, due to LBT, the latency between the uplink grant reception time and the transmission of PUSCH may be unpredictable (e.g., due to congestion in medium). Further, multi-access operation over the LTE uplink channels may not be guaranteed since the transmission of the wireless node <b>120</b> over a subframe may prevent wireless node <b>122</b> from accessing the medium due to LBT requirements at the wireless node <b>122</b>. Modifications for the LTE-LAA uplink are presented in terms of PUSCH transmission, HARQ operation and channel access.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a simplified block diagram illustrates a wireless device, e.g., wireless node <b>120</b>, configured to perform the LAA-LTE uplink methods as presented herein. The wireless node <b>120</b> is shown as an example of a wireless device, but other wireless devices (e.g., wireless nodes <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>, LTE-eNB <b>110</b>) may include similar components that perform similar methods. The wireless device <b>120</b> includes a transmitter <b>210</b> (or multiple transmitters), a receiver <b>215</b> (or multiple receivers), an antenna <b>220</b>, a baseband processor <b>230</b> (e.g., a modem), and a controller <b>240</b> (e.g., a processor such as a microprocessor or microcontroller). The receiver <b>215</b> may comprise one or more receivers with the capability to detect signals according to a plurality of formats, e.g., Wi-Fi and LAA-LTE signals. The baseband processor <b>230</b> may perform media access control (MAC) functions as well as physical layer (PHY) functions. The methods presented herein may be implemented by control logic in the baseband processor <b>230</b>. The control logic may take the form of fixed or programmable digital logic gates. In another form, the control logic may be implemented by instructions stored/encoded in memory <b>250</b> (e.g., LTE uplink logic <b>252</b>, LBT logic <b>254</b>) and executed by the controller <b>240</b>. The memory <b>250</b> may also store data (e.g., user data, control data, etc.) related to the control logic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0047">The memory <b>250</b> may include read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), magnetic disk storage media devices, optical storage media devices, flash memory devices, electrical, optical, or other physical/tangible memory storage devices. Thus, in general, the memory <b>250</b> may comprise one or more tangible (non-transitory) computer readable storage media (e.g., a memory device) encoded with software comprising computer executable instructions and when the software is executed (by the controller <b>240</b>) it is operable to perform the operations described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an example of the signaling modification of the uplink transmission <b>150</b> is shown. Unlike licensed radio operation, the LBT mechanism at the wireless node <b>120</b> may potentially result in the wireless node <b>120</b> detecting that the medium is idle (hence free for transmission) in the middle of an uplink subframe. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> presents a scheme wherein the LTE subframe <b>310</b> is divided into segments (or sub-subframes) <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, and <b>318</b> and describes how the wireless node <b>120</b> conveys the start time of its data transmission to the LTE eNB <b>110</b> via the RS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0049">The wireless node <b>120</b> detects that the medium is busy during time period <b>320</b> by a clear channel assessment (e.g., ICCA/ECCA process) as part of a LBT process, which is not necessarily synchronized to any boundary between subframes or segments within the subframe. After the time period <b>320</b>, i.e., when the medium is determined to be free, the wireless node <b>120</b> may wait for a randomly determined backoff period <b>330</b> before transmitting the reservation signal <b>340</b>. The reservation signal <b>340</b> reserves the medium starting at the next segment boundary between segment <b>316</b> and segment <b>318</b>. The reservation signal <b>340</b> may also reserve the medium for additional uplink subframes, which may be contiguous or non-contiguous with the segment <b>318</b> and subframe <b>310</b>. Starting with the reserved segment <b>318</b>, the wireless node <b>120</b> begins transmitting user data on the PUSCH <b>350</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0050">In one example, the UL subframe <b>310</b> is divided into K segments (e.g., K=4 as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), with each segment corresponding to a candidate starting OFDM symbol for PUSCH transmission. The value of K, i.e., the number of segments, may be signaled by the LTE eNB <b>110</b>. In this example, each segment <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, or <b>318</b> may be thought of as a sub-subframe of subframe <b>310</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0051">In another example, the wireless node <b>120</b> transmits on the PUSCH <b>350</b> starting from the OFDM symbol of the nearest segment <b>318</b> after transmission of the reservation signal <b>340</b>. The reservation signal <b>340</b> may be transmitted after the backoff period <b>330</b> and occupy as many OFDM symbols as required until the start of the next segment <b>318</b>, when the transmission of the PUSCH <b>350</b> begins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0052">In a further example, the wireless node <b>120</b> may adjust its transport block size based on the time available for PUSCH transmission <b>350</b>. For instance, the wireless node <b>120</b> may choose its transport block size equaling Q(1/K×TBSSize) where TBSSize equals the transport block size corresponding to the MCS and #RBs as derived from TS36.213 and Q(x) returns the transport block size in TS36.213 that is closest to x for that MCS.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Channel Access Schemes</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0053">Two classes of channel access schemes are provided: contention-based channel access and scheduled channel access. In a contention-based scheme, the wireless nodes <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> access the shared channel after LBT, however, they do not require a scheduling grant from the eNB <b>110</b>. The resources on which the wireless node <b>120</b> or <b>122</b> transmits its data are semi-statically assigned from the eNB <b>110</b>. Additionally, a probabilistic channel access scheme may be provided wherein wireless nodes <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> probabilistically transmit after they detect that the medium is not busy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0054">In a scheduled channel access scheme, the wireless node <b>120</b> is scheduled to transmit data on the uplink channel <b>150</b> by the eNB <b>110</b> via an uplink scheduling grant. However, the latency between the grant reception and PUSCH transmissions is unpredictable due to LBT at wireless node <b>120</b>. Scheduled access is similar to LTE uplink access with some key differences. The PUSCH is transmitted only after LBT and (potential) reservation signal transmission. Uplink HARQ mechanism is asynchronous, and the PUSCH transmission does not have to be aligned with subframe boundary. The associated modifications required for scheduled channel access are presented in more detail hereinafter with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0055">Contention-based access involves autonomous UE uplink channel access. The eNB <b>110</b> may configure the wireless node <b>120</b> such that whenever the wireless node <b>120</b> accesses the medium it transmits only over the configured time/frequency resources. The access may be probabilistic, i.e., the wireless node <b>120</b> may transmit on the shared medium with probability p after an LBT procedure declares medium is idle. Probabilistic access statistically mitigates random access interference. The initial value of p may be set based on the node density (i.e., number of UEs served by eNB <b>110</b>). The parameter p may be updated in a decentralized manner at each UE based on measured parameters such as HARQ-ACK statistics or the number of UE with active UL traffic. The updates may be performed at regular intervals or on an as-needed basis. Examples of contention-based access schemes are presented in more detail hereinafter with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">Motivation of Contention-Based Access</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0056">With decentralized (non-scheduled) access, a UE with fewer neighbors to contend with is more likely to begin its PUSCH transmission. The PUSCH transmissions can cause a neighbor UE to back-off and prevent it from accessing the medium. It is therefore desirable to somehow ensure that a UE experiencing greater uplink congestion can obtain a fair share of the medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0057">One way to ensure fair sharing of medium access is to randomize the uplink channel access for a UE given that it has detected that the medium is not busy. Initial access probability can be configured (via Radio Resource Channel (RRC) signaling) at the UE. The eNB can set this value based on the number of UEs with active traffic. Setting the access probability p=1 will result in the UE transmitting immediately after LBT and post contention-backoff. In one example, the access probability p may be updated on a regular (semi-static) basis based on the HARQ-ACK statistics over a time-span of a few tens/hundreds of milliseconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the operations for contention-based uplink access. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a timing diagram for contention-based access. The eNB configures each UE (with active traffic) with an uplink modulation coding scheme (MCS), a set of frequency resources (units: RB) and time resources (subframe offset within each radio frame and periodicity). The uplink MCS, frequency-time resources are signaled via UE-dedicated (Radio Resource Control) RRC signaling. The frequency resources may be logical and not physical, i.e., the resources sent by the eNB can be mapped to the actual physical resources to get additional frequency diversity. The UE continuously monitors the medium via CCA procedure. Upon completion of LBT and if the UE can access the channel, the UE does so on its configured time and frequency resources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0059">Referring now specifically to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a flowchart diagram illustrates operations in a channel access process <b>400</b> performed by a UE (e.g., wireless node <b>120</b>) in a probabilistic contention-based uplink access scheme. The UE begins in an idle state <b>410</b> until it has data to send to its associated eNB, as determined in step <b>415</b>. Once the UE determines that it has data to send, it performs a LBT process at step <b>420</b>. The UE continues to perform the clear channel access of the LBT process until the time T<sub>idle </sub>for which the medium is determined to be idle exceeds a threshold time T<sub>threshold</sub>, as determined in step <b>425</b>. In one example, the idle time T<sub>idle </sub>is the time in which energy in the medium is below a first predetermined threshold E<sub>dThresh </sub>and in which no Wi-Fi preamble is decoded at an energy level above a second predetermined threshold P<sub>dThresh</sub>. The threshold time T<sub>threshold </sub>may be calculated as T<sub>threshold</sub>=T<sub>ICCA</sub>+T<sub>ECCA</sub>*N<sub>slots</sub>, where T<sub>ICCA </sub>is the initial defer time of the ICCA process (e.g., on the order of a Distributed Coordination Function Interframe Space (DIFS) time period), T<sub>ECCA </sub>is the extended clear channel assessment defer time that models contention backoff, and N<sub>slots </sub>is the number of ECCA time slots for performing contention backoff. The number of backoff slots N<sub>slots </sub>may be randomly generated (e.g., via a linear or truncated backoff) or a fixed value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0060">Once the UE has determined that the medium has been idle for the threshold time, it generates a binary random variable X as a function of the channel access probability p in step <b>430</b>. The binary random variable returns a value of X=1 with a probability of p, and returns a value of X=0 with a probability of 1−p. If X=1, as determined in step <b>435</b>, then the UE will assert control of the shared medium and begin transmitting in step <b>440</b>. In one example, the UE may transmit a reservation signal before transmitting PUSCH signals. The reservation signal alerts neighboring wireless devices of the impending PUSCH signals if the neighboring devices can decode the reservation signal above their energy detection threshold. The reservation signal may also include information for the eNB regarding the HARQ process ID and the redundancy version.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0061">If the binary random variable X=0, then the UE returns to performing the LBT process, and defers access to the shared medium. In step <b>450</b> the UE may update the channel access probability p based on, e.g., HARQ-ACK statistics and/or the number of UEs with active traffic to send.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0062">Referring now specifically to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a timing diagram illustrates transmissions from a UE (e.g., wireless node <b>120</b>) to gain uplink access in a contention-based scheme. The timing of an LTE frame <b>500</b> is divided into subframes <b>510</b>-<b>519</b>. In this example, subframes <b>510</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>515</b>, and <b>519</b> are downlink subframes dedicated to transmissions from the eNB to the UE. Subframes <b>512</b>, <b>513</b>, <b>517</b>, and <b>518</b> are uplink subframes dedicated to transmissions from the UE to the eNB. Subframes <b>511</b> and <b>516</b> are special subframes dedicated to maintaining the timing of the frame when switching from downlink to uplink transmissions. The special subframes are further divided into Downlink Pilot Time Slot (DwPTS) <b>520</b>, Guard Period (GP) <b>522</b>, and Uplink Pilot Time Slot (UpPTS) <b>524</b>. While the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows four uplink subframes, four downlink subframes, and two special subframes as an example of a frame, other configurations and numbers of uplink/downlink/special subframes may also use the techniques presented herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0063">The transmission sequence <b>530</b> from a UE with data to send includes a clear channel assessment period <b>532</b> during which the UE determines whether the medium is busy or idle. After the medium is determined to be idle, the UE waits for a contention backoff period <b>534</b> before transmitting a reservation signal <b>536</b>. The reservation signal <b>536</b> informs other wireless devices that the UE will be transmitting a PUSCH transmission <b>538</b> after the reservation signal <b>536</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0064">A second transmission sequence <b>540</b> from either the same or a different UE with data to send includes a clear channel assessment period <b>542</b> during which the UE determines whether the medium is busy or idle. The clear channel assessment period <b>542</b> begins after the guard period <b>522</b> in the special subframe <b>516</b> and includes the UpPTS <b>524</b>. After the medium is determined to be idle, the UE waits for a contention backoff period <b>544</b> before transmitting a reservation signal <b>546</b>. The reservation signal <b>546</b> informs other wireless devices that the UE will be transmitting a PUSCH transmission <b>548</b> after the reservation signal <b>546</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0065">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a timing diagram illustrates transmissions for scheduled access to the shared medium for an uplink channel with reference to the frame structure <b>500</b>. Initially, the eNB (e.g., eNB <b>110</b>) begins a transmission sequence <b>610</b> with a downlink LBT process. The downlink LBT process includes a clear channel assessment period <b>612</b>, a contention backoff period <b>614</b> and optionally a downlink reservation signal <b>616</b>. After the downlink LBT process is complete, the eNB transmits the uplink grant in the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) transmission <b>618</b> along with any Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) during the downlink subframe <b>514</b>. The uplink grant in the transmission <b>618</b> specifies that the UE is scheduled to transmit its data during uplink subframes <b>517</b> and <b>518</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0066">In response to the uplink grant received in transmission <b>618</b>, the UE begins the uplink transmission sequence <b>620</b> in the special subframe <b>516</b> preceding the scheduled uplink subframe. The uplink transmission sequence <b>620</b> begins with an uplink LBT process including a clear channel assessment period <b>622</b>, a contention backoff period <b>624</b>, and optionally a reservation signal <b>626</b>. After the LBT process the UE transmits its user data in PUSCH transmission <b>628</b> as scheduled by the eNB in the uplink grant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0067">A scheduled access scheme requires the UE to be assigned a dynamic grant prior to sending PUSCH transmissions. Sending the dynamic grant via an unlicensed cell requires LBT to be performed at the eNB. Dynamic grant is signaled via a Licensed Pcell for cross-carrier scheduling. The latency between the time of the grant reception to the time of sending the PUSCH transmission may be variable due to the LBT process performed at the UE. As part of the dynamic grant the eNB orders the UE as to which set of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs), the MCS, and HARQ process ID to employ for its transmission. Upon completion of the uplink LBT process and post contention backoff, the UE transmits reservation signal followed by PUSCH on its scheduled resources.</div>
<heading id="h-0013">Scheduled Access Scheme 1: Synchronous UL-HARQ Transmission</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0068">If due to the LBT procedure (consisting of initial CCA and subsequent defer time+ECCA), the UL subframe is unavailable, the UE skips transmitting PUSCH on the scheduled subframe. If PUSCH is not received correctly, the eNB infers from the absence of PUSCH on the scheduled transmission time interval (TTI) that either the PUSCH was not transmitted as a result of the uplink LBT process or the PUSCH was not received as a result of bad channel conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0069">In one example, the eNB schedules subsequent retransmissions either non-adaptively (via signaling Physical Hybrid-ARQ Indicator Channel (PHICH) or adaptively (via sending downlink control information (DCI) 0/3 with a new data indicator (NDI) not toggled and IMCS=29/30/31).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0070">The advantage to this scheme is that it retains UL transmission according to the existing LTE standard. The disadvantage is that it involves re-assembly at a higher layer and may incur greater delay since HARQ transmissions can be received out of order due to both contention related delays and poor channel conditions.</div>
<heading id="h-0014">Scheduled Access Scheme II: Asynchronous HARQ Transmission</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0071">The assumption of synchronous HARQ transmission may be dropped, allowing for the possibility that there is no implicit linkage between the subframe number of the scheduling DCI and the subframe number on which PUSCH is transmitted. In case the UE does not receive one or more scheduling Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), there may be a potential ambiguity regarding the HARQ process identifier (ID) and redundancy version (RV) for the PUSCH transmission. To resolve any such ambiguity, the UE may explicitly signal the HARQ process ID and the RV via the Reservation Signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0072">In one example, the scheduling UL-DCI contains new fields for communicating the HARQ process ID and RV number. This allows the HARQ process ID and RV information to be conveyed to the eNB when there is no Reservation Signal being used. In another example, the UE transmits the HARQ process ID and RV number via the Reservation Signal prior to the PUSCH transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0073">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a flowchart illustrates operations in a process <b>700</b> performed by a UE (e.g., wireless node <b>120</b>) in transmitting data on an uplink channel to its associated eNB. In step <b>710</b>, the UE obtains data to be transmitted over the shared spectrum/medium in an uplink channel. In one example, the uplink channel comprised a plurality of frames and subframes with a predetermined timing, e.g., according to an LTE-LAA format. The UE determines when the shared spectrum is free in step <b>720</b>. In one example, in order to determine when the shared spectrum is free, the UE performs a LBT process with a clear channel assessment and may include a contention backoff. After the UE determines that the shared spectrum is free, the UE selects a start time in step <b>730</b>. The selected start time mitigates interference from other wireless devices in proximity to the UE. In step <b>740</b>, the UE transmits data over the shared spectrum in the uplink channel to the eNB beginning at the selected start time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0074">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a flowchart illustrates operations in a process <b>800</b> performed by a UE (e.g., wireless node <b>120</b>) in contending for access to an uplink channel to its associated eNB on a shared channel. In step <b>810</b>, the UE obtains data to be transmitted over the shared spectrum/medium in an uplink channel. In one example, the uplink channel comprised a plurality of frames and subframes with a predetermined timing, e.g., according to an LTE-LAA format. The UE determines when the shared spectrum is free in step <b>820</b>. In one example, the UE performs a LBT process in order to determine when the shared spectrum is free. In step <b>830</b>, the UE contends with other UEs to gain access to the uplink channel. In one example, the UEs may contend for access to the uplink channel through a random backoff period, with the UE with the shortest, randomly determined, backoff period gaining access to the uplink channel. Once the UE gains access to the shared spectrum, as determined in step <b>840</b>, the UE transmits the data over the shared spectrum in the uplink channel to the eNB in step <b>850</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0075">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a flowchart illustrates operations in a process <b>900</b> performed by a UE (e.g., wireless node <b>120</b>) in accessing an uplink channel to its associated eNB on a shared channel according to a scheduled access scheme. In step <b>910</b>, the UE obtains data to be transmitted over the shared spectrum/medium in an uplink channel. In one example, the uplink channel comprised a plurality of frames and subframes with a predetermined timing, e.g., according to an LTE-LAA format. In step <b>920</b>, the UE receives an uplink grant specifying a time slot to transmit the data back to the eNB. In one example, control signals between the UE and the eNB may inform the eNB that the UE has data to transmit, which causes the eNB to transmit the uplink grant to the UE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0076">In step <b>930</b>, the UE determines if the shared spectrum is free during the time slot specified in the uplink grant. In one example, the UE performs a LBT process in order to determine when the shared spectrum is free. If the shared spectrum is free, then the UE selects a start time at the beginning of the time slot indicated in the uplink grant at step <b>940</b>. If the shared spectrum is not free, then the UE defers transmission of the data on the uplink channel at step <b>950</b>, and selects a start time after the time slot indicated in the uplink grant at step <b>955</b>. In one example, the UE will wait for a subsequent uplink grant from the eNB to select the start time. Alternatively, the UE may select the start time at a predetermined time interval after the time slot indicated in the original uplink grant. Once the UE has selected a start time, either in step <b>940</b> or step <b>955</b>, the UE transmits the data over the shared spectrum in the uplink channel to the eNB in step <b>960</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0077">In summary, schemes are presented herein for uplink channel access, medium reservation and uplink transmission for LTE operation in the unlicensed spectrum. Within a subframe, the UE monitors the channel and may send a reservation signal when the channel is free. The reservation signal should claim the usage of channel till the end of the subframe in its duration field. Each UE may start uplink transmission at different time instants within a subframe. Some explicit or implicit control information may be embedded in each UE's transmission to indicate the number of used symbols.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0078">Some of these schemes ensure that LTE-LAA UEs contend for medium access in a fair manner to other devices (e.g. Wi-Fi) in unlicensed frequencies. Unlike existing solutions that typically try to reuse the scheduled uplink access principles of LTE uplink (which can be sub-optimal when LBT is considered), these schemes may use randomized, contention-based uplink channel access. The techniques presented herein would be employed by LTE access points and LTE UEs that are operating over uplink in unlicensed frequency channels (e.g. in 5 GHz).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0079">Moreover, hidden nodes are removed since any Wi-Fi nodes that receive the reservation signal should stop a transmission. Exposed nodes are removed since any Wi-Fi node that does not receive CTS should be allowed to transmit. LTE-to-Wi-Fi interference is minimized when Wi-Fi nodes detect the channel is busy (i.e., used by LTE UEs).</div>

The mobile device obtains data to be wirelessly transmitted over a shared spectrum in an uplink channel to a base station. The uplink channel comprises a plurality of frames and subframes with a predetermined timing.

Responsive to a determination that the shared spectrum is free for transmission, the mobile device selects a start time in the uplink channel that mitigates interference from other mobile devices in proximity to the mobile device.
