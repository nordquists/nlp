<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The field of the present invention relates to the delivery of energy impulses (and/or fields) to bodily tissues for therapeutic purposes. It relates more specifically to the use of non-invasive devices, such as electrical nerve stimulation devices and magnetic stimulation devices, along with methods of treating medical disorders using energy that is delivered by such devices. The disorders comprise migraine and other primary headaches such as cluster headaches, including sinus symptoms that resemble an immune-mediated response (“sinus” headaches), irrespective of whether those symptoms arise from an allergy that is co-morbid with the headache. The methods may also be used to treat other disorders that may be co-morbid with migraine headaches, such as anxiety disorders in which the nervous system may also be hyper-reactive and in which attacks may be triggered by some of the same factors that trigger migraine and asthma attacks. In preferred embodiments of the disclosed methods, one or both of the patient's vagus nerves are stimulated non-invasively. In other embodiments, parts of the sympathetic nervous system and/or the adrenal glands are stimulated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Treatments for various infirmities sometime require the destruction of otherwise healthy tissue in order to produce a beneficial effect. Malfunctioning tissue is identified and then lesioned or otherwise compromised in order to produce a beneficial outcome, rather than attempting to repair the tissue to its normal functionality. A variety of techniques and mechanisms have been designed to produce focused lesions directly in target nerve tissue, but collateral damage is inevitable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Other treatments for malfunctioning tissue can be medicinal in nature, but in many cases the patients become dependent upon artificially synthesized chemicals. In many cases, these medicinal approaches have side effects that are either unknown or quite significant. Unfortunately, the beneficial outcomes of surgery and medicines are often realized at the cost of function of other tissues, or risks of side effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The use of electrical stimulation for treatment of medical conditions has been well known in the art for nearly two thousand years. It has been recognized that electrical stimulation of the brain and/or the peripheral nervous system and/or direct stimulation of the malfunctioning tissue holds significant promise for the treatment of many ailments, because such stimulation is generally a wholly reversible and non-destructive treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Nerve stimulation is thought to be accomplished directly or indirectly by depolarizing a nerve membrane, causing the discharge of an action potential; or by hyperpolarization of a nerve membrane, preventing the discharge of an action potential. Such stimulation may occur after electrical energy, or also other forms of energy, are transmitted to the vicinity of a nerve [F. RATTAY. The basic mechanism for the electrical stimulation of the nervous system. Neuroscience 89 (2, 1999):335-346; Thomas HEIMBURG and Andrew D. Jackson. On soliton propagation in biomembranes and nerves. PNAS 102 (28, 2005): 9790-9795]. Nerve stimulation may be measured directly as an increase, decrease, or modulation of the activity of nerve fibers, or it may be inferred from the physiological effects that follow the transmission of energy to the nerve fibers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">One of the most successful applications of modern understanding of the electrophysiological relationship between muscle and nerves is the cardiac pacemaker. Although origins of the cardiac pacemaker extend back into the 1800's, it was not until 1950 that the first practical, albeit external and bulky, pacemaker was developed. The first truly functional, wearable pacemaker appeared in 1957, and in 1960, the first fully implantable pacemaker was developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Around this time, it was also found that electrical leads could be connected to the heart through veins, which eliminated the need to open the chest cavity and attach the lead to the heart wall. In 1975 the introduction of the lithium-iodide battery prolonged the battery life of a pacemaker from a few months to more than a decade. The modern pacemaker can treat a variety of different signaling pathologies in the cardiac muscle, and can serve as a defibrillator as well (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,738,667 to DENO, et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Another application of electrical stimulation of nerves has been the treatment of radiating pain in the lower extremities by stimulating the sacral nerve roots at the bottom of the spinal cord (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,871,099 to WHITEHURST, et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Electrical stimulation of the brain with implanted electrodes has also been approved for use in the treatment of various conditions, including movement disorders such as essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. The principle underlying these approaches involves disruption and modulation of hyperactive neuronal circuit transmission at specific sites in the brain. Unlike potentially dangerous lesioning procedures in which aberrant portions of the brain are physically destroyed, electrical stimulation is achieved by implanting electrodes at these sites. The electrodes are used first to sense aberrant electrical signals and then to send electrical pulses to locally disrupt pathological neuronal transmission, driving it back into the normal range of activity. These electrical stimulation procedures, while invasive, are generally conducted with the patient conscious and a participant in the surgery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">However, brain stimulation, and deep brain stimulation in particular, is not without some drawbacks. The procedure requires penetrating the skull, and inserting an electrode into brain matter using a catheter-shaped lead, or the like. While monitoring the patient's condition (such as tremor activity, etc.), the position of the electrode is adjusted to achieve significant therapeutic potential. Next, adjustments are made to the electrical stimulus signals, such as frequency, periodicity, voltage, current, etc., again to achieve therapeutic results. The electrode is then permanently implanted, and wires are directed from the electrode to the site of a surgically implanted pacemaker. The pacemaker provides the electrical stimulus signals to the electrode to maintain the therapeutic effect. While the therapeutic results of deep brain stimulation are promising, significant complications may arise from the implantation procedure, including stroke induced by damage to surrounding tissues and the neuro-vasculature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Most of the above-mentioned applications of electrical stimulation involve the surgical implantation of electrodes within a patient. In contrast, for embodiments of the present invention, the disclosed devices and medical procedures stimulate nerves by transmitting energy to nerves and tissue non-invasively. They may offer the patient an alternative that does not involve surgery. A medical procedure is defined as being non-invasive when no break in the skin (or other surface of the body, such as a wound bed) is created through use of the method, and when there is no contact with an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice (e.g., beyond the mouth or beyond the external auditory meatus of the ear). Such non-invasive procedures are distinguished from invasive procedures (including minimally invasive procedures) in that invasive procedures do involve inserting a substance or device into or through the skin or into an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice. For example, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is non-invasive because it involves attaching electrodes to the surface of the skin (or using a form-fitting conductive garment) without breaking the skin. In contrast, percutaneous electrical stimulation of a nerve is minimally invasive because it involves the introduction of an electrode under the skin, via needle-puncture of the skin (see commonly assigned co-pending US Patent Application 2010/0241188, entitled Percutaneous Electrical Treatment of Tissue to ERRICO et al, which is hereby incorporated by reference).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Potential advantages of non-invasive medical methods and devices relative to comparable invasive procedures are as follows. The patient may be more psychologically prepared to experience a procedure that is non-invasive and may therefore be more cooperative, resulting in a better outcome. Non-invasive procedures may avoid damage of biological tissues, such as that due to bleeding, infection, skin or internal organ injury, blood vessel injury, and vein or lung blood clotting. Non-invasive procedures generally present fewer problems with biocompatibility. In cases involving the attachment of electrodes, non-invasive methods have less of a tendency for breakage of leads, and the electrodes can be easily repositioned if necessary. Non-invasive methods are sometimes painless or only minimally painful and may be performed without the need for even local anesthesia. Less training may be required for use of non-invasive procedures by medical professionals. In view of the reduced risk ordinarily associated with non-invasive procedures, some such procedures may be suitable for use by the patient or family members at home or by first-responders at home or at a workplace, and the cost of non-invasive procedures may be reduced relative to comparable invasive procedures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Electrodes that are applied non-invasively to the surface of the body have a long history, including electrodes that were used to stimulate underlying nerves [L. A. GEDDES. Historical Evolution of Circuit Models for the Electrode-Electrolyte Interface. Annals of Biomedical Engineering 25 (1997):1-14]. However, electrical stimulation of nerves in general fell into disfavor in middle of the twentieth century, until the “gate theory of pain” was introduced by Melzack and Wall in 1965. This theory, along with advances in electronics, reawakened interest in the use of implanted electrodes to stimulate nerves, initially to control pain. Screening procedures were then developed to determine suitable candidates for electrode implantation, which involved first determining whether the patient responded when stimulated with electrodes applied to the surface of the body in the vicinity of the possible implant. It was subsequently found that the surface stimulation often controlled pain so well that there was no need to implant a stimulating electrode [Charles Burton and Donald D. Maurer. Pain Suppression by Transcutaneous Electronic Stimulation. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering BME-21(2, 1974): 81-88]. Such non-invasive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was then developed for treating different types of pain, including pain in a joint or lower back, cancer pain, post-operative pain, post-traumatic pain, and pain associated with labor and delivery [Steven E. ABRAM. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation. pp 1-10 in: Joel B. Myklebust, ed. Neural stimulation (Volume 2). Boca Raton, Fla. CRC Press 1985; WALSH D M, Lowe A S, McCormack K. Willer J-C, Baxter G D, Allen J M. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation: effect on peripheral nerve conduction, mechanical pain threshold, and tactile threshold in humans. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 79(1998):1051-1058; J A CAMPBELL. A critical appraisal of the electrical output characteristics of ten transcutaneous nerve stimulators. Clin. phys. Physiol. Meas. 3(2, 1982): 141-150; U.S. Pat. No. 3,817,254, entitled Transcutaneous stimulator and stimulation method, to Maurer; U.S. Pat. No. 4,324,253, entitled Transcutaneous pain control and/or muscle stimulating apparatus, to Greene et al; U.S. Pat.

No. 6,351,674, entitled Method for inducing electroanesthesia using high frequency, high intensity transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, to Silverstone].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">As TENS was being developed to treat pain, non-invasive electrical stimulation using surface electrodes was simultaneously developed for additional therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, which are known collectively as electrotherapy. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) stimulates normally innervated muscle in an effort to augment strength and endurance of normal (e.g., athletic) or damaged (e.g., spastic) muscle. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is used to activate nerves innervating muscle affected by paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury, head injury, stroke and other neurological disorders, or muscle affected by foot drop and gait disorders. FES is also used to stimulate muscle as an orthotic substitute, e.g., replace a brace or support in scoliosis management. Another application of surface electrical stimulation is chest-to-back stimulation of tissue, such as emergency defibrillation and cardiac pacing. Surface electrical stimulation has also been used to repair tissue, by increasing circulation through vasodilation, by controlling edema, by healing wounds, and by inducing bone growth. Surface electrical stimulation is also used for iontophoresis, in which electrical currents drive electrically charged drugs or other ions into the skin, usually to treat inflammation and pain, arthritis, wounds or scars. Stimulation with surface electrodes is also used to evoke a response for diagnostic purposes, for example in peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) that evaluates the ability of motor and sensory nerves to conduct and produce reflexes. Surface electrical stimulation is also used in electroconvulsive therapy to treat psychiatric disorders; electroanesthesia, for example, to prevent pain from dental procedures; and electrotactile speech processing to convert sound into tactile sensation for the hearing impaired. All of the above-mentioned applications of surface electrode stimulation are intended not to damage the patient, but if higher currents are used with special electrodes, electrosurgery may be performed as a means to cut, coagulate, desiccate, or fulgurate tissue [Mark R. Prausnitz. The effects of electric current applied to skin: A review for transdermal drug delivery. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 18 (1996) 395-425].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Despite its attractiveness, non-invasive electrical stimulation of a nerve is not always possible or practical. This is primarily because the current state of the art may not be able to stimulate a deep nerve selectively or without producing excessive pain, since the stimulation may unintentionally stimulate nerves other than the nerve of interest, including nerves that cause pain. For this reason, forms of electrical stimulation other than TENS may be best suited for the treatment of particular types of pain [Paul F. WHITE, Shitong Li and Jen W. Chiu. Electroanalgesia: Its Role in Acute and Chronic Pain Management. Anesth Analg 92(2001):505-13].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">For some other electrotherapeutic applications, it has also been difficult to perform non-invasive stimulation of a nerve, in lieu of stimulating that nerve invasively. The therapies most relevant to the present invention involve electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck, which was developed initially for the treatment of epilepsy. The left vagus nerve is ordinarily stimulated at a location within the neck by first surgically implanting an electrode there, then connecting the electrode to an electrical stimulator [U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,254 entitled Neurocybernetic prosthesis, to ZABARA; U.S. Pat. No. 6,341,236 entitled Vagal nerve stimulation techniques for treatment of epileptic seizures, to OSORIO et al and U.S. Pat. No. 5,299,569 entitled Treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders by nerve stimulation, to WERNICKE et al; G. C. ALBERT, C. M. Cook, F. S. Prato, A. W. Thomas.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">When it is desired to avoid the surgical implantation of an electrode, vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) may be performed less invasively by positioning one or more electrodes in the esophagus, trachea, or jugular vein, but with one electrode positioned on the surface of the body [U.S. Pat. No. 7,340,299, entitled Methods of indirectly stimulating the vagus nerve to achieve controlled asystole, to PUSKAS; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,869,884, entitled Non-surgical device and methods for trans-esophageal vagus nerve stimulation, to SCOTT et al]. Despite their advantage as being non-surgical, such methods nevertheless exhibit other disadvantages associated with invasive procedures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In other patents, non-invasive VNS is disclosed, but at a location other than in the neck [e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,865,048, entitled Method and apparatus for drug free neurostimulation, to ECKERSON; U.S. Pat. No. 6,609,025 entitled Treatment of obesity by bilateral sub-diaphragmatic nerve stimulation to BARRETT et al; U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,625, entitled Transcutaneous nerve stimulation device and method for using same, to KENDALL; U.S. Pat. No. 7,386,347, entitled Electric stimulator for alpha-wave derivation, to Chung et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 7,797,042, entitled Device for applying a transcutaneous stimulus or for transcutaneous measuring of a parameter, to Dietrich et al.; patent application US2010/0057154, entitled Device and Method for the Transdermal Stimulation of a Nerve of the Human Body, to Dietrich et al; US2006/0122675, entitled Stimulator for auricular branch of vagus nerve, to Libbus et al; US2008/0288016, entitled Systems and Methods for Stimulating Neural Targets, to Amurthur et al]. However, because such non-invasive VNS occurs at a location other than the neck, it is not directly comparable to invasive VNS in the neck, for which therapeutic results are well documented. Among other patents and patent applications, non-invasive VNS is sometimes mentioned along with invasive VNS methods, but without addressing the problem of unintentional stimulation of nerves other than the vagus nerve, particularly nerves that cause pain [e.g., US20080208266, entitled System and Method for Treating Nausea and Vomiting by Vagus Nerve Stimulation, to LESSER et al]. Other patents are vague as to how non-invasive electrical stimulation in the vicinity of the vagus nerve in the neck is to be accomplished [e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,499,747, entitled External baroreflex activation, to KIEVAL et al].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention uses electrical nerve stimulation to treat headaches, particularly non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation in the neck. According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II), there are four types of primary headaches: migraine, tension-type, cluster headache plus other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, and other primary headaches (e.g., cough headache, exertional headache). Additional headache types are recognized, but they are attributable to some causative factor such as head and/or neck trauma, vascular disorder, other intracranial disorders such as hypertension, substance abuse, infection, homeostasis disorder, facial structural problems (e.g., tooth or ear), psychiatric problems, or cranial neuralgia [Jes OLESEN et al. The International Classification of Headache Disorders, Second Edition (ICHD-II). Cephalalgia 24 (Suppl. 1, 2004): 1-160]. An overview of the diagnosis and treatment of primary and some secondary headaches is found in a publication by the British Association for the Study of Headaches (BASH) [T J STEINER, E A MacGregor, P T G Davies. Guidelines for All Healthcare Professionals in the Diagnosis and Management of Migraine, Tension-Type, Cluster and Medication-Overuse Headache, 3rd Edition, 2007. BASH. Department of Neurology, Hull Royal Infirmary, Anlaby Road, Hull HU3 2JZ Great Britain].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention is particularly suitable for the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches, as well as disorders with which those headaches are co-morbid. According to the ICHD-II, migraine is not a homogenous entity, but is instead a group of syndromes, some categories of which are distinguished by the presence of an aura that usually occurs shortly before pain of the headache. The aura typically lasts for 5 minutes to an hour, during which time the patient experiences sensations such as moving zig-zag flashes of light, blind spots or tingling in the hand or face. The features most predictive of the diagnosis of migraine, rather than tension-type headaches, are nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, exacerbation by physical activity and aura. The duration of pain is of little differential diagnostic value for discriminating migraine from tension and other types of headache.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Migraine is highly disabling and costly to society, with an annual prevalence of 6-9% among men and 15-17% among women. It occurs in all age groups but reaches a peak in middle age. Migraine headaches often occur on both sides of the head in children, but an adult pattern of unilateral pain often emerges in adolescence. The pain is often reported as starting in the occipital/neck regions, later becoming frontotemporal. It is throbbing and aggravated by physical effort. Approximately 20-30% of migraine sufferers (migraineurs) experience an aura, ordinarily a visual aura. [Bert B. VARGAS, David W. Dodick. The Face of Chronic Migraine: Epidemiology, Demographics, and Treatment Strategies. Neurol Clin 27 (2009) 467-479; Peter J. GOADSBY, Richard B. Lipton, Michel D. Ferrari. Migraine—Current understanding and treatment. N Engl J Med 346 (4, 2002): 257-270; Stephen D SILBERSTEIN. Migraine. LANCET 363 (2004):381-391].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Pharmacological administration of triptans is currently the most effective treatment for acute migraine headaches (Sumatriptan, Zolmitriptan, Naratriptan, Rizatriptan, Eletriptan, Almotriptan, and Frovatriptan). However, only 30-40% of migraineurs are pain-free two hours after the administration of triptans. Of those who do respond, one in three will experience a migraine recurrence within 24 hours. Furthermore, because triptans constrict cranial blood vessels through activation of serotonin 5-HT1B receptors, as a side effect they may also cause vasoconstriction of coronary vessels. Switching to a different triptan might benefit some non-responders, but for many such migraineurs, non-migraine-specific rescue drugs that have significant side effects may be the last and potentially ineffective option (opioids, neuroleptics, and/or corticosteroids). Accordingly, migraine treatment methods are needed that are more effective than triptan pharmaceuticals but that do not exhibit significant side effects [Stephen D Silberstein. Migraine. Lancet 363 (2004):381-391; Peter J GOADSBY, Till Sprenger. Current practice and future directions in the prevention and acute management of migraine. Lancet Neurol 9(2010): 285-98; Joel R.

Headache 50(2010): 1175-1193].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The diagnosis and treatment of migraine is complicated by the potential co-morbidity of migraine with other disorders. Those disorders include ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA), sub-clinical cerebral lesions, coronary heart disease, patent foramen ovale, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, bipolar disorders, restless leg syndrome, obesity, epilepsy (co-morbid with aura), fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and celiac disease [H.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Additional disorders that may be co-morbid with migraine comprise allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and asthma, the co-morbidity of which is largely responsible for the considerable underreporting and misdiagnosis of migraine. According to the American Migraine Study II, half of the individuals diagnosed with migraine did not know they were migraine sufferers before diagnosis, and a misdiagnosis of “sinus headache” (rhinosinusitis), rather than migraine, was made in almost ninety percent of individuals who also had symptoms of facial pain and pressure and/or nasal and sinus congestion. It is estimated that 45% of individuals experiencing a migraine headache have a symptom of either nasal congestion or watery eyes, and this leads to the patient not obtaining treatment for migraine, or to self-treatment with inappropriate, ineffective, or even migraine-enhancing over-the-counter sinus medications [LIPTON RB, Diamond S, Reed M, Diamond M L, Stewart W F.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In the American Migraine Study II, 40%-70% of respondents with migraine had co-morbid allergies. Other studies have reported that people with migraine are 2 to 3.5 times more likely to have co-morbid asthma, particularly if they have a parent with migraine and asthma. Allergic rhinitis (hay fever or nasal allergy) is a histamine-driven response to an allergen, such that when exposed to the allergen, the nasal passage becomes inflamed and irritated, resulting in a nasal drip. That histamine release might be involved in triggering migraine headaches, but stress or environmental insults might also independently trigger simultaneous allergic rhinitis and migraine [Min K U, Bernard Silverman, Nausika Prifti, Wei Ying, Yudy Persaud, and Arlene Schneider.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, a migraineur may exhibit pain that is refractory to treatment using currently available conventional methods. A significant number of migraineurs also exhibit facial pain and pressure, nasal and sinus congestion and/or some other symptom that resembles an immune-mediated response. Although those symptoms may be attributable to migraine co-morbid with allergic rhinitis or some other immune-related disorder, the symptoms may in fact arise from the migraine itself.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention provides novel methods and devices for treating migraine and other primary headaches (particularly cluster headaches), including sinus symptoms that resemble an immune-mediated response, irrespective of whether those symptoms arise from an allergy that is co-morbid with the headache. The disclosed methods may also be used to treat other disorders that may be co-morbid with migraine, such as anxiety disorders, in which the nervous system may also be hyper-reactive and in which attacks may be triggered by some of the same factors that trigger migraine and asthma attacks.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In one aspect of the invention, devices and methods are described to produce therapeutic effects in a patient by utilizing an energy source that transmits energy non-invasively to nervous tissue. In particular, the disclosed devices can transmit energy to, or in close proximity to, a vagus nerve in the neck of the patient, in order to stimulate, block and/or modulate electrophysiological signals in that nerve. The methods that are disclosed herein comprise stimulating the vagus nerve with particular stimulation waveform parameters, preferably using the nerve stimulator devices that are also described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">A novel stimulator device is used to modulate electrical activity of a vagus nerve or other nerves or tissue. The stimulator comprises a source of electrical power and two or more remote electrodes that are configured to stimulate a deep nerve relative to the nerve axis. The device also comprises continuous electrically conducting media within which the electrodes are in contact, wherein a conducting medium has a shape that conforms to the contour of a target body surface of a patient when the medium is applied to the target body surface. In another aspect of the invention, a non-invasive magnetic stimulator device is used to modulate electrical activity of the vagus nerve or other nerves or tissue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">For the present medical applications, a device is ordinarily applied to the patient's neck. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the stimulator comprises two electrodes that lie side-by-side within separate stimulator heads, wherein the electrodes are separated by electrically insulating material. Each electrode and the patient's skin are in continuous contact with an electrically conducting medium that extends from the skin to the electrode. The conducting media for different electrodes are also separated by electrically insulating material. In another embodiment of the invention, a non-invasive magnetic stimulator device is ordinarily applied to the patient's neck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">A source of power supplies a pulse of electric charge to the electrodes or magnetic stimulator, such that the electrodes or magnetic stimulator produce an electric current and/or an electric field within the patient. The electrical or magnetic stimulator is configured to induce a peak pulse voltage sufficient to produce an electric field in the vicinity of a nerve such as a vagus nerve, to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation. By way of example, the threshold electric field for stimulation of the nerve may be about 8 V/m at 1000 Hz. For example, the device may produce an electric field within the patient of about 10 to 600 V/m and an electrical field gradient of greater than 2 V/m/mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Current passing through an electrode may be about 0 to 40 mA, with voltage across the electrodes of 0 to 30 volts. The current is passed through the electrodes in bursts of pulses. There may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst, preferably five pulses. Each pulse within a burst has a duration of 20 to 1000 microseconds, preferably 200 microseconds. A burst followed by a silent inter-burst interval repeats at 1 to 5000 bursts per second (bps), preferably at 15-50 bps. The preferred shape of each pulse is a full sinusoidal wave. The preferred stimulator shapes an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to a long nerve, such as a vagus nerve in the patient's neck. By selecting a suitable waveform to stimulate the nerve, along with suitable parameters such as current, voltage, pulse width, pulses per burst, inter-burst interval, etc., the stimulator produces a correspondingly selective physiological response in an individual patient. Such a suitable waveform and parameters are simultaneously selected to avoid substantially stimulating nerves and tissue other than the target nerve, particularly avoiding the stimulation of nerves that produce pain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The currents passing through the coils of the magnetic stimulator will saturate its core (e.g., 0.1 to 2 Tesla magnetic field strength for Supermendur core material). This will require approximately 0.5 to 20 amperes of current being passed through each coil, typically 2 amperes, with voltages across each coil of 10 to 100 volts. The current is passed through the coils in bursts of pulses, shaping an elongated electrical field of effect as with the electrode-based stimulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Teachings of the present invention demonstrate how the disclosed non-invasive stimulators may be positioned and used against body surfaces, particularly at a location on the patient's neck under which a vagus nerve is situated. Those teachings also describe the production of certain beneficial, therapeutic effects in a patient. An exemplary teaching is the treatment of migraine and other primary headaches such as cluster headaches, including sinus symptoms that resemble an immune-mediated response (“sinus” headaches), irrespective of whether those symptoms arise from an allergy that is co-morbid with the headache. The treatment causes patients to experience a very rapid relief from headache pain, as well as a rapid opening of the nasal passages within approximately 20 minutes. Effects of the disclosed treatment method last for 4 to 5 hours or longer, and the method has none of the side effects typically associated with pseudoephedrine products or other allergy medications. The disclosure also describes treatment of other disorders that may be co-morbid with migraine headaches, such as anxiety disorders, in which attacks may be triggered by some of the same factors that trigger migraine and asthma attacks. In preferred embodiments of the disclosed methods, a vagus nerve is stimulated non-invasively, but in other embodiments, parts of the sympathetic nervous system and/or the adrenal glands are stimulated. However, it should be understood that application of the methods and devices is not limited to the examples that are given.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The novel systems, devices and methods for treating conditions using the disclosed stimulator or other non-invasive stimulation devices are more completely described in the following detailed description of the invention, with reference to the drawings provided herewith, and in claims appended hereto.

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">In the present invention, energy is transmitted non-invasively to a patient. The invention is particularly useful for producing applied electrical impulses that interact with the signals of one or more nerves to achieve a therapeutic result. In particular, the present disclosure describes devices and methods to stimulate a vagus nerve non-invasively at a location on the patient's neck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">There is a long-felt but unsolved need to stimulate the vagus nerve electrically in the neck, totally non-invasively, selectively, and essentially without producing pain. As described below, this is evidenced by the failure of others to solve the problem that is solved by the present invention, such that investigators abandoned the attempt to non-invasively stimulate electrically in the neck, in favor of stimulating the vagus nerve at other anatomical locations, or in favor of stimulating the vagus nerve non-electrically. Japanese patent application JP2009233024A with a filing date of Mar. 26, 2008, entitled Vagus Nerve Stimulation System, to Fukui YOSHIHITO, is concerned with stimulation of the vagus nerve on the surface of the neck to control heart rate, rather than epilepsy, depression, or other infirmities that vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is ordinarily intended to treat. Nevertheless, the approach that is taken by Yoshihito illustrates the difficulties encountered with non-invasive electrical stimulation the vagus nerve. Yoshihito notes that because electrical stimulation on the surface of the neck may co-stimulate the phrenic nerve that is involved with the control of respiration, the patient hiccups and does not breathe normally, resulting in “a patient sense of incongruity and displeasure.” Yoshihito's proposed solution to the problem is to modulate the timing and intensity of the electrical stimulation at the neck as a function of the respiratory phase, in such a way that the undesirable respiratory effects are minimized. Thus, Yoshihito's approach is to compensate for non-selective nerve stimulation, rather than find a way to stimulate the vagus nerve selectively. However, such compensatory modulation might also prevent the stimulation from achieving a beneficial effect in treating epilepsy, depression, and other infirmities that are treated with VNS. Furthermore, Yoshihito does not address the problem of pain in the vicinity of the stimulation electrodes. Similar issues could conceivably arise in connection with possible co-stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve [Ingrid J. M. Scheffers, Abraham A. Kroon, Peter W. de Leeuw. Carotid Baroreflex Activation: Past, Present, and Future. Curr Hypertens Rep 12(2010):61-66]. Side effects due to co-activation of muscle that is controlled by the vagus nerve itself may also occur, which exemplify another type of non-selective stimulation [M Tosato, K Yoshida, E Toft and J J Struijk. Quasi-trapezoidal pulses to selectively block the activation of intrinsic laryngeal muscles during vagal nerve stimulation. J. Neural Eng. 4 (2007): 205-212].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">One circumvention of the problem that the present invention solves is to non-invasively stimulate the vagus nerve at an anatomical location other than the neck, where the nerve lies closer to the skin. A preferred alternate location is in or around the ear (tragus, meatus and/or concha) although other locations have been proposed [Manuel L. KARELL. TENS in the Treatment of Heroin Dependency.

No. 12/859,568 entitled Non-invasive Treatment of Bronchial Constriction, to SIMON]. However, it is not certain that stimulation in this minor branch of the vagus nerve will have the same effect as stimulation of a main vagus nerve in the neck, where VNS electrodes are ordinarily implanted, and for which VNS therapeutic procedures produce well-documented results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Another circumvention of the problem is to substitute electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck with some other form of stimulation. For example, mechanical stimulation of the vagus nerve on the neck has been proposed as an alternative to electrical stimulation [Jared M. HUSTON, Margot Gallowitsch-Puerta, Mahendar Ochani, Kanta Ochani, Renqi Yuan, Mauricio Rosas-Ballina, Mala Ashok, Richard S. Goldstein, Sangeeta Chavan, Valentin A. Pavlov, Christine N. Metz, Huan Yang, Christopher J. Czura, Haichao Wang, Kevin J. Tracey.

No. 12/859,568 entitled Non-invasive Treatment of Bronchial Constriction, to SIMON]. However, such mechanical VNS has only been performed in animal models, and there is no evidence that such mechanical VNS would be functionally equivalent to electrical VNS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Another circumvention of the problem is to use magnetic rather than purely electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck [Q. AZIZ et al. Magnetic Stimulation of Efferent Neural Pathways to the Human Oesophagus. Gut 33: S53-S70 (Poster Session F218) (1992); AZIZ, Q., J. C. Rothwell, J. Barlow, A. Hobson, S. Alani, J. Bancewicz, and D. G. Thompson. Esophageal myoelectric responses to magnetic stimulation of the human cortex and the extracranial vagus nerve. Am. J. Physiol. 267 (Gastrointest.

Cranial nerve modulation of human cortical swallowing motor pathways. Am. J. Physiol. 272 (Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 35): G802-G808, 1997; Shaheen HAMDY, John C. Rothwell, Qasim Aziz, Krishna D. Singh, and David G. Thompson. Long-term reorganization of human motor cortex driven by short-term sensory stimulation. Nature Neuroscience 1 (issue 1, May 1998):64-68; A. SHAFIK. Functional magnetic stimulation of the vagus nerve enhances colonic transit time in healthy volunteers. Tech Coloproctol (1999) 3:123-12; see also the non-invasive methods and devices that Applicant disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/859,568 entitled Non-invasive Treatment of Bronchial Constriction, to SIMON, as well as co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/964,050 entitled Magnetic Stimulation Devices and Methods of Therapy, to SIMON et al]. Magnetic stimulation might functionally approximate electrical stimulation. However, magnetic stimulation has the disadvantage that it ordinarily requires complex and expensive equipment, and the duration of stimulation may be limited by overheating of the magnetic stimulator. Furthermore, in some cases, magnetic stimulation in the neck might also inadvertently stimulate nerves other than the vagus nerve, such as the phrenic nerve [SIMILOWSKI, T., B. Fleury, S. Launois, H. P. Cathala, P. Bouche, and J. P. Derenne. Cervical magnetic stimulation: a new painless method for bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation in conscious humans. J. Appl. Physiol. 67(4): 1311-1318, 1989; Gerrard F. RAFFERTY, Anne Greenough, Terezia Manczur, Michael I. Polkey, M. Lou Harris, Nigel D. Heaton, Mohamed Rela, and John Moxham. Magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation to assess diaphragm function in children following liver transplantation. Pediatr Crit Care Med 2001, 2:122-126; W. D-C. MAN, J. Moxham, and M. I. Polkey. Magnetic stimulation for the measurement of respiratory and skeletal muscle function. Eur Respir J 2004; 24: 846-860]. Furthermore, magnetic stimulation may also stimulate nerves that cause pain. Other stimulators that make use of magnetic fields might also be used, but they too are complex and expensive and may share other disadvantages with more conventional magnetic stimulators [U.S. Pat. No. 7,699,768, entitled Device and method for non-invasive, localized neural stimulation utilizing hall effect phenomenon, to Kishawi et al].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (as well as magnetic stimulation) can be unpleasant or painful, in the experience of patients that undergo such procedures. The quality of sensation caused by stimulation depends strongly on current and frequency, such that currents barely greater than the perception threshold generally cause painless sensations described as tingle, itch, vibration, buzz, touch, pressure, or pinch, but higher currents can cause sharp or burning pain. As the depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin is increased (e.g., to deeper nerves such as the vagus nerve), any pain will generally begin or increase. Strategies to reduce the pain include: use of anesthetics placed on or injected into the skin near the stimulation and placement of foam pads on the skin at the site of stimulation [Jeffrey J. BORCKARDT, Arthur R. Smith, Kelby Hutcheson, Kevin Johnson, Ziad Nahas, Berry Anderson, M. Bret Schneider, Scott T. Reeves, and Mark S. George. Reducing Pain and Unpleasantness During Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Journal of ECT 2006; 22:259-264], use of nerve blockades [V. HAKKINEN, H. Eskola, A. Yli-Hankala, T. Nurmikko and S. Kolehmainen. Which structures are sensitive to painful transcranial stimulation? Electromyogr. clin. Neurophysiol. 1995, 35:377-383], the use of very short stimulation pulses [V. SUIHKO. Modelling the response of scalp sensory receptors to transcranial electrical stimulation. Med. Biol. Eng. Comput., 2002, 40, 395-401], decreasing current density by increasing electrode size [Kristof VERHOEVEN and J. Gert van Dijk. Decreasing pain in electrical nerve stimulation. Clinical Neurophysiology 117 (2006) 972-978], using a high impedance electrode [N. SHA, L. P. J. Kenney, B. W. Heller, A. T. Barker, D. Howard and W. Wang. The effect of the impedance of a thin hydrogel electrode on sensation during functional electrical stimulation. Medical Engineering &amp; Physics 30 (2008): 739-746] and providing patients with the amount of information that suits their personalities [Anthony DELITTO, Michael J Strube, Arthur D Shulman, Scott D Minor. A Study of Discomfort with Electrical Stimulation. Phys. Ther. 1992; 72:410-424]. U.S. Pat. No. 7,614,996, entitled Reducing discomfort caused by electrical stimulation, to RIEHL discloses the application of a secondary stimulus to counteract what would otherwise be an uncomfortable primary stimulus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Additional considerations related to pain resulting from the stimulation are as follows. When stimulation is repeated over the course of multiple sessions, patients may adapt to the pain and exhibit progressively less discomfort. Patients may be heterogeneous with respect to their threshold for pain caused by stimulation, including heterogeneity related to gender and age. Electrical properties of an individual's skin vary from day to day and may be affected by cleaning, abrasion, and the application of various electrode gels and pastes. Skin properties may also be affected by the stimulation itself, as a function of the duration of stimulation, the recovery time between stimulation sessions, the transdermal voltage, the current density, and the power density. The application of multiple electrical pulses can result in different perception or pain thresholds and levels of sensation, depending on the spacing and rate at which pulses are applied. The separation distance between two electrodes determines whether sensations from the electrodes are separate, overlap, or merge. The limit for tolerable sensation is sometimes said to correspond to a current density of 0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, but in reality the functional relationship between pain and current density is very complicated. Maximum local current density may be more important in producing pain than average current density, and local current density generally varies under an electrode, e.g., with greater current densities along edges of the electrode or at “hot spots.” Furthermore, pain thresholds can have a thermal and/or electrochemical component, as well as a current density component. Pulse frequency plays a significant role in the perception of pain, with muscle contraction being involved at some frequencies and not others, and with the spatial extent of the pain sensation also being a function of frequency. The sensation is also a function of the waveform (square-wave, sinusoidal, trapezoidal, etc.), especially if pulses are less than a millisecond in duration [Mark R. PRAUSNITZ. The effects of electric current applied to skin: A review for transdermal drug delivery. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 18 (1996): 395-425].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Considering that there are so many variables that may influence the likelihood of pain during non-invasive electrical stimulation (detailed stimulus waveform, frequency, current density, electrode type and geometry, skin preparation, etc.), considering that these same variables must be simultaneously selected in order to independently produce a desired therapeutic outcome by vagal nerve stimulation, and considering that one also wishes to selectively stimulate the vagus nerve (e.g., avoid stimulating the phrenic nerve), it is understandable that prior to the present disclosure, no one has described devices and methods for stimulating the vagus nerve electrically in the neck, totally non-invasively, selectively, and without causing substantial pain.</div>

Thus, combined elements in the invention do not merely perform the function that the elements perform separately (viz., perform therapeutic VNS, minimize stimulation pain, or stimulate the vagus nerve selectively), and one of ordinary skill in the art would not have combined the claimed elements by known methods because the archetypal magnetic stimulator was known only to Applicant. That stimulator used a magnetic coil, embedded in a safe and practical conducting medium that was in direct contact with arbitrarily-oriented patient's skin, which had not been described in its closest art [Rafael CARBUNARU and Dominique M.

The stimulator coil <b>341</b> is toroidal in shape, due to its winding around a toroid of core material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Although the magnetic stimulator coil <b>341</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to be a single coil, in practice the coil may also comprise two or more distinct coils, each of which is connected in series or in parallel to the impulse generator <b>310</b>.

Thus, the sinuousness or curvature shown at the outer surface of the electrically conducting medium <b>351</b> corresponds also to sinuousness or curvature on the surface of the body, against which the conducting medium <b>351</b> is applied, so as to make the medium and body surface contiguous. As time-varying electrical current is passed through the coil <b>341</b>, a magnetic field is produced, but because the coil winding is toroidal, the magnetic field is spatially restricted to the interior of the toroid. An electric field and eddy currents are also produced. The electric field extends beyond the toroidal space and into the patient's body, causing electrical currents and stimulation within the patient. The volume <b>351</b> is electrically connected to the patient at a target skin surface in order to significantly reduce the current passed through the coil <b>341</b> that is needed to accomplish stimulation of the patient's nerve or tissue.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The design of the magnetic stimulator <b>301</b>, which is adapted herein for use with surface electrodes, makes it possible to shape the electric field that is used to selectively stimulate a deep nerve such as a vagus nerve in the neck of a patient. Furthermore, the design produces significantly less pain or discomfort (if any) to a patient than stimulator devices that are currently known in the art. Conversely, for a given amount of pain or discomfort on the part of the patient (e.g., the threshold at which such discomfort or pain begins), the design achieves a greater depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The control unit <b>330</b> controls the impulse generator <b>310</b> to generate a signal for each of the device's coils or electrodes. The signals are selected to be suitable for amelioration of a particular medical condition, when the signals are applied non-invasively to a target nerve or tissue via the coil <b>341</b> or electrodes <b>342</b>. It is noted that nerve stimulating/modulating device <b>301</b> or <b>302</b> may be referred to by its function as a pulse generator. Patent application publications US2005/0075701 and US2005/0075702, both to SHAFER, both of which are incorporated herein by reference, relating to stimulation of neurons of the sympathetic nervous system to attenuate an immune response, contain descriptions of pulse generators that may be applicable to the present invention. By way of example, a pulse generator is also commercially available, such as Agilent 33522A Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator, Agilent Technologies, Inc., 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd Santa Clara Calif. 95051.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The control unit <b>330</b> may also comprise a general purpose computer, comprising one or more CPU, computer memories for the storage of executable computer programs (including the system's operating system) and the storage and retrieval of data, disk storage devices, communication devices (such as serial and USB ports) for accepting external signals from the system's keyboard and computer mouse as well as any externally supplied physiological signals, analog-to-digital converters for digitizing externally supplied analog signals, communication devices for the transmission and receipt of data to and from external devices such as printers and modems that comprise part of the system, hardware for generating the display of information on monitors that comprise part of the system, and busses to interconnect the above-mentioned components.

Alternatively, the control unit <b>330</b> may have a compact and simple structure, for example, wherein the user may operate the system using only an on/off switch and power control wheel or knob.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Parameters for the nerve or tissue stimulation include power level, frequency and train duration (or pulse number). The stimulation characteristics of each pulse, such as depth of penetration, strength and selectivity, depend on the rise time and peak electrical energy transferred to the electrodes, as well as the spatial distribution of the electric field that is produced by the electrodes. The rise time and peak energy are governed by the electrical characteristics of the stimulator and electrodes, as well as by the anatomy of the region of current flow within the patient. In one embodiment of the invention, pulse parameters are set in such as way as to account for the detailed anatomy surrounding the nerve that is being stimulated [Bartosz SAWICKI, Robert Szmurło, Przemysław Płonecki, Jacek Starzyński, Stanisław Wincenciak, Andrzej Rysz. Mathematical Modelling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92-97 in: Krawczyk, A. Electromagnetic Field, Health and Environment: Proceedings of EHE'07. Amsterdam, IOS Press, 2008]. Pulses may be monophasic, biphasic or polyphasic. Embodiments of the invention include those that are fixed frequency, where each pulse in a train has the same inter-stimulus interval, and those that have modulated frequency, where the intervals between each pulse in a train can be varied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates an exemplary electrical voltage/current profile for a stimulating, blocking and/or modulating impulse applied to a portion or portions of selected nerves in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For the preferred embodiment, the voltage and current refer to those that are produced non-invasively within the patient by the magnetic stimulator or electrodes. As shown, a suitable electrical voltage/current profile <b>400</b> for the blocking and/or modulating impulse <b>410</b> to the portion or portions of a nerve may be achieved using pulse generator <b>310</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the pulse generator <b>310</b> may be implemented using a power source <b>320</b> and a control unit <b>330</b> having, for instance, a processor, a clock, a memory, etc., to produce a pulse train <b>420</b> to the coil <b>341</b> or electrodes <b>342</b> that deliver the stimulating, blocking and/or modulating impulse <b>410</b> to the nerve. Nerve stimulating/modulating device <b>301</b> or <b>302</b> may be externally powered and/or recharged may have its own power source <b>320</b>. The parameters of the modulation signal <b>400</b>, such as the frequency, amplitude, duty cycle, pulse width, pulse shape, etc., are preferably programmable. An external communication device may modify the pulse generator programming to improve treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, or as an alternative to the devices to implement the modulation unit for producing the electrical voltage/current profile of the stimulating, blocking and/or modulating impulse to the electrodes, the device disclosed in patent publication No. US2005/0216062 (the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) may be employed. That patent publication discloses a multifunctional electrical stimulation (ES) system adapted to yield output signals for effecting electromagnetic or other forms of electrical stimulation for a broad spectrum of different biological and biomedical applications, which produce an electric field pulse in order to non-invasively stimulate nerves. The system includes an ES signal stage having a selector coupled to a plurality of different signal generators, each producing a signal having a distinct shape, such as a sine wave, a square or a saw-tooth wave, or simple or complex pulse, the parameters of which are adjustable in regard to amplitude, duration, repetition rate and other variables. Examples of the signals that may be generated by such a system are described in a publication by LIBOFF [A. R. LIBOFF. Signal shapes in electromagnetic therapies: a primer. pp. 17-37 in: Bioelectromagnetic Medicine (Paul J. Rosch and Marko S. Markov, eds.). New York: Marcel Dekker (2004)]. The signal from the selected generator in the ES stage is fed to at least one output stage where it is processed to produce a high or low voltage or current output of a desired polarity whereby the output stage is capable of yielding an electrical stimulation signal appropriate for its intended application. Also included in the system is a measuring stage which measures and displays the electrical stimulation signal operating on the substance being treated as well as the outputs of various sensors which sense conditions prevailing in this substance whereby the user of the system can manually adjust it or have it automatically adjusted by feedback to provide an electrical stimulation signal of whatever type the user wishes, who can then observe the effect of this signal on a substance being treated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The stimulating, blocking and/or modulating impulse signal <b>410</b> preferably has a frequency, an amplitude, a duty cycle, a pulse width, a pulse shape, etc. selected to influence the therapeutic result, namely, stimulating, blocking and/or modulating some or all of the transmission of the selected nerve. For example, the frequency may be about 1 Hz or greater, such as between about 15 Hz to 50 Hz, more preferably around 25 Hz. The modulation signal may have a pulse width selected to influence the therapeutic result, such as about 20 microseconds or greater, such as about 20 microseconds to about 1000 microseconds. For example, the electric field induced by the device within tissue in the vicinity of a nerve is 10 to 600 V/m, preferably around 300 V/m. The gradient of the electric field may be greater than 2 V/m/mm. More generally, the stimulation device produces an electric field in the vicinity of the nerve that is sufficient to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation, which is approximately 8 V/m at 1000 Hz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">An objective of the stimulators disclosed herein is to provide both nerve fiber selectivity and spatial selectivity. Spatial selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the electrode or coil configuration, and nerve fiber selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the stimulus waveform, but designs for the two types of selectivity are intertwined. This is because, for example, a waveform may selectively stimulate only one of two nerves whether they lie close to one another or not, obviating the need to focus the stimulating signal onto only one of the nerves [GRILL W and Mortimer J T. Stimulus waveforms for selective neural stimulation. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. 14 (1995): 375-385].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">To date, the selection of stimulation waveform parameters for vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has been highly empirical, in which the parameters are varied about some initially successful set of parameters, in an effort to find an improved set of parameters for each patient. A more efficient approach to selecting stimulation parameters might be to select a stimulation waveform that mimics electrical activity in the regions of the brain that one is attempting stimulate indirectly, in an effort to entrain the naturally occurring electrical waveform, as suggested in patent number U.S. Pat. No. 6,234,953, entitled Electrotherapy device using low frequency magnetic pulses, to THOMAS et al. and application number US20090299435, entitled Systems and methods for enhancing or affecting neural stimulation efficiency and/or efficacy, to GLINER et al. One may also vary stimulation parameters iteratively, in search of an optimal setting [U.S. Pat. No. 7,869,885, entitled Threshold optimization for tissue stimulation therapy, to Begnaud, et al]. However, some VNS stimulation waveforms, such as those described herein, are discovered by trial and error, and then deliberately improved upon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Invasive vagal nerve stimulation typically uses square wave pulse signals. The typical waveform parameter values for VNS therapy for epilepsy and depression are: a current between 1 and 2 mA, a frequency of between 20 and 30 Hz, a pulse width of 250-500 microseconds, and a duty cycle of 10% (signal ON time of 30 s, and a signal OFF time to 5 min). Output current is gradually increased from 0.25 mA to the maximum tolerable level (maximum, 3.5 mA), with typical therapeutic settings ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 mA. Greater output current is associated with increased side effects, including voice alteration, cough, a feeling of throat tightening, and dyspnea. Frequency is typically 20 Hz in depression and 30 Hz in epilepsy. The therapy is adjusted in a gradual, systematic fashion to individualize therapy for each patient. To treat migraine headaches, typical VNS parameters are a current of 0.25 to 1 mA, a frequency of 30 Hz, a pulse width of 500 microseconds, and an ‘ON’ time of 30 s every 5 min. To treat migraine plus epilepsy, typical parameters are 1.75 mA, a frequency of 20 Hz, a pulse width of 250 microseconds, and ‘ON’ time of 7 s followed by an ‘OFF’ time of 12 s. To treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, typical VNS waveform parameters are: a current of 0.25 to 0.5 mA, a frequency of 20 Hz, a pulse width of 500 microseconds, and an ‘ON’ time of 30 s every 5 min.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Prepulses and similar waveform modifications have been suggested as means to improve selectivity of vagus and other nerve stimulation waveforms, but Applicant did not find them ideal [Aleksandra VUCKOVIC, Marco Tosato and Johannes J Struijk.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Applicant also found that stimulation waveforms consisting of bursts of square pulses are not ideal for non-invasive VNS stimulation [M. I. JOHNSON, C. H. Ashton, D. R. Bousfield and J. W. Thompson. Analgesic effects of different pulse patterns of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on cold-induced pain in normal subjects. Journal of Psychosomatic Research 35 (2/3, 1991):313-321; U.S. Pat. No. 7,734,340, entitled Stimulation design for neuromodulation, to De Ridder]. However, bursts of sinusoidal pulses are a preferred stimulation waveform, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref>. As seen there, individual sinusoidal pulses have a period of τ, and a burst consists of N such pulses. This is followed by a period with no signal (the inter-burst period). The pattern of a burst plus followed by silent inter-burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example, the sinusoidal period □τ may be 200 microseconds; the number of pulses per burst may be N=5; and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter-burst period may have a period of T=40000 microseconds (a much smaller value of T is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> to make the bursts discernable). Applicant is unaware of such a waveform having been used with vagal nerve stimulation, but a similar waveform has been used to stimulate muscle as a means of increasing muscle strength in elite athletes. However, for the muscle strengthening application, the currents used (200 mA) may be very painful and two orders of magnitude larger than what is disclosed herein for VNS. Furthermore, the signal used for muscle strengthening may be other than sinusoidal (e.g., triangular), and the parameters τ, N, and T may also be dissimilar from the values exemplified above [A.

By way of example, the electric field shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref> may have an E<sub>max </sub>value of 17 V/m, which is sufficient to stimulate the vagus nerve but is significantly lower than the threshold needed to stimulate surrounding muscle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In order to compare the electrical stimulator that is disclosed herein with existing electrodes and stimulators that have been used for non-invasive electrical stimulation, it is useful to first summarize the relevant physics of electric fields and currents that are produced by the electrodes. According to Maxwell's equation (Ampere's law with Maxwell correction): ∇×B=J+∈(∂E/∂t), where B is the magnetic field, J is the electrical current density, E is the electric field, ∈ is the permittivity, and t is time [Richard P. FEYNMAN, Robert B. Leighton, and Matthew Sands. The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Volume II. Addison-Wesley Publ. Co. (Reading Mass., 1964), page 15-15].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">According to Faraday's law, ∇×E=−∂B/∂t. However, for present purposes, changes in the magnetic field B may be ignored, so ∇×E=0, and E may therefore be obtained from the gradient of a scalar potential φ: <div class="patent-image small-patent-image"><a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/93/4e/0d/cb9d6479b31717/US10384061-20190820-P00001.png"><img alt="Figure US10384061-20190820-P00001" class="patent-full-image" file="US10384061-20190820-P00001.TIF" he="3.22mm" height="13" id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" img-content="character" img-format="tif" inline="no" orientation="portrait" src="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/93/4e/0d/cb9d6479b31717/US10384061-20190820-P00001.png" wi="2.79mm" width="11"/></a></div>=−∇φ. In general, the scalar potential φ and the electric field E are functions of position (r) and time (t).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">The electrical current density J is also a function of position (r) and time (t), and it is determined by the electric field and conductivity as follows, where the conductivity a is generally a tensor and a function of position (r): J=σE=−σ∇φ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">Because ∇·∇×B=0, Ampere's law with Maxwell's correction may be written as: ∇·J+∇·∈(∂E/∂t)=0. If the current flows in material that is essentially unpolarizable (i.e., is presumed not to be a dielectric so that ∈=0), substitution of the expression for J into the above expression for Ampere's law gives −∇·(σ∇φ)=0, which is a form of Laplace's equation. If the conductivity of material in the device (or patient) is itself a function of the electric field or potential, then the equation becomes non-linear, which could exhibit multiple solutions, frequency multiplication, and other such non-linear behavior. The equation has been solved analytically for special electrode configurations, but for more general electrode configurations, it must be solved numerically [Petrus J. CILLIERS.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">If capacitive effects cannot be ignored, an additional term involving the time-derivative of the gradient of the potential appears in the more general expression, as obtained by substituting the expressions for J and E into the divergence of Ampere's law with Maxwell's correction: −∇·(σ∇φ)−∇·(∈∇(∂φ/∂t))=0</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">The permittivity E is a function of position (r) and is generally a tensor. It may result from properties of the body and may also be a property of the electrode design [L. A. GEDDES, M. Hinds and K. S. Foster. Stimulation with capacitor electrodes. Med. and Biol. Eng. and Comput. 25(1987):359-360]. As a consequence of such a term, the waveform of the electrical potential at points within the body will generally be altered relative to the waveform of the voltage signal(s) applied to the electrode(s). Furthermore, if the permittivity of a material in the device itself (or patient) is a function of the electric field or potential, then the equation becomes non-linear, which could exhibit multiple solutions, frequency multiplication, and other such non-linear behavior. This time-dependent equation has been solved numerically [KUHN A, Keller T. A 3D transient model for transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">In any case, Dirichlet (D) boundary conditions define voltage sources, and Neumann (N) boundary conditions describe the behavior of the electric field at the crossover boundary from skin to air, as follows:
<br/>
<i>N:∂φ/∂n</i>=σ(<i>r</i>) and <i>D:φ=V</i>(<i>t</i>)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">where n denotes the outward pointing normal vector, i.e., the vector orthogonal to the boundary curve; and V(t) denotes the voltage applied to an electrode. Thus, no conduction current can flow across an air/conductor interface, so according to the interfacial boundary conditions, the component of any current normal to the an air/conductor interface must be zero. In constructing the above differential equation for φ as a function of time, the divergence of J is taken, which satisfies the continuity equation: ∇·J=−∂ρ/∂t, where ρ is the charge density. Conservation of charge requires that sides of this equation equal zero everywhere except at the surface of the electrode where charge is impressed upon the system (injected or received).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">It is an objective of the present invention to shape an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to a long nerve such as the vagus nerve in the neck. The term “shape an electric field” as used herein means to create an electric field or its gradient that is generally not radially symmetric at a given depth of stimulation in the patient, especially a field that is characterized as being elongated or finger-like, and especially also a field in which the magnitude of the field in some direction may exhibit more than one spatial maximum (i.e. may be bimodal or multimodal) such that the tissue between the maxima may contain an area across which current flow is restricted. Shaping of the electric field refers both to the circumscribing of regions within which there is a significant electric field and to configuring the directions of the electric field within those regions. Our invention does so by configuring elements that are present within the equations that were summarized above, comprising (but not limited to) the following exemplary configurations that may be used alone or in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">First, different contours or shapes of the electrodes affect ∇·J. For example, charge is impressed upon the system (injected or received) differently if an electrode is curved versus flat, or if there are more than two electrodes in the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Second, values of the voltage V(t) in the above boundary condition is manipulated to shape the electric field. For example, if the device contains two pairs of electrodes that are perpendicular or at a variable angle with respect to one another, the waveform of the voltage across one pair of electrodes may be different than the waveform of the voltage across the second pair, so that the superimposed electric fields that they produce may exhibit beat frequencies, as has been attempted with electrode-based stimulators [U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,057, entitled Interferential stimulator for applying localized stimulation, to REISS et al.], and acoustic stimulators [U.S. Pat. No. 5,903,516, entitled Acoustic force generator for detection, imaging and information transmission using the beat signal of multiple intersecting sonic beams, to GREENLEAF et al].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Third, the scalar potential φ in the above equation ∂φ/∂n=σ(r) may be manipulated to shape the electric field. For example, this is accomplished by changing the boundaries of conductor/air (or non-conductor) interfaces, thereby creating different boundary conditions. For example, the conducting material may pass through conducting apertures in an insulated mesh before contacting the patient's skin, creating thereby an array of electric field maxima. As another example, an electrode may be disposed at the end of a long tube that is filled with conducting material, or the electrode may be situated at the bottom of a curved cup that is filled with conducting material. In those cases the dimensions of the tube or cup would affect the resulting electric fields and currents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">Fourth, the conductivity σ (in the equation J=σE) may be varied spatially within the device by using two or more different conducting materials that are in contact with one another, for given boundary conditions. The conductivity may also be varied by constructing some conducting material from a semiconductor, which allows for adjustment of the conductivity in space and in time by exposure of the semiconductor to agents to which they are sensitive, such as electric fields, light at particular wavelengths, temperature, or some other environmental variable over which the user of the device has control. For the special case in which the semiconductor's conductivity may be made to approach zero, that would approximate the imposition of an interfacial boundary condition as described in the previous paragraph.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Fifth, a dielectric material having a high permittivity ∈, such as Mylar, neoprene, titanium dioxide, or strontium titanate, may be used in the device, for example, in order to permit capacitative electrical coupling to the patient's skin. Changing the permittivity in conjunction along with changing the waveform V(t) would especially affect operation of the device, because the permittivity appears in a term that is a function of the time-derivative of the electric potential: ∇·(∈∇(∂φ/∂t)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In configurations of the present invention, an electrode is situated in a container that is filled with conducting material. The disclosure below applies as well to conducting material within the magnetic stimulation device. In one embodiment, the container contains holes so that the conducting material (e.g., a conducting gel) can make physical contact with the patient's skin through the holes. For example, the conducting medium <b>351</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A or 352</figref> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> may comprise a chamber surrounding the electrode, filled with a conductive gel that has the approximate viscosity and mechanical consistency of gel deodorant (e.g., Right Guard Clear Gel from Dial Corporation, 15501 N. Dial Boulevard, Scottsdale Ariz. 85260, one composition of which comprises aluminum chlorohydrate, sorbitol, propylene glycol, polydimethylsiloxanes Silicon oil, cyclomethicone, ethanol/SD Alcohol 40, dimethicone copolyol, aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly, and water). The gel, which is less viscous than conventional electrode gel, is maintained in the chamber with a mesh of openings at the end where the device is to contact the patient's skin. The gel does not leak out, and it can be dispensed with a simple screw driven piston.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In another embodiment, the container itself is made of a conducting elastomer (e.g., dry carbon-filled silicone elastomer), and electrical contact with the patient is through the elastomer itself, possibly through an additional outside coating of conducting material. In some embodiments of the invention, the conducting medium may be a balloon filled with a conducting gel or conducting powders, or the balloon may be constructed extensively from deformable conducting elastomers. The balloon conforms to the skin surface, removing any air, thus allowing for high impedance matching and conduction of large electric fields in to the tissue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Agar can also be used as part of the conducting medium, but it is not preferred, because agar degrades in time, is not ideal to use against skin, and presents difficulties with cleaning the patient. Rather than using agar as the conducting medium, an electrode can instead be in contact with in a conducting solution such as 1-10% NaCl that also contacts an electrically conducting interface to the human tissue. Such an interface is useful as it allows current to flow from the electrode into the tissue and supports the conducting medium, wherein the device can be completely sealed. Thus, the interface is material, interposed between the conducting medium and patient's skin, that allows the conducting medium (e.g., saline solution) to slowly leak through it, allowing current to flow to the skin. Several interfaces are disclosed as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">One interface comprises conducting material that is hydrophilic, such as Tecophlic from The Lubrizol Corporation, 29400 Lakeland Boulevard, Wickliffe, Ohio 44092. It absorbs from 10-100% of its weight in water, making it highly electrically conductive, while allowing only minimal bulk fluid flow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Another material that may be used as an interface is a hydrogel, such as that used on standard EEG, EKG and TENS electrodes [Rylie A GREEN, Sungchul Baek, Laura A Poole-Warren and Penny J Martens. Conducting polymer-hydrogels for medical electrode applications. Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 11 (2010) 014107 (13 pp)]. For example it may be the following hypoallergenic, bacteriostatic electrode gel: SIGNAGEL Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories, Inc., 286 Eldridge Rd., Fairfield N.J. 07004. Another example is the KM10T hydrogel from Katecho Inc., 4020 Gannett Ave., Des Moines Iowa 50321.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">A third type of interface may be made from a very thin material with a high dielectric constant, such as those used to make capacitors. For example, Mylar can be made in submicron thicknesses and has a dielectric constant of about 3. Thus, at stimulation frequencies of several kilohertz or greater, the Mylar will capacitively couple the signal through it because it will have an impedance comparable to that of the skin itself. Thus, it will isolate the electrode and conducting solution in from the tissue, yet allow current to pass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">The electrode-base based stimulator in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows two equivalent electrodes <b>342</b>, side-by-side, wherein electrical current would pass through the two electrodes in opposite directions. Thus, the current will flow from one electrode, through the tissue and back through the other electrode, completing the circuit within the electrodes' conducting media that are separated from one another. An advantage of using two equivalent electrodes in this configuration is that this design will increase the magnitude of the electric field gradient between them, which is crucial for exciting long, straight axons such as the vagus nerve in the neck and other deep peripheral nerves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">A preferred embodiment of the electrode-based stimulator is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. A cross-sectional view of the stimulator along its long axis is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. As shown, the stimulator <b>30</b> comprises two heads <b>31</b> and a body <b>32</b> that joins them. Each head <b>31</b> contains a stimulating electrode. The body of the stimulator <b>32</b> contains the electronic components and battery (not shown) that are used to generate the signals that drive the electrodes, which are located behind the insulating board <b>33</b> that is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. However, in other embodiments of the invention, the electronic components that generate the signals that are applied to the electrodes may be separate, but connected to the electrode head <b>31</b> using wires. Furthermore, other embodiments of the invention may contain a single such head or more than two heads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Heads of the stimulator <b>31</b> are applied to a surface of the patient's body, during which time the stimulator may be held in place by straps or frames (not shown), or the stimulator may be held against the patient's body by hand. In either case, the level of stimulation power may be adjusted with a wheel <b>34</b> that also serves as an on/off switch. A light <b>35</b> is illuminated when power is being supplied to the stimulator. Thus, in this embodiment of the invention, mechanical and electronic components of the stimulator (impulse generator, control unit, and power source) are compact, portable, and simple to operate. A cap <b>36</b> is provided to cover each of the stimulator heads <b>31</b>, to protect the device when not in use, to avoid accidental stimulation, and to prevent material within the head from leaking or drying. However, for embodiments of the stimulator head in which the head is covered with Mylar or some other high-dielectric material that can capacitively couple the signal to the skin, the Mylar may completely seal the gel within the stimulator head, thereby preventing exposure of the gel to the outside. In that case, there would be no gel evaporation. Then, the cap <b>36</b> would be less advantageous because the head can be cleaned between stimulation sessions (e.g., with isopropyl alcohol) with no chance of contaminating the internal gel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Construction of the stimulator head is shown in more detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the stimulator head contains an aperture screen, but in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref>, there is no aperture screen. Referring now to the exploded view shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the electrode head is assembled from a snap-on cap <b>41</b> that serves as a tambour for a conducting membrane <b>42</b>, an aperture screen <b>43</b>, the head-cup <b>44</b>, the electrode which is also a screw <b>45</b>, and a lead-mounting screw <b>46</b> that is inserted into the electrode <b>45</b>. The electrode <b>45</b> seen in each stimulator head has the shape of a screw that is flattened on its tip. Pointing of the tip would make the electrode more of a point source, such that the above-mentioned equations for the electrical potential may have a solution corresponding more closely to a far-field approximation. Rounding of the electrode surface or making the surface with another shape will likewise affect the boundary conditions. Completed assembly of the stimulator head is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, which also shows how the head is attached to the body of the stimulator <b>47</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">As examples, the conducting membrane <b>42</b> may be a sheet of Tecophlic material from Lubrizol Corporation, 29400 Lakeland Boulevard, Wickliffe, Ohio 44092. The apertures may be open, or they may be plugged with conducting material, for example, KM10T hydrogel from Katecho Inc., 4020 Gannett Ave., Des Moines Iowa 50321. If the apertures are so-plugged, the conducting membrane <b>42</b> becomes optional. The head-cup <b>44</b> is filled with conducting material, for example, SIGNAGEL Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories, Inc., 286 Eldridge Rd., Fairfield N.J. 07004. The snap-on cap <b>41</b>, aperture screen <b>43</b>, head-cup <b>44</b> and body of the stimulator are made of a non-conducting material, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The depth of the head-cup from its top surface to the electrode may be between one and six centimeters. The head-cup may have a different curvature than what is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or it may be tubular or conical or have some other inner surface geomety that will affect the Neumann boundary conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">The alternate embodiment of the stimulator head that is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> also contains a snap-on cap <b>41</b>, a conducting membrane <b>42</b>, the head-cup <b>44</b>, the electrode which is also a screw <b>45</b>, and a lead-mounting screw <b>46</b> that is inserted into the electrode <b>45</b>. This alternate embodiment differs from the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> in regard to the mechanical support that is provided to the conducting membrane <b>42</b>. Whereas the aperture screen had provided mechanical support to the membrane in the other embodiment, in the alternate embodiment a reinforcing ring <b>40</b> is provided to the membrane. That reinforcement ring rests on non-conducting struts <b>49</b> that are placed in the head-cup <b>44</b>, and a non-conducting strut-ring <b>48</b> is placed within notches in the struts <b>49</b> to hold the struts in place. An advantage of the alternate embodiment is that without apertures, current flow is less restricted through the conducting membrane <b>42</b>. Furthermore, although the struts and strut-ring are made of non-conducting material in this alternate embodiment, the design may be adapted to position additional electrode or other conducting elements within the head-cup for other more specialized configurations of the stimulator head, the inclusion of which will influence the electric fields that are generated by the device. Completed assembly of the alternate stimulator head is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, without showing attachment to the body of the stimulator, and without showing the insertion of the lead-mounting screw <b>46</b>. In fact, it is also possible to insert a lead under the head of the electrode <b>45</b>, and many other methods of attaching the electrode to the signal-generating electronics of the stimulator are known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Another embodiment of the electrode-based stimulator is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, showing a device in which electrically conducting material is dispensed from the device to the patient's skin. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> respectively provide top and bottom views of the outer surface of the electrical stimulator <b>50</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> provides a bottom view of the stimulator <b>50</b>, after sectioning along its long axis to reveal the inside of the stimulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5C</figref> show a mesh <b>51</b> with openings that permit a conducting gel to pass from inside of the stimulator to the surface of the patient's skin at the position of nerve or tissue stimulation. Thus, the mesh with openings <b>51</b> is the part of the stimulator that is applied to the skin of the patient, through which conducting material may be dispensed. In any given stimulator, the distance between the two mesh openings <b>51</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is constant, but it is understood that different stimulators may be built with different inter-mesh distances, in order to accommodate the anatomy and physiology of individual patients. Alternatively, the inter-mesh distance may be made variable as in the eyepieces of a pair of binoculars. A covering cap (not shown) is also provided to fit snugly over the top of the stimulator housing and the mesh openings <b>51</b>, in order to keep the housing's conducting medium from leaking or drying when the device is not in use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</figref> show the bottom of the self-contained stimulator <b>50</b>. An on/off switch <b>52</b> is attached through a port <b>54</b>, and a power-level controller <b>53</b> is attached through another port <b>54</b>. The switch is connected to a battery power source (<b>320</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), and the power-level controller is attached to the control unit (<b>330</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) of the device. The power source battery and power-level controller, as well as the impulse generator (<b>310</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) are located (but not shown) in the rear compartment <b>55</b> of the housing of the stimulator <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Individual wires (not shown) connect the impulse generator (<b>310</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) to the stimulator's electrodes <b>56</b>. The two electrodes <b>56</b> are shown here to be elliptical metal discs situated between the head compartment <b>57</b> and rear compartment <b>55</b> of the stimulator <b>50</b>. A partition <b>58</b> separates each of the two head compartments <b>57</b> from one another and from the single rear compartment <b>55</b>. Each partition <b>58</b> also holds its corresponding electrode in place. However, each electrode <b>56</b> may be removed to add electrically conducting gel (<b>352</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) to each head compartment <b>57</b>. In addition, a non-conducting variable-aperture iris diaphragm may be placed in front of each of the electrodes within the head compartment <b>57</b>, in order to vary the effective surface area of each of the electrodes. Each partition <b>58</b> may also slide towards the head of the device in order to dispense conducting gel through the mesh apertures <b>51</b>. The position of each partition <b>58</b> therefore determines the distance <b>59</b> between its electrode <b>56</b> and mesh openings <b>51</b>, which is variable in order to obtain the optimally uniform current density through the mesh openings <b>51</b>. The outside housing of the stimulator <b>50</b>, as well as each head compartment <b>57</b> housing and its partition <b>58</b>, are made of electrically insulating material, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, so that the two head compartments are electrically insulated from one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">In a preferred embodiment, the magnetic stimulator coil <b>341</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> has a body that is similar to the electrode-based stimulator shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. To compare the electrode-based stimulator with the magnetic stimulator, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, which shows the magnetic stimulator <b>530</b> sectioned along its long axis to reveal its inner structure. As described below, it reduces the volume of conducting material that must surround a toroidal coil, by using two toroids, side-by-side, and passing electrical current through the two toroidal coils in opposite directions. In this configuration, the induced electrical current will flow from the lumen of one toroid, through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other, completing the circuit within the toroids' conducting medium. Thus, minimal space for the conducting medium is required around the outside of the toroids at positions near from the gap between the pair of coils. An additional advantage of using two toroids in this configuration is that this design will greatly increase the magnitude of the electric field gradient between them, which is crucial for exciting long, straight axons such as the vagus nerve and certain peripheral nerves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, a mesh <b>531</b> has openings that permit a conducting gel (within <b>351</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) to pass from the inside of the stimulator to the surface of the patient's skin at the location of nerve or tissue stimulation. Thus, the mesh with openings <b>531</b> is the part of the magnetic stimulator that is applied to the skin of the patient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> also shows openings at the opposite end of the magnetic stimulator <b>530</b>. One of the openings is an electronics port <b>532</b> through which wires pass from the stimulator coil(s) to the impulse generator (<b>310</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The second opening is a conducting gel port <b>533</b> through which conducting gel (<b>351</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) may be introduced into the magnetic stimulator <b>530</b> and through which a screw-driven piston arm may be introduced to dispense conducting gel through the mesh <b>531</b>. The gel itself is contained within cylindrical-shaped but interconnected conducting medium chambers <b>534</b> that are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. The depth of the conducting medium chambers <b>534</b>, which is approximately the height of the long axis of the stimulator, affects the magnitude of the electric fields and currents that are induced by the magnetic stimulator device [Rafael CARBUNARU and Dominique M. Durand. Toroidal coil models for transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of nerves. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. 48 (No. 4, April 2001): 434-441].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> also show the coils of wire <b>535</b> that are wound around toroidal cores <b>536</b>, consisting of high-permeability material (e.g., Supermendur). Lead wires (not shown) for the coils <b>535</b> pass from the stimulator coil(s) to the impulse generator (<b>310</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) via the electronics port <b>532</b>. Different circuit configurations are contemplated. If separate lead wires for each of the coils <b>535</b> connect to the impulse generator (i.e., parallel connection), and if the pair of coils are wound with the same handedness around the cores, then the design is for current to pass in opposite directions through the two coils. On the other hand, if the coils are wound with opposite handedness around the cores, then the lead wires for the coils may be connected in series to the impulse generator, or if they are connected to the impulse generator in parallel, then the design is for current to pass in the same direction through both coils.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">As also seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the coils <b>535</b> and cores <b>536</b> around which they are wound are mounted as close as practical to the corresponding mesh <b>531</b> with openings through which conducting gel passes to the surface of the patient's skin. As shown, each coil and the core around which it is wound is mounted in its own housing <b>537</b>, the function of which is to provide mechanical support to the coil and core, as well as to electrically insulate a coil from its neighboring coil. With this design, induced current will flow from the lumen of one toroid, through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other, completing the circuit within the toroids' conducting medium. A difference between the structure of the electrode-based stimulator shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> and the magnetic stimulator shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> is that the conducting gel is maintained within the chambers <b>57</b> of the electrode-based stimulator, which is generally closed on the back side of the chamber because of the presence of the electrode <b>56</b>; but in the magnetic stimulator, the hole of each toroidal core and winding is open, permitting the conducting gel to enter the interconnected chambers <b>534</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">Different diameter toroidal coils and windings may be preferred for different applications. For a generic application, the outer diameter of the core may be typically 1 to 5 cm, with an inner diameter typically 0.5 to 0.75 of the outer diameter. The coil's winding around the core may be typically 3 to 250 in number, depending on the core diameter and depending on the desired coil inductance. The currents passing through the coils of the magnetic stimulator will saturate the core (e.g., 0.1 to 2 Tesla magnetic field strength for Supermendur core material). This will require approximately 0.5 to 20 amperes of current being passed through each coil, typically 2 amperes, with voltages across each coil of 10 to 100 volts. The current is passed through the coils in bursts of pulses, as described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

Such a chamber design had been used prior to the availability of flexible, flat, disposable electrodes [U.S. Pat.

Portable stimulators are also known in the art, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,171,266, entitled Electro-acupuncture device with stimulation electrode assembly, to Gruzdowich. Novelty of the designs shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref> is not per se that the electrode is situated remotely from the skin with intervening conductive material, or that the devices are portable, but rather that two or more remote electrodes are configured for placement relative to the axis of a deep, long nerve, such that the stimulator along with a correspondingly suitable stimulation waveform shapes the electric field, producing a selective physiological response by stimulating that nerve, but avoiding substantial stimulation of nerves and tissue other than the target nerve, particularly avoiding the stimulation of nerves that produce pain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Examples in the remaining disclosure will be directed to methods for using the disclosed electrical stimulation devices for treating a patient. Selected nerve fibers are stimulated in different embodiments of methods that make use of the disclosed electrical stimulation devices, including stimulation of the vagus nerve at a location in the patient's neck. At that location, the vagus nerve is situated within the carotid sheath, near the carotid artery and the interior jugular vein. The carotid sheath is located at the lateral boundary of the retopharyngeal space on each side of the neck and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The left vagus nerve is sometimes selected for stimulation because stimulation of the right vagus nerve may produce undesired effects on the heart, but depending on the application, the right vagus nerve or both right and left vagus nerves may be stimulated instead.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">The three major structures within the carotid sheath are the common carotid artery, the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve. The carotid artery lies medial to the internal jugular vein, and the vagus nerve is situated posteriorly between the two vessels. Typically, the location of the carotid sheath or interior jugular vein in a patient (and therefore the location of the vagus nerve) will be ascertained in any manner known in the art, e.g., by feel or ultrasound imaging. Proceeding from the skin of the neck above the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the vagus nerve, a line may pass successively through the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the carotid sheath and the internal jugular vein, unless the position on the skin is immediately to either side of the external jugular vein. In the latter case, the line may pass successively through only the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath before encountering the vagus nerve, missing the interior jugular vein. Accordingly, a point on the neck adjacent to the external jugular vein might be preferred for non-invasive stimulation of the vagus nerve. The magnetic stimulator coil may be centered on such a point, at the level of about the fifth to sixth cervical vertebra.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates use of the devices shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref> to stimulate the vagus nerve at that location in the neck, in which the stimulator device <b>50</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is shown to be applied to the target location on the patient's neck as described above.

The layer of conducting gel <b>29</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is shown to connect the device to the patient's skin, but it is understood that the actual location of the gel layer(s) may be generally determined by the location of mesh <b>51</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Furthermore, it is understood that for other embodiments of the invention, the conductive head of the device may not necessitate the use of additional conductive material being applied to the skin. The vagus nerve <b>60</b> is identified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, along with the carotid sheath <b>61</b> that is identified there in bold peripheral outline. The carotid sheath encloses not only the vagus nerve, but also the internal jugular vein <b>62</b> and the common carotid artery <b>63</b>. Features that may be identified near the surface of the neck include the external jugular vein <b>64</b> and the sternocleidomastoid muscle <b>65</b>.

The sixth cervical vertebra <b>76</b> is also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, with bony structure indicated by hatching marks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">If it is desired to maintain a constant intensity of stimulation in the vicinity of the vagus nerve (or any other nerve or tissue that is being stimulated), methods may also be employed to modulate the power of the stimulator in order to compensate for patient motion or other mechanisms that would otherwise give rise to variability in the intensity of stimulation. In the case of stimulation of the vagus nerve, such variability may be attributable to the patient's breathing, which may involve contraction and associated change in geometry of the sternocleidomastoid muscle that is situated close to the vagus nerve (identified as <b>65</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Methods for compensating for motion and other confounding factors were disclosed by the present applicant in commonly assigned co-pending application Ser. No. 12/859,568, entitled Non-Invasive Treatment of Bronchial Constriction, to SIMON, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Methods of treating a patient comprise stimulating the vagus nerve as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, using the electrical or magnetic stimulation devices that are disclosed herein. The position and angular orientation of the device are adjusted about that location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator electrodes. The applied current is increased gradually, first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased, but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort. Straps, harnesses, or frames are used to maintain the stimulator in position (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6 or 7</figref>). The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to produce a therapeutic result in the patient. Stimulation parameters for each patient are adjusted on an individualized basis. Ordinarily, the amplitude of the stimulation signal is set to the maximum that is comfortable for the patient, and then the other stimulation parameters are adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">In other embodiments of the invention, pairing of vagus nerve stimulation may be with a time-varying sensory stimulation. The paired sensory stimulation may be bright light, sound, tactile stimulation, or electrical stimulation of the tongue to simulate odor/taste, e.g., pulsating with the same frequency as the vagus nerve electrical stimulation. The rationale for paired sensory stimulation is the same as simultaneous, paired stimulation of both left and right vagus nerves, namely, that the pair of signals interacting with one another in the brain may result in the formation of larger and more coherent neural ensembles than the neural ensembles associated with the individual signals, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect. For example, the hypothalamus is well known to be responsive to the presence of bright light, so exposing the patient to bright light that is fluctuating with the same stimulation frequency as the vagus nerve (or a multiple of that frequency) may be performed in an attempt to enhance the role of the hypothalamus in producing the desired therapeutic effect. For migraine headaches, the desired effect is to reduce the frequency of migraines and/or the reduction of migraine pain and its duration [D. J. ANDERSON. The Treatment of Migraine with Variable Frequency Photo-Stimulation. Headache 29(1989):154-155; David NOTON. Migraine and photic stimulation: report on a survey of migraineurs using fickering light therapy. Complementary Therapies in Nursing and Midwifery 6(2000): 138-142]. Such paired stimulation does not rely upon neuronal plasticity and is in that sense different from other reports of paired stimulation [Navzer D. ENGINEER, Jonathan R. Riley, Jonathan D. Seale, Will A. Vrana, Jai A. Shetake, Sindhu P. Sudanagunta, Michael S. Borland and Michael P. Kilgard. Reversing pathological neural activity using targeted plasticity. Nature (2011): published online doi:10.1038/nature09656].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Use of the above-described devices and methods to treat migraine headaches is now disclosed. Migraine headache is a disorder of the brain characterized by a complex, but stereotypical, dysfunction of sensory processing. The annual prevalence of migraine is 6-9% among men and 15-17% among women. Migraine appears in all ages but reaches a peak in middle age, decreasing in old age. Migraine headaches often occur on both sides of the head in children, but then an adult pattern of unilateral pain often emerges in adolescence. Migraine headache pain is usually located in the temple, forehead or eye, or back of the head, sometimes reported as starting in the occipital/neck regions, and later becoming fronto-temporal. The pain is throbbing and aggravated by physical effort. Approximately 20-30% of migraine sufferers (migraineurs) experience an aura, ordinarily a visual aura. The aura typically lasts for 5 minutes to an hour, during which time the patient experiences sensations such as moving zig-zag flashes of light, blind spots or tingling in the hand or face. Allodynia (perception of pain when a usually nonpainful stimulus is applied, such as hair combing) is reported in about two-thirds of migraineurs during the attack [SCHER A I, Stewart W F, Ricci J A, Lipton R B. Factors associated with the onset and remission of chronic daily headache in a population-based study. Pain. 106(2003):81-89; Bert B. VARGAS, David W. Dodick. The Face of Chronic Migraine: Epidemiology, Demographics, and Treatment Strategies. Neurol Clin 27 (2009): 467-479].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Both twin studies and population-based epidemiological surveys strongly suggest that migraine without aura is a multifactorial disorder, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Inherited susceptibility for common migraine (without or with aura) involves a gene sequence variant on chromosome 8, which is flanked between two genes (PGCP and MTDH/AEG-1) that are involved in glutamate homeostasis. MTDH/AEG-1 regulates the activity of the EAAT2 gene product, which is responsible for clearing glutamate from brain synapses in the brain. Plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase (PGCP) is a proteinase that acts on the unsubstituted N- and C-termini of dipeptides, which like other glutamate carboxypeptidases may regulate the concentration of glutamate in the extra cellular space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Migraine with aura has an even stronger genetic basis. Families with Familial Hem iplegic Migraine (FHM) most often have a mutation involving a Cav2.1 (P/Q) type voltage-gated calcium channel on chromosome 19. In other families with FMH, a mutation occurs on chromosome 1 in a gene encoding the A2 subunit of the Na+, K+ ATPase. A third mutant gene that is located on chromosome 2, a neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel, has also been found to produce FMH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Some migraine sufferers become symptom-free for long periods of time. Others continue to have headaches with fewer or less typical migraine features, resembling tension-type headaches, rather than full-blown migraine. Considering the above-mentioned age-related incidence of migraine, this may be partly due to aging. It may also be due to the migraineur learning to avoid the factors that trigger migraines or to successful prophylactic treatment [SCHER A I, Stewart W F, Ricci J A, Lipton R B. Factors associated with the onset and remission of chronic daily headache in a population-based study. Pain 106(2003):81-89; BOARDMAN H F, Thomas E, Millson D S, Croft P R. The natural history of headache: predictors of onset and recovery Cephalalgia 26(2006):1080-1088; BIGAL M E, Lipton R B. Modifiable risk factors for migraine progression.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">Migraine attacks may also continue over many years without major changes in frequency, severity or symptoms. In some migraineurs, migraine attack frequency and disability may increase over time, in which there may be a progression from episodic migraine to chronic (chronified or transformed) migraine. The progression may be due to treatment exacerbating the problem, to unsuccessful or futile avoidance of triggers, or conceivably to progressive neurological changes that are analogous to progressive neurodegeneration [Paul R. MARTIN and Colin MacLeod. Behavioral management of headache triggers: Avoidance of triggers is an inadequate strategy. Clinical Psychology Review 29 (2009) 483-495]. Attempts have been made to document progressive neurological changes in migraineurs so as better understand putative progression [VALFRE W, Rainero I, Bergui M, Pinessi L. Voxel-based morphometry reveals grey matter abnormalities in migraine Headache 48(2008):109-17]. However, conclusions drawn from brain imaging of migraineurs is controversial because observed progressive changes might not be irreversible [Arne May. Morphing voxels: the hype around structural imaging of headache patients. Brain 132(2009): 1419-1425]. Such imaging may be most useful in conjunction with biomarkers that do not involve brain imaging, but that may be also be used to diagnose, stage, and evaluate therapies for migraine [Aron D Mosnaim, Javier Puente and Marion E Wolf. Biological correlates of migraine and cluster headaches: an overview of their potential use in diagnosis and treatment. Pragmatic and Observational Research 1(2010): 25-32].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">The diagnosis and treatment of migraine is complicated by the potential co-morbidity of migraine with other disorders. Those disorders include ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA), sub-clinical cerebral lesions, coronary heart disease, patent foramen ovale, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, bipolar disorders, restless leg syndrome, obesity, epilepsy (co-morbid with aura), fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and celiac disease. Additional disorders that may be co-morbid with migraine comprise allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and asthma, the co-morbidity of which is largely responsible for the considerable underreporting and misdiagnosis of migraine [H. C. DIENER, M. Küper, and T. Kurth. Migraine-associated risks and co-morbidity. J Neurol (2008) 255:1290-1301; Shuu-Jiun WANG, Ping-Kun Chen and Jong-Ling Fuh. Co-morbidities of migraine.

Possible mechanisms of interaction. Neurology 68 (2007): 1851-1861].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">A migraine headache typically passes through the following stages: prodrome, aura, headache pain, and postdrome. All these phases do not necessarily occur, and there is not necessarily a distinct onset or end of each stage, with the possible exception of the aura. An interictal period follows the postdrome, unless the postrome of one migraine attack overlaps the prodrome of the next migraine attack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">The prodrome stage comprises triggering events followed by premonitory symptoms. Triggers (also called precipitating factors) usually precede the attack by less than 48 h. The most commonly reported triggers are: stress and negative emotions; hormonal factors for females (menstruation, menopause, pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy); flicker, glare and eyestrain; noise; odors (exhaust fumes, cleaning solutions, perfume); hunger and thirst (skipped meals, delayed meals, fasting, dehydration, withdrawal of reactive foods and drinks, particularly caffeinated); consumption of certain foods (e.g., chocolate, monosodium glutamate, pungent foods) and alcohol; weather (cold, heat, high humidity, sudden changes in weather, allergens such as pollen); fatigue; and lack of sleep or too much sleep [Burstein R, Jakubowski M. A unitary hypothesis for multiple triggers of the pain and strain of migraine. J Comp Neurol 493(2005):9-14; Vincent T. Martin, Michael M. Behbehani. Towards a rational understanding of migraine trigger factors. Medical Clinics of North America 85(4, 2001): 911-41].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">The prodrome is often characterized by fatigue, sleepiness, elation, food cravings, depression, irritability, among other symptoms. Clinical signs of sensory hyper-excitability often make their debut during the premonitory phase, which later accompany the headache phase, such as photo/phonophobia, hyperosmia and cutaneous allodynia of the scalp. Patients may also describe nausea during the prodrome. The average duration of the prodrome is 6 to 10 hours, but in half of migraine attacks, the prodrome is less than two hours (or absent), and in approximately 15% of migraine attacks, the prodrome lasts for 12 hours to 2 days. The following symptoms were found to be most predictive of imminent headache pain: difficulty with speech, reading or writing, and yawning. Many prodromal symptoms persist after the headache (during the postdrome), but the following decrease significantly: yawning, blurred vision, and nausea/vomiting [Leslie KELMAN. The premonitory symptoms (prodrome): a tertiary care study of 893 migraineurs. Headache 44(2004): 865-872; N. J. Giffin, L. Ruggiero, R. B. Lipton, S. D. Silberstein, J. F. Tvedskov, J. Olesen, J. Altman, P. J. Goadsby, and A. Macrae. Premonitory symptoms in migraine. An electronic diary study. Neurology 60 (2003):935-940].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">It is widely agreed that the aura, which is present in 20-30% of migraine attacks, is due to cortical spreading depression (CSD) within the brain, as now described. An electrophysiological wave is usually initiated within the occipital region of the brain where visual processing occurs, and the wave propagates at a rate of approximately 3 mm/min through neighboring cortical tissue, which is perceived as a scintillating scotoma (zig-zag line) that moves within the visual field as the CSD propagates. Such an aura may be initiated, for example, by viewing a bright light (e.g., reflection of the sun) while the occipital region is in a hypersensitive state. More generally, CSD is triggered when a minimum critical volume of brain tissue is simultaneously depolarized by an intense stimulus, such as concentrated KCl application, direct electrical stimulation, trauma, ischemia or epileptic activity. However, aura symptoms, regardless of their form, vary to a great extent in duration and severity from patient to patient, and also within the same individual. This variation may be due to unique paths that the CSD wave follows in individual attacks as it propagates through regions of the brain that have different functions (e.g., related to speech, memory, motor functions). Furthermore, non-visual and possibly non-perceived (silent) auras may also arise when the CSD is not initiated in the occipital portion of the brain [C. AYATA. Spreading depression: from serendipity to targeted therapy in migraine prophylaxis. Cephalalgia 29 (2009), 1097-1114; Markus A. DAHLEM, Felix M. Schneider, and Eckehard Scholl.

Migraine aura and related phenomena: beyond scotomata and scintillations. Cephalagia 27 (12, 2007):1368-77].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">Although the headache phase can begin at any hour, it most commonly begins as mild pain when the patient awakens in the morning. It then gradually builds at variable rates to reach a peak at which the pain is usually described as moderate to severe. The typical headache is unilateral and throbbing, aggravated by movement, with all stimuli tending to accentuate the headache. Patients frequently develop cutaneous allodynia, and sensory hypersensitivity results in patients seeking a dark, quiet place. Blurry vision, nasal stuffiness, anorexia, hunger, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, polyuria, facial pallor, sensations of heat or cold, and sweating might also occur. Depression, fatigue, anxiety, nervousness, irritability, and impairment of concentration are common. The pain phase lasts 4-72 h in adults and 1-72 h in children, with a mean duration generally of less than 1 day. The pain intensity usually follows a smooth curve with a crescendo with a diminuendo.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">After the headache has resolved, many patients are left with a postdrome that lingers for one to two days. The main complaints are cognitive difficulties, such as mental tiredness. Patients also describe symptoms of neural hyperexcitability, such as photophobia and allodynia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">The following is known about the pathophysiology of migraine. The trigeminovascular system consists of the neurons innervating the cerebral vessels whose cell bodies are located in a trigeminal ganglion [Arne M A Y and Peter J Goadsby. The Trigeminovascular System in Humans: Pathophysiologic Implications for Primary Headache Syndromes of the Neural Influences on the Cerebral Circulation. Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism 19(1999): 115-127]. It is widely accepted that migraine is a neurovascular disorder, wherein the intracranial throbbing pain of migraine is mediated by the interaction between nerves and blood vessels, involving neuronal activity and inflammation along the trigeminovascular pathway [Daniela PIETROBON and Jörg Striessnig.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">The cranial blood vessels are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the cranial vessels (arteries and veins) <b>830</b> lie between the skullcap bone <b>810</b> and grey matter of the cerebral hemispheres <b>841</b>, within the meninges that comprises the dura mater <b>820</b>, the arachnoid mater <b>822</b> and the pia mater <b>840</b>. Other structures shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> include skin <b>801</b>, connective tissue <b>802</b>, aponeurosis <b>803</b>, loose areolar tissue <b>804</b>, pericranium <b>805</b>, subdural space <b>821</b>, subarachnoid space <b>823</b>, superior sagittal sinus <b>824</b>, and an arachnoid granulation <b>825</b>. The cranial vessels <b>830</b> are shown here within the dura mater <b>820</b>. However, it is understood in what follows that the relevant noiceceptive nerve fibers may be located not only around the large cranial vessels, but also around pial vessels, sinuses such as the superior sagittal sinus <b>824</b>, and dura mater <b>820</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">The trigeminal ganglion is a sensory ganglion of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve (V cranial nerve) consists of three main branches, the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3), each providing somatosensory innervations of distinct regions of the head, face, and orofacial cavity. Although the migraine headache pain arises primarily from activation of the opthalmic branch (V1), all branches of the trigeminal nerve share the same basic pathophysiology. For many individuals the first symptom of altered trigeminal function with subsequent inflammatory protein release may be at the maxillary (V2) or even mandibular (V3) trigeminal divisions. This is important clinically because some patients may experience the first symptoms in the region innervated by V2, namely, the area of the nasal passages, and they may be misdiagnosed (through the patient's own self diagnosis or clinician's diagnosis) with sinus headache. However, a trigeminally mediated neuroinflammatory response at the level of the nasal passages can explain the nasal congestion, discharge, and discomfort experienced by many patients at the onset of their migraine attacks. Similarly, pericranial (jaw and neck) muscle tenderness is a common symptom in migraine, which might be attributed in part to activation of the mandibular (V3) trigeminal division.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the development of headache depends on the activation of nociceptive afferent fibers <b>860</b> of trigeminal ganglion neurons innervating the blood vessels <b>830</b> in the meninges. Activation of the trigeminovascular afferents <b>860</b> by a variety of mechanisms leads to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides in the meninges. These trigeminal fibers contain substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), both of which can be released when the fibers are stimulated. Neurokinin A (formerly known as substance K), produced from the same gene as substance P, may also be released. Trigeminal ganglion fiber stimulation also increases cerebral blood flow through release of a powerful vasodilator peptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Vasodilation of meningeal blood vessels also occurs via activation of parasympathetic efferents <b>861</b>, wherein nitric oxide (NO) and acetylcholine (ACh) are released. The dilation also causes mechanical stretching or bending of the perivascular nerve fibers, which results in fiber depolarization, in addition to that attributable to the above-mentioned released chemicals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">Stimulation may also results in leakage of plasma from dural blood vessels (plasma extravasation), leaked components of which may contribute to the nociception. Additional structural changes in the dura mater after trigeminal ganglion stimulation include degranulation of mast cells <b>870</b> (not drawn to scale) and activation of macrophages <b>871</b> (not drawn to scale). Activation of such resident immune cells, which are prominent components of the intracranial meninges, is also likely to serve as an important step in promoting the enhanced excitability of meningeal nociceptors. Inhibition of neuroinflammation in the vicinity of a nociceptor might therefore be accomplished through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or histamine or the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines and/or antihistamines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">In addition to the above-mentioned self-reinforcing mechanisms for activation of nociceptive afferent fibers <b>860</b> of trigeminal ganglion neurons innervating the blood vessels <b>830</b> in the meninges, cortical spreading depression (CSD) that accompanies migraine aura may also activate the fibers. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows a wave of cortical spreading depression <b>850</b> that is propagating (shown with arrows) within the cerebral hemisphere. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the wave may eventually reach pia mater <b>840</b>, activating perivascular trigeminal terminals therein. Such CSD-mediated activation will stimulate nearby nociceptive fibers that impinge upon a blood vessel <b>830</b>, resulting in the release of substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, etc.; and it will also result in a nociceptive afferent signal that is sent to central brain structures via the trigeminal nerve branch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">After meningeal stimulation and/or inflammation, the corresponding afferent signal <b>860</b> is relayed to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As described above in connection with description of the branches of the trigeminal nerve, the meningeal signal arrives from the ophthalmic branch (V1), but more generally a signal may arrive from the maxillary (V2) and/or mandibular (V3) branches as well, which are also labeled as an afferent signal <b>860</b>. Stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus (<b>824</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) also causes excitation in the TNC, as well as in the dorsal horn at the C1 and C2 levels. Stimulation of a branch of C2, the greater occipital nerve, increases neuronal activity in the same regions, i.e., the TNC and C1/2 dorsal horn. This group of neurons from the superficial laminae of trigeminal nucleus caudalis and C1/2 dorsal horns is known functionally as the trigeminocervical complex. Thus, a substantial portion of the trigeminovascular nociceptive signals comes through mostly caudal cells. This provides an anatomical explanation for the experience of pain to the back of the head in migraine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">As also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, following neuronal transmission in the caudal brain stem and high cervical spinal cord of the trigeminocervical complex, information is relayed to the thalamus, contralateral to the acute migraine pain, which processes and forwards the processed signal to the cerebral cortex, where it is perceived as migraine pain. Stimulating the superior sagittal sinus (<b>824</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) also activates neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) and in the dorsal pons, near the locus ceruleus. Notably, electrical stimulation with electrodes in the PAG and locus ceruleus induces migraine-like headaches. The PAG is involved in craniovascular pain not only through ascending projections to the thalamus but also through descending, mostly inhibitory modulation of nociceptive afferent information via projections to serotonergic neurons in the raphe nucleus. Upon activation, the nucleus locus ceruleus, the main central noradrenergic nucleus, reduces cerebral blood flow, apparently by causing vasodilation in other vessels to divert the flow of blood. In contrast, the main serotonin-containing nucleus in the brain stem, the raphe nucleus, increases cerebral blood flow when activated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">As also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a migraine-related pathway involves pre- and postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the superior salivatory nucleus (SSN) and sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), respectively. The SSN stimulates the release of acetylcholine, vasopressin intestinal peptide, and nitric oxide from meningeal terminals of SPG neurons, resulting directly or indirectly in the cascade of events that include the dilation of intracranial blood vessels, plasma protein extravasation, and local release of inflammatory molecules that activate adjacent terminals of meningeal nociceptors. This autonomic activation also leads to lacrimation, reddening of the eye, and nasal congestion. The efferent circuit element <b>861</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is the same as the element so-labeled in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. The SSN receives extensive input from more than fifty brain areas, three of which are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Furthermore, the same hypothalamic, limbic, and cortical areas that project to the SSN also appear to receive extensive afferent connections from the trigeminovascular pathway. This provides a neuroanatomical mechanism by which stimulation of the afferent <b>860</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> can lead to a positive-feedback stimulation of the efferent <b>861</b> [BURSTEIN R, Jakubowski M. A unitary hypothesis for multiple triggers of the pain and strain of migraine. J Comp Neurol 2005; 493:9-14].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">The foregoing sequence of activation, from meninges inflammation to trigeminal nucleus caudalis to thalamus, PAG, locus ceruleus, raphe nuclei and back via the SSN and SPG does not ascribe a proximal cause of the trigeminal activation, other than possibly the cortical spreading depression that is associated with aura experienced by some migraineurs. This is because the proximal events leading to activation of the trigeminal ganglia fibers may trigger the migraine, but they are not necessarily the cause of the migraine, for the following reason. Once the migraine has started, it becomes self-perpetuating, which is to say, painful stimulation from the ongoing migraine itself may be sufficient to feed back and maintain activation of the trigeminal ganglia, long after the triggering events have passed. In fact, it is conceivable that internal random or chaotic fluctuations of neuronal activity within the trigeminal ganglia itself, and the structures with which it is physiologically connected, may be sufficiently amplified by positive feedback of the system to trigger the migraine, without even the need for an external triggering event. For this reason, the pathophysiology of migraine triggers is important not so much as it relates to the initial events of the migraine attack, but rather as it relates to the origins of the hypersensitivity of the trigeminovascular and other neurological systems in migraineurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">Hypersensitivity in migraine headaches, as well as the common migraine prodromal symptoms, may result from connection of the trigeminovascular pathway with an abnormal hypothalamus and/or limbic system, which in turn may be associated with imbalanced neurotransmitter levels. Such connections are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, many of which involve the hypothalamus, which is activated during a migraine attack [Marie Denuelle, Nelly Fabre, Pierre Payoux, Francois Chollet, Gilles Geraud. Hypothalamic Activation in Spontaneous Migraine Attacks. Headache 47 (2007):1418-1426]. Many migraine patients experience premonitory autonomic and endocrine symptoms (sleep disturbances, changes of wakefulness and alertness, as well as changes of appetite and thirst) that may well be attributed to primary hypothalamic dysfunction. In particular, the association of migraine with hormonal changes and the fact that migraine occurs most often in women may be attributed to involvement of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus may also regulate activity of the thalamus, periaqueductal gray, locus ceruleus, trigeminocervical complex, and cortical structures via its secretion of orexin. Furthermore, the hypothalamus plays an important role in control of nociception, for example, involving the release of endogenous opioid peptides, as described below [KB Alstadhaug. Migraine and the hypothalamus. Cephalalgia 29(2009): 809-817].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Connections of the trigeminovascular pathway to the limbic system via the hypothalamus may also explain in part the hypersensitivity that is associated with migraine headaches. The extended amygdala with its connections within the limbic system mediates long-lasting responses during sustained stress, which is the prodromal symptom most commonly associated with migraine. Such responses persist long after the termination of stress, so migraine nociception may be enhanced as a consequence of the connection of the trigeminovascular pathway to an activated limbic system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">Hyperactivity of cranial parasympathetic nerves was mentioned above in connection with the superior salivatory nucleus and superior sphenopalatinate ganglion. Thus, parasympathetic symptoms such as facial flushing, lacrimation and nasal stuffiness may accompany migraine attacks. In contrast, sympathetic hypofunction appears to be associated with migraine. Even during headache-free periods, migraineurs have reduced sympathetic function, as compared with non-migraineurs. This is evidenced in migrainers by reduced norepinephrine levels, adrenergic receptor super-sensitivity, orthostatic intolerance, decreased Valsalva maneuver response, impaired isometric exercise and cold-pressor responses and impaired pupillary control. These observations are consistent with the view that prolonged stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system in migraineurs has depleted norepinephrine levels. This leads to an increase in the release of other sympathetic neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine, adenosine, neuropeptide Y, dynorphin, and prostaglandins. Nausea/vomiting and yawning are symptoms that are associated with increased dopamine levels. Increased pain sensitivity and inflammation are symptoms that are associated with increased prostaglandin levels. Drowsiness is a symptom that is associated with increased adenosine levels. Also, the decreased norepinephrine levels will result in orthostatic intolerance and vasodilation. Furthermore, because the sympathetic system normally acts to inhibit the trigeminal system, hypofunction of the sympathetic nervous system will promote migraine attacks. The sympathetic nervous system works in conjunction with the hypothalamus and limbic system as part of the physiological stress response system. Then, according to this view, a prime cause of migraine would be prolonged stress and its sequela in a susceptible individual, which is consistent with the fact that stress is cited as the primary trigger migraine attacks. The anticipation of migraine, as well as the actual migraine attacks, will contribute to that stress [Stephen J. Peroutka. Migraine: a chronic sympathetic nervous system disorder. Headache 44(2004): 53-64].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">In addition to its role in producing prodromal symptoms such as yawning, dopamine that is produced in the hypothalamus and elsewhere may also act directly on trigeminal afferents to modulate (generally inhibit) the trigeminocervical complex [Annabelle R. CHARBIT, Simon Akerman and Peter J. Goadsby. Dopamine: what's new in migraine? Current Opinion in Neurology 23 (2010):275-281]. Another neurotransmitter that is implicated in migraine is serotonin (5-HT), wherein a low 5-HT state facilitates activation of the trigeminovascular nociceptive pathway when induced by cortical spreading depression [E. HAMEL. Serotonin and migraine: biology and clinical implications. Cephalalgia 27 (2007): 1295-1300].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Current treatments for migraine are made in the context of its above-described pathophysiology, but are often based on trial and error. Pharmacological treatments may be divided into those that are intended to prevent migraine attacks and those administered during an attack. Current preventive treatment includes the administration of one or more of the following: beta-blockers (Propranolol, Metoprolol), anticonvulsants (Valproate, Topiramate, Gabapentin, lamotrigine), antidepressants (Amitriptyline, dosulepin, nortriptyline, Venlafaxine), calcium-channel blockers (Flunarizine, Verapamil), serotonin antagonists (Pizotifen, Methysergide), and dietary supplements (Riboflavin, Coenzyme Q10). Drugs that are administered during a migraine attack fall into two categories: analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) that are not specific for migraine; and largely migraine-specific drugs (ergot-related compounds and triptans). The former group of drugs include: aspirin, paracetamol, Naproxen and ibuprofen. To counter nausea during the migraine attack, anti-emetics are often administered as well (domperidone, metoclopramide). Migraine-specific drugs are administered when the non-specific drugs are ineffective. They include ergot-related Dihydroergotamine as a nasal spray or injection, and triptans, which are serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists: Sumatriptan, Zolmitriptan, Naratriptan, Rizatriptan, Eletriptan, Almotriptan, and Frovatriptan. Often a different triptan will be administered if the currently administered triptan is ineffective for three migraine attacks. Triptans have cardiovascular side effects and are contraindicated during pregnancy and when a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is being administered. Furthermore, only 30-40% of migraineurs are pain-free two hours after the administration of triptans. Of those who do respond, one in three will experience a migraine recurrence within 24 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">In situations in which the above-mentioned standard drug treatments are ineffective, the following experimental drug treatments have been tried: Botulinum Toxin Type A for prophylaxis (possibly blocking the local release of glutamate and substance P) and divalproex sodium, which increases the levels of inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Additional drugs are under trial, notably CGRP1 antagonists, glutamate receptor antagonists, transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) receptor antagonists, nitric oxide synthesis inhibitors, and prostanoid receptor antagonists [Peter J Goadsby, Till Sprenger.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Non-pharmacological treatments of migraine headaches have a long history [Peter J. KOEHLER and Christopher J. Boes. A history of non-drug treatment in headache, particularly migraine. Brain 133(2010): 2489-2500]. Behavioral therapy is sometimes used when the patient has overused drugs [Grazzi L, Andrasik F, D'Amico D, et al. Behavioral and pharmacologic treatment of transformed migraine with analgesic overuse: outcome at 3 years. Headache 42 (2002):483-90]. Non-invasive physical treatments for migraine include spinal manipulation, mobilization, massage, therapeutic touch, therapeutic exercise, cold packs, and electrical modalities (including pulsating electromagnetic fields [PEMF], cranial electrotherapy, interferential therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS], and ultrasound), and different combinations of physical treatments [Brønfort G, Nilsson N, Haas M, Evans R L, Goldsmith C H, Assendelft W J J, Bouter L M.

However, even daily opioids may fail to provide sustained relief [Joel R. SAPER, Alvin E. Lake III, Philip A. Bain, Mark J. Stillman, John F. Rothrock, Ninan T. Mathew, Robert L.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">It is possible to use drugs other than narcotics in an attempt to dissociate the neural pathways associated with pain production from pathways involving the perception of pain. One such drug is ketamine, which is very commonly used as a dissociative anesthetic, especially in veterinary medicine. At certain doses, ketamine produces euphoria and is therefore consumed by drug abusers. When used to treat depression, ketamine produces effects much more quickly than conventional antidepressant medication [Nancy A. Melville.

No. 13/024,727, entitled “Non-invasive methods and devices for inducing euphoria in a patient and their therapeutic application,” which is hereby incorporated by reference. The neuronal mechanisms underlying the effects of ketamine and the disclosed VNS methods appear to be similar, which leads to the present invention that uses the disclosed VNS stimulation to treat migraine. Because the disclosed VNS method has no known side-effects, it may be more suitable than the use of ketamine and related compounds to treat migraine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">Ketamine is a glutamate receptor antagonist. NICOLODI et al. claim that ketamine (as well as the NMDA receptor antagonist gapapentin) can cure chronic migraine by causing it to revert to episodic migraine [NICOLODI M, Sicuteri F. Negative modulators of excitatory amino acids in episodic and chronic migraine: preventing and reverting chronic migraine. Special lecture 7th INWIN Congress. Int J Clin Pharmacol Res. 18(2, 1998): 93-100]. Evidence has also been presented that ketamine can stop migraine aura, at least in patients with familial hemiplegic migraine [KAUBE H, Herzog J, Käufer T, Dichgans M, Diener H C. Aura in some patients with familial hem iplegic migraine can be stopped by intranasal ketamine. Neurology 55(1, 2000): 139-41]. Several other glutamate receptor antagonist drugs are under active development for the treatment of migraine [MONTEITH T S, Goadsby P J. Acute migraine therapy: new drugs and new approaches. Curr Treat Options Neurol. 2011 (1, 2011):1-14]. Some of the mechanisms by which glutamate receptor agonists inhibit migraine headaches involve the colocalization of glutamate with 5-HT(1B/1D/1F) receptors in trigeminal ganglia, as well as the effects of glutamate receptor agonists on the diameter of arteries that are involved in migraine pain [MA Q P. Co-localization of 5-HT(1B/1D/1F) receptors and glutamate in trigeminal ganglia in rats. Neuroreport 12(8, 2001):1589-1591; CHAN K Y, Gupta S, de Vries R, Danser A H, Villalón C M, Muñoz-Islas E, Maassenvandenbrink A. Effects of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists on rat dural artery diameter in an intravital microscopy model. Br J Pharmacol. 160 (6, 2010):1316-25]. Furthermore, inherited forms of migraine susceptibility involve a sequence variant on chromosome 8q22.1, which is flanked by two genes involved in glutamate homeostasis, leading to the view that disruption of glutamate metabolism is a primary cause of migraine, and that treatment of migraine should address that cause.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, glutamate receptor antagonist effects, brought about by nerve stimulation, comprise the following. The glutamate receptor, which is ordinarily found on the surface of a post-synaptic cell, has an ion channel that only opens when the following two conditions are met simultaneously: glutamate is bound to the receptor, and the postsynaptic cell is depolarized (which removes Mg2+ blocking the channel). To antagonize glutamate receptors, a stimulated nerve may (1) block/inhibit the synthesis or release of the neurotransmitter glutamate from a pre-synaptic cell; (2) maintain a post-synaptic cell in a hyperpolarized state; (3) directly or indirectly modulate activity of the receptor via control of endogenous modulators such as glutathione, lipoic acid, H+, K+, and 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptors; and (4) a combination of these effects. The invention contemplates that different glutamate receptors (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate) may be modulated by such nerve stimulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">Pathways relating Applicant's vagal nerve stimulation method to its observed effects in migraineurs, including rapid dissociation of the perception of pain from the production of pain (relief within seconds to minutes through a euphoria-like mechanism) are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Pathways relating to the relief of sinus congestion and related symptoms, involving for example direct or indirect inhibition of the superior salivatory nucleus parasympathetic pathway, are also shown. It is understood that the pathways shown there are a simplification of the actual mechanisms, that not all of the pathways may participate equally, that pathways not shown may also participate, and that future investigations may require that the pathways be modified. The arrows indicate the direction of information flow, some of which are bi-directional.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">Beginning in the right middle side of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the vagus nerve is stimulated, and the resulting signal is sent towards the brain. Vagal afferents traverse the brainstem in the solitary tract, with some eighty percent of the terminating synapses being located in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). The NTS projects to a wide variety of structures, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, including the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens, and the hypothalamus [JEAN A. The nucleus tractus solitarius: neuroanatomic, neurochemical and functional aspects. Arch Int Physiol Biochim Biophys 1991; 99(5):A3-A52]. The NTS also projects to the parabrachial nucleus, which in turn projects to the hypothalamus, the thalamus, the amygdala, the anterior insular, and infralimbic cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex, and other cortical regions (only the thalamus projection is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, from which the perception of pain may reach the cortex). Other pathways from the NTS to many of the other structures shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are multi-synaptic [M. CASTLE, E. Comoli and A. D. Loewy. Autonomic brainstem nuclei are linked to the hippocampus. Neuroscience 134 (2005) 657-669]. Through its direct or indirect projection to the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens, the NTS gains access to amygdala-hippocampus-entorhinal cortex pathways of the limbic system. The disclosed method of vagal nerve stimulation uses parameters (intensity, pulse-width, frequency, duty cycle, etc.) that activate the limbic system via the amygdala and nucleus accumbens or other routes [Jeong-Ho CHAE, Ziad Nahas, Mikhail Lomarev, Stewart Denslow, Jeffrey P. Lorberbaum, Daryl E. Bohning, Mark S. George. A review of functional neuroimaging studies of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Journal of Psychiatric Research 37 (2003) 443-455; G. C. Albert, C. M. Cook, F. S. Prato, A. W. Thomas. Deep brain stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation and transcranial stimulation: An overview of stimulation parameters and neurotransmitter release. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 33 (2009) 1042-1060].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">In its most basic conception, the limbic system can be defined by its input from dopaminergic neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain. Those dopamine-producing neurons are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> as <b>81</b>, projecting to the nucleus accumbens, with neurons branching nearby that project to the ventral palladium (VP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In addition, dopamine-producing neurons <b>81</b> project from the VTA to the amygdala and to the hippocampus. The feeling of relief that may be felt by an individual is thought to occur when the VTA floods these dopaminergic neurons <b>81</b> with dopamine, thereby stimulating the nucleus accumbens, VP, PFC, amygdala, and hippocampus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">Feedback from the above-mentioned structures to the VTA determines the magnitude of the dopamine levels, as well as the steady state that obtained before the stimulation. The feedback loops involve neurons that use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their neurotransmitter <b>82</b> as well as neurons that use glutamate as their neurotransmitter <b>83</b>. The GABAminergic neurotransmission is generally inhibitory, while the glutamatergic neurotransmission is generally excitatory. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, glutmatergic neurotransmission <b>83</b> occurs from the amygdala, PFC and hippocampus to the nucleus accumbens, as well as from the thalamus to the PFC. As also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, GABAminergic neurotransmission <b>82</b> occurs from the VTA and VP to the thalamus, from the nucleus accumbens to the VTA and VP, as well as within the VTA, which has the effect of inhibiting dopamine neurotransmission. The mechanism of inhibition is that a GABA-A receptor on the dopaminergic neuron binds to GABA released from a GABAminergic neuron, which inhibits dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, the GABAminergic neuron may contain mu-opioid and/or CB1 cannabinoid receptors on its surface. Mu opioid receptors are presynaptic, and inhibit neurotransmitter release. In particular, they inhibit the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and thereby disinhibit the dopamine pathways, causing more dopamine to be released.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Through such mechanisms, opioids and cannabinoids can indirectly modulate neurotransmission [Janice C. Froehlich. Opioid peptides. Alcohol health and research world. 132-136; Anupama Koneru, Sreemantula Satyanarayana and Shaik Rizwan. Endogenous Opioids: Their Physiological Role and Receptors.

Different types of opioid receptors that modulate neurotransmission are found throughout the brain, but significant ones for present purposes are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in the VTA, nucleus accumbens, VP, parabrachial nucleus, and NTS. Similar receptors for cannabinoids exist throughout the brain (not shown). It is thought that without neuromodulation via the opioid and cannabinoid receptors, the dopaminergic limbic system may generate a feeling of “want”, but with the additional receptor systems, a hedonic feeling of “like” (or relief through euphoria) may be generated [Julie LeMerrier, Jerome A. J. Becker, Katia Befort, and Brigitte L. Kieffer. Reward Processing by the Opioid System in the Brain. Physiol Rev 89 (2009): 1379-1412; Kent C. Berridge and Morten L. Kringelbach.

Neuroscientist 12(6, 2006):500-511].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">Endorphins are endogenous opioid peptides that function as neurotransmitters, and beta-endorphin is released into the brain from hypothalamic neurons. It is also released into the blood from the pituitary gland under the control of the hypothalamus, but because endorphins cannot pass easily through the blood-brain barrier, only the opioids under direct control of the hypothalamus are shown with the solid square (□) that is attached to the hypothalamus in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The raphe nuclei also cause the release endorphins. Thus, through the production of endogenous opioid peptides, the hypothalamus and raphe nuclei can modulate neurotransmission involving opioid receptors that were described above. The hypothalamus also connects bi-directionally to components of the limbic system, through the medial forebrain bundle. Such bidirectional connections are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> to the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and VTA with arrows on both ends. [Pedro RADA, Jessica R. Barsonb Sarah F. Leibowitz, Bartley G. Hoebel. Opioids in the hypothalamus control dopamine and acetylcholine levels in the nucleus accumbens. Brain Research 1312(2010): 1-9].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">According to the foregoing description of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, many pathways collectively bring about the euphoria-like mechanism whereby migraine pain production is dissociated from the perception of migraine pain. From the NTS projections, direct inhibition of the nucleus accumbens and indirect inhibition via the amygdala may lead to a reduced GABAnergic signal from the nucleus accummbens to the VTA and VP. Inhibition of the thalamus via the parabrachial nucleus reduces stimulation of the prefrontal cortex, which in turn results in reduced stimulation of the nucleus accumbens. From the NTS input to the hypothalamus, stimulation may (1) produce endogenous opioids that can further inhibit GABAnergic inhibition through binding to the opioid receptors; and (2) directly stimulate the VTA and inhibit the amygdala and/or nucleus accumbens.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">Such effects would bring about a significant dopaminergic neurotransmission disinhibition in the VTA, which responds by flooding the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, VP, PFC and hippocampus with dopamine along the dopaminergic projections <b>81</b>, giving rise to the dissociation. Continued stimulation of the vagus nerve prevents neurotransmitter equilibrium from being restored, during which time gene expression and other biochemical effects alter the physiology of the nerve cells. When stimulation is terminated, the duration of the subsequent dissociation is a function of the time needed for neuronal changes, such as biochemical effects and gene expression that were altered during the stimulation, to be restored to their former equilibria.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) also connects to structures that were identified above as being involved directly in the pathophysiology of migraine. Those structures include the hypothalamus, periaqueducatal gray, locus ceruleus, and raphe nuclei. They are in turn connected to other structures that are more closely linked to the vascular afferents <b>860</b> and efferents <b>861</b>, which are respectively the trigeminocervical complex and superior salivatory nucleus. The hypothalamus may also regulate activity of the thalamus, periaqueductal gray, locus ceruleus, trigeminocervical complex, and cortical structures via its secretion of orexin and other chemicals. Although the pathways from the NTS are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> to be unidirectional, it is understood that many of them are in fact bi-directional, such that the NTS receives and processes neural information, rather than simply relaying signals from one place to another</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">[JEAN A. The nucleus tractus solitarius: neuroanatomic, neurochemical and functional aspects. Arch Int Physiol Biochim Biophys 1991; 99(5):A3-A52]. The locus ceruleus is responsible for mediating many of the sympathetic effects during stress, including those associated with migraine. The locus ceruleus is activated by stress, and will respond by increasing norepinephrine secretion, which in turn will alter cognitive function through the prefrontal cortex, increase motivation through nucleus accumbens, activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and increase the sympathetic discharge/inhibit parasympathetic tone through the brainstem. Such inhibition of parasympathetic tone will specifically inhibit the parasympathetic pathway via the superior salivatory nucleus, thereby blocking the positive feedback loop that contributes to the maintenance of migraine pain and thereby bringing about a reduction in sinus congestion and related symptoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">The disclosed vagal nerve stimulation may also aid in the prevention of recurrent migraine attacks over a longer period of time, through its effects on the raphe nuclei and locus ceruleus. The raphe nuclei provide extremely widespread serotonergic innervation of the entire cortex, diencephalon, and other brain structures. The NTS projects to multiple raphe nuclei, as do other nuclei of the dorsal medullary vagal complex, but the complexity of NTS-raphe pathways and transmitters is greater than for NTS-locus ceruleus interactions. Thus, the locus ceruleus is the major source of norepinephrine and the raphe of serotonin in most of the brain, and the NTS projects to both of them. Migraine is a disease in which both norepinephrine and serotonin are chronically low, and stimulation of the locus ceruleus and raphe nuclei via the NTS may ameliorate that problem, at a minimum as a prophylactic [Stephen J. Peroutka. Migraine: a chronic sympathetic nervous system disorder. Headache 44(2004): 53-64; E. HAMEL. Serotonin and migraine: biology and clinical implications. Cephalalgia 27 (2007): 1295-1300].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">The disclosed devices and methods may also be used to treat types of headaches that are co-morbid with migraine, or that overlap in symptoms such that a diagnosis of migraine versus the other headache is difficult. One such headache with potentially overlapping symptoms is cluster headache [A O Kaup, N T Mathew, C Levyman, J Kailasam, L A Meadors and S S Villarreal. ‘Side locked’ migraine and trigeminal autonomic cephalgias: evidence for clinical overlap. Cephalalgia 23(2003): 43-49].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">Cluster headache is a relatively rare but very painful disorder affecting males more than females. Its attacks come in clusters typically occurring 6 to 12 weeks at a time, anywhere from one to three times a year. The duration of a cluster headache 15 minutes to 3 hours, often beginning at night shortly after the patient has gone to sleep, and may recur two to six times during the night and into the next day. The pain is localized unilaterally in or around the eye, and almost invariably, cluster headache is accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as lacrimation, eye redness, drooping eyelid, nasal stuffiness, and runny nose [Arne May. Cluster headache: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. Lancet 366(2005): 843-55].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">Anatomical structures identified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in connection with migraine are also involved in cluster headaches, including the trigeminovascular system, but the key site for triggering the pain and controlling the cycling features of the headache is in the posterior hypothalamic grey matter region. The associated autonomic dysregulation might originate centrally in association with the hypothalamic disturbance, or through trigeminal discharge, or through compression of pericarotid sympathetic fibers due to vasodilation or perivascular edema that is evoked by parasympathetic overactivity during attacks [Peter J Goadsby. Pathophysiology of cluster headache: a trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. Lancet Neurology 1(2002): 251-57; Massimo Leone, Gennaro Bussone. Pathophysiology of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. Lancet Neurol 8(2009): 755-64]. Trauma may also be involved in the pathogenesis of cluster headaches [Russell W. Walker. Cluster Headache and Head Trauma: Is There an Association? Current Pain and Headache Reports 11(2007):137-140].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">Inhalation of pure oxygen via a non-rebreathing facial mask is effective at stopping cluster headache attacks, and it is used for treatment in conjunction with migraine treatments, including sumatriptan and oral ergotamine. Because there is highly specific activation of the hypothalamic grey matter in cluster headache, deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the hypothalamus is used to treat refractory cases [A Mauskop. Vagus nerve stimulation relieves chronic refractory migraine and cluster headaches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">Cephalalgia 25(2005):82-96; Robert Levy, Timothy R. Deer, and Jaimie Henderson. Intracranial Neurostimulation for Pain Control: A Review. Pain Physician 13(2010):157-165]. Vagal nerve stimulation has also been used in conjunction with DBS [Angelo Franzini, G. Messina, Massimo Leone, Alberto Proietti Cecchini, Giovanni Broggi and Gennaro Bussone. Feasibility of simultaneous vagal nerve and deep brain stimulation in chronic cluster headache: case report and considerations. Neurol Sci 30 (Suppl 1, 2009):S137-S139]. The present invention differs from other nerve stimulation treatments for cluster headaches in that it may be performed without DBS or invasive nerve stimulation, including using magnetic stimulation, and in that it involves modulation of glutamate or glutamate receptors (e.g., Pathways <b>83</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">The disclosed devices and methods may also be used to treat other disorders that may be co-morbid with migraine, such as anxiety disorders, in which the nervous system may also be hyper-reactive and in which attacks may be triggered by some of the same factors that trigger migraine and asthma attacks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">The annual prevalence of anxiety disorders is eighteen percent in the general population, divided among particular forms of anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia without panic, specific phobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation anxiety disorder) [Ronald C. Kessler, Wai Tat Chiu, Olga Demler, Ellen E. Walters. Prevalence, Severity, and Comorbidity of 12-Month DSM-IV Disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication. Arch Gen Psychiatry 62(2005):617-627].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Compared to individuals without migraine, migraineurs are 3.7 to 6.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with panic disorder, 5.7 times more likely to suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, 5.1 times more likely to suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 2.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with a phobia [H. C. DIENER, M. Küper, and T. Kurth. Migraine-associated risks and co-morbidity. J Neurol (2008) 255:1290-1301; Nathalie Jette, Scott Patten, Jeanne Williams, Werner Becker, Samuel Wiebe.

Headache 41(Supplement s1, 2001): S11-S18].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">The treatment of anxiety disorders is important in and of itself, but it is all the more important in migraineurs because co-morbid anxiety disorder is associated with a progression from episodic migraines to chronic migraines [Todd A. Smitherman, Jeanetta C. Rains, and Donald B. Penzien. Psychiatric Comorbidities and Migraine Chronification. Current Pain and Headache Reports 13(2009):326-331]. It should be noted that anxiety disorders are comorbid with asthma, in addition to migraine, and all three may involve triggers and hypersensitivity [Peter P. Roy-Byrne, Karina W. Davidson, Ronald C. Kessler, et al. Anxiety disorders and comorbid medical illness. General Hospital Psychiatry 30 (2008) 208-225; Naomi M. Simon and Diana Fischmann. The implications of medical and psychiatric comorbidity with panic disorder. J Clin Psychiatry 66(Supplement 4, 2005): 8-15]. Some of the association between migraine and anxiety disorders occurs in individuals who suffer from vertigo, which may be considered to be a special type of disease entity with its own pathophysiology [J M Furman, C D Balaban, R G Jacob, D A Marcus. Migraine-anxiety related dizziness (MARD): a new disorder? J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2005 76: 1-8; Naomi M. Simon and Diana Fischmann. The implications of medical and psychiatric comorbidity with panic disorder. J Clin Psychiatry 66(Supplement 4, 2005): 8-15]. Part of the association between migraine and anxiety disorder may be also due to a common genetic disposition, for example with genes related to serotonin and/or to dopamine being involved [Xenia Gonda, Zoltan Rihmer, Gabriella Juhasz, Terezia Zsombok, Gyorgy Bagdy. High anxiety and migraine are associated with the s allele of the 5HTTLPR gene polymorphism. Psychiatry Research 149 (2007) 261-266; Stephen J. Peroutka, Susan C. Price, Tara L. Wilhoit, and Keith W. Jones. Comorbid Migraine with Aura, Anxiety, and Depression Is Associated with Dopamine D2 Receptor (DRD2) Ncol Alleles. Molecular Medicine 4(1998): 14-21]. More generally though, the association between migraine and anxiety disorder has been attributed to three mechanisms: aberrant serotonergic (5-HT) functioning, medication overuse or drug abuse (e.g., long-term use of “Ecstasy”), and psychological mechanisms (fear of pain, fear of anxiety-related sensations, i.e., anxiety sensitivity, and unwarranted avoidance behaviors) [Todd A. Smitherman, Jeanetta C. Rains, and Donald B. Penzien. Psychiatric Comorbidities and Migraine Chronification. Current Pain and Headache Reports 13(2009):326-331].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">The particular anxiety disorder that is cited as being most consistently associated with migraine is panic disorder, so in what follows, treatment of panic disorder will be specifically discussed, with the understanding that other anxiety disorders may be treated as well. As with migraine, panic disorder occurs preferentially in women, and its prevalence increases in adolescence and decreases with old age. Like migraine, panic disorder attacks are said to be triggered, and as in migraine the most commonly reported antecedent trigger is negative or stressful life events. At the cellular level, the trigger for panic attacks is thought to involve changes in sodium [A. I. Molosh, P. L. Johnson, S. D. Fitz, J. A. DiMicco, J. P. Herman, and A. Shekhar. Changes in central sodium and not osmolarity or lactate induce panic-like responses in a model of panic disorder. Neuropsychopharmacology 35(6, 2010): 1333-1347].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">The neurological pathways that are involved in panic disorder comprise connections between many of the structures shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, namely, the amygdala interacting with the parabrachial nucleus, pariaqueductal gray, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, locus ceruleus, and hypothalamus. Respiratory effects that may be associated with asthma co-morbidity are particularly mediated by signals through the parabrachial nucleus. As with migraine, the panic attack is self-sustaining after being triggered, but the positive feedback loops appear to involve autonomic pathways (e.g., with increased heart rate, blood pressure and respiration) and cognitive recognition (increased fear resulting from recognized increasing fear) to a greater extent than migraine [Peter P Roy-Byrne, Michelle G Craske, Murray B Stein. Panic disorder. Lancet 368(2006): 1023-1032]. Unless a migraine attack is coincident with the panic attack, the trigeminocervical complex and superior salivatory nucleus are not necessarily part of the positive feedback loop.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">Currently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the preferred treatment for panic disorder, on the basis of many positive placebo-controlled, randomized trials supporting the efficacy of six different drugs: fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram. However, patients with migraine are also treated with triptans, and potentially life-threatening Serotonin Syndrome may develop as the result of the combined administration of SSRIs and triptans [Randolph W. Evans. The FDA Alert on Serotonin Syndrome With Combined Use of SSRIs or SNRIs and Triptans: An Analysis of the 29 Case Reports. MedGenMed 9(3, 2007): 48]. Accordingly, there is a need for new anxiety disorders treatments, particularly in individuals with co-morbid migraine. The presently disclosed methods and devices involving vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) are intended as such a treatment. The present invention differs from other VNS treatments for anxiety disorders in that it may be performed non-invasively, including using magnetic stimulation to the vagus nerve, and in that it involves modulation of glutamate or glutamate receptors (e.g., Pathways <b>83</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">As described above, migraine headaches are due in part to hypoactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, as evidenced for example by reduced norepinephrine levels in migraineurs. More generally, in migraine there is an imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in which the former is hypoactive and the latter is hyperactive. Stimulation of the vagus nerve as described herein is intended to restore the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance to a more normal range, for example by activating the locus ceruleus to increase sympathetic discharge and inhibit parasympathetic tone through its connections within the brainstem, or by activating a structure such as the hypothalamus that might restore autonomic balance. Such stimulation may also cause the release of catecholamines (epinephrine and/or norepinephrine) from the adrenal glands and/or from nerve endings that are distributed throughout the body, in which circulation primarily through the carotid artery delivers the catacholamines to the brain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">However, it is understood that the vagus nerve is not the only nerve or tissue that may be stimulated as a countermeasure against sympathetic hypoactivity or sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance. Commonly assigned co-pending patent applications US20070106338, entitled Direct and Indirect Control of Muscle for the Treatment of Pathologies to ERRICO and US20100249873, entitled Direct and Indirect Control of Muscle for the Treatment of Pathologies, to ERRICO, contemplate the electrical stimulation of nerves emanating from a patient's sympathetic nerve chain, as well as stimulation of the nerve plexus of fibers emanating from both the sympathetic nerve chain and the tenth cranial nerve (the vagus nerve), such as the hepatic plexus. U.S. Pat. No. 7,418,292 to SHAFER also relates to electrical stimulation of neurons of the sympathetic nervous system. U.S. Pat. No. 7,877,146, entitled Methods of treating medical conditions by neuromodulation of the sympathetic nervous system, to Rezai et al is concerned with the neuromodulation of the sympathetic nervous system to treat respiratory and pulmonary conditions, but mentions treatment of migraine within a long list of diseases that may be treated. The stimulation of a branch of the greater splanchnic nerve also causes release of catecholamines from the adrenal gland, in addition to direct electrical stimulation of that gland [Xi Guo and Arun R. Wakade. Differential secretion of catecholamines in response to peptidergic and cholinergic transmitters in rat adrenals. Journal of Physiology 475(3, 1994):539-545].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">In such applications involving sympathetic stimulation, the stimulating electrode would ordinarily be implanted invasively, but it is also possible to implant the stimulating electrodes percutaneously [Patent application US20100234907, entitled Splanchnic Nerve Stimulation for Treatment of Obesity, to Dobak]. Considering that the devices and methods disclosed herein are intended for the stimulation of deep nerves, in situations where the introduction of electrodes percutaneously is feasible, the presently disclosed non-invasive devices may work as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">Although the invention herein has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present invention. It is therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative embodiments and that other arrangements may be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</div>
