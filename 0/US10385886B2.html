<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">All patents, patent applications and publications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety in order to more fully describe the state of the art as known to those skilled therein as of the date of the invention described herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Actuators have come a long way since the invention of rotary motors, which set the foundation for robotics and marks the dawn of the age of automation and industrialization. The drastic improvement in performance of hard actuators nowadays is only matched by the large number of emerging soft actuators, which demonstrate functionalities tantamount to or more expansive than that of their hard counterparts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Robots or machines capable of complex movements often require many actuators working in synchrony. Such systems are potentially difficult to control. One way of reducing the complexity in control is to have parallel actuation in the system, where one or a few inputs can result in many outputs working synchronously in a desired way. For hard machines, parallel actuation can be realized through gears and levers in high precision. In soft machines, however, the counter parts of such parallel actuation systems are rare or non-existent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">“Muscle” is the almost universal actuator in animals. In efforts to mimic aspects of the mechanics of (if not the mechanism of action of) biological muscle, a large range of synthetic structures has been explored but none has successfully replicated the essential features of muscle. Muscle has three features that have remained difficult to replicate: muscle i) maintains roughly a constant volume upon contraction; ii) shows a useful compromise between speed of actuation, and force applied during actuation; iii) has mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness and density) that are compatible with the requirements of animals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">McKibben actuators, developed in the 1950s, were examples of muscle-mimetic structures. These actuators comprise a rubber balloon, surrounded by a fiber-reinforcing mesh. On pressurization, the balloon inflates anisotropically (with a motion that reflects the structure and mechanics of the surrounding mesh), and this expansion results in useful motion. The properties of the fiber reinforcement (i.e., the density of the weave, and the strength of the fibers) dictate the strain (typically 25%) and load (typically 80˜130 N/cm<sup>2</sup>) the actuator can produce for a given pressure. McKibben actuators have been used in many practical applications, but suffer from two major disadvantages: 1) their inherit dry friction creates heating (which changes the properties of the actuator) and hysteresis that makes precise positional control difficult; 2) they become stiff and their specific tension decreases (and approaches zero at ˜25% strain) as the actuators shorten.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Soft actuators are important for their ability to contact delicate, soft, and irregularly shaped objects (i.e., humans and animals, fruit, produce), because they distribute forces across the surface of the objects, and because they are fabricated of compliant rather than unyielding materials and structures. They also offer an attractive approach to simplifying controls, since they make it possible—in some circumstances—to substitute the properties (and especially non-linearities such as “snap-through”) of materials and structures for some of the control loops, sensors, and actuators of hard robots.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Pneumatically actuated soft machines are being actively developed, but, as a clan, they have two characteristics that can limit their use in some applications: i) they can burst when over-pressurized, and therefore may be dangerous or unreliable when used outside their specified operational ranges; ii) most increase in volume when pressurized, and thus cannot be used in applications in confined spaces. Thus, there remains a need for new and more effective actuators.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Described herein are soft buckling linear actuators and devices, e.g., soft robotic machines and artificial skeletal muscle systems, comprising the same buckling linear actuators. The buckling linear actuator represents a new class of pneumatically driven, muscle-mimetic actuators, and can be used in machines and robots that model on structures found in anatomy. Soft actuators that are powered pneumatically are conceptually interesting and practical useful alternatives to the hard actuators used in conventional machines and robots, especially when contacting delicate objects (e.g., humans, tissue, and fruit), because they distribute forces across the surface of the objects, and because they are fabricated of compliant rather than unyielding materials and structures. They also offer an attractive approach to simplifying control systems, since they make it possible to substitute the properties of materials for some of the control loops, sensors, and actuators of hard robots.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The soft buckling linear actuator described herein includes a soft and flexible body and utilizes the buckling of one or more bucklable, elastic structural components in the actuators to generate a force, e.g., a linear force, available for actuation. The soft buckling linear actuators described herein may be actuated by deflating or over-inflating one or more cells which are inside the actuator body and structurally linked to the bucklable, elastic structural components to cause the bucklable, elastic structural component to buckle. The shape of the cell is in principle not restricted and any shape or size of the cell is contemplated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The soft buckling linear actuator as described herein has excellent scaling capabilities, allowing easy realization of parallel actuation, e.g., using a single input or multiple inputs such as the input of pressure or vacuum to enable multiple outputs to generate synchronous movements. Thus, the soft actuating device may include a plurality of the soft buckling linear actuators to trigger multiple actuations occurring in parallel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, soft actuators that are pneumatically powered as described herein can be easily fabricated and may provide delicate object-handling capabilities (e.g., in a buckling artificial muscle) and enable sophisticated movement with the simple input of pressure. In certain embodiments, the soft buckling actuator generates forces, e.g. linear forces, as fluid is pumped in and out of the actuator's cell(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">As used herein, “soft actuator” refers to an actuator with at least one portion of its body being soft. As used herein, “soft body” refers to the body of the soft actuator or a portion of the soft actuator that is soft, and may be involved in the actuation movement of the soft actuator. However, the soft actuator or soft body, as used herein, may have one or more portions of its body being hard or may be connected with a hard part or device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">As used herein, “structurally linked” refers to the scenario in which two structural components are connected directly, or indirectly through an additional structural component. As a result, the movement of one of the structurally linked components will result in the movement of the other component(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, buckling artificial muscle (BAM), also referred to as the vacuum-actuated muscle-mimetic pneumatic (VAMP) structures, is one specific example of the soft buckling linear soft actuator described herein. As used herein, buckling artificial muscle (BAM) and vacuum-actuated muscle-mimetic pneumatic (VAMP) structures are used interchangeably.

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0092">In one aspect, a soft buckling linear actuator is described, including: a plurality of substantially parallel bucklable, elastic structural components each having its longest dimension along a first axis; and a plurality of secondary structural components each disposed between and bridging two adjacent bucklable, elastic structural components; wherein every two adjacent the bucklable, elastic structural components and the secondary structural components in-between define a layer comprising a plurality of cells each capable of being connected with a fluid inflation or deflation source; the secondary structural components from two adjacent layers are not aligned along a second axis perpendicular to the first axis; and the secondary structural components are configured not to buckle, the bucklable, elastic structural components are configured to buckle along the second axis to generate a linear force, upon the inflation or deflation of the cells. In certain embodiments, the secondary structural components from two adjacent layers are not aligned along their longest dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0093">As used herein, “horizontal” is an internal reference and indicates that the elastic bucklable elements are arranged in a plane that is arbitrarily defined as “horizontal”. “Horizontal” provides a frame of reference to describe the position of the elastic bucklable elements relative to other elements of the linear actuator, such as the secondary structural elements. As used herein, the phrase “approximately horizontal” refers to the scenario in which two adjacent bucklable, elastic structural components are at 180 degrees, or 165, 170, 175, 176, 178, or 179 degrees or from 165-180 degrees, from 170-180 degrees, or 175-180 degrees. As used herein, the phrase “substantially parallel” refers to the scenario in which two adjacent bucklable, elastic structural components are at 180 degrees, or 165, 170, 175, 176, 178, or 179 degrees or from 165-180 degrees, from 170-180 degrees, or 175-180 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0094">In some embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural component has a high aspect ratio and is configured to buckle upon the deflation or inflation of the cell along an axis about perpendicular to its long dimension (also referred to as “the first axis”) to generate a linear force available for actuation. In some embodiments, the soft buckling linear actuator comprises a plurality of layers each comprising a plurality of cells. The layers include at least two adjacent layers, a first cell layer and a second cell layer. In certain embodiments, the cells in two adjacent rows are not aligned along the direction of the linear force, that is, they are offset. In certain specific embodiments, a secondary structural component of the first layer is positioned above a cell of the second layer and a secondary structural element of the second layer is positioned below a cell of the first layer (see, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0095">As used herein, the term “buckle” refers the phenomenon in which a structural component of the soft actuator bends or collapses when induced by a compressive force on this component. In certain embodiments, “buckling” happens when the fluidic chambers in the soft device are deflated, as deflation (but not limited to) of structures lead to overall or local compression and compressive forces. Thus, a bucklable, elastic structural component is an elastic structural component of the soft actuator that is capable of bending or collapsing under certain circumstances (often under circumstances when the actuator is deflated). In certain embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural components are in the form of pillars, levers, or beams. As used herein, the term “pillar”, “lever”, and “beam” all refer to a structure that has two ends, which, under a compressive force applied across the two ends, can either buckle, or resist a compression and maintain its shape to some extent but will buckle under the pressure. In certain embodiments, those pillars/levers/beams that buckles have higher aspect ratio than those that maintain their shapes, thanks to Euler's buckling formula.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0096">The soft buckling linear actuator's soft body contains a plurality of cells inside the soft body. As used herein, the term “cell” refers to an enclosed space within the soft body of the soft buckling linear actuator. The cells are configured for connection with an external fluid inflation and/or deflation source. The geometry of the cell can take on any form or shape. In some embodiments, the cell is in the form of a rod, slit, triangular prisms, square prisms, spheres, rectangular prisms cylinder or a cylinder of oval cross-section shape. In certain embodiments, other than the connection to the fluid inflation and/or deflation source, the cell is isolated from the outside atmosphere. In some embodiments, the cells are all connected to the same fluid source. In other embodiments, at least two of the cells are connected to different fluid sources so that the two or more cells may be vacuumed/inflated independently by controlling the different fluid sources. In certain embodiments, two or more cells are connected to each other. The soft body or portions thereof define the boundaries, e.g., walls, of the cells. In certain embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural component makes up at least one of the boundaries, e.g., walls, of the cell. In certain embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural component and the secondary structural component (described further below) make up two or more boundaries, e.g., walls, of the cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0097">In some embodiments, the soft actuating device further includes one or more secondary structural components structurally linked to the cell, wherein the secondary structural component does not buckle upon the deflation or inflation of the cell, or is designed not to buckle first. The secondary structural component can be directly attached or adjacent to the cell or connected to one or more additional structural elements which are directly attached or adjacent to the cell. In certain embodiments, the secondary structural component does not buckle when the bucklable, elastic structural component buckles as a result of the deflation or over-inflation of the cell. In certain embodiments, the secondary structural component is made from a non-elastic material or a material that is less elastic than the material of the bucklable, elastic structural component. In other embodiments, the secondary structural component is made from a material the same as or similar to the material of the bucklable, elastic structural component but is thicker and/or shorter and thus is more resistant to pressure. The secondary structural component can be in any form or shape, e.g., (in the case of BAM) a pillar, a beam, or a column (or any polyhedron or smooth 3D shape in general). As a result, when the cell is deflated or over-inflated, the secondary structural component remains in the same position/shape and the bucklable, elastic structural component buckles to generate a linear force for actuation. In certain embodiments, the secondary structural component has a second axis along its long dimension and the bucklable, elastic structural component buckles in a direction parallel to the second axis. In certain embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural component has a first axis along its long dimension perpendicular to the second axis, or substantially perpendicular to the second axis, i.e., about 90 degrees to the second axis (e.g., from 80-90, 85-90, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 or 90 degrees). As used herein, “perpendicular” means two axes are at 90 degree to each other. Non-limiting examples of the angles include 70, 75, and 80, or in any range bounded by any two values of the angles are disclosed herein. While large deviations from 90 degree will hinder the ability of the bucklable component to buckle, variations can be made to enable alterations of the overall geometry from being purely rectangular. For example, for certain applications, one may want to reshape the BAM into a spindle shape to mimic that of a human muscle. In that case, one may deform/curve the vertical wall near the ends of the BAM slightly as well to accommodate the overall shape change. A non-limiting exemplary embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, where the bucklable, elastic structural component <b>111</b> has long aspect ratio and will buckle to generate linear actuation along the direction of a, which is perpendicular to its long axis a′.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0098">When the cell collapses during deflation/over-inflation, the bucklable, elastic structural component is subjected to forces as a result of the cell's collapse and therefore buckles. In certain embodiments, this buckling results in a change in the shape and/or size of the soft actuator's body and generates a force, e.g., a linear force, which can be utilized for actuation. Therefore, as described herein, buckling of the bucklable, elastic structural component can be used as a mechanism for actuation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0099">The force generated is a linear force. In some embodiments, upon the deflation or inflation of the cell, the bucklable, elastic structural component buckles, while the overall structure collapse linearly as a result of the negative pressure applied to the inside of the cell's. As a result of the vacuum of the deflation source, at least a portion of the soft actuator's body to move linearly, thus generating a linear force. The linear force may be a contracting force, or an expansion force (if a pressure is applied instead).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0100">The bucklable, elastic structural component is structurally linked to the cell. Thus, the bucklable, elastic structural component can be directly attached or adjacent to the cell (e.g., the bucklable, elastic structural component is one of the walls of the cell), or the bucklable, elastic structural component is connected to one or more additional structural elements which are directly attached or adjacent to the cell. Thus, when the cell collapses or is over-inflated to generate a pressure, the additional structural element transfers the pressure to the bucklable, elastic structural component and causes it to buckle to generate a motion. The additional structural element may be made from a material which is not bucklable or less bucklable than the bucklable, elastic structural component. Alternatively, the additional structural element can be thicker and/or shorter than the bucklable, elastic structural component and thus will not buckle or will not buckle first. In some embodiments, the structural element may be made from one or more elastomer. Any elastomer known in the art may be used. In some embodiments, some structural elements may be made from hard materials. Any rigid materials known in the art may be used, as long as they can establish mechanical connection with the soft material used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0101">The soft buckling linear actuator further includes one or more secondary structural components structurally linked to the cell, wherein the secondary structural component does not buckle upon the deflation or inflation of the cell, or is designed not to buckle first. The secondary structural component can be directly attached or adjacent to the cell or connected to one or more additional structural elements which are directly attached or adjacent to the cell. In certain embodiments, the secondary structural component does not buckle when the bucklable, elastic structural component buckles as a result of the deflation or over-inflation of the cell. In certain embodiments, the secondary structural component is made from a non-elastic material or a material that is less elastic than the material of the bucklable, elastic structural component. In other embodiments, the secondary structural component is made from a material the same as or similar to the material of the bucklable, elastic structural component but is thicker and/or shorter and thus is more resistant to pressure. The secondary structural component can be in any form or shape, e.g., a pillar, a lever, or a column. As a result, when the cell is deflated or over-inflated, the secondary structural component does not buckle, and the bucklable, elastic structural component buckles to generate a force for actuation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0102">In some embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural component has a high aspect ratio. As used herein, aspect ratio refers to the ratios of the long dimension to the short dimension of an object or particles. An aspect ratio of more than one is generally referred to as high aspect ratios. In certain embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structure component has an aspect ratio of more than 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 10:1, or 20:1, or in the range denoted by any two values described herein. Other suitable high aspect ratios are contemplated. In certain embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structure component with a high aspect ratio may buckle in the direction perpendicular to its long dimension (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>). In other embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structure component with a high aspect ratio may buckle in the direction about 90 degrees (e.g., from 80-90, 85-90, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 or 90 degrees) to its long dimension.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0103">A non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the soft buckling linear actuator is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a soft buckling linear actuator <b>101</b> has pattern including bucklable, elastic structural components, e.g., long, thin (1.5 mm) horizontal beams <b>102</b>, bridged by secondary structural components, e.g., thick (4 mm) vertical walls <b>103</b>. The details of fabrication are summarized in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> below. Horizontal beams <b>102</b> are substantially parallel to one another and bridged by vertical beams <b>103</b>, which define a plurality of cells <b>104</b>. The plurality of cells <b>104</b> are connected to tube <b>107</b>, connectable to a pneumatic/vacuum input. The two adjacent beams <b>102</b> and respective bridging beams <b>103</b> together a structural layer, e.g., layer <b>105</b> or <b>106</b>. When a pneumatic/vacuum input is applied to the soft buckling linear actuator via tube <b>107</b>, the horizontal walls <b>102</b> buckle reversibly into serpentine shapes, and these buckling actions results in a large change in the vertical length of the structure (˜40%), but a negligible change in its horizontal width. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> also shows the 3D view (left), the front view (middle; along plane A′), and the cross-section view (right; along plane B′) of the soft buckling actuator <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0104"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the schematics of a soft buckling linear actuator during actuation, i.e., the unactuated state <b>109</b> and the actuated state <b>109</b>′. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, parallel bucklable, elastic structural components <b>111</b> (disposed along its longest dimension a′, i.e., horizontally) and the secondary structural components <b>113</b> (disposed along an axis a which is perpendicular to the axis a′) form the walls of cells <b>115</b>. In certain embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural components <b>111</b> have high aspect ratios. The secondary structural components <b>113</b> may be thicker and/or short than <b>111</b>. Note that in this example, the cells <b>115</b>′ and <b>115</b>″ from two adjacent cell layers <b>117</b>′ and <b>117</b>″, respectively, are not aligned horizontally: the secondary structural component <b>113</b> of the first layer <b>117</b>″ is positioned above the cell <b>115</b>′ of the second layer <b>117</b>″ and the secondary structural element <b>113</b>′ of the second layer <b>117</b>″ is positioned below the cell <b>115</b>″ of the first layer <b>117</b>″. As a result, the soft body as a whole contracts linearly. Specifically, when vacuum is applied to tube <b>119</b> (which is connected to the cells <b>115</b>, <b>115</b>′, and <b>115</b>″), these cells collapse and thus the bucklable, elastic structural components <b>111</b> will buckle preferentially. The bucklable, elastic structural component <b>111</b> buckles and moves along axis a (which is about perpendicular to its long dimension) linearly while the soft actuator body contracts linearly. The secondary structural components <b>113</b> do not buckle or do not buckle first.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0105"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows a soft buckling linear actuator <b>121</b> lifting a weight <b>129</b> (Scale bars are 1 cm). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a soft buckling linear actuator <b>121</b> has a soft body <b>122</b>. The soft body <b>122</b> has parallelly disposed, bucklable, elastic structural components <b>123</b> and the secondary structural components <b>124</b>, which form the walls of cells <b>125</b>. The bucklable, elastic structural components <b>123</b> have high aspect ratios and a long dimension a′. The bucklable, elastic structural components <b>123</b>, not the thicker and shorter secondary structural components <b>124</b>, will buckle preferentially upon the deflation of cell <b>125</b>. The bucklable, elastic structural component <b>123</b> buckles and moves along axis a (which is about perpendicular to its long dimension a′ and parallel to the long axis of the secondary structural component <b>124</b>) linearly and forces the soft actuator body to contract linearly, thus lifting a weight <b>129</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0106">In other embodiments, upon the over-inflation of the cell (e.g., a slit), the bucklable, elastic structural component buckles linearly, i.e., expands linearly, as a result of the pressure of the cell's changed shape. The movement, i.e., linear buckling, of the bucklable, elastic structural component forces at least a portion of the soft actuator's body to expand linearly, thus generating a linear expanding force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0107">Buckling of materials is often considered an undesired behavior as it often results in permanent altered states of the materials that degrade their original functions. The reversible buckling of elastomeric materials as described herein, however, is free of such problems, and enables the development of a new class of actuators that utilize buckling for actuations as described herein. Thus, in some embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural component buckles upon the deflation of the cell and returns to its un-buckled state upon re-inflation of the cell. In other embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural component is configured to buckle upon the over-inflation of the cell, which generates a pressure above the atmosphere pressure and returns to its original position/state when the over-inflated cell is deflated. The bucklable, elastic structural component can be in any form or shape. In some specific embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural component is in the form of a pillar, a lever, or a column. In general, the bucklable, elastic structural component can have a variety of different shapes. For example, any shape that has two ends to which a compressive force can be applied and possibly collapse the structure, such as: a banana shape, a star shape (pick any two ends), a diamond shape with a hole in the middle, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0108">Any known elastic material can be used to make the bucklable, elastic structural component. In some embodiments, the material for making the bucklable, elastic structural component is an elastic polymer. Any elastic polymer known in the art can be used. Non-limiting examples of the elastic polymer include natural rubber, silicone rubbers, polyurethane rubbers, isoprene rubber, butadiene rubber, butyl rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, nitrile rubber, ethylene propylene rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, polyacrylic rubber, fluorosilicone rubber, fluoroelastomers, perfluoroelastomers, polyether block amides, chlorosulfonated polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate, thermoplastic elastomers, proteins resilin and elastin, polysulfide rubber, elastolefin, etc. In some embodiments, the material to make the bucklable, elastic structural component is Ecoflex, Stratasys PolyJet 3D printed soft material, Elastosil, PDMS, or another material that is elastic and airtight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0109">The external fluid inflation or deflation source can be any apparatus that inflates and/or deflates the fluid. Non-limiting examples of the fluid inflation or deflation sources include a gas pump, a gas vacuum, a gas pump and vacuum, a liquid pump, a liquid-suction pump, or a liquid pump and suction pump. In some embodiments, the one or more cells are connected directly to the fluid inflation/deflation source or via a fluid chamber. The use of any fluid, gas or liquid, is contemplated, including air, gas, water, oil, liquid metal. A non-limiting example of the gas is air. In some specific embodiments, the one or more cells are connected to a gas chamber, which may be connected to the gas inflation/deflation source. In other embodiments, the cell is connected to the gas inflation/deflation source directly. The use of other gases is contemplated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0110">In certain embodiments, the fluid is gas and the fluid inflation/deflation source is a gas inflation/vacuum source. The external gas inflation source may be a pump, gas cylinder or balloon. The external vacuum source may be a vacuum pump. Any other gas inflation source and vacuum source known in the art are contemplated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0111">Thus, in some embodiments, an external deflation source, e.g., vacuum source, is used to induce a negative pressure within the cell, which allows the atmospheric pressure to apply an isotropic compressive force. Pneumatic actuation using air has the additional advantages, e.g., that the air it uses is widely available, safe to operate, transfers quickly through tubing (due to its low viscosity), lightweight, and easily controlled and monitored by regulators, valves, and sensors. In some embodiments, the cells are sealed so that it is topologically closed except for the entrance into the inflation/deflation device or the common air chamber. By connecting the cells and attaching a gas channel, e.g., a tube, to the inflation/deflation device, the cells inside the soft actuator body can be inflated and deflated through pumping air and applying vacuum. In other embodiments, an external inflation source may be used to induce a positive pressure within the cell (a gas cylinder which pumps gas into a cell), which allows the cell to expand to generate a force to cause the bucklable, elastic structural component to un-buckle (pressure reverses motion).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0112">In some embodiments, the soft buckling linear actuator comprises more than one cell connected to each other and to the fluid inflation or deflation source but otherwise isolated from the outside atmosphere. In certain embodiments, the cells are connected to the same external fluid inflation or deflation source. In other embodiments, the cells are connected to different external fluid inflation or deflation source and can be inflated or deflated (and thus actuated) independent of each other. Thus, the cells can be separate from one another, providing more degrees of freedom of actuation. For example, in certain specific embodiments, two soft buckling linear actuators (each with connected cells) can be glued (e.g., with elastomer) side-to-side, thus providing two separately controllable actuating units.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0113">In another aspect, a soft actuating device comprising a plurality of the soft buckling linear actuator of any one of the embodiments described herein or any combination of the embodiments described herein is described. The cells can be connected to the same external fluid or vacuum source, or at least two of the soft buckling linear actuators are connected to different external fluid or vacuum sources capable of being activated independently. As a result, parallel or independent actuation is achieved.</div>

In short, the soft buckling linear actuators are functionally equal to natural muscles. In some embodiments, the soft buckling linear actuators are anchored to artificial skeletons that are humanoid or animal like, and actuated to generate a contraction which moves the skeleton in a biomimetic way. Non-limiting examples of application include: artificial arms that lift, artificial legs that walk, artificial hands that grasp, etc. Movements in structures that consists of the soft buckling linear actuators and hard “skeletons” are not limited to natural occurring structures in animals; more generally the motions may include, but are not limited to: translational motions, pivoting and rotating motions, gripping and releasing motions, opening and closing motions, contraction and extension motions, a compound motion that is a combination of some of the above mentioned motions, etc.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0126">As described herein, we explored buckling in elastomers—usually considered a mechanism of failure in structures—as a mechanism to achieve complex, reversible, and nonlinear motions. In certain embodiments, the structures described herein (vacuum-actuated muscle-mimetic pneumatic (VAMP) structures) are based on a new mechanism for actuation, in which the muscle-mimetic characteristics of this motion come from applying negative pressure (vacuum) to the structure, and in which this motion derives from the cooperative collapse (that is, buckling) of a set of elastomeric beams or pillars. In certain embodiments, we describe the design of VAMPs that generate linear motions with strain up to 45%, and tensions up to at least 6.5 N/cm<sup>2</sup>, both of which are similar to those of human muscle (typical strain of 20%, and maximum up to ˜40%; maximum sustained tension of 10 N/cm<sup>2</sup>, and maximum impulsive tension of 35N/cm<sup>2</sup>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0127">In certain embodiments, the actuators described herein are based on an elastomeric slab with holes that are sealed with an elastomeric membrane. The holes are interconnected by—ultimately to an external pneumatic port—small channels that allow them to be evacuated. This design allows ambient pressure to be applied isotropically to the device on evacuation. These structures can be considered as an ensemble of elastomeric beams or pillars. The application of vacuum causes the reversible, cooperative buckling of these pillars, and results in motion of the actuator. This design converts pressure-volume work (done when applying negative pressure) into mechanical work (here, for example, lifting a weight as the slab changes shape).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0128">In certain embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural component has an axis along its long dimension and buckles in a direction perpendicular to the axis, or about 90 degrees to the axis (e.g., from 80-90, 85-90, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 or 90 degrees). In other embodiments, the bucklable, elastic structural component has an axis along its long dimension and buckles in a direction at any angle to the axis. This may be accomplished by disposing the bucklable, elastic structural component at an angle other than 90 degree relative to the long axis of the secondary structural components.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0133">In some embodiments, the soft buckling linear actuator described herein is a buckling artificial muscle. The buckling artificial muscle described is based on a new mechanism for actuation, in which motion comes from applying negative pressure (vacuum) to the structure, and in which this motion derives from the cooperative collapse (that is, buckling) of a set of elastomeric beams or pillars. We refer to these actuators as “buckling artificial muscle” (BAM) or VAMP. As a demonstration, we describe the design of BAMs that generate linear motion with strain up to 45%, and specific tension potentially up to 10 N/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is similar to that of a human muscle (˜30%, 10˜15N/cm<sup>2</sup>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0134">In certain embodiments, the system developed herein to operate BAMs uses negative pressure for actuation. In certain embodiments, the soft buckling linear actuators, e.g., BAMs, include elastomeric beams or pillars fabricated in an elastomeric solid; the application of vacuum causes the reversible, cooperative buckling of these pillars, and the motion of the actuator. In certain embodiments, the soft buckling linear actuators utilize pressure applied isotropically to the device by evacuating it, e.g., using a network of channels, and coupling the buckling of the pillars to the collapse of structures connecting them under the influence of the atmospheric pressure external to the system. This type of design converts pressure-volume work (done by applying negative pressure) into mechanical work (here, for example, lifting a weight).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0135">Any combination of one or more soft buckling artificial actuators described herein and hard skeletons that generate mammalian-like or novel motions is contemplated.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0141"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows the actuation strain of VAMPs under zero loading stress s(ΔP, σ). As the differential pressure ΔP increases, the VAMPs contract along their long axis, initially approximately linearly. Above a certain value (ΔP<sub>crit</sub>) of ΔP, which depends on the properties of the elastomer, the VAMPs collapse almost completely. For Ecoflex 00-30 (Young's Modulus E=43 kPa), ΔP<sub>crit </sub>is about 1 kPa; for Elastosil M4601 (E=520 kPa), ΔP<sub>crit </sub>is about 10 kPa. This critical differential pressure is proportional to the Young's modulus of the material (for detailed theoretical discussion below). Hence VAMPs made of a material with Young's modulus E≈4 MPa will have a ΔP<sub>crit </sub>of ˜100 kPa (1 atm). A VAMP made of an elastomer with this high stiffness has a projected loading stress of about 60 kPa (or 6 N/cm<sup>2</sup>) at 30% actuation strain, and a loading stress of about 100 kPa (or 10 N/cm<sup>2</sup>) at 0% actuation strain. This scaling rule describes the stiffness of the material from which VAMPs can be fabricated. VAMPs made from materials with E&gt;4 MPa will not actuate fully under atmospheric pressure, but if P<sub>ext </sub>is greater (e.g., in undersea applications), much greater forces could be generated, using stiffer elastomers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0142"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows the actuation strain s(ΔP,σ) of VAMPs made from two different elastomers as a function of loading stress σ, while applying a negative pressure greater than ΔP<sub>crit</sub>. The maximum loading stress (a.k.a. specific tension) determines the maximum weight VAMPs fabricated in a given elastomeric material can lift. The specific tension of VAMPs scales linearly with the Young's modulus of the actuator (For detailed theoretical discussions see the SI).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0143"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3B</figref> show that VAMPs with indistinguishable geometrical sizes and shapes (34 mm×28 mm×46.5 mm) support higher maximum loads, as the stiffness of the elastomer they are made from increases. We have experimentally demonstrated up to 65 kPa loading stress with high stiffness materials (Stratasys PolyJet 3D printed soft material with a Young's modulus of E≈2.5 MPa, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0144">Specifically, in certain embodiments, a BAM is shown lifting a much higher weight (500 g; <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). The highest stiffness that atmospheric pressure can actuate is approximately a Young's modulus of E=4 MPa. A BAM made of this stiff material has a projected a loading stress of about 60 kPa (or 6N/cm<sup>2</sup>) at 30% actuation strain, and a loading stress of about 100 kPa (or 10N/cm<sup>2</sup>) at 0% actuation strain. Specific tension is the effective physical pressure that the actuator can generate. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a BAM of the same geometry, but made of Stratasys PolyJet 3D printed soft material (E˜1.6 MPa) lifting an even higher weight (˜2.3 kg plus metal basket). It is, therefore, limited by the maximum differential pressure one can apply between the inside and the outside of the BAM—that is, by the atmospheric pressure (˜100 kPa)—this pressure provides an intrinsic limit to the specific tension that a BAM can provide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">Demonstration of Muscle-Mimetic Actuation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0145">In certain embodiments, when vacuum is applied to the internal cells, the BAM contracts uni-axially in a direction determined by its internal, soft, meta-structure (axis a in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>). This pattern can extend indefinitely, since it is scalable in both the length and the cross-sectional area of the BAM. Increasing the length increases the total displacement of the BAM on actuation, and increasing the cross-sectional area increases the force it generates. In certain embodiments, the BAM as described herein can actuate a human skeleton in a fashion similar to a human bicep. To demonstrate the use of a BAM to mimic the motion of a human bicep, we designed a structure to bend the (artificial) skeleton of an arm, which lifts an external weight (a volleyball in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0146">When vacuum is applied to the internal chambers, the VAMPs contract uniaxially in a direction determined by their internal soft structure (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). This pattern can extend over substantial lengths and areas. Increasing the length increases the total displacement of the VAMPs on actuation, and increasing the cross-sectional area increases the force they generates. Readily accessible geometries provide properties (speed, strain) on actuation that mimic human muscle. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> demonstrates the ability of an artificial skeletal muscle system <b>400</b> including a soft buckling linear actuator (e.g., VAMP <b>401</b>) and man-made skeleton <b>404</b> to mimic the motion of human biceps. Metal wires in rubber tubing <b>403</b> served as tendons to connect the VAMP <b>401</b> to the skeleton <b>404</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the length of the VAMP <b>401</b> decreased by ˜30% on actuation (as shown by time-lapsed photos at 0, 5, and 10 seconds); the resulting movement of the “hand” was about five times the change in length of the VAMP, because of an lever arm ratio of 1:5. We chose this value to resemble that of a human arm (which is around 1:4.9). In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the VAMP is shown to lift a volleyball by time-lapsed photos at 0, 5, and 10 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0147">VAMPs can demonstrate high strain rates by fabricating them to have a wide pneumatic port (for gas transfer), as air friction in the port is the main limiting factor of actuation speed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">Applications in Various Systems and Parallel Actuation of the Soft Buckling Linear Actuators</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0148">In certain embodiments, the soft actuating device includes a plurality of the soft buckling linear actuators. Each unit of the soft buckling linear actuator is capable of individual linear actuation; however, that motion is linked to and in synchrony with the motion of the units in the array. This has been demonstrated in the soft robotic worm (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5B</figref>) and the soft robotic climber (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>), described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0149">The soft buckling linear actuator described herein, e.g., BAMs, can be utilized in a variety of forms of soft robotic devices such as soft robots or artificial limbs. The soft actuating device as described herein may be structures without rigid structures or predominantly formed by soft body's portions. For example, it can mimic the movements of invertebrates that contract their body for locomotion (e.g., earthworms and millipedes), by having multiple BAM units in series. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, BAMs can be stacked in a series to generate more complex functions. Here, a plurality of BAMs is assembled together and actuated in sequence to make a soft robotic worm that generates worm-like peristalsis motion. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows the snapshots of the movement of the soft robot worm at 0, 50, 100, and 150 seconds. Alternatively, the soft actuating device as described herein may include rigid structures or rigid body portions to achieve a variety of functions. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows the schematics of the millipede, which includes a plurality of pneumatic vacuum inputs <b>502</b> and BAM units <b>501</b>. Each BAM unit is connected to a different pneumatic vacuum unit to allow it to be actuated independently. Each BAM unit includes one or more bucklable, elastic structural components, e.g., horizontal walls <b>503</b> (which buckles during actuation), and one or more secondary structural components, e.g., vertical walls <b>504</b> (which are configured not to buckle).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0150">In certain embodiments, the vacuum-operated BAM can be used in conjunction with pressure based soft actuators to realize more complex functions. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a contracting soft buckling linear actuator, e.g., BAM unit (<b>601</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>), is sandwiched between two expanding soft actuators, e.g., pneumatically actuated expanding disks <b>602</b> and <b>603</b>. The three actuation-units are actuated in a particular sequence to generate a soft robotic worm with an inchworm like motion, which enabled the combined system to climb up a tube. Specifically, the expanding actuator acts <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> as feet to cling on to the interior of the tube via expansion upon pneumatic inflation, while the contracting unit <b>601</b> adjusts the distance between the two “feet”, so that the robot can inch forward—a motion similar to that of an inchworm (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows the snapshots of the movement of the soft robotic worm at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 seconds. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows the schematics of the worm, including two expansions rings <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> at either end of the BMA unit <b>601</b>. The two expansion rings 1 and 2 and the BAM unit may each be connected to a separate inflation devices <b>604</b>. The BAM unit has a similar design as the one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0151">BAMs offer a new approach, and a new mechanism for, biomimetic actuation having significant similarity to biological muscle. Their key features are i) no expansion in volume on contraction; ii) moderately rapid actuation (one second for full-scale actuation of the structures shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>; and iii) “cooperativity:” because they use soft materials, and because they are intrinsically compliant, they are (to use the term common in robotics) cooperative, and can be used safely and synergistically with humans; their motion (at least in the systems that we have demonstrated) cannot cause harm. The thermodynamic efficiency of transduction of the pressure-volume work required to actuate them into mechanical (force×distance) work (e.g., lifting a weight) is limited by dissipation of the work required to strain the system into heat in the elastomer, and can be near 100% if made from non-viscoelastic materials. They are sufficiently inexpensive to fabricate that they could be considered for single-use applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0152">The designs that we use in the actuators in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2 and 4</figref> are a small subset of those that can be created through appropriate designs of the patterns of pillars making up the BAM, and through extension of these quasi-two-dimensional structures into three dimensions. The key feature, however, and all of these designs is the constructive use of buckling in an elastomeric material as a feature leading to actuation. Buckling—in rigid structural materials—is usually a mechanism of failure. The ability to exploit buckling to achieve complex, nonlinear motions, reversibly, in elastomers, opens the door to the design of entirely new classes of actuators.</div>

We designed the molds using computer-aided design (CAD) (Solidworks) and fabricated them with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic using a 3D printer (StrataSys Fortus 400 mc; Step <b>701</b>). Curing a silicone-based elastomer (Ecoflex 0030 or Elastosil) (Step <b>702</b>) against the molds at room temperature (3 hours for Ecoflex 0030 and 6 hours for Elastosil) produced two halves of the VAMPs. These two halves were aligned and bonded together by applying uncured elastomer at their interface prior to placing them in an oven and curing at 60° C. for 10 minutes (Step <b>703</b>). A conically shaped piece of the elastomer was bonded to the top of the actuator to provide additional material that allowed tubing (Intramedic polyethylene tubing, ID 0.76 mm) to be securely attached to the structure (Step <b>704</b>). The conical piece was first pierced by a cannula. The tubing was fed through the cannula, which was then removed to leave the tubing imbedded in the VAMP. The tubing was secured through elastic force of the elastomer, which attempts to close the hole occupied now by the tubing.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0156">Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the critical differential pressure (ΔP<sub>crit</sub>ΔP<sub>crit</sub>) is proportional to Young's modulus at zero loading stress. We represent the elastomer using the neo-Hookean model. Assuming the elastomer is incompressible, the model indicates that the stress-strain relation contains a single material constant—the Young's modulus E. Let ΔP be the difference in the pressure between that in the ambient and that inside the actuator. In the absence of the applied load, the differential pressure ΔP relates to the actuation strain s by

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0157">This relation is obtained on the basis of dimensional considerations. The function ƒ(s) is nonlinear in strain, and depends on ratios of various geometric features (but is independent of the size of the features).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0158">When ΔP/E is large, the cells in the actuator collapse, and the actuation strain reaches a plateau. Critical differential pressure ΔP<sub>crit</sub>ΔP<sub>crit </sub>is reached when actuation strain reaches near maximum: s<sub>max</sub>≈0.4.

The samples were stretched at a strain rate of 0.5 mm/s until rupture. The modulus was estimated by linear fitting the stress strain data from 0 to 50% strain. The slope of this fitting was extracted as an estimate for Young's Modulus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0020" num="0000">Speed of Actuation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0165">VAMPs demonstrate moderately rapid actuation. Complete actuation of the structures shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> using a pneumatic pressure line with a 0.75 mm inner diameter and 10 cm in length takes ˜1 second. The actuation speed is limited by the diameter of the pneumatic port, as losses due to sheer friction of the air with the tubing is the main factor limiting the actuation speed. Larger VAMPs with the same size of the pneumatic port will actuate more slowly, as the actuation speed is inversely proportional to volume of air that must be removed. The actuation speed can thus be increased for desired applications with gas transfer pressure lines with greater diameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0021" num="0000">Specifications for the Muscle-Mimetic Demo</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0166">We estimated the force required to lift the lower part of the skeleton (10 kN), the cross sectional dimensions of the VAMP (50 mm×40 mm), and the material (Elastosil) required to generate this force based on equation S5. The VAMP was 240 mm so that the “arm” could achieve the required range of movement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0022" num="0000">Muscle-Mimetic Demo With Greater Speed</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0167">In another embodiment, another muscle-mimetic demo was made with a wider pneumatic port (ID=2 mm), which resulted in much faster actuation. The total time required for the “arm” to change from the unactuated state to the actuate state is under one second. One may use a port of greater diameter to achieve even faster motion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0023" num="0000">Measurement of Thermodynamic Efficiency</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0168">The thermodynamic efficiency of transduction of the pressure-volume work required to actuate VAMPs into doing mechanical (force×distance) work (e.g., lifting a weight) is limited by the work required to compress the elastomer. We estimate the thermodynamic efficiency to be 27% for an actuation strain of 20% at 500 g load for the VAMP shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. This value is comparable to that of a human skeletal muscle (˜40%). The energy stored in the deformed, elastomeric components (which is not converted into useful mechanical work and thus reduces thermodynamic efficiency for a single, unidirectional motion) can be partly recovered during unloading. Therefore a system containing VAMPs can demonstrate greater efficiency over multiple actuation cycles than that measured in a single loading. Similar energy recovery is demonstrated in a number of actuators.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0169">We generated PV hysteresis curves by hydraulic inflation and deflation of the actuators with water (an incompressible fluid) in a 1-gallon liquid container. We fixed a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, PHD 2000) and a pressure sensor (Transducers Direct, TDH31) in an orientation parallel to the surface of the water (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>, which shows the schematic outline of the experiment used to determine the thermodynamic efficiency of operation of a VAMP). Specifically, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows the schematics describing the setup used for testing. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows the PV curves of a VAMP fabricated in Elastosil lifting a 500 g weight. The actuation curve and the return curve are labeled therein. The shaded area E<sub>in </sub>is the fluidic energy input via the syringe pump.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0170">We clamped the actuator so that it was fully submerged in the water in a vertical position. We filled the actuators with water by submerging them and applying a vacuum several times until bubbles would no longer emerge (squeezing the actuators under water also enabled effective removal of air).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0171">Within each test, we switched from deflation to inflation when the actuator had achieved ˜20% contraction. We choose the rate of deflation and inflation to be 0.081 ml/s, which is sufficiently slow to achieve quasi-static conditions. Once the actuator had completed one full cycle and the pressure returned to zero, we deflated it again to assure reproducibility. We repeated this procedure for at least six cycles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0172">Since the fluid used for inflation/deflation (water) is incompressible, we could equate the volume decrease/increase of fluid in the syringe to that of the increase/decrease in the volume of the channels in the VAMPs. The VAMPs required removal of V<sub>o</sub>=16.6 ml V<sub>0</sub>=16.6 ml of water to deflate to its ˜20% actuation, creating a lift of Δh=0.9 mm. Δh=0.9 mm of a test weight while the applied differential pressure ramped up from 0 kPa to 18 kPa. We calculated the efficiency η by dividing “energy out” E<sub>out </sub>by “energy in” E<sub>in</sub>:
<br/>
η=<i>E</i> <sub>out</sub> <i>/E</i> <sub>in</sub>  (S7)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0173">E<sub>out </sub>was obtained by calculating the potential energy gain of lifting the weight (m=500 g was the weight we used, and g is the gravitational constant):
<br/>
<i>E</i> <sub>out</sub> <i>=mgΔh</i>  (S8)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0174">E<sub>in </sub>was obtained by integrating the differential pressure with respect to volume change:
<br/>
<i>E</i> <sub>in</sub>=∫<sub>0</sub> <sup>V</sup> <sup> <sub2>0</sub2> </sup> <i>P</i>(<i>V</i>(<i>dV</i>  (S9)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0175">This value is represented by the area under the PV curve (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). Averaging a total of six runs, we obtained an efficiency of η=27%±0.6%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0024" num="0000">Measurement of Lifetime</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0176">We measured the lifetime of VAMPs fabricated in Elastosil by connecting them to an Arduino controlled/gated pneumatic source. The VAMPs were each fully deflated and then re-inflated to the initial state repeatedly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0177">The VAMPs were actuated at a frequency of 1 Hz, and left running continuously for ˜12 days. This interval resulted in more than 1,000,000 cycles of actuation. We tested the loading stress vs. actuation strain of these three VAMPs, and observed no significant change in the curves (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0178">As described herein, the soft, buckling linear actuators (e.g., the VAMPs) described here offers a new approach for biomimetic actuation that is the nonlinear motion resulting from cooperative, reversible, buckling and collapse of beams fabricated in an elastomeric polymer. In certain embodiments, the features in the functions of VAMPs include i) no expansion in volume on contraction; ii) performance of actuation similar to many human muscles; iii) “cooperativity:” because they use soft materials, and because they are intrinsically compliant, they are (to use the term common in robotics) cooperative, and can be used safely and synergistically with humans; their motion (at least in the systems that we have demonstrated) cannot cause harm; iv) thermodynamic efficiency that is similar to muscle; v) cost of fabricating that is sufficiently low that they could be considered for single-use applications; vi) performance that is reliable even after high numbers of actuation cycles (VAMPs fabricated in Elastosil demonstrated no significant change in performance after a million cycles of actuation. VAMPs have the potential for long lifetime as a result of two choices of designs: 1) the use of a single material allows the actuator to be fabricated as a single piece, and thus to have no seams or regions of concentrated stress; 2) the maximum strain occurring in the elastomers is also moderate in VAMPs and less than those positive pressure systems subjected to larger strain on inflation. Since the lifetime of elastomers in use usually correlates positively with strain, VAMPs will have longer lifetimes than systems that operate at positive pressure and at high strain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0179">The designs of the actuators described herein are a non-limiting, a small subset of those that can be created through appropriate design and segmentation of the patterns of pillars making up the VAMPs, and through extension of these quasi-two-dimensional structures into three dimensions. In certain embodiments, the key feature of these designs is the constructive use of cooperative, reversible buckling in an elastomeric material to achieve actuation. The ability to exploit buckling to achieve complex, nonlinear motions, reversibly, in elastomers, opens the door to entirely new classes of actuators with fundamentally new designs. The ability to mimic muscle, in particular, makes biomimetic designs based closely on the anatomy of animals practical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0180">The foregoing and other features and advantages of various aspects of the invention(s) will be apparent from the following, more-particular description of various concepts and specific embodiments within the broader bounds of the invention(s). Various aspects of the subject matter introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the subject matter is not limited to any particular manner of implementation.
