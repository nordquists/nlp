<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a U.S. National Phase of International Patent Application No. PCT/JP2015/072990, filed Aug. 17, 2015, which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-165622, filed Aug. 18, 2014, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an acid-addition salt of 1-{2-[4-(2-amino-5-chloro-3-pyridinyl)phenoxy]-5-pyrimidinyl}-3-[2-(methylsulfonyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]urea, 1-{2-[4-(2-amino-5-fluoropyridin-3-yl)phenoxy]pyrimidin-5-yl}-3-[2-(pyridin-3-yl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]urea, or 1-(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-(2-(4-(2-amino-5-chloropyridin-3-yl)phenoxy)pyrimidin-5-yl)urea, which exhibits Trk-inhibiting activity and is useful as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic agent for pain, cancer, and the like (hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as “the present compound”), and a crystal thereof, and a pharmaceutical composition thereof.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The tropomyosin receptor kinase (hereinafter abbreviated as “Trk”) family is classified as receptor tyrosine kinases and comprises TrkA which is a high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (hereinafter abbreviated as NGF), TrkB which is a high-affinity receptor of brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin (hereinafter abbreviated as NT)-4/5, and TrkC which is a high-affinity receptor of NT-3. All of the Trk receptors are highly expressed in nerve tissues and are involved in differentiation and maintenance of functions of nerve cells (see Non-Patent Document 1). Meanwhile, it has been known that activation of TrkA in peripheral nerves by NGF initiates hyperalgesia (see Non-Patent Document 2), and based on clinical and non-clinical test results using anti-NGF antibodies or non-clinical test results using low-molecular weight Trk inhibitors, involvement of TrkA has been reported in nociceptive pain of osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, bone fracture, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pancreatitis, neuropathic pain as well as cancer pain combining the both types of pain described above (see Non-Patent Documents 3 to 10). Moreover, the Trk receptors are expressed on cancer cells, such as neuroblastoma, thyroid cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, etc., and a possibility of involvement in proliferation, migration, and metastasis of cancer cells is also reported. Especially, fused genes resulting from fusion of TrkA or TrkC with an MPRIP, CD74, TPM3, TPR, TFG, or ETV6 gene are discovered from a part of patients of thyroid cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, or the like. It is reported that in the cancer having such a fused gene, the Trk kinase is always activated, and a compound having Trk-inhibiting activity inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells. In addition, the Trk receptor is also expressed in inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, eosinophils, etc., immunocompetent cells, such as T cells, B cells, etc., and keratinocytes, and so on, and is reported to be potentially involved in inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, etc., allergic diseases, such as asthma, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and other diseases, such as psoriasis, (see Non-Patent Documents 11 to 15). Therefore, compounds having Trk-inhibiting activity may be possibly applied to therapy of nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain and pain combining the both types of pain, cancer, inflammatory diseases, allergic diseases, psoriasis, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the foregoing, supposing that drugs capable of inhibiting Trk are created, it is expected that Trk-inhibitors may provide new types of prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents for pain and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, Patent Document 1 discloses a method for treating or preventing a disease in a human or other mammal regulated by tyrosine kinase, comprising administering, to a human or other mammal in need thereof, a compound of the following formula (Ia), a salt thereof, an isomer thereof, or a prodrug thereof.</div>

The test tube was placed in a solubility test apparatus (Gilson, Quad-Z 215), and stirring was performed at 37° C. and 700 rpm. A part of the liquid in the test tube was collected after lapsing 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours, respectively. The collected liquid was filtered with a filter, and the filtrate was diluted to 2-fold with acetonitrile. The diluted liquid was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes. A supernatant after centrifugation was used as a sample solution and calculated for solubility by means of high-performance liquid chromatography.</div>

The present compound dissolved in a medium was orally administered (adminstered volume: 5 mL/kg) to male CD(SD)IGS rats (7- to 9-week old, Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc.) shaved on the back. A medium was orally administered (adminstered volume: 5 mL/kg) to the control and normal groups. After 12 or 14 hours of administration, 3 μg/mL of an NGF (Mouse 2.5s, Natural, Invitrogen) solution prepared in 0.1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich)-containing saline was intracutaneously administered (adminstered volume; 50 μL/site) at 3 sites on the back of animals under halothane anesthesia. For the normal group, 0.1% BSA-containing saline was intracutaneously administered (adminstered volume; 50 μL/site) at 3 sites on the back. Immediately after intracutaneous administration, 1% Evans Blue (Tokyo Chemical Industriy Co., Ltd.) dissolved in saline was administered intravenously from tail (adminstered volume: 3 mL/kg). After 10 minutes of administration, the animals were sacrificed by bleeding due to incision of the abdominal aorta. The sites of intracutaneous administration on the back (3 sites) were excised, and the skin samples were respectively transferred to the wells in a 48-well plate (Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.). Formamide (0.8 mL/well) was added to the plate, and the plate was sealed and incubated overnight at 60° C. The formamide extraction solution (200 μL) was transferred to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance (wavelength: 620 nm) of Evans Blue extracted in formamide was measured on an absorbance microplate reader (SpectraMAX 190, Molecular Devices Japan, K.K.). Standard samples of Evans Blue dissolved in formamide (0, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL) were measured at the same time for the absorbance (wavelength: 620 nm), thereby preparing a calibration curve. Based on the calibration curve and the absorbances of the respective samples, the concentrations of Evans Blue in each sample was calculated.

Based on the average values of right and left hind limb weight loads, the right hind limb weight load ratio with respect to the weight load of both hind limbs was calculated according to the following Equation 5. The measurement was carried out in a blind manner. A percent improvement of the present compound was calculated based on the right hind limb weight load ratio of each group at day 24 after induction with MIA according to the following Equation 6, thereby evaluating analgesic effect of the present compound.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0374">As a result, the present compound had a percent improvement equivalent to or higher than that of tramadol (percent improvement: 43%) and morphine (percent improvement: 54%), each of which is commonly used as an analgesic agent. For example, the hydrochloride of Compound (I) had a percent improvement of about 54% (positive control drug: morphine); the di(p-toluenesulfonate) of Compound (II) had a percent improvement of about 53% (positive control drug: morphine); and the methanesulfonate of Compound (III) had a percent improvement of about 61% (positive control drug: tramadol). Accordingly, it was noted that the present compound had an analgesic effect equivalent to or higher than that of tramadol and morphine.</div>
<heading id="h-0177">Pharmacological Experiment Example 5: Anti-Tumor Effect on Human Colon Cancer Cell Line KM12</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0360" num="0375">Using KM12 (ATCC, Inc., Catalogue No. RBC0805) that is a human colon cancer cell line, the anti-tumor effect of the present compound was evaluated. KM12 was plated in DMEM (Life Technologies Corporation, Catalogue No. 11965) containing a 10 volume % inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and a 1 volume % penicillin-streptomycin liquid (Life Technologies Corporation) and subcultured. On the day before the treatment with the present compound, the KM12 was floated using 0.25% Trysin-EDTA, and the KM12 was recovered into a centrifugal tube from the dish. The KM12 was centrifuged at 180 g at room temperature for 3 minutes, and a cell sediment was then suspended in 10 mL of a DMEM medium. A part of the KM12 suspension was collected, the number of cells thereof was counted, and the KM12 was then suspended in a cell density of 5×10<sup>4 </sup>cells/mL in a DMEM medium, thereby preparing a cell suspension. In a 96-well tissue culture plate (Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.), 100 μL/well of the KM12 suspension was plated, and the plate was allowed to stand for 16 hours under conditions at 37° C. in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 95% air. On the day of the treatment with the present compound, 10 mmol/L of the present compound (DMSO solution) was serially diluted with DMSO, thereby preparing solutions of the present compound having a concentration of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μmol/L, respectively. Furthermore, these DMSO solutions were diluted to 100-fold with the medium, thereby preparing media containing the present compound having a concentration of 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, and 1,000 nmol/L, respectively. The medium within the 96-well tissue culture plate in which the KM12 was subjected to static culture for 16 hours was removed by means of decantation. Thereafter, each of the wells was added with the DMEM medium and the above-prepared medium containing the present compound in an amount of 90 and 10 μL/well, respectively (the final concentration of the present compound became 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 nmol/L). Thereafter, the plate was subjected to static culture for 72 hours under conditions at 37° C. in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 95% air. After completion of the static culture, using a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, G7571), a luminescence signal (relative luminescence unit, RLU) of each well was measured by a micro plate reader. An average value of RLU of the three wells of the medium group (group in which the DMSO solution having a concentration of the present compound of zero (0) was treated) was calculated, and a KM12 proliferation rate in each well was calculated according to the following Equation 7.
<br/>
KM12 proliferation rate (%)=(RLU of each well)÷(Average value of RLU of the medium group)×100  [Eq. 7]
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0361" num="0376">Next, with respect to the group treated with the present compound, a KM12 proliferation inhibition rate in each well was calculated according to the following Equation 8.
<br/>
KM12 proliferation inhibition rate (%)=100−(KM12 proliferation rate (%))  [Eq. 8]
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0362" num="0377">As a result, it was noted that the present compound strongly inhibited the proliferation of KM12.</div>
