<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for endovascularly replacing a heart valve. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus for percutaneously replacing a heart valve with a replacement valve using an expandable and retrievable anchor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Heart valve surgery is used to repair or replace diseased heart valves. Valve surgery is an open-heart procedure conducted under general anesthesia. An incision is made through the patient's sternum (sternotomy), and the patient's heart is stopped while blood flow is rerouted through a heart-lung bypass machine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Valve replacement may be indicated when there is a narrowing of the native heart valve, commonly referred to as stenosis, or when the native valve leaks or regurgitates. When replacing the valve, the native valve is excised and replaced with either a biologic or a mechanical valve. Mechanical valves require lifelong anticoagulant medication to prevent blood clot formation, and clicking of the valve often may be heard through the chest. Biologic tissue valves typically do not require such medication. Tissue valves may be obtained from cadavers or may be porcine or bovine, and are commonly attached to synthetic rings that are secured to the patient's heart.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Valve replacement surgery is a highly invasive operation with significant concomitant risk. Risks include bleeding, infection, stroke, heart attack, arrhythmia, renal failure, adverse reactions to the anesthesia medications, as well as sudden death. 2-5% of patients die during surgery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Post-surgery, patients temporarily may be confused due to emboli and other factors associated with the heart-lung machine. The first 2-3 days following surgery are spent in an intensive care unit where heart functions can be closely monitored. The average hospital stay is between 1 to 2 weeks, with several more weeks to months required for complete recovery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, advancements in minimally invasive surgery and interventional cardiology have encouraged some investigators to pursue percutaneous replacement of the aortic heart valve. Percutaneous Valve Technologies (“PVT”) of Fort Lee, N.J., has developed a balloon-expandable stent integrated with a bioprosthetic valve. The stent/valve device is deployed across the native diseased valve to permanently hold the valve open, thereby alleviating a need to excise the native valve and to position the bioprosthetic valve in place of the native valve. PVT's device is designed for delivery in a cardiac catheterization laboratory under local anesthesia using fluoroscopic guidance, thereby avoiding general anesthesia and open-heart surgery. The device was first implanted in a patient in April of 2002.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">PVT's device suffers from several drawbacks. Deployment of PVT's stent is not reversible, and the stent is not retrievable. This is a critical drawback because improper positioning too far up towards the aorta risks blocking the coronary ostia of the patient. Furthermore, a misplaced stent/valve in the other direction (away from the aorta, closer to the ventricle) will impinge on the mitral apparatus and eventually wear through the leaflet as the leaflet continuously rubs against the edge of the stent/valve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Another drawback of the PVT device is its relatively large cross-sectional delivery profile. The PVT system's stent/valve combination is mounted onto a delivery balloon, making retrograde delivery through the aorta challenging. An ante grade transseptal approach may therefore be needed, requiring puncture of the septum and routing through the mitral valve, which significantly increases complexity and risk of the procedure. Very few cardiologists are currently trained in performing a transseptal puncture, which is a challenging procedure by itself.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Other prior art replacement heart valves use self-expanding stents as anchors. In the endovascular aortic valve replacement procedure, accurate placement of aortic valves relative to coronary ostia and the mitral valve is critical. Standard self-expanding systems have very poor accuracy in deployment, however. Often the proximal end of the stent is not released from the delivery system until accurate placement is verified by fluoroscopy, and the stent typically jumps once released. It is therefore often impossible to know where the ends of the stent will be with respect to the native valve, the coronary ostia and the mitral valve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Also, visualization of the way the new valve is functioning prior to final deployment is very desirable. Visualization prior to final and irreversible deployment cannot be done with standard self-expanding systems, however, and the replacement valve is often not fully functional before final deployment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Another drawback of prior art self-expanding replacement heart valve systems is their lack of radial strength. In order for self-expanding systems to be easily delivered through a delivery sheath, the metal needs to flex and bend inside the delivery catheter without being plastically deformed. In arterial stents, this is not a challenge, and there are many commercial arterial stent systems that apply adequate radial force against the vessel wall and yet can collapse to a small enough of a diameter to fit inside a delivery catheter without plastically deforming. However when the stent has a valve fastened inside it, as is the case in aortic valve replacement, the anchoring of the stent to vessel walls is significantly challenged during diastole. The force to hold back arterial pressure and prevent blood from going back inside the ventricle during diastole will be directly transferred to the stent/vessel wall interface. Therefore the amount of radial force required to keep the self expanding stent/valve in contact with the vessel wall and not sliding will be much higher than in stents that do not have valves inside of them. Moreover, a self-expanding stent without sufficient radial force will end up dilating and contracting with each heartbeat, thereby distorting the valve, affecting its function and possibly migrating and dislodging completely. Simply increasing strut thickness of the self-expanding stent is not a practical solution as it runs the risk of larger profile and/or plastic deformation of the self-expanding stent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">U.S. patent application Serial No. 2002/0151970 to Garrison et al. describes a two-piece device for replacement of the aortic valve that is adapted for delivery through a patient's aorta. A stent is percutaneously placed across the native valve, then a replacement valve is positioned within the lumen of the stent. By separating the stent and the valve during delivery, a profile of the device's delivery system may be sufficiently reduced to allow aortic delivery without requiring a transseptal approach. Both the stent and a frame of the replacement valve may be balloon-expandable or self-expanding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">While providing for an aortic approach, devices described in the Garrison patent application suffer from several drawbacks. First, the stent portion of the device is delivered across the native valve as a single piece in a single step, which precludes dynamic repositioning of the stent during delivery. Stent foreshortening or migration during expansion may lead to improper alignment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Additionally, Garrison's stent simply crushes the native valve leaflets against the heart wall and does not engage the leaflets in a manner that would provide positive registration of the device relative to the native position of the valve. This increases an immediate risk of blocking the coronary ostia, as well as a longer-term risk of migration of the device post-implantation. Furtherstill, the stent comprises openings or gaps in which the replacement valve is seated post-delivery. Tissue may protrude through these gaps, thereby increasing a risk of improper seating of the valve within the stent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In view of drawbacks associated with previously known techniques for percutaneously replacing a heart valve, it would be desirable to provide methods and apparatus that overcome those drawbacks.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Anchor <b>30</b> may be actuated using external non-hydraulic or non-pneumatic force to actively foreshorten in order to increase its radial strength. As shown below, the proximal and distal end regions of anchor <b>30</b> may be actuated independently. The anchor and valve may be placed and expanded in order to visualize their location with respect to the native valve and other anatomical features and to visualize operation of the valve. The anchor and valve may thereafter be repositioned and even retrieved into the delivery sheath or catheter. The apparatus may be delivered to the vicinity of the patient's aortic valve in a retrograde approach in a catheter having a diameter no more than 23 french, preferably no more than 21 french, more preferably no more than 19 french, or more preferably no more than 17 french. Upon deployment the anchor and replacement valve capture the native valve leaflets and positively lock to maintain configuration and position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">A deployment tool is used to actuate, reposition, lock and/or retrieve anchor <b>30</b>. In order to avoid delivery of anchor <b>30</b> on a balloon for balloon expansion, a non-hydraulic or non-pneumatic anchor actuator is used. In this embodiment, the actuator is a deployment tool that includes distal region control wires <b>50</b>, control rods or tubes <b>60</b> and proximal region control wires <b>62</b>. Locks <b>40</b> include posts or arms <b>38</b> preferably with male interlocking elements <b>44</b> extending from skirt region <b>34</b> and mating female interlocking elements <b>42</b> in lip region <b>32</b>. Male interlocking elements <b>44</b> have eyelets <b>45</b>. Control wires <b>50</b> pass from a delivery system for apparatus <b>10</b> through female interlocking elements <b>42</b>, through eyelets <b>45</b> of male interlocking elements <b>44</b>, and back through female interlocking elements <b>42</b>, such that a double strand of wire <b>50</b> passes through each female interlocking element <b>42</b> for manipulation by a medical practitioner external to the patient to actuate and control the anchor by changing the anchor's shape. Control wires <b>50</b> may comprise, for example, strands of suture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Tubes <b>60</b> are reversibly coupled to apparatus <b>10</b> and may be used in conjunction with wires <b>50</b> to actuate anchor <b>30</b>, e.g., to foreshorten and lock apparatus <b>10</b> in the fully deployed configuration. Tubes <b>60</b> also facilitate repositioning and retrieval of apparatus <b>10</b>, as described hereinafter. For example, anchor <b>30</b> may be foreshortened and radially expanded by applying a distally directed force on tubes <b>60</b> while proximally retracting wires <b>50</b>. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, control wires <b>62</b> pass through interior lumens <b>61</b> of tubes <b>60</b>. This ensures that tubes <b>60</b> are aligned properly with apparatus <b>10</b> during deployment and foreshortening. Control wires <b>62</b> can also actuate anchor <b>60</b>; proximally directed forces on control wires <b>62</b> contacts the proximal lip region <b>32</b> of anchor <b>30</b>. Wires <b>62</b> also act to couple and decouple tubes <b>60</b> from apparatus <b>10</b>. Wires <b>62</b> may comprise, for example, strands of suture.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2A</figref>, replacement valve <b>20</b> is collapsed within lumen <b>31</b> of anchor <b>30</b>. Retraction of wires <b>50</b> relative to tubes <b>60</b> foreshortens anchor <b>30</b>, which increases the anchor's width while decreasing its length. Such foreshortening also properly seats replacement valve <b>20</b> within lumen <b>31</b> of anchor <b>30</b>. Imposed foreshortening will enhance radial force applied by apparatus <b>10</b> to surrounding tissue over at least a portion of anchor <b>30</b>. In some embodiments, the anchor exerts an outward force on surrounding tissue to engage the tissue in such way to prevent migration of anchor caused by force of blood against closed leaflet during diastole. This anchoring force is preferably 1 to 2 lbs, more preferably 2 to 4 lbs, or more preferably 4 to 10 lbs. In some embodiments, the anchoring force is preferably greater than 1 pound, more preferably greater than 2 pounds, or more preferably greater than 4 pounds. Enhanced radial force of the anchor is also important for enhanced crush resistance of the anchor against the surrounding tissue due to the healing response (fibrosis and contraction of annulus over a longer period of time) or to dynamic changes of pressure and flow at each heart beat In an alternative embodiment, the anchor pattern or braid is designed to have gaps or areas where the native tissue is allowed to protrude through the anchor slightly (not shown) and as the foreshortening is applied, the tissue is trapped in the anchor. This feature would provide additional means to prevent anchor migration and enhance long term stability of the device.</div>

In this manner, a medical practitioner may radially and longitudinally align valve piece <b>600</b>″ with anchor piece <b>550</b>″ by proximally retracting sutures <b>661</b> (as shown by arrows in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>) while distally advancing distal step <b>742</b> of outer tube <b>740</b> against valve piece <b>600</b>″ until tips <b>622</b>″ of the valve piece engage groove section <b>570</b>″ of anchor piece <b>550</b>″. Proximal retraction of outer tube <b>740</b> then causes expandable frame <b>620</b>″ to further expand and form hoop <b>624</b>″ that friction locks with groove section <b>570</b>″ of anchor piece <b>550</b>″, thereby forming apparatus <b>51</b> <b>0</b>″ as described hereinabove with respect to apparatus <b>510</b>. A secondary lock may be achieved by advancing optional suture knots (not shown) to the overlap of eyelets <b>660</b> and knotted loops of suture <b>662</b>. Such optional suture knots preferably are pre-tied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, yet another alternative embodiment of apparatus <b>510</b>′, comprising yet another alternative alignment/locking mechanism <b>650</b>, is described. First portion <b>652</b>″ of alignment/locking mechanism <b>650</b>″ is coupled to anchor piece <b>550</b>″′ of apparatus <b>510</b>″′, while second portion <b>654</b>″ is coupled to valve piece <b>600</b>″′. The first portion comprises male posts <b>670</b> having flared ends <b>671</b>, while the second portion comprises female guides <b>672</b> coupled to tips <b>622</b>″′ of expandable frame <b>620</b>′″ of valve piece <b>600</b>″′.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">Female guides <b>672</b> are translatable about male posts <b>670</b>, but are constrained by flared ends <b>671</b> of the male posts. In this manner, anchor piece <b>550</b>″′ and valve piece <b>600</b>″′ remain coupled and in radial alignment with one another at all times—including delivery—but may be longitudinally separated from one another during delivery. This facilitates percutaneous delivery without requiring a transseptal approach, while mitigating a risk of inadvertent deployment of the anchor and valve pieces in an uncoupled configuration. Additional alignment/locking mechanisms will be apparent in view of the mechanisms described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46-48</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">Prior to implantation of one of the replacement valves described above, it may be desirable to perform a valvoplasty on the diseased valve by inserting a balloon into the valve and expanding it using saline mixed with a contrast agent. In addition to preparing the valve site for implant, fluoroscopic viewing of the valvoplasty will help determine the appropriate size of replacement valve implant to use.</div>
