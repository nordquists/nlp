<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">Touch screen sensors detect the location of an object (e.g. a finger or a stylus) applied to the surface of a touch screen display or the location of an object positioned near the surface of a touch screen display. These sensors detect the location of the object along the surface of the display, e.g. in the plane of a flat rectangular display. Examples of touch screen sensors include capacitive sensors, resistive sensors, and projected capacitive sensors. Such sensors include transparent conductive elements that overlay the display. The elements are combined with electronic components that use electrical signals to probe the elements in order to determine the location of an object near or in contact with the display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In the field of touch screen sensors, there is a need to have improved control over the electrical properties of the transparent touch screen sensors, without compromising optical quality or properties of the display. A transparent conductive region of a typical touch screen sensor includes a continuous coating of a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) such as indium tin oxide (ITO), the coating exhibiting electrical potential gradients based on the location or locations of contact to a voltage source and the overall shape of the region. This fact leads to a constraint on possible touch sensor designs and sensor performance, and necessitates such measures as expensive signal processing electronics or placement of additional electrodes to modify the electrical potential gradients. Thus, there is a need for transparent conductive elements that offer control over electrical potential gradients that is independent of the aforementioned factors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">There is an additional need in the field of touch screen sensors that relates to flexibility in the design of electrically conductive elements. The fabrication of touch screen sensors using patterned transparent conducting oxides (TCO) such as indium tin oxide (ITO) often places limitations on conductor design. The limitations relate to a constraint caused by patterning all of the conductive elements from a transparent sheet conductor that has a single value of isotropic sheet resistance.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Micro-wire electrode configurations for use, for example, in a touch-sensing application. The electrodes comprise continuous micro-wires patterned coincident with an underlying reference mesh, as well as interior regions comprised of discontinuous micro-wires patterned according to a further pattern. The interior regions are rendered discontinuous by, for example, small breaks in the micro-wire conductors. In some embodiments, the further pattern is the same as that of the underlying reference mesh. The patterning of the interior regions may make them less noticeable to users, and discontinuity of the interior regions may make them more pervious to electric fields than other electrically continuous regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a touch screen sensor is described, the touch screen sensor comprising an upper electrode layer comprising an array of composite electrodes comprised of a plurality of continuous micro-wire conductors disposed in a first pattern; a lower electrode layer comprising a plurality of electrodes; wherein the upper and lower electrodes are separated by a dielectric layer, and together define an electrode matrix having nodes where the upper and lower electrodes intersect; wherein the composite electrodes of the upper electrode layer form interior regions electrically isolated from the composite electrodes, the regions comprised of discontinuous micro-wire conductors.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying set of drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration several specific embodiments. It is to be understood that other embodiments are contemplated and may be made without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">All scientific and technical terms used herein have meanings commonly used in the art unless otherwise specified. The definitions provided herein are to facilitate understanding of certain terms used frequently herein and are not meant to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing feature sizes, amounts, and physical properties used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the foregoing specification and attached claims are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by those skilled in the art utilizing the teachings disclosed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The recitation of numerical ranges by endpoints includes all numbers within that range (e.g. 1 to 5 includes 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4, and 5) and any range within that range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” encompass embodiments having plural referents, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term “or” is generally employed in its sense including “and/or” unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, “visible light transparent” refers to the level of transmission being at least 60 percent transmissive to at least one polarization state of visible light, where the percent transmission is normalized to the intensity of the incident, optionally polarized light. It is within the meaning of visible light transparent for an article that transmits at least 60 percent of incident light to include microscopic features (e.g., dots, squares, or lines with minimum dimension, e.g. width, between 0.5 and 10 micrometers, or between 1 and 5 micrometers) that block light locally to less than 80 percent transmission (e.g., 0 percent); however, in such cases, for an approximately equiaxed area including the microscopic feature and measuring 1000 times the minimum dimension of the microscopic feature in width, the average transmittance is greater than 60 percent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The present disclosure relates to touch screen sensors with electrical and optical properties that are engineered through design of conductor micropatterns comprised therein. There are several advantages that are created for touch screen sensors by the incorporation of the conductor micropatterns described herein. In some embodiments, the transparent conductive properties within a transparent conductive region are engineered to control the electrical potential gradient within the touch sensing region during use. This leads to simplicity of signal processing electronics and, for some touch screen sensor types simplicity in the design of (or elimination of the need for) additional conductor patterns that would otherwise be needed for electrical potential gradient (electrical field) linearization. In some embodiments, the electrical properties of the touch screen sensors described herein are designed to generate a controlled electrical potential gradient along a transparent sensor element. E.g., the electrical properties are designed to create a linear electrical potential gradient along a particular direction within a transparent conductive region, the overall shape of which would ordinarily lead to a non-linear gradient if a standard transparent conductor material was used (e.g., continuous ITO coating). In some embodiments, the electrical properties are designed to create a level of non-linearity of electrical potential gradient for a transparent conductive region that is greater than that which would be present within a transparent conductive region of the same shape but comprised of a standard transparent conductor material (e.g., continuous ITO coating). In more detail, for a rectangular capacitive touch screen comprising a contiguous transparent sheet conductor in the form of a micropatterned conductor with electrical connections made to the corners of the sensing area, the linearity of electrical potential gradient (and uniformity of electric field) across the sensing area in the vertical and horizontal directions can be improved by engineering the area distribution of sheet resistance values and anisotropy in such a way as to distribute the field more uniformly. In other embodiments, the sensor includes conductor elements comprised of the same conductor material at the same thickness (i.e., height), but with different effective sheet resistance by virtue of micropatterning. E.g., in some embodiments, the same conductor material at the same thickness (i.e., height) is used to generate conductive traces that define a first micropattern geometry, leading to a first level of sheet resistance in a transparent conductive region, and conductive traces that define a second micropattern geometry, leading to a second level of sheet resistance in a second transparent conductive region. This disclosure also allows for improved efficiency and resource utilization in the manufacture of transparent display sensors, e.g. through the avoidance of rare elements such as indium for some embodiments, e.g. embodiments based on micropatterned metal conductors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The disclosure further relates to contact or proximity sensors for touch input of information or instructions into electronic devices (e.g., computers, cellular telephones, etc.) These sensors are visible light transparent and useful in direct combination with a display, overlaying a display element, and interfaced with a device that drives the display (as a “touch screen” sensor). The sensor element has a sheet like form and includes at least one electrically insulating visible light transparent substrate layer that supports one or more of the following: i) conductive material (e.g., metal) that is mesh patterned onto two different regions of the substrate surface with two different mesh designs so as to generate two regions with different effective sheet resistance values, where at least one of the regions is a transparent conductive region that lies within the touch-sensing area of the sensor; ii) conductive material (e.g., metal) that is patterned onto the surface of the substrate in a mesh geometry so as to generate a transparent conductive region that lies within the touch sensing area of the sensor and that exhibits anisotropic effective sheet resistance; and/or iii) conductive material (e.g., metal) that is patterned onto the surface of the substrate in a mesh geometry within an effectively electrically continuous transparent conductive region, the geometry varying within the region so as to generate different values of local effective sheet resistance in at least one direction (e.g., continuously varying sheet resistance for the transparent conductive region), where the region lies within the sensing area of the touch sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The sensing area of a touch sensor is that region of the sensor that is intended to overlay, or that overlays, a viewable portion of an information display and is visible light transparent in order to allow viewability of the information display. Viewable portion of the information display refers to that portion of an information display that has changeable information content, e.g. the portion of a display “screen” that is occupied by pixels, e.g. the pixels of a liquid crystal display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">This disclosure further relates to touch screen sensors that are of the resistive, capacitive, and projected capacitive types. The visible light transparent conductor micropatterns are particularly useful for projected capacitive touch screen sensors that are integrated with electronic displays. As a component of projected capacitive touch screen sensors, the visible light transparent conductive micropattern are useful for enabling high touch sensitivity, multi-touch detection, and stylus input.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The two or more different levels of sheet resistance, the anisotropy of the sheet resistance, or the varying level of sheet resistance within a transparent conductive region can be controlled by the geometries of two-dimensional meshes that make up the transparent micropatterned conductors, as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">While the present invention is not so limited, an appreciation of various aspects of the invention will be gained through a discussion of the examples provided below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a touch screen sensor <b>100</b>. The touch screen sensor <b>100</b> includes a touch screen panel <b>110</b> having a touch sensing area <b>105</b>. The touch sensing area <b>105</b> is electrically coupled to a touch sensor drive device <b>120</b>. The touch screen panel <b>110</b> is incorporated into a display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a conductive visible light transparent region <b>101</b> that would lie within a touch sensing area of a touch screen panel, e.g., touch sensing area <b>105</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The conductive visible light transparent region <b>101</b> includes a visible light transparent substrate <b>130</b> and an electrically conductive micropattern <b>140</b> disposed on or in the visible light transparent substrate <b>130</b>. The visible light transparent substrate <b>130</b> includes a major surface <b>132</b> and is electrically insulating. The visible light transparent substrate <b>130</b> can be formed of any useful electrically insulating material such as, e.g., glass or polymer. Examples of useful polymers for light transparent substrate <b>130</b> include polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN). The electrically conductive micropattern <b>140</b> can be formed of a plurality of linear metallic features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also illustrates an axis system for use in describing the conductive visible light transparent region <b>101</b> that would lie within a touch sensing area of a touch screen panel. Generally, for display devices, the x and y axes correspond to the width and length of the display and the z axis is typically along the thickness (i.e., height) direction of a display. This convention will be used throughout, unless otherwise stated. In the axis system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the x axis and y axis are defined to be parallel to a major surface <b>132</b> of the visible light transparent substrate <b>130</b> and may correspond to width and length directions of a square or rectangular surface. The z axis is perpendicular to that major surface and is typically along the thickness direction of the visible light transparent substrate <b>130</b>. A width of the plurality of linear metallic features that form the electrically conductive micropattern <b>140</b> correspond to an x-direction distance for the parallel linear metallic features that extend linearly along the y axis and a y-direction distance for the orthogonal linear metallic features correspond to a width of the orthogonal linear metallic features. A thickness or height of the linear metallic features corresponds to a z-direction distance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the conductive visible light transparent region <b>101</b> that would lie within a touch sensing area of a touch screen panel includes two or more layers of visible light transparent substrate <b>130</b> each having a conductive micropattern <b>140</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The conductive micropattern <b>140</b> is deposited on the major surface <b>132</b>. Because the sensor is to be interfaced with a display to form a touch screen display, or touch panel display, the substrate <b>130</b> is visible light transparent and substantially planar. The substrate and the sensor may be substantially planar and flexible. By visible light transparent, what is meant is that information (e.g., text, images, or figures) that is rendered by the display can be viewed through the touch sensor. The viewability and transparency can be achieved for touch sensors including conductors in the form of a deposited metal, even metal that is deposited with thickness great enough to block light, if the metal is deposited in an appropriate micropattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The conductive micropattern <b>140</b> includes at least one visible light transparent conductive region overlaying a viewable portion of the display that renders information. By visible light transparent conductive, what is meant is that the portion of the display can be viewed through the region of conductive micropattern and that the region of micropattern is electrically conductive in the plane of the pattern, or stated differently, along the major surface of the substrate onto which the conductive micropattern is deposited and to which it is adjacent. Preferred conductive micropatterns include regions with two dimensional meshes, e.g. square grids, rectangular (non-square) grids, or regular hexagonal networks, where conductive traces define enclosed open areas within the mesh that are not deposited with conductor that is in electrical contact with the traces of the mesh. The open spaces and associated conductor traces at their edges are referred to herein as cells. Other useful geometries for mesh cells include random cell shapes and irregular polygons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the conductive traces defining the conductive micropattern are designed not to include segments that are approximately straight for a distance greater than the combined edge length of five adjacent cells, preferably four adjacent cells, more preferably three adjacent cells, even more preferably two adjacent cells. Most preferably, the traces defining the micropattern are designed not to include segments that are straight for a distance greater than the edge length of a single cell. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the traces that define the micropattern are not straight over long distances, e.g., 10 centimeters, 1 centimeter, or even 1 millimeter. Patterns with minimal lengths of straight line segments, as just described, are particularly useful for touch screen sensors with the advantage of causing minimal disturbance of display viewability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The two-dimensional geometry of the conductive micropattern (that is, geometry of the pattern in the plane or along the major surface of the substrate) can be designed, with consideration of the optical and electrical properties of the conductor material, to achieve special transparent conductive properties that are useful in touch screen sensors. E.g., whereas a continuous (un-patterned) deposit or coating of conductor material has a sheet resistance that is calculated as its bulk resistivity divided by its thickness, in the present invention different levels of sheet resistance are engineered by micropatterning the conductor as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the two-dimensional conductive micropattern is designed to achieve anisotropic sheet resistance in a conductive region (e.g., a visible light transparent conductive region) of the sensor. By anisotropic sheet resistance, what is meant is that the magnitude of the sheet resistance of the conductive micropattern is different when measured or modeled along two orthogonal directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In contrast, in some embodiments, the two-dimensional conductive micropattern is designed to achieve isotropic sheet resistance in a conductive region (e.g., a visible light transparent conductive region) of the sensor. By isotropic sheet resistance, what is meant is that the magnitude of the sheet resistance of the conductive micropattern is the same when measured or modeled along any two orthogonal directions in the plane, as in the case for a square grid formed with traces of constant width for both directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Anisotropic sheet resistance within a region can include sheet resistance in one direction that is at least 10 percent greater than the sheet resistance in the orthogonal direction, or at least 25 percent greater, at least 50 percent greater, at least 100 percent greater, at least 200 percent greater, at least 500 percent greater, or even at least 10 times greater. In some embodiments, anisotropic sheet resistance within a region includes sheet resistance in one direction that is greater than the sheet resistance in the orthogonal direction by a factor of at least 1.5. In some embodiments, anisotropic sheet resistance within a region includes sheet resistance in one direction that is greater than the sheet resistance in the orthogonal direction by a factor between 1.1 and 10, in other embodiments between 1.25 and 5, and in yet other embodiments between 1.5 and 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">An example of a conductive micropattern geometry that can generate anisotropic sheet resistance is approximately a rectangular microgrid (non-square) with fixed widths for the conductive traces. For such a rectangular microgrid (non-square), anisotropic sheet resistance can result from a repeating geometry for the cells of the grid that includes one edge that is 10 percent longer than the other, 25 percent longer than the other, at least 50 percent longer than the other, 100 percent longer than the other, or even 10 times longer than the other. Anisotropic sheet resistance can be created by varying the width of traces for different directions, e.g. in an otherwise highly symmetrical pattern of cells for a mesh. An example of the latter approach to generating anisotropic sheet resistance is a square grid of conductive traces, e.g. with pitch of 200 micrometers, wherein the traces in a first direction are 10 micrometers wide and the traces in the orthogonal direction are 9 micrometers in width, 7.5 micrometers in width, 5 micrometers in width, or even 1 micrometer in width. Anisotropic sheet resistance within a region can include a finite, measurable sheet resistance in one direction and essentially infinite sheet resistance in the other direction, as would be generated by a pattern of parallel conductive lines. In some embodiments, as described above, the anisotropic sheet resistance within a region includes a finite, measurable sheet resistance in a first direction and a finite, measurable sheet resistance in the direction orthogonal to the first direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">For the purpose of determining whether a region of conductive micropattern is isotropic or anisotropic, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the scale of the region of interest must be reasonably selected, relative to the scale of the micropattern, to make relevant measurements or calculations of properties. E.g., once a conductor is patterned at all, it is trivial for one to select a location and a scale on which to make a measurement that will yield a difference in sheet resistance for different directions of measurement. The following detailed example can make the point more clearly. If one considered a conductor pattern of isotropic geometry in the form of a square grid with 100 micrometer wide conductor traces and 1 millimeter pitch (leading to 900 micrometer by 900 micrometer square openings in the grid), and one made four point probe measurements of sheet resistance within one of the traces along the edge of a square opening with a probe having fixed spacing along the four linearly arranged probes of 25 micrometers (leading to a separation between the two current probes, the outside probes, of 75 micrometers), different levels of sheet resistance will be calculated by the measured values of current and voltage depending on whether the probes were aligned parallel to the trace or orthogonal to the trace. Thus, even though the square grid geometry would yield isotropic sheet resistance on a scale larger than the square grid cell size, it is possible for one to carry out measurements of sheet resistance that would suggest anisotropy. Thus, for the purpose of defining anisotropy of the sheet resistance of a conductive micropattern in the current disclosure, e.g. a visible light transparent conductive region of the micropattern that comprises a mesh, the relevant scale over which the sheet resistance should be measured or modeled is greater than the length scale of a cell in the mesh, preferably greater than the length scale of two cells. In some cases, the sheet resistance is measured or modeled over the length scale of five or more cells in the mesh, to show that the mesh is anisotropic in its sheet resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">In contrast to embodiments where the conductive micropattern exhibits anisotropy of sheet resistance in a region, sensors including transparent conducting oxide thin films (e.g., indium tin oxide, or ITO) exhibit isotropic sheet resistance in contiguous regions of the conductor. In the latter case, one can measure or model that as four-point probe measurements of sheet resistance of a contiguous region are made in different directions and with decreasing spacing between the probes, the same readings of current and voltage for different directions clearly indicate isotropy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the two-dimensional conductive micropattern is designed to achieve different levels, or magnitudes, of sheet resistance in two different patterned conductor regions of the sensor, when measured in a given direction. E.g., with respect to the different levels of sheet resistance, the greater of the two may exceed the lesser by a factor greater than 1.25, a factor greater than 1.5, a factor greater than 2, a factor greater than 5, a factor greater than 10, or even a factor greater than 100. In some embodiments, the greater of the two sheet resistance values exceeds the lesser by a factor between 1.25 and 1000, in other embodiments between 1.25 and 100, in other embodiments between 1.25 and 10, in other embodiments between 2 and 5. For a region to be regarded as having a different sheet resistance from that of another region, it would have a sheet resistance that is greater or lesser than that of the other region by a factor of at least 1.1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the micropattern is designed to achieve the aforementioned different levels of sheet resistance for two patterned conductor regions that are electrically contiguous, which is to say that they are patterned conductor regions that are in electrical contact with each other along a boundary between them. Each of the two patterned conductor regions that share a conductive boundary may have uniform respective pattern geometries, but again different. In some embodiments, the micropattern is designed to achieve the different levels of sheet resistance for two different patterned conductor regions that are electrically noncontiguous, which is to say that the they are patterned conductor regions that share no boundary between them for which the patterned regions are in electrical contact along that boundary. Each of the two patterned conductor regions that share no conductive boundary between them may have uniform respective pattern geometries, but again different. For electrically noncontiguous regions, it is within the scope of the disclosure for them both to make electrical contact in the pattern to the same solid conductor element, e.g. a bus bar or pad. In some embodiments, the micropattern is designed to achieve the different levels of sheet resistance for two regions that are electrically isolated from each other and thus can be addressed independently by electrical signals. Each of the two mesh regions that are electrically isolated may have a uniform pattern geometry, but again different. Finally, in some embodiments, the micropattern is designed to achieve different levels of sheet resistance for two different regions by creating continuously varying sheet resistance from the first region to the second, and example of two regions that are electrically contiguous.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The two dimensional conductive micropatterns that include two regions with different sheet resistance in a measurement direction are useful for designing a visible light transparent conductive region in the sensing area with a preferred level of sheet resistance for that region (e.g., low sheet resistance between 5 and 100 ohms per square), including varying or anisotropic sheet resistance optionally, and designing an electrical element, e.g. a resistor element, as part of the touch screen sensor that may or may not lie within the sensing area, the resistor element comprising a sheet conductor with sheet resistance selected optimally for the resistor function (e.g., higher sheet resistance between 150 and 1000 ohms per square) and possibly in light of other design constraints, e.g. the constraint of minimizing the footprint of the resistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The sheet resistance of the conductive micropattern, in regions and directions with finite sheet resistance that can be measured or modeled, as described above, may fall within the range of 0.01 ohms per square to 1 megaohm per square, or within the range of 0.1 to 1000 ohms per square, or within the range of 1 to 500 ohms per square. In some embodiments, the sheet resistance of the conductive micropattern falls within the range of 1 to 50 ohms per square. In other embodiments, the sheet resistance of the conductive micropattern falls within the range of 5 to 500 ohms per square.

Area fraction that is shadowed by conductor is used interchangeably with the density of lines for a micropatterned conductor.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In general, the deposited electrically conductive material reduces the light transmission of the touch sensor, undesirably. Basically, wherever there is electrically conductive material deposited, the display is shadowed in terms of its viewability by a user. The degree of attenuation caused by the conductor material is proportional to the area fraction of the sensor or region of the sensor that is covered by conductor, within the conductor micropattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In general, it is desirable for a transparent touch screen sensor to exhibit a low value of haze. Haze refers to a property related to the scattering of light as it passes through a medium, e.g. as measured by a Haze-Gard instrument (Haze-Gard plus, BYK Gardner, Columbia, Md.). In some embodiments, the touch screen sensor exhibits haze less than 10%, in some embodiments less than 5%, in some embodiments less than 4%, in some embodiments less than 3%, in some embodiments less than 2%. Embodiments are disclosed which achieve a desirable combination of high transmission (also referred to as visible light transmittance), low haze, and low conductor trace visibility for regions including conductor micropatterns. The conductor micropatterns are thus especially useful when used as part of a sensing area or region of a touch screen sensor display, e.g. when the micropattern overlays a viewable region of the display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, in order to generate a visible light transparent display sensor that has uniform light transmission across the viewable display field, even if there is a non-uniform distribution of sheet resistance, e.g. derived from a non-uniform mesh of conductive material, the sensors include isolated conductor deposits added to the conductor micropattern that serve to maintain the uniformity of light transmittance across the pattern. Such isolated conductor deposits are not connected to the drive device (e.g., electrical circuit or computer) for the sensor and thus do not serve an electrical function. For example, a metal conductor micropattern that includes a first region with a mesh of square grid geometry of 3 micrometer line width and 200 micrometer pitch (3% of the area is shadowed by the metal, i.e., 97% open area) and second region with a mesh of square grid geometry of 3 micrometer line width and 300 micrometer pitch (2% of the area is shadowed by the metal, i.e., 98% open area) can be made optically uniform in its average light transmission across the two regions by including within each of the open cells of the 300 micrometer pitch grid region one hundred evenly spaced 3 micrometer by 3 micrometer squares of metal conductor in the pattern. The one hundred 3 micrometer by 3 micrometer squares (900 square micrometers) shadow an additional 1 percent of the area for each 300 micrometer by 300 micrometer cell (90000 square micrometers), thus making the average light transmission of the second region equal to that of the first region. Similar isolated metal features can be added in regions of space between contiguous transparent conductive regions, e.g. contiguous transparent conductive regions that include micropatterned conductors in the form of two dimensional meshes or networks, in order to maintain uniformity of light transmittance across the sensor, including the transparent conductive regions and the region of space between them. In addition to isolated squares of conductor, other useful isolated deposits of conductor for tailoring optical uniformity include circles and lines. The minimum dimension of the electrically isolated deposits (e.g., the edge length of a square feature, the diameter of a circular feature, or the width of a linear feature) is less than 10 micrometers, less than 5 micrometers, less than 2 micrometers, or even less than 1 micrometer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">With respect to the reproducible achievement of useful optical properties (e.g. high transmission and invisibility of conductive pattern elements), using practical manufacturing methods, the minimum dimension of the electrically isolated deposits is preferably between 0.5 and 10 micrometers, more preferably between 0.5 and 5 micrometers, even more preferably between 0.5 and 4 micrometers, even more preferably between 1 and 4 micrometers, and most preferably between 1 and 3 micrometers. In some embodiments, the arrangement of electrically isolated conductor deposits is designed to lack periodicity. A lack of periodicity is preferred for limiting unfavorable visible interactions with the periodic pixel pattern of an underlying display. For an ensemble of electrically isolated conductor deposits to lack periodicity, there need only be a single disruption to the otherwise periodic placement of at least a portion of the deposits, across a region having the deposits and lacking micropattern elements that are connected to decoding or signal generation and/or processing electronics. Such electrically isolated conductor deposits are said to have an aperiodic arrangement, or are said to be an aperiodic arrangement of electrically isolated conductor deposits. In some embodiments, the electrically isolated conductor deposits are designed to lack straight, parallel edges spaced closer than 10 micrometers apart, e.g. as would exist for opposing faces of a square deposit with edge length of 5 micrometers. More preferably the isolated conductor deposits are designed to lack straight, parallel edges spaced closer than 5 micrometers apart, more preferably 4 micrometers apart, even more preferably 3 micrometers apart, even more preferably 2 micrometers apart. Examples of electrically isolated conductor deposits that lack straight, parallel edges are ellipses, circles, pentagons, heptagons, and triangles. The absence within the design of electrically isolated conductor deposits of straight, parallel edges serves to minimize light-diffractive artifacts that could disrupt the viewability of a display that integrates the sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The impact of the conductor micropattern on optical uniformity can be quantified. If the total area of the sensor, and hence the conductor micropattern, that overlays a viewable region of the display is segmented into an array of 1 millimeter by 1 millimeter regions, preferred sensors include conductor micropatterns wherein none of the regions have a shadowed area fraction that differs by greater than 75 percent from the average for all of the regions. More preferably, none have a shadowed area fraction that differs by greater than 50 percent. More preferably, none have a shadowed area fraction that differs by greater than 25 percent. Even more preferably, none have a shadowed area fraction that differs by greater than 10 percent.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The disclosure advantageously allows for the use of metals as the conductive material in a transparent conductive sensor, as opposed to transparent conducting oxides (TCO's), such as ITO. ITO has certain drawbacks, such as corrosion-related degradation in certain constructions, a tendency to crack when flexed, high attenuation of transmitted light (due to reflection and absorption) when deposited as a coating with sheet resistance below 100 to 1000 ohms per square, and increasing cost due to the scarcity of indium. ITO is also difficult to deposit with uniform and reproducible electrical properties, leading to the need for more complex and expensive electronics that couple to the conductive pattern to construct a touch screen sensor.</div>

In many embodiments, the thickness of the conductor is less than one micrometer. A desired thickness for the conductor can be calculated by starting with the desired sheet resistance and considering the micropattern geometry (and in turn its effect on the current-carrying cross-section in the plane) and the bulk resistivity of the conductor, as is known in the art. For complicated geometries of micropattern, there are computational methods in the art, e.g. finite difference methods or finite element methods that can be used to calculate sheet resistance, referred to herein as modeling the properties of a micropattern.

The approach exhibits several technologically important features, including the ability to be carried out for very fine scale patterns (e.g., feature size of one tenth of a micrometer) and with the extension of the patterned monolayer to the patterning of metals, ceramics, and polymers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0108">An exemplary micro-contact printing process is as follows:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0109">1.

For example, substrates can be PET, glass, PEN, TAC, or opaque plastic. As is known in the art, micro-contact printing can be combined with metal deposition processes to yield an additive patterning process (for example, including electroless plating).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0121">In some embodiments, transparent conductive regions with different sheet resistance in at least one direction are created by including selective breaks in conductive traces within an otherwise continuous and uniform mesh. This approach of selective placement of breaks is especially useful for generating articles including patterns of visible transparent conductive regions where the optical transmittance across the article is uniform. The starting mesh can be isotropic or anisotropic. For example, an elongated rectangular transparent conductive bar having a square micromesh can be made to exhibit periodic sheet resistance along its long axis by creating a periodic series of breaks, the breaks being in traces that have a vector component in the direction of the long axis and the periodicity being in the direction of the long axis. This periodicity in sheet resistance can be useful for decoding the position of an object (e.g., a finger) near the rectangular bar. By selecting the width, thickness, and area density of traces, together with the population of breaks, one can design periodic variation in the resistance per unit length along a transparent conductive element characterized by peaks in resistance per unit length that are at least 2 times the minimum in resistance per unit length, preferably at least 5 times their minimum, more preferably at least 10 times their minimum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0122">In other embodiments that include selective breaks in an otherwise continuous and uniform mesh, the breaks can be placed in order to create approximately continuously varying sheet resistance in a given direction. The continuously varying sheet resistance can be useful for amplifying the non-linearity of electric field along a transparent conductive element, beyond that which would be created only by the overall shape of the element. E.g., as is known in the art, a transparent conductive element with uniform sheet resistance, in the form of an elongated isosceles triangle with an electrical potential applied to its base relative to its apex, exhibits non-linear electric field from base to apex due to the gradient in resistance per unit length along the field direction (created by the narrowing width of the triangle). For touch sensors based on interdigitated arrays of such triangular transparent conductive elements, it would be advantageous for the non-linearity in electric field to be even greater, leading to greater signal-to-noise ratio for circuitry used to decode the position of an object (e.g., a finger) near the array. By selecting the width, thickness, and area density of traces, together with the population of breaks, one can design sheet resistance per unit length along a transparent conductive element that increases by a factor of at least 1.1 over a distance of 1 centimeter, or at least 1.2, or at least 1.5, or at least 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0123">In some embodiments, two transparent conductive regions with different sheet resistance in at least one direction are created by including in each of the two regions a contiguous mesh with its own design, each mesh not necessarily including selectively placed breaks. Examples of two meshes with designs that lead to different values of sheet resistance for current passing in a single direction, e.g. the x direction in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, include two meshes with the same thickness (dimension in the z direction in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the same conductive material deposit but with different amounts with current-carrying cross-sectional area (y-z plane in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) per unit width in the y direction. One example of such a pair of mesh regions are two square grid regions each comprising conductive traces of width 2 micrometers but with different pitch, e.g. 100 micrometers and 200 micrometers. Another example of such a pair of mesh regions are two rectangular grid regions (non-square, with 100 micrometer pitch in the one direction and 200 micrometer pitch in the orthogonal direction) each comprising conductive traces of width 2 micrometers but with different orientation, e.g. with the long axes of the rectangular cells in the first regions oriented at 90 degrees with respect to the rectangular cells in the second region.</div>

Accordingly, with thirteen evenly spaced traces <b>244</b> traversing a width (y-axis) of 6 millimeters and thirteen evenly spaced traces <b>242</b> traversing a length (x-axis) of 6 millimeters, the pitch of the square grid of traces is 500 micrometers. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, certain traces have breaks <b>250</b>, measuring approximately 25 micrometers (exaggerated in the figures, for ease in locating). For a square grid with 2 micrometers wide opaque traces on a 500 micrometer pitch, the fill factor for opaque traces is 0.80%, thus leading to an open area of 99.20%. For the same square grid, except with a 25 micrometer break every 500 micrometers, the fill factor is 0.78%, thus leading to an open area of 99.22%. Thus, the design includes 1 mm×6 mm regions with 99.22% open area and 6 mm×6 mm regions with 99.20% open area. The average visible transmittance of the glass article with mesh is approximately 0.92*0.992=91% (with the factor of 0.92 related to interfacial reflection losses in light transmission in the non-conductor-deposited areas of the pattern). Along the horizontal bar direction, there is a series of complete grid regions connected together by four traces of gold. Assuming an effective bulk resistivity of 5E−06 ohm-cm for sputtered thin film gold, each 2 micrometer wide, 500 micrometer long segment of thin film gold has a resistance of approximately 125 ohms. The regions with a completed grid, for current passing in the direction of the bars, have an effective sheet resistance of approximately 115 ohms per square. The four traces connecting the regions with completed grids create approximately 62.5 ohms of resistance between the regions. The above described arrangement of conductive trace elements leads to a spatially varying resistance per unit length along the bar direction as plotted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an equivalent circuit for the array of horizontal mesh bars. The circuit has a series of plates connected by resistors.</div>

The different master tools were based on two different mesh shapes, herein referred to as “Hex” and “Square”. Hex refers to a pattern comprising a network of lines that define enclosed areas having the shape of a regular hexagon. Square refers to a pattern comprising a network of lines that define enclosed areas having the shape of squares. An elastomeric stamp was molded against the master tool by pouring uncured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard™ 184, Dow Corning, Midland Mich.) over the tool to a thickness of approximately 3.0 millimeters. The uncured silicone in contact with the master was degassed by exposing to a vacuum, and then cured for 2 hours at 70° C. After peeling from the master tool, a PDMS stamp was provided with a relief pattern comprising raised features approximately 1.8 micrometers in height. For both hex mesh and square mesh stamps, the raised features were the lines defining the respective mesh geometry, as described above.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0177">A transparent sensor element was fabricated and combined with a touch sensor drive device as generally shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27, 28 and 29</figref> using microcontact printing and etching as described in co-assigned U.S. Provisional application 61/032,273. The device was then integrated with a computer processing unit connected to a display to test the device. The device was able to detect the positions of multiple single and or simultaneous finger touches, which was evidenced graphically on the display. This example used micro-contact printing and etching techniques (see also U.S. Patent App. No. 61/032,273) to form the micro-conductor pattern used in the touch sensor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0179">First Patterned Substrate</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0180">A first visible light substrate made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) having a thickness of 125 micrometers (μm) was vapor coated with 100 nm silver thin film using a thermal evaporative coater to yield a first silver metalized film. The PET was commercially available as product number ST504 from E.I. du Pont de Nemours, Wilmington, Del. The silver was commercially available from Cerac Inc., Milwaukee, Wis. as 99.99% pure 3 mm shot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0181">A first poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamp, referred to as PDMS and commercially available as product number Sylgard 184, Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich., having a thickness of 3 mm, was molded against a 10 cm diameter silicon wafer (sometimes referred to in the industry as a “master”) that had previously been patterned using standard photolithography techniques. The PDMS was cured on the silicon wafer at 65° C. for 2 hours. Thereafter, the PDMS was peeled away from the wafer to yield a first stamp having two different low-density regions with patterns of raised features, a first continuous hexagonal mesh pattern and a second discontinuous hexagonal mesh pattern. That is, the raised features define the edges of edge-sharing hexagons. A discontinuous hexagon is one that contains selective breaks in a line segment. The selective breaks had a length less than 10 μm. The breaks were designed and estimated to be approximately 5 μm. In order to reduce their visibility, it found that, preferably, the breaks should be less than 10 m, more preferably, 5 μm or less, e.g., between 1 and 5 μm. Each raised hexagon outline pattern had a height of 2 um, had 1% to 3% area coverage, corresponding to 97% to 99% open area, and line segments that measured from 2 to 3 μm in width. The first stamp also included raised features defining 500 μm wide traces. The first stamp has a first structured side that has the hexagonal mesh pattern regions and the traces and an opposing second substantially flat side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0182">The stamp was placed, structured side up, in a glass Petri dish containing 2 mm diameter glass beads. Thus, the second, substantially flat side was in direct contact with the glass beads. The beads served to lift the stamp away from the base of the dish, allowing the following ink solution to contact essentially all of the flat side of the stamp. A 10 millimolar ink solution of 1-octadecanethiol (product number C18H3CS, 97%, commercially available from TCI America, Portland Oreg.) in ethanol was pipetted into the Petri dish beneath the stamp. The ink solution was in direct contact with the second substantially flat side of the stamp. After sufficient inking time (e.g., 3 hours) where the ink has diffused into the stamp, the first stamp was removed from the petri dish. The inked stamp was placed, structured side up, onto a working surface. The first silver metalized film was applied using a hand-held roller onto the now inked structured surface of the stamp such that the silver film was in direct contact with the structured surface. The metalized film remained on the inked stamp for 15 seconds. Then the first metalized film was removed from the inked stamp. The removed film was placed for three minutes into a silver etchant solution, which contained (i) 0.030 molar thiourea (product number T8656, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) and (ii) 0.020 molar ferric nitrate (product number 216828, Sigma-Aldrich) in deionized water. After the etching step, the resulting first substrate was rinsed with deionized water and dried with nitrogen gas to yield a first patterned surface. Where the inked stamp made contact with the silver of the first metalized substrate, the silver remained after etching. Thus silver was removed from the locations where contact was not made between the inked stamp and silver film.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0187">Formation of a Projected Capacitive Touch Screen Sensor Element</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0188">The first and second patterned substrates made above were used to produce a two-layer projected capacitive touch screen transparent sensor element as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0189">The first and second patterned substrates were adhered together using Optically Clear Laminating Adhesive <b>8141</b> from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn. to yield a multilayer construction. A handheld roller was used to laminate the two patterned substrates with the regions of the first and second conductive trace regions <b>706</b> and <b>726</b> being adhesive free. The multilayer construction was laminated to a 0.7 mm thick float glass using Optically Clear Laminating Adhesive <b>8141</b> such that the first side of the first substrate was proximate to the float glass. The adhesive free first and second conductive trace regions <b>706</b> and <b>726</b> allowed electrical connection to be made to the first and second patterned substrates <b>700</b> and <b>720</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0190">The integrated circuits used to make mutual capacitance measurements of the transparent sensor element were PIC18F87J10 (Microchip Technology, Chandler, Ariz.), AD7142 (Analog Devices, Norwood, Mass.), and MM74HC154WM (Fairchild Semiconductor, South Portland, Me.). The PIC18F87J10 was the microcontroller for the system. It controlled the selection of sensor bars which MM74HC154WM drives. It also configured the AD7142 to make the appropriate measurements. Use of the system included setting a number of calibration values, as is known in the art. These calibration values can vary from touch screen to touch screen. The system could drive 16 different bars and the AD7142 can measure 12 different bars. The configuration of the AD7142 included selection of the number of channels to convert, how accurately or quickly to take measurements, if an offset in capacitance should be applied, and the connections for the analog to digital converter. The measurement from the AD7142 was a 16 bit value representing the capacitance of the cross point between conductive bars in the matrix of the transparent sensor element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0191">After the AD7142 completed its measurements it signaled the microcontroller, via an interrupt, to tell it to collect the data. The microcontroller then collected the data over the SPI port. After the data was received, the microcontroller incremented the MM74HC154WM to the next drive line and cleared the interrupt in the AD7142 signaling it to take the next set of data. While the sampling from above was constantly running, the microcontroller was also sending the data to a computer with monitor via a serial interface. This serial interface allowed a simple computer program, as are known to those of skill in the art, to render the raw data from the AD7142 and see how the values were changing between a touch and no touch. The computer program rendered different color across the display, depending on the value of the 16 bit value. When the 16 bit value was below a certain value, based on the calibration, the display region was rendered white.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0192">Above that threshold, based on the calibration, the display region was rendered green.

Groups of adjacent conductors may be electrically interconnected to form electrodes of 1 mm to 10 mm total width, for example, using the process described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0199">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-36</figref>, a number of different micro-wire electrode embodiments are described. The micro-wire printing techniques described above afford a great deal of design flexibility to individual electrode patterns. Such design flexibility can enhance performance characteristics. For example, as further described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2010/0026,664, “Touch Sensitive Devices with Composite Electrodes”, it is possible to tailor electrode design to improve a feature referred to as perviousness—that is, the tendency to allow passage of an electric field through an electrode, to capacitively couple with a pointing object, such as a finger. In some arrangements, an upper electrode that is pervious may better allow capacitive coupling between a pointing object (i.e., a finger) and a lower electrode positioned where the upper and lower electrodes cross over one another. This may allow for better signal-to-noise performance of the electrode. However, holes or gaps in an electrode may make them more visually noticeable to a user, which is generally not desirable. Embodiments shown below generally are structured on a reference mesh, and include areas of continuous and discontinuous micro-wire conductors, which may result in both improved electrical performance and consistent visual characteristics that render electrode patterning less noticeable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0200"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> illustrates a portion of a sensor electrode according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The sensor electrode pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> could be employed, for instance, in place of the electrodes illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The sensor electrode of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is built from two coincident micropatterns of cells <b>810</b>, including a first pattern comprised of a first reference mesh of discontinuous micro-wires with first characteristic average cell spacing (<b>810</b> <i>a</i>), and a second pattern adapted from the network of the first pattern, where the second pattern is coincident with the first pattern, and comprises a network of continuous micro-wire structures that form a single electrode <b>817</b> (<b>810</b> <i>b</i>). The electrode includes interior regions <b>815</b> of discontinuous micro-wires that follow a third pattern, which may be the same or similar to the first pattern or the second pattern. (In this <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the first and second and third patterns are the same pattern modeled after the first lattice mesh—repeating squares 45 degrees off axis—but in other embodiments, the first, second, and third patterns may be the same or may be different). Interior regions <b>815</b> have dimensions substantially larger than the first characteristic average cell spacing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0201">The selection of the first, second, and third patterns, is designed to establish a uniform optical property throughout the active area of the sensing device. In one embodiment, the first second and third patterns are all based on the same pattern, that is, the first lattice mesh, as is seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0202">The average cell spacing, along with the width of the patterned micro-wires that form the mesh, determines an average open area of the underlying mesh and an optical density which primarily affects overall sensor properties such as optical transmittance and reflectance. Whether particular local regions of the underlying mesh are conductive (second pattern) or not (first and third patterns) is determined by the patterning of small (and nearly invisible) breaks along the length of the micro-wires. The first pattern, that is, the underlying lattice mesh of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, is built from an array of simple squares whose axes are oriented 45 degrees to the printed page. It will be understood that alternative designs may comprise the lattice mesh patterns seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, including without limitation lattice mesh patterns using triangles, pyramids, trapezoids, parallelograms, hexagons, or other repeating shapes. In some embodiments the cells which make of the array may be polygons with straight sides; in other embodiments the boundaries of the arrayed cells may be curved, convex, or concave. The plurality of cells which make up the array need not be equal in area, although for purposes of optical density, the local average cell spacing is preferably kept uniform throughout the sensing device. In alternative embodiments the principle axes of any of the arrays may be disposed along any arbitrary angle. In some embodiments the first pattern lattice mesh need not be comprised of a regular repeating array of cells, but may be built instead from a random network of metal micro-wires, without any discernable principle axes. It may be preferable that the pseudo-random network of metal wires is still characterized by a local average cell spacing which can establish a uniform optical property. Even a random network of metal micro-wires can be rendered locally conductive or non-conductive by the patterning of the appropriate number of small breaks along the lengths of the wires.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0203">Each of the three patterns is characterized by an average cell spacing. The characteristic cell spacing can vary between 10 microns and 1 millimeter, however for reasons of optical transmittance and pattern visibility the cell spacing in one embodiment is preferably in the range between 100 and 350 microns. The micro-wire conductors can be patterned with widths between 0.2 microns and 10 microns. In one embodiment, the micro-wire widths are less than 3 microns and preferably less than 2 microns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0204">The second pattern illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the electrically continuous pattern which comprises electrode <b>817</b>, is in one embodiment coincident to the mesh of the first pattern. The design of the second pattern establishes the electrical function and circuitry of the electrodes for the touch sensor. The second pattern in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is designed as a continuously conductive electrode oriented vertically, which functions as one of a plurality of upper column electrodes in a sensor electrode array. The pattern shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is one of an upper electrode array, but could also be one of a lower electrode array. In alternative embodiments, a second pattern similar to the second pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> can form an electrode directed along any arbitrary angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0205">The sensor electrode established by the second pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> includes interior regions <b>815</b> according to the third pattern. The interior regions comprise a mesh of discontinuous, or broken, micro-wires, in some embodiments quite similar to or the same as the first pattern. The interior region in one embodiment includes dimensions greater than 350 microns across in any direction. Within interior region formed by the third pattern, the underlying mesh of the first pattern includes breaks along the micro-wires to render the mesh within the gap non-conductive. The interior region is patterned in one embodiment to be coincident with the first pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0206">The interior regions <b>815</b> shown in second pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> represent just two of many more interior regions which can be arranged along the length of the sensor electrode <b>817</b>. For instance one or more of these interior regions may be placed centered over cross-over points associated with lower electrodes, the interior regions having the same pitch as the lower electrode spacing. The presence of a non-conductive interior region or hole within the column electrode of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> increases the capacitive difference signal detected by the sensor when a finger or any grounded object is placed near the intersection of one of the row and column electrodes. The presence of the interior region increases the perviousness of the column electrode to electric fields which emanate from the underlying row electrodes. In one embodiment, the interior region in the second pattern of the column electrode spans a distance equal to at least two mesh cells of the first or the second patterns. In a further embodiment, the interior region in the electrode defined by the third pattern should be at least twice as large as the average cell spacing (or mesh size) of the first pattern or the second pattern in any pattern direction. Commonly, an interior region without any patterned micropattern (that is, a bare hole) within a column electrode as large as 350 microns across would be big enough to be noticeable to the human eye. However, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> the interior region is filled with a continuation of the mesh of the first or second pattern (which as mentioned in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> are the same), to achieve a uniform optical density which renders the interior region virtually invisible to the human eye. In other words, the first pattern may be thought to establish a reference mesh, and the second and third patterns are coincident to this reference mesh. In this fashion interior regions in the electrodes as large as 1 to 5 mm across can be designed into the sensor electrodes with reduced risk of pattern visibility.</div>

The sensor electrode pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30<i>a </i> </figref>could be employed in place of the vertical electrodes illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The sensor electrode of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30<i>a </i> </figref>is built from coincident micropatterns, including a first pattern comprised of a first mesh with first characteristic average cell spacing, and a second pattern adapted from the network of the first pattern, where the second pattern comprises a conductive electrode <b>817</b>B, and a third pattern that comprises interior regions <b>815</b>B in the electrode <b>817</b>B, the interior regions having interior dimensions substantially larger than the first characteristic average cell spacing. The first micropattern illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30<i>a </i> </figref>is the same as the underlying mesh pattern employed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. Any of the alternative mesh patterns described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> can be usefully substituted, including regular hexagonal mesh patterns or random networks of metal micro-wires.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0209">The second pattern in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30<i>a</i> </figref>, which establishes the functional geometry of an upper sensor electrode, is built by rendering conductive a continuous chain of underlying mesh cells to create an electrode which is locally only as wide as a single average cell from the first pattern. The complete sensor electrode in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30<i>a</i> </figref>, however, consists of an intertwined ladder or trellis structure of conductive chains which are all built from the cells of the underlying first pattern. In between the rungs of the ladder or between the vines of the trellis of the second pattern, the underlying mesh of the first pattern is rendered non-conductive by means of small breaks in the micro-wires, to form interior regions <b>815</b>B. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30<i>a</i> </figref>, the third pattern that comprises the interior regions is the same as the first and second patterns. In other embodiments, they may be different. In the particular example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30<i>a</i> </figref>, the conductive cells of the second pattern are laid-out as a connected array or super-structure of larger diamonds, the pattern extending continuously along the vertical axis of the figure. The distance between conductive chains on opposite sides of the diamond is exactly 7 cells from the underlying mesh structure. In a similar fashion to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, therefore, the electrode pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> includes a series of non-conductive interior regions by the conductive traces of the second pattern. These large non-conductive regions increase the perviousness of the sensor electrode illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30<i>a</i> </figref>; the gaps increase the capacitive difference signal detected by the sensor when a grounded object (such as a finger) is placed near the intersection of a row and column electrodes.</div>

In alternative embodiments the conductive traces could be as wide as 2, 3, 4 or more cells in width. Additionally, the conductive traces of the super-structure need not be uniform in width along their length. The conductive chains of a second pattern similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30<i>a </i> </figref>might be comprised of sections whose width incorporates alternately 1, 2, or 3 cells from the underlying mesh. In an alternate embodiment, if the first micropattern is built from a random network of metal micro-wires, then the width of the conductive sections in the superstructure might be characterized by any average fractional number larger than the characteristic average cell spacing. For instance the effective width of a conductive trace might be 1.1 times the average cell spacing, or 1.6 times, or 2.3 times the average cell spacing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0212">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30<i>a</i> </figref>, the micro-wires that form the mesh lattice within the conductive traces of the second pattern super-structure are shown as broken traces. The conductive traces, therefore, have an anisotropic conductive aspect wherein the conductivity in a direction orthogonal to the direction of the conductive traces in the second pattern is very low compared to the conductivity along the length of the conductive trace. In an alternative embodiment, however, all of the micro-wires within the conductive traces can be patterned without breaks, so that the conductivity of the second pattern is maximized and anisotropic.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0222">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>, a touch sensor commonly employs a plurality of electrodes disposed parallel to each other. The capacitive touch response of the sensor, however, is not always uniform with respect to a small object which is passed across and in-between the parallel touch electrodes. Branching elements <b>818</b>, similar to those illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31<i>c</i> </figref>, can be used to fill the space between parallel electrodes and smooth out the sensor response. By employing micro-wire branching elements, which extend outward from and are disposed between the parallel touch electrodes, the sensor response of each electrode can be improved while adding relatively little to the total background capacitance. In some embodiments the micro-wire branching elements from neighboring electrodes can be interleaved or intermingled in the spaces between touch electrodes. This intermingling of touch electrodes ensures that a touch response can be recorded simultaneously from each of two neighboring electrodes regardless of the small size of a touch object. Since touch position is often calculated as an interpolation of capacitance signals from neighboring electrodes, the ability to provide an intermingling of branching elements between parallel electrodes improves the accuracy of reports from the touch sensor.</div>

The second pattern includes an array of super-cells, where each of the super-cells comprises an integer multiple of cells from the first pattern (nine first-pattern cells are included in the super-cell for shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>). The characteristic cell spacing of the second pattern is an integer multiple (greater than or equal to 2) of the first characteristic cell spacing (the multiple is 3 in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>). The micro-wires that define the electrode <b>817</b> <i>d </i>are all patterned without breaks and are continuously conductive. The interior regions of the electrode <b>817</b> <i>d </i>are patterned according to the third pattern (which in this embodiment is the same as the first pattern) and rendered non-conductive by means of breaks along the length of the micro-wires, rendering the interior regions electrically isolated regions.</div>

In an embodiment where the mesh of the first pattern is formed from a pseudo-random network of micro-wires, the second pattern can also be designed as a random network of micro-wires. In this pseudo-random embodiment it is possible for the second characteristic cell spacing to be any distance greater than the first characteristic cell spacing. However, in order to achieve a useful increase in perviousness, it is preferred that the second characteristic cell spacing be at least twice the first characteristic cell spacing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0226">When compared to the simply-connected electrode geometry illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>, the inclusion of interior regions for the upper electrode in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> (and the corresponding interior regions described with respect to other embodiments discussed herein) may present several advantages. The perviousness of the electrode structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is considerably enhanced. For instance, while the underlying mesh in both electrodes may be comprised of cells with a characteristic spacing of 200 microns (a spacing which determines the pervasive optical density of the pattern), the super-structure conductive mesh in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> (the second pattern that forms electrode <b>17</b>D) can have a much larger characteristic cell spacing of 800, 1000, or 1200 microns. The interior regions in-between the conductive traces of the second pattern allow for the penetration of electric fields from the underlying bottom electrode. Proportionally, a larger fraction of the electric field which couples the top and bottom electrodes becomes a fringing field which extends above the sensor where it can usefully interact with a nearby finger or conductive object. The proportion or usefulness of these fringing fields may depend on the ratio of the spacing in the conductive second pattern in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> to either a) the thickness of the dielectric that separates the upper and lower electrodes; orb) the thickness of the covering dielectric that separates the upper electrode from a finger placed upon the sensor. In one embodiment, it may be preferable if the cell spacing of the conductive second pattern be at least ¼ of either or both of the thicknesses defined above, and more preferable if the cell spacing is at least ½ of either or both of those thicknesses. Since the super-structure conductive mesh, in the second pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, allows for cell spacing which is greater than 350 microns, and in some embodiments greater than 600 microns, the superstructure mesh allows for pervious sensor designs with covering dielectrics thicker than 1 millimeter and in some embodiments thicker than 2 millimeters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0227">The embodiments described herein, which include patterned interior regions of the electrode that are electrically isolated from the electrode, make possible electrode structures where the conductive traces of the second pattern cover less than 1 percent of the surface area of the electrode, and in many cases less than 0.5% of the surface area. These small percentages are characteristic of improved perviousness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0228">Embodiments described herein may present another advantage for the performance of projected capacitance sensors. The capacitive difference signal detected by the sensor in the presence of a finger increases with the perviousness of the sensor electrode, and at the same time the absolute capacitive coupling between the finger and the sensor electrode decreases in comparison to a less pervious electrode. Since noise signals, which can disrupt the sensing function, tend to scale with the capacitance between sensor electrode and finger, the pervious nature (or the small relative surface area covered by the metal traces) of the conductive super-structure in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> improves the sensing signal while at the same time reducing the noise susceptibility of the sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0229"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> illustrates a further embodiment. The sensor electrode of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is built from coincident micropatterns, including a first pattern comprised of a first mesh with first characteristic average cell spacing, and a second pattern adapted from the network of the first pattern, where the second pattern comprises a conductive electrode <b>817</b> <i>e</i>, and a third pattern that comprises interior regions <b>810</b> <i>e </i>in the electrode <b>817</b> <i>e</i>, the interior regions having a variety of different sizes and shapes. The micro-wires that define the electrode <b>817</b> <i>e </i>are patterned without breaks and are continuously conductive. The cells of the third pattern which comprise the interior regions of electrode <b>810</b> <i>e </i>are rendered electrically isolated from electrode <b>817</b> <i>e </i>by means of breaks along the length of the micro-wires.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0230">The third pattern, that is, the interior regions <b>815</b> <i>e </i>of electrode <b>817</b> <i>e </i>by contrast to those shown with respect to the electrode configuration shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, are not uniform. Near the left and right edges of the electrode shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the interior regions are four times larger than the cells of the underlying mesh pattern (the first pattern). Near the center axis of electrode <b>817</b> <i>e</i>, the cells of interior regions <b>815</b> <i>e </i>are only twice that of the first pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0231">The second pattern, which comprises the conductive electrode, is characterized by a cell spacing which is not uniform. The conductive electrode illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> was characterized as a super-cell with a fixed and characteristic cell spacing, while by contrast the super-structure cell spacing in electrode <b>817</b> <i>e </i>varies as a function of position. The cell spacing of the continuous mesh located along the left and right edges of electrode <b>817</b> <i>e </i>is larger than the cell spacing found along the central axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0232">The mesh cells that comprise the conductive second pattern in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> are generally isotropic, meaning that the cell dimensions are nearly equal in two orthogonal directions and an integer multiple (greater than or equal to 2) of the cell dimensions from the underlying mesh.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0233">Any of the alternative mesh patterns described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> can be employed in a coincident lattice structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. For instance the second conductive pattern could be comprised of hexagonal cells whose dimensions are a multiple of two or greater than the dimensions of the hexagonal cells from the first pattern. In an embodiment where the mesh of the first pattern is formed from a pseudo-random network of micro-wires, the conductive second pattern and the electrically isolated interior regions thereof can also be designed as a pseudo-random network of micro-wires. In this pseudo-random embodiment the average distance between wires in the conductive second pattern may be at least twice the average characteristic cell spacing of the underlying first pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0234">Along the center axis of electrode <b>817</b> <i>e </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, a conductive trace, or trunk, similar to that of the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31<i>a, b</i>, and <i>c</i> </figref>, has been designed. This conductive trunk is comprised of a chain of connected and conductive mesh cells where the central trunk is only as wide as a single cell from the underlying first pattern or reference mesh structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0235">In one electrical design of a touch sensor, the capacitive difference signal of the touch sensor is proportional to the absolute capacitance between the finger and the sensor electrode. For an electrode such as those illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>, the capacitance between the finger and sensor electrode will increase with the number and density of conductive micro-wires in the second pattern. The design of electrode <b>817</b> <i>e </i>may allow for a variation in capacitance between sensor and object (that is, a finger) as a function of its position along the sensor electrode. An apparent localized center point of the sensor electrode is located at the XX position. The density of the second pattern conductive mesh falls off (or the cell spacing increases) as the object moves away from a vertical line through the XX position to either the left or the right, and the density of the second pattern mesh falls off as one moves away from a horizontal line through the XX position towards either the top or the bottom of the sensor electrode. The density of the superstructure mesh falls off approximately isotropically and radially as a finger is moved away from the center point XX. As a result, the second pattern conductive mesh of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> allows for variation in the capacitive difference signal as a function of local distance from the XX center point of the sensor. This designed variation in sensor response enables the sensor to detect and interpret finger position with much better accuracy when compared to a sensor that does not include a similar distribution or variety of interior regions within the electrode structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0236">In the particular embodiment shown with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the cell spacing of the second pattern that comprises electrode <b>817</b> <i>e </i>varies depending on position between 400 and 1000 microns. The density of the second pattern conductive mesh and the local capacitance vary significantly between points on the sensor that are separated by less than 1 mm. The structure is also compatible with a pitch between neighboring sensor electrodes of 5 to 7 millimeters. Such a structure, with a variation of interior regions, may accommodate position detection of small fingers and position detection of styli with diameters as small as 1 mm, even when these objects which are substantially smaller than the pitch between sensor electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0237">It will be understood that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, and other similar illustrations of electrode designs, illustrates only a portion of a longer sensing electrode. The overall mesh pattern shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> can be repeated at intervals along the whole length of a vertical or column electrode, according to the pitch of the electrodes of the other electrode array, where the electrode is one of a plurality of upper column electrodes in a sensor array. The localized center-point XX of the electrode <b>817</b> <i>e </i>pattern is coincident with the center-point of the intersection of a row and a column electrode. Since the electrode <b>817</b> <i>e </i>pattern repeats along the length of each upper electrode, a plurality of localized center points XX will be found at the intersection of each of the row and column electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0238">The pitch of the sensor electrode center points XX established by the second pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> can be in the range of 200 microns to 10 millimeters. The maximum horizontal width or extent of the upper or column electrode can be any width which is a fraction of the pitch, for instance the electrode width may vary between 20% of the pitch to 98% of the pitch. The width of the intersecting row electrode can be any width which is a fraction of the pitch, for instance the width may vary between 30% of the pitch to 98% of the pitch. Preferably the width of the lower or row electrode would be between 70% and 98% of the pitch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0239"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> illustrates a further embodiment of an electrode configuration. The sensor electrode of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is built from coincident micropatterns, including a first pattern comprised of a first mesh with first characteristic average cell spacing, and a second pattern adapted from the network of the first pattern, where the second pattern comprises conductive electrode <b>817</b> <i>f</i>, and a third pattern that comprises interior regions <b>815</b> <i>f </i>in electrode <b>817</b> <i>f</i>, the interior regions having a variety of different sizes and shapes.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0240">The cell spacings of the second pattern in the electrode shown with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> vary with position along the sensor in a manner which is similar to the electrode shown with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, except that the cell-size variations in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> are not as isotropic as those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. Near the left and right edges of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> the cells of the conductive second pattern are 4 times larger than the cells of the underlying mesh pattern. Near the vertical center line of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the cells of the second pattern are only three times that of the first pattern. The cells that comprise the superstructure second pattern in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> are rectangular. For instance the super-structure cell marked “PP” has a width along the horizontal of four times the cell dimension of the underlying mesh and a height along the vertical of eight times the cell dimension of the underlying mesh.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0241">Any of the alternative mesh patterns described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> can be employed in a coincident lattice structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. An approximately rectangular super-structure cell can still be formed by bounding a collection of underlying hexagonal cells that are approximately four hexagonal cell widths wide and eight hexagonal cell widths tall. In an embodiment where the mesh of the first pattern is formed from a pseudo-random network of micro-wires, the conductive second pattern can also be designed as a pseudo-random network of micro-wires. In this random embodiment the average distance between wires in the conductive second pattern do not need to be equal along two orthogonal directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0242">Along the center line of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, a conductive trunk in the second pattern, similar to those employed in the embodiments described earlier is shown. This conductive trunk is comprised of the outlines of single-wide and neighboring mesh cells along the vertical axis. The lateral micro-wires that comprise the interior regions according to the third pattern of this central column of conductive cells are maintained as broken traces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0243">For the super-structure conductive mesh of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> a variation in capacitance has been provided as a function of position along the sensor electrode. An apparent localized center point of the sensor electrode is located at the QQ position. The density of the super-structure conductive mesh falls off as a pointing object moves horizontally away from a vertical line through the QQ position to either the left or the right. As the finger moves vertically away from a horizontal line through QQ, however, the density of the super-structure mesh changes very little. The density of the superstructure mesh therefore does not have an isotropic variation with distance from the center-point QQ. Instead the super-structure shown in the electrode of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is designed to present a density variation which has mirror symmetry about the vertical centerline.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0244"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> illustrates a further embodiment of an electrode configuration. The sensor electrode of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> is built from two coincident micropatterns, including a first pattern comprised of a first mesh with first characteristic average cell spacing, and a second pattern adapted from the network of the first pattern, where the second pattern comprises a second super-structure mesh with a variety of larger cell spacings. The micro-wires that define the boundaries of the second mesh are all patterned without breaks and are continuously conductive. The cells of the first pattern which lie within the gaps of the second pattern are rendered non-conductive by means of breaks along the length of the micro-wires.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0245">The super-structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> is similar to that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, except that the overall width or extent of the electrode pattern is <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> is more narrow than that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, and the variations in cell spacing in the super-structure are much less pronounced. The super-structure cells that comprise the conductive second pattern are rectangular and the density variation presents a mirror symmetry about the vertical trunk or centerline.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0246">If one measures across the width of the sensor electrode in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> one will note that the super-structure pattern is comprised of six vertical conducting lines, while the pattern in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is comprised of eight vertical conducting lines. As a result, the electrode pattern in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> will have a smaller total capacitance between the upper electrode and the finger. In some applications this reduced capacitance to the finger can result in an improved signal-to-noise ratio for the output of the capacitive sensor. The pattern shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, however, may present an advantage to the sensor manufacturer since an electrode with eight vertical lines along each column presents more redundant paths for the flow of current and may thereby be manufactured with a lower probability of disabling defects due to broken or in-correctly patterned conductive traces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0247">Because of the larger super-structure cell spacings in the conductive mesh of the electrodes shown with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 35</figref>, however, the total capacitance to the finger in the sensor patterns of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 35</figref> is considerably less than what would be achieved if the sensor pattern was built from eight vertically-miming near-neighbor cells of the underlying mesh. As a result, electrodes shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 35</figref> present a greater amount of perviousness and a lower capacitance to the finger than a simply-connected mesh-based electrode structure with similar width.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0248">In a variation of the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, a lateral trellis or extension of conductive cells (the second pattern) can be added which protrudes to the left and right from the vertical traces along the horizontal centerline of each row and column intersection. This lateral extension of the electrode pattern will add somewhat to the total capacitance between the upper electrode and the finger, but it can also provide for a variation in the capacitive difference signal as the finger moves up and down along the length of the sensor electrode. A lateral extension of the conductive cells can therefore improve the accuracy of position reporting while adding relatively little to the overall capacitance between the sensor electrode and the finger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0249">Though embodiments with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-35</figref> have been primarily described in the context of upper electrodes, similar designs and patterning could be used for lower electrodes. In other words, a lower electrode could include interior regions, electrically isolated from the lower electrode, but including patterned microconductors with breaks or branch elements.</div>

The density of the superstructure mesh increases approximately isotropically and radially as a finger is moved away from the center point.
