<heading id="h-0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to heterocyclic organic compounds that may be employed as an electron donor for polymerization catalyst systems, to polymerization catalyst systems employing the heterocyclic organic compounds as an electron donor, to methods of making such polymerization catalyst systems, and to polymerization processes to produce polyolefins, particularly polypropylene, which does not contain a phthalate derivative.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems for polyolefin polymerization are well known in the art. Commonly, these systems are composed of a solid Ziegler-Natta catalyst component and a co-catalyst component, usually an organoaluminum compound. To increase the activity and sterospecificity of the catalyst system for the polymerization of α-olefins, electron donating compounds have been widely used (1) as an internal electron donor in the solid Ziegler-Natta catalyst component and/or (2) as an external electron donor to be used in conjunction with the solid Ziegler-Natta catalyst component and the co-catalyst component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In the utilization of Ziegler-Natta type catalysts for polymerizations involving propylene or other olefins for which isotacticity is a possibility, it may be desirable to utilize an external electron donor, which may or may not be in addition to the use of an internal electron donor. Acceptable external electron donors include organic compounds containing O, Si, N, S, and/or P. Such compounds include organic acids, organic acid esters, organic acid anhydrides, ethers, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, silanes, amides, amines, amine oxides, thiols, various phosphorus acid esters and amides, etc. Preferred external electron donors are organosilicon compounds containing Si—O—C and/or Si—N—C bonds, having silicon as the central atom. Such compounds are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,472,524; 4,473,660; 4,560,671; 4,581,342; 4,657,882; 5,106,807; 5,407,883; 5,684,173; 6,228,961; 6,362,124; 6,552,136; 6,689,849; 7,009,015; 7,244,794; 7,619,049; and 7,790,819, which are incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Common internal electron donor compounds, incorporated in the solid Ziegler-Natta catalyst component during preparation of such component, known in the prior art, include ethers, ketones, amines, alcohols, phenols, phosphines, and silanes. It is well known in the art that polymerization activity, as well as stereoregularity, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the resulting polymer, depend on the molecular structure of the internal electron donor employed. Therefore, in order to improve the polymerization process and the properties of the resulting polymer, there has been an effort and desire to develop various internal electron donors. Examples of such internal electron donor compounds and their use as a component of the catalyst system are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,107,414; 4,186,107; 4,226,963; 4,347,160; 4,382,019; 4,435,550; 4,465,782; 4,522,930; 4,530,912; 4,532,313; 4,560,671; 4,657,882; 5,208,302; 5,902,765; 5,948,872; 6,121,483; 6,436,864, 6,770,586; 7,022,640; 7,049,377; 7,202,314; 7,208,435; 7,223,712; 7,351,778; 7,371,802; 7,491,781; 7,544,748; 7,674,741; 7,674,943; 7,888,437; 7,888,438; 7,964,678; 8,003,558; and 8,003,559, which are incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Most of commercial propylene polymerization catalysts currently used employ alkyl phthalate esters as an internal electron donor. However, certain environmental issues have been recently raised concerning the continued use of phthalate derivatives in human contact applications. As a result, the employment of a phthalate-free propylene polymerization catalyst is now necessary for the production of phthalate-free polypropylene to remedy these issues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 7,491,781 in particular teaches the use of an internal donor in a propylene polymerization catalyst component which does not contain a phthalate derivative. However the resulted propylene polymerization catalyst has poorer hydrogen response and lower isotacticity than the catalyst containing a phthalate derivative.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The polypropylene market also has an increasing demand in high melt flow rate (MFR) grade polypropylene to reduce cycle time and to achieve down-gauging while maintaining acceptable impact strength and stiffness. High MFR polypropylene is commonly achieved by adding peroxide to the polymer, but such obtained polypropylene usually has odor issues and the physical properties are sacrificed somehow. As such, production of reactor-grade high MFR polypropylene becomes necessary to avoid these issues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a continuous need for developing catalyst systems that can be used to produce polyolefins, particularly polypropylene, which does not contain a phthalate derivative. Furthermore, the desirable catalyst systems should also offer capabilities to produce poly-propylene with acceptable isotacticity and high MFR.</div>

Except for the inclusion of the heterocyclic organic compounds of the present invention, the Ziegler-Natta type catalyst systems, and methods for making such catalyst systems, which may be employed in accordance with the various embodiments of the present invention, are not generally limited. Typical, and acceptable, Ziegler-Natta type catalyst systems that may be used in accordance with the present invention comprise (a) a solid Ziegler-Natta type catalyst component, and (b) a co-catalyst component, and optionally (c) one or more external electron donors. In accordance with the various embodiments of the present invention, at least one heterocyclic organic compound in accordance with the present invention is used as an electron donor in the Ziegler-Natta type catalyst system. As previously disclosed herein, these heterocyclic organic compounds may be used as either an internal electron donor or an external electron donor. Preferably, these heterocyclic organic compounds are used as an internal electron donor.</div>

Finally, the heterocyclic organic compounds of the present invention may also be employed as an external electronic donor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The olefin polymerization processes that may be used in accordance with the present invention are not generally limited. For example, the catalyst components (a), (b) and (c), when employed, may be added to the polymerization reactor simultaneously or sequentially.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The olefin monomer may be added prior to, with, or after the addition of the Ziegler-Natta type catalyst system to the polymerization reactor. It is preferred to add the olefin monomer after the addition of the Ziegler-Natta type catalyst system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The molecular weight of the polymers may be controlled in a known manner, preferably by using hydrogen. With the catalysts produced according to the present invention, molecular weight may be suitably controlled with hydrogen when the polymerization is carried out at relatively low temperatures, e.g., from about 30° C. to about 105° C. This control of molecular weight may be evidenced by a measurable positive change of the Melt Flow Rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The polymerization reactions may be carried out in slurry, liquid or gas phase processes, or in a combination of liquid and gas phase processes using separate reactors, all of which may be done either by batch or continuously. The polyolefin may be directly obtained from gas phase process, or obtained by isolation and recovery of solvent from the slurry process, according to conventionally known methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">There are no particular restrictions on the polymerization conditions for production of polyolefins by the method of this invention, such as the polymerization temperature, polymerization time, polymerization pressure, monomer concentration, etc. The polymerization temperature is generally from 40-90° C. and the polymerization pressure is generally 1 atmosphere or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The Ziegler-Natta type catalyst systems of the present invention may be precontacted with small quantities of olefin monomer, well known in the art as prepolymerization, in a hydrocarbon solvent at a temperature of 60° C. or lower for a time sufficient to produce a quantity of polymer from 0.5 to 3 times the weight of the catalyst. If such a prepolymerization is done in liquid or gaseous monomer, the quantity of resultant polymer is generally up to 1000 times the catalyst weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The Ziegler-Natta type catalyst systems of the present invention are useful in the polymerization of olefins, including but not limited to homopolymerization and copolymerization of alpha olefins. Suitable α-olefins that may be used in a polymerization process in accordance with the present invention include olefins of the general formula CH<sub>2</sub>═CHR, where R is H or C<sub>1-10 </sub>straight or branched alkyl, such as ethylene, propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methylpentene-1 and octene-1. While the Ziegler-Natta type catalyst systems of the present invention may be employed in processes in which ethylene is polymerized, it is more desirable to employ the Ziegler-Natta type catalyst systems of the present invention in processes in which polypropylene or higher olefins are polymerized. Processes involving the homopolymerization or copolymerization of propylene are preferred.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">(A) The Preparation of a Solid Catalyst Component:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">A 250 ml flask equipped with a stirrer and thoroughly purged with nitrogen was charged with 10 g of magnesium ethoxide and 100 ml of anhydrous toluene to form a suspension. To the suspension was injected 25 ml of TiCl<sub>4 </sub>and was then heated up to a temperature of 90° C. 1.8 g of 2,2-di(2-tetrahydrofuryl)propane was added thereto, followed by heating up to 110° C. with agitation at that temperature for 2 hours. After the completion of the reaction, the product was washed twice with 100 ml of anhydrous toluene at 90° C., and 100 ml of fresh anhydrous toluene and 25 ml of TiCl<sub>4 </sub>were added thereto for reacting with agitation at 110° C. for two additional hours. After the completion of the reaction, the product was washed 8 times with 200 ml of anhydrous n-heptane at 90° C. and was dried under a reduced pressure to obtain a solid composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">(B) Polymerization:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">A bench scale 2-liter reactor was used. The reactor was first preheated to at least 100° C. with a nitrogen purge to remove residual moisture and oxygen. The reactor was thereafter cooled to 50° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Under nitrogen, 1 liter dry heptane was introduced into the reactor. When reactor temperature was about 50° C., 4.3 ml triethylaluminum (0.58M, in hexanes), 0.40 ml cyclohexyl(dimethoxy)methylsilane (C-donor) (0.5 M in heptane), and then 30 mg of the solid catalyst component prepared above were added to the reactor. The pressure of the reactor was raised to 28.5 psig at 50° C. by introducing nitrogen. 8 psi hydrogen in a 150 cc vessel was flushed into the reactor with propylene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The reactor temperature was then raised to 70° C. The total reactor pressure was raised to and controlled at 90 psig by continually introducing propylene into the reactor and the polymerization was allowed to proceed for 1 hour. After polymerization, the reactor was vented to reduce the pressure to 0 psig and the reactor temperature was cooled to 50° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The reactor was then opened. 500 ml methanol was added to the reactor and the resulting mixture was stirred for 5 minutes then filtered to obtain the polymer product. The obtained polymer was vacuum dried at 80° C. for 6 hours. The polymer was evaluated for melt flow rate (MFR), Xylene soluble (% XS), and molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn).
