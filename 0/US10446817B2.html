<heading id="h-0002">GOVERNMENT FUNDING STATEMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention was made with government support under Contract No. DE-AR0000392, awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in this invention.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Broadly, the instant disclosure is directed towards energy storage assemblies for energy storage devices, where the assembly is configured to reduce, prevent, and/or eliminate failures attributable to pressurization within the energy storage device(s) or energy storage assembly (e.g. which can cause thermal events and/or fires). More specifically, the instant disclosure is directed towards various embodiments of energy storage device assemblies configured with a sealed housing/enclosure and configured to retain individual energy storage devices. In one or more embodiments of the instant disclosure, the energy storage assembly is configured with at least one of: a sealed (e.g. hermetically sealed) housing, configured with a forming operation (e.g. double seam); a current interrupt device, configured with a dome actuator, and/or a pressure vent, configured with a scored pattern to define a vent path and a countersink. In some embodiments, the energy storage assembly is configured with failure mechanisms to prevent pressure from building within the sealed housing, which is configured to house a plurality of energy storage devices.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Energy storage devices (e.g. batteries, super capacitors, etc) can undergo thermal events in which a highly exothermic reaction occurs, which can result in a runaway thermal reaction and/or fire. This can cause damage to the underlying device/product in which the energy storage device resides or is attached to (and safety issues for device/product users or bystanders). One such example of an energy storage device is a lithium ion core member (lithium ion cell).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As lithium ion battery assemblies are packaged more densely than other battery or power delivery systems, there is a risk that a failure of one cell in an assembly from abuse may lead to propagating (cascading) runaway in the entire system with explosion and fire risk. In some instances, this abuse can come from external events, such as crash and fire, and also from internal events such as inadvertent overcharge (e.g. due to charging electronics failures or internal shorts due to metal particulates from the manufacturing process).</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Energy storage assemblies, including batteries (e.g. lithium ion batteries), suffer from two failure mechanisms, both of which release a significant amount of thermal energy. Upon impact to the battery cell/module (e.g. jellyroll), the energy storing cells can be punctured, releasing significant amounts of thermal energy. Also, it is possible for the chemical components of the energy storage device to degrade, releasing a high rate of thermal energy in a thermal run away event (which can trigger a chain reaction thermal runaway in other energy storage devices in that energy storage assembly (e.g. battery pack).</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">Reference will now be made in detail to one or more embodiments, and/or the accompanying drawings with reference to various experimental examples in accordance with the instant disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">In one or more embodiments of the instant disclosure, the battery assembly is configured such that abuse failures do not lead to cascading runaway</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">In one or more aspects of the instant disclosure, the energy storage assembly is configured with a sealed enclosure housing one or more (e.g. a plurality of) energy storage devices; a current interrupt device with a dome actuator; and/or a pressure vent with a flat panel actuator, the panel configured with a raised circumferential groove (e.g. countersink) and a score positioned along at least a portion of the countersink, the score configured to extend at least a portion of the thickness of the countersink substrate and a buckling initiator positioned proximate (e.g. orthogonal to and/or intersecting with) the countersink and/or the score. Without wishing to be bound by a particular mechanism or theory, it is believed that material properties and dimensions are dependent on the methods chosen to affect the sealing of the enclosure/housing, with complex interdependencies regarding the relationships of the features configured within the enclosure/housing. Set out in the paragraphs that follow are examples including: prophetic examples (e.g. method of assembly and use), computer modeling trials, and experimental data obtained on various features and/or components of the instant disclosure.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Prophetic Example 1—Method of Making Housing</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">In this configuration, the housing/enclosure body is formed via a forming operation (e.g. drawing and ironing) in order to provide a base with a perimetrical sidewall extending upward and surrounding the base, thus defining an inner void. The inner void is configured/sufficiently sized to accommodate a plurality of energy storage devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">At a position along the sidewall (e.g. positioned a sufficient distance from the electrode leads, terminal contacts and/or electrical wiring of the energy storage devices) a portion of the housing sidewall is removed to accommodate the attachment of a current interrupt device. The current interrupt device is attached (e.g. welded, fastened, bonded, and/or adhered) to the housing and configured to interrupt electrical contact if the internal atmosphere of the housing reaches/exceeds a predetermined pressure. The current interrupt device is configured onto the sidewall of the housing such that the housing is capable of maintaining a sealed enclosure to house the energy storage devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">In one embodiment, at a position along the sidewall (e.g. positioned a sufficient distance from the electrode leads, terminal contacts and/or electrical wiring of the energy storage devices) a portion of the housing sidewall is removed to accommodate the pressure vent. The pressure vent is attached to the opening to maintain a seal in the housing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">In another embodiment, at a position along the sidewall having a sufficient thickness, is configured with a scored vent (e.g. with countersink and buckling initiator) is configured into the locally thinned portion of the sidewall, such that the scored vent is configured to open at a predetermined pressure acting upon the scored area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">In another embodiment, at a position along the sidewall (e.g. positioned a sufficient distance from the electrode leads, terminal contacts and/or electrical wiring of the energy storage devices) a portion of the housing sidewall is locally thinned. Once locally thinned, a scored vent is configured into the locally thinned portion of the sidewall, such that the scored vent is configured to open at a predetermined pressure acting upon the scored area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">In alternative embodiments, at least one of the current interrupt device and the pressure vent are configured in the cover/lid of the housing (as opposed to the sidewall).</div>
<heading id="h-0009">Prophetic Example 2—Method of Assembly Li-Ion Core Members (e.g. Jelly Roll)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">In this configuration, the individual energy storage devices are retained in a housing that is sealed via a forming operation (e.g. double seaming). In this instance, the jelly rolls are placed into the housing, electrolyte is inserted into the jelly rolls and a charge/discharge cycle is completed in order to prepare the li-ion core members. Once the li-ion core members are primed (e.g. configured for electrical storage, charge, and discharge operation), the lid of the housing is positioned over the open, upper end of the housing body, overlapping a perimetrical lip (e.g. flange) on the upper end of the housing with a corresponding flange/lip perimetrically located on the lid/cover. Through a forming operation, the corresponding flanges are joined to form a double seal (e.g. having a sealing compound positioned between the layers to assist in achieving a hermetic seal).</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Prophetic Example 3—Method of Assembly with Wire Fuse</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">In this configuration, the individual energy storage devices are each retained in a sleeve, with the plurality of energy storage devices set into a larger housing/enclosure configured to seal (e.g. hermetically seal) around/about the energy storage devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">The inner can and ends are manufactured (e.g. via a forming operation, via an extrusion), with inner end having/configured with a central hole for the electrical contact/wiring (e.g. copper lead) to exit the energy storage device. Then, the outer cans (e.g. housing/enclosure), including body and cover (or ends) is manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0267">Each energy storage device is loaded into an inner can, and a weld (e.g. ultrasonic weld or laser weld) is positioned adjacent to the bottom of the can (e.g. where the weld is an aluminum contact configured between the energy storage device and the container). The electrical contact/wiring is threaded through the central hole in the top, followed by the insertion of a non-sealing, insulating spacer (e.g. grommet) into the hole to prevent the electrical wiring/contact (copper) from touching the metal end (e.g. aluminum end).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">An electrolyte resistant substrate/sheet (e.g. plastic) is then positioned over the top of the energy storage device, such that the electrolyte resistant substrate/sheet is configured to extend over a flange at the top of the can (i.e. between the top and the upper end of the body of the can).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">The top (including electrolyte resistant sheet) is sealed to the upper end of the can via a forming operation (e.g. double seam). In this embodiment, the apparatus is configured to protect the sealing compound from the electrolyte (of the battery). In some embodiments, the sealing compound is configured to be resistant to electrolyte, such that the electrolyte resistant sheet is omitted (not needed).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0270">The cans are positioned into an open bottomed foam layer such that the bottom of each can is exposed below to the foam. Weld (e.g. ultrasonically weld) the bottom of the can to a sheet (e.g. aluminum sheet) to serve as a bus bar, where the weld is configured to circumscribe each can (e.g. configured as an annulus on the outside of the can). Beneath each of the cans is a hole in the bus. Position an insulating sheet (first insulating sheet) under the bus, where the insulating sheet includes a hole under each of the cans. Position a thin conducting member (e.g. sheet, wire, plurality of wires, etc) beneath the insulating sheet, where the conducting member is electrically connected to one side of a cell shutoff relay. In this embodiment, the thin conducting member is configured to act as a relay contact (e.g. in the event of a pressure event). Position another insulating sheet (second insulating sheet), where the sheet is configured to extend across the whole bottom of the container and upwards at least partially up the side of the foam layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0271">Position the sealed cans, foam, bus (e.g. aluminum bus), insulating sheet (first sheet), relay contact member, and insulating sheet (second sheet) into the container (e.g. outer can). Position/configure the electrical contacts from the electrical connection on each battery to a second bus work (e.g. copper bus work). Insert electrolyte into the center hole of all the sealed cans (e.g. into the battery). Position/configure electrical contact to the bus work (e.g. aluminum bus work and copper bus work, sited at the electrode ends) for each of the plurality of the cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0272">Perform battery preparation, via a charge and discharge cycle. Seal inner can lids via (e.g. sealing grommet). Connect the busses to the cell contacts and add the relay, connecting the relay to the copper bus and the relay contact member, seal the outer can (e.g. via a forming operation, e.g. seaming).</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Prophetic Example 4—Method of Using an Energy Storage Assembly</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0273">An energy storage device is configured with a sealed housing (e.gs. of a metal substrate, aluminum alloy), where the housing is configured to enclose a plurality of energy storage devices within the housing (e.g. body and cover) and permit electrical communication between the energy storage devices and a product form/device. The energy storage device is configured with a current interrupt device as shown and described and a pressure vent as shown and described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0274">During operation (e.g. charge, discharge, storage/maintaining the charge) of the energy storage device, the energy storage assembly is configured to retain the energy storage devices and other innards (e.g. electrical connections, bus work, support structures, etc) at an operating pressure (P<b>1</b>, e.g. a range). During operation, the energy storage device can be configured in electrical contact/communication with a product form/device and/or other energy storage devices. Alternatively, during operation, the energy storage device may be charged, discharged, or partially charged and be in storage for a period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">During operation, if/when the internal pressure of the energy storage assembly reaches P<b>2</b>, a pressure above the operating pressure, then the current interrupt device configured onto the energy storage device is configured to interrupt the current of the energy storage device (e.g. such that one or more of the energy storage devices is incapable of electrical communication with other energy storage devices and/or the product form/device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0276">During operation, if/when the internal pressure of the energy storage assembly reaches P<b>3</b>, a pressure above P<b>2</b>, then the pressure vent configured in the housing opens and releases the pressurized gases from inside the housing.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">Prophetic Example 5—Method of Using a Battery Assembly</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0278" num="0277">Operating (e.g. charging, discharging) a battery assembly at an operating pressure (P<b>1</b>, e.g. ranging from 0 to 5 PSI), wherein the battery assembly is configured in electrical communication with at least one of: a product form and other battery assemblies; disconnecting the battery assembly from electrical communication with at least one of: the product form and the other battery assemblies when the internal pressure of the battery assembly reaches P<b>2</b> (e.g. ranging from 15-25 PSI), a pressure above the operating pressure (e.g. wherein disconnecting is accomplished via a current interrupt device); venting the battery assembly via a vent configured in the housing of the battery assembly when the internal pressure of the battery assembly reaches P<b>3</b> (e.g. ranging from 35-45 PSI), a pressure above P<b>2</b> (e.g. wherein venting is accomplished via a semi-circular scored vent positioned in a circular countersink of a vent area positioned on the housing of a battery assembly, wherein the battery assembly is configured to house a plurality of lithium ion core members; venting the battery assembly via a structural vent (e.g. plugged enclosure, weld seam, or attachment site of lid to body) when the pressure reaches P<b>4</b>, (e.g. a pressure range of 50-60 PSI), where P<b>4</b> is greater than P<b>3</b> (e.g. upper limit pressure that the box can withstand while maintaining structural integrity).</div>
<heading id="h-0013">Example 6: Displacement of Sealed Housing Under Pressurized Conditions</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0279" num="0278">In order to understand how pressurization impacts the sealed housing, some computer models were generated to view/confirm the displacement of the sealed housing at operating pressure (e.g. up to 3 PSI). Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35-40</figref>, seam welded housing designs having varied thickness (e.g. 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.5 mm) were computer modeled towards the upper end of the typical range of operating pressure (e.g. 3 PSI) in order to understand displacement. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34-39</figref>, varying displacement is depicted in grayscale, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> provides a graph depicting the relationship of normalized performance pressure compared to normalized volume of box. As the thickness of the walls increases, the amount of displacement observed in the z direction decreases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0279">Without wishing to be bound by a particular mechanism or theory, the amount of growth in the z direction is believed to be a function of the length and width of the housing, the thickness of the top and the joining method of the top closure to the container wall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0280">Without wishing to be bound by a particular mechanism or theory, for a rectangular container, it is believed (e.g. based on the equations set out in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>) that the larger the plan view dimensions (length and width of the lid) the thicker or more geometrically stiffened the lid (or body) has to be in order to meet the deformation limit at operating pressure. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, for maximum deflection of a rectangular plate subject to a pressure load, the deflection is an inverse cubic relation to the thickness for fixed boundary dimensions. Further, the deflection is a nominally a 3rd order function of the long dimension of the plate.</div>

<heading id="h-0014">Example 7: Displacement Measured in Sealed Housings/Enclosures at Elevated Pressures</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0283">This set of experiments was carried out on battery assembly housings having different wall thicknesses, in order to better understand the expansion of hermetically sealed boxes at typical operating pressures (e.g. 0-3 PSI) as compared to elevated pressures (e.g. &gt;3 to 50 PSI). Displacement was measured as a function of internal pressure in the boxes. Two different wall thicknesses were evaluated, where housings included a 0.8 mm wall thickness (“cans 1-4”, Test #1) or 1.5 mm thickness (“cans 5-8”, Test #2). Otherwise, the housings shared the same design criterion: the base thickness was 1.5 mm, the lid thickness was 2 mm, and the basic dimensions of the boxes were 175.2 mm×118.69 mm×56.06 mm. The housings were constructed of 3003-H14 aluminum. The laser welded hermetic seals on the prepared housings were evaluated via a prepared bodies “Whole-Can Helium leak test”, and all housings passed. The cans were equipped with a completely sealed nitrogen gas inlet (in order to input nitrogen gas into the otherwise sealed housing and increase internal pressure).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0284">Prior to pressurization, each housing geometry was measured. Then, the housing was positioned and retained inside a stainless steel cage in 2-axis fixed position, equipped with a drop indicator. The drop indicator was in contact with the top of the housing in order to measure the Z-axis displacement as a function of increasing pressure. Since the bottom plate is 1.5 mm and top plate is 2 mm, the housing was positioned with the bottom plate facing up in order to minimize any potential contribution of the unbalanced geometry due to size expansion during the test.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0285">During testing, the housing was pressurized to 3 psi (P<b>1</b>) and held at this pressure for a duration of two minutes, followed by a pressurization at 10 psi for a duration of two minutes. This sequence—pressurize and hold for a duration of two minutes, was followed in increments of 5 PSI until the upper limit of the experiment, 50 PSI, was achieved. The upper limit of 50 PSI was based upon the Lid Test Plan. Measurements were obtained via a camera that was positioned in front of the cage in order to record readings from the drop indicator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0287" num="0286">Without wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism or theory, at 3 PSI, the believed upper limit of typical internal operating pressure for a battery assembly housing a plurality of active (e.g. charging, discharging, operating) lithium ion batteries, was also tracked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0287">At 3 PSI, the maximum displacement on all 4 cans having 0.8 mm thick walls was 1.016 mm. The minimum displacement on the thin walled cans at 3 PSI was 0.457 mm. The average displacement on the thin walled cans at 3 PSI was 0.9335 mm.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0300" num="0299">A series of buckling experiments was performed on flat sheet (no countersink, no bucking initiator). Nine venting trials were run on flat circular sheets, where each sheet was configured with a circumferential/oblong score with a non-scored region defining a hinge. The score was placed directly on the panel (no countersink). The 31.75 mm round disk samples were produced on a single action mechanical press with the stroke controlled to meet the desired score residual. AA3104 material was used for the score vent. The thickness of the material was 250 microns and the score residual was 50 microns (range of 38-60 microns).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0301" num="0300">The samples were tested (e.g. pressurized) by clamping the scored disk to a flat plate using a washer to simulate a welded condition. The samples were pressurized via a pressurization instrument configured to act through a hole on the washer (on the surface of the each disk) until venting occurred. The experiment was (originally) designed to provide venting at 90-100 PSI, and when factors were varied in order to drive the venting initiation down to a lower pressure, the pressure to initiate venting was no lower than 70 PSI for this set of experiments. Results of the trial are set out in the Table 3 below:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0303" num="0302">Nine tests were run and in each instance, the vent retained pressure to at least 65 psi. Venting was observed in all cases at/along the scored vent. The average venting pressure was 75.6 psi. It is noted, variations in the residual thickness did not necessarily have a direct relationship with (e.g. provide significant control to direct) venting pressure. Without being bound by any mechanism of theory, this is believed to be because the scoring (vent) was positioned directly on the panel and the panel diameter was of a relatively small size (compared to later trials).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0303">It is noted that for one of the nine runs, a copper mesh flame arrestor was positioned inside the vent. At venting pressure (approximately 70 psi) the flame arrestor remained intact e.g. did not dislodge from its position or blow through the vent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0304">Without wishing to be bound by a particular mechanism or theory, buckling pressure is believed to be related to the diameter of the shell/disk and/or other components (e.g. panel depth, countersink, strength of material, material choice, etc.). Without wishing to be bound by a particular mechanism or theory, the required score residual to meet the venting pressure is believed to be a function of the score design and the material thickness and strength.</div>
<heading id="h-0016">Example 9: Pressure Venting With Scored Vent with Countersink</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0306" num="0305">In order to evaluate the score design and controls over the pressurization and resulting venting of the pressure vent, a series of experiments was performed on a number of shells having different score features. For each design parameter at least 5 to up to 10 runs were performed on each configuration variable, in order to have a sufficient sample size to draw reasonable comparisons in performance/impact of changing the vent configuration. The same pressurization equipment utilized in Example 8 was again utilized in these trials to better understand the vent configurations and resulting impact on vent propagation through the shell/disk.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0307" num="0306">In evaluating the configuration of score shape, three shapes were evaluated: a y-shaped score, a line score, and a circumferential score.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0308" num="0307">In evaluating the configuration of score position, a circumferential score was placed in the countersink vs. directly on the panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0309" num="0308">In evaluating the configuration of score location (i.e. positioning inside or outside of housing), a score was placed on the inside vs. outside of the panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0310" num="0309">In evaluating score-to-hinge ratio configuration, various runs were completed to evaluate the hinge size with a circumferential score in the countersink.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0311" num="0310">In evaluating the configuration of a score initiation site, circumferential scores were evaluated with and without a buckling initiator. In this trial, when a buckling initiator was used, the buckling initiator was positioned opposite the hinge (e.g. 180 degrees from the hinge) and was configured as a score set in a perpendicular direction to the principal score line on top side of lid/outside shell (e.g. configured as the outside/outward facing portion of the housing).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0312" num="0311">In each of these trials, the material type/composition, strength, and thickness were selected such that the pressure vents were configured to vent at a range of approximately 85-90 psi. In each run, the score was configured by the same score knife, score procedure, and the same residual thickness such that each sample was designed to vent so that the resulting ‘vent event’ (e.g. initiation site, propagation, etc) could be evaluated after pressurization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0313" num="0312">It is noted that the various configurations were designed to vent, but many of the configurations did not vent in a repeatable and consistent way. In some instances, the vent did not propagate far enough in order to create a sufficient opening in the vent to direct pressurized gas through the opening. In other instances, the vent propagated through the vent shell/sample, such that, if used in combination with an energy storage device, the torn vent substrate could create sharp edges in close proximity to neighboring energy storage devices, electrical components, or sensitive components of the product form or device. In some instances, the vent propagated too far and resulted in a freestanding portion of the vent substrate/shell that was completely removed from the sample (e.g. which could cause a proj ectile during operating conditions of the energy storage device). In some instances, the vent initiated at a score line, but deviated from the score and instead propagated through the non-score portion of the vent (e.g. creating different sized resulting vents).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0314" num="0313">In evaluating the results, it was determined that the circumferential-shaped score (leaving an unscored hinge), where the score (and hinge) was positioned within a raised circumferential groove (e.g. countersink) was configured to create a consistently repeatable, precise and accurate vent. Specifically, this configuration resulted in: (1) a consistent vent size; (2) a consistent vent path (e.g. along the score line, neither deviating from the path nor propagating into the hinge); (3) fast vent propagation through the score (short duration of time, as measured from start of vent at buckling initiator to finish of vent at completion of propagation; and (4) did not impact the resulting attachment zone (e.g. outer edges of the shell/substrate). Additionally, the inclusion of the buckling initiator to the vent configuration was found to promote initiation (e.g. via its configuration as site for receiving the build-up of panel stress upon pressurization) of the vent site at a predetermined location on the score line, such that the hinge remained intact (e.g. vented flap was retained on vent substrate) and the score propagated along the defined/designed pathway (e.g. score line) to result in a sufficiently sized vent to achieve quick venting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0315" num="0314">Based on these tests, further evaluation of the circumferential score with hinge, positioned in a countersinkF was completed (e.g. Example 10).</div>
<heading id="h-0017">Example 10: Computer Modeling Trials on Circumferential Countersink</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0316" num="0315">Finite element models were generated to determine the impact and relationships of diameter, material strength, vent thickness, and residual thickness on the performance and venting characteristics of the disk/vent structure. More specifically, a computer modeling trial was completed on a vent substrate (e.g. AA3003 H14) with a circumferential countersink (no score) with welded ends and undergoing pressurization, in order to evaluate the variables in the vent feature and their impact on buckling pressure (no vent, since no score).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0317" num="0316">In this experiment, by varying certain factors (e.g. diameter, thickness, and strength of the material), the vent was designed to buckle at a threshold of around 40 PSI. The goal of these parametric studies was to understand the effect of radius, radius depth, and countersink depth have on performance of the vent. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, in this modeling series, R1 (e.g. radius, or panel radius), H1 (e.g. panel depth, or radius depth), and H2 (e.g. countersink depth) were varied in order to understand the impact on buckling pressure. In this series of FEM analyses, D1, D2, D3, R2, R3, R4, and T1 (depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>) were maintained as constant. Specifically, D1 and D2 were the same (D1−D2=0), 1.1275″; D3 was 1.3000″; R2=R3, which was 0.0250″; R4 was 0.200″, and T1 was 0.0100″. The variations in R1, H1, and H2 (in inches) and resulting buckle pressure (psi) are set out in Table 4 below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0318">Referring to Table 4, it is shown that variations in the countersink depth resulted in a difference in buckling pressure of approximately 7 psi, while varying the radius depth or panel radius resulted in smaller changes in buckling pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0319">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, two comparative examples from this vent buckling trial are shown as internal pressure (psi) by vent centerline displacement (inches). With vent buckle trial #2, the panel radius was 0.0450 inches, the panel depth was 0.0500 inches, the countersink depth was 0.0600 inches, and the buckling pressure was 30.2 psi. With vent trial #12,the panel radius was 0.0450 inches, the panel depth was 0.0700 inches, the countersink depth was 0.0800 inches, and the buckling pressure was 39.9 psi. In this comparative example, both samples buckled, but trial #12 performed better as it exhibited snap-through buckling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0321" num="0320">Without being bound by a particular theory or mechanism, it is believed that snap through buckling is configured to provide strain energy needed to break/perforate the score line. For example, with ID#2, it tracks closely with ID12 for the first portion of the measured performance (e.g. generally believed to be due to plasticity of the material), however, around 20 PSI the two runs are directed along different pathways. Regarding ID#2, as the sample undergoes further pressurization as the displacement increases, then pressure levels off while displacement continues. In contrast, ID#12 undergoes some initial plasticity with limited displacement 0.075 at ˜40 psi (compared with ID#2 which reaches 40 psi at 0.16 inches).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0327" num="0326">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, a graph illustrating an example of snap-through buckling for the dome actuator is provided, depicting dome displacement (inches) as a function of pressure (psi) for ID#19. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, as pressure increases up towards 20 psi, there is not much movement (displacement) in the center of the dome. Upon reaching the 20 psi threshold, snap-through buckling occurs, in which near instantaneous displacement (e.g. with speed akin to the speed of sound in air) of 0.16 inches occurs. Once the dome actuator is fully reversed, no further appreciable displacement occurs, though the dome (e.g. in its actuated position) continues to retain pressure/maintain the hermetic seal of the housing <b>134</b> if pressure continues to increase.</div>
<heading id="h-0020">Example 13: Computer Modeling on Energy Storage Device Undergoing Pressurization</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0328" num="0327">Computer modeling was completed on the overall energy storage device in order to evaluate the escalating pressure in the housing and energy storage device components, including for example the housing (e.g. housing material, strength, thickness, forming), current interrupt device (e.g. dome actuation, fuse disconnect); and pressure vent (e.g. maintaining pressure, buckling initiation, score propagation, size of vent).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0328"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A and 47B</figref> depict, respectively, an example of a computer-modeled “before” and “after” cut-away side line view of the housing of an energy storage device in accordance with the instant disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0330" num="0329">As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47A &amp; 47B</figref>, the sidewall <b>134</b> is configured to house the dome (actuator) of the current interrupt device <b>242</b> and vent <b>220</b>, with countersink and score.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0331" num="0330">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47A</figref>, (1) the dome <b>242</b> is in its recessed position and (2) the vent is in its intact (e.g. non-perforated or non-vented) position, in accordance with its operating position during the standard range of operating pressure within the housing. In contrast, FIG. <b>47</b>B depicts the same view as <b>47</b>A but under a different pressure condition (e.g. exceeding the pressure limit of the dome actuator and the scored vent). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47B</figref>, the dome has undergone snap-through buckling and the vent has undergone buckle-initiated score perforation, resulting in the propagation of a vent in the vent device/component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0332" num="0331">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, the pressurization event in an embodiment of the energy storage device is depicted at different (increasing) pressures. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, the storage device configurations (e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> (1)-(4) are depicted as events on the plot depicting displacement (in inches) of the centerlines of the dome actuator and vent as a function of pressure (psi).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0333" num="0332">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, (1) corresponds to a departure slightly above the normal operating pressures (e.g. 0-5 psi) for an embodiment of an energy storage device. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> (1), both the dome and the vent device have moved slightly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0334" num="0333">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, (2) corresponds to a pressure well above normal operating pressure (e.g. ˜15-17 psi) and prior to any operations of the dome actuator actuation/CID actuation) and/or pressure vent) departure slightly above the normal operating pressures (e.g. within CID) or pressure vent. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> (2), both the dome and the vent device have moved to a greater extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0335" num="0334">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, (3) corresponds to a pressure threshold for the dome actuator to undergo a reversal (e.g. snap-through buckling), while the pressure vent is intact. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> (3), the dome has reversed/acutated and the vent device has moved to a greater extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0336" num="0335">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, (4) corresponds to a pressure threshold for the pressure vent to open (e.g. via a buckling event to propagate an opening along the scored line). As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> (4), the dome (in reversed/actuated position) has moved again and the vent device has opened.</div>
<heading id="h-0021">Example 14: Flame Arrestor Trial</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0337" num="0336">As briefly noted in Example 8, a flame arrestor was tested in accordance with a scored vent shell assembly, pressurized to vent at approximately 70 psi. The flame arrestor was a 30 mesh copper wire that was adhered to the base of the vent. Upon venting, the flame arrestor was maintained in position. With this run, it is noted that the venting gas was not flammable and did not contain corrosive species. Upon evaluation of the flame arrestor, it did not tear or blow through the vent when the vent opened under pressure. However, as a proxy, the selected mesh was successfully tested as a flame arrestor with both natural gas and propane.</div>
<heading id="h-0022">Example 15: Computer Modeling Scoring Knife</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0338" num="0337"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> depicts a typical score knife geometry in parametric format. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, the opening forces or pressures are directly related to the score residual. In one or more embodiments of the instant disclosure, the score knife (and/or scoring process) can be varied in order to provide a specifically configured scored portion on the vent component to provide the vent upon pressurization above a predetermined threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0339" num="0338">The score residual is configured to provide an appropriate amount of material in order to achieve the desired application. If the residual is too large, opening forces or pressures will be high. If the depth is too shallow, the strength of the vent needed to withstand the applied pressure will be low (e.g. and may vent prematurely).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0340" num="0339">The draft angle of the score knife is configured to provide an appropriate angle to achieve the desired application in the resulting score. For example, if the draft angle is too small, cracks could form under the knife, leading to leaks in the resulting score within the vent component. If it is too large, the forming load increases, and may make the score line less defined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0341" num="0340">In one or more embodiments of the instant disclosure, the score is created with a score knife having a chisel-like geometry (e.g. having radii instead of sharp edges), as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>.</div>
