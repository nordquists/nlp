<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. Non-Provisional application Ser. No. 15/302,721, filed Oct. 7, 2016, which is the National Stage Entry under 35 U.S.C. § 371 of Patent Cooperation Treaty Application No. PCT/US2015/025195, filed Apr. 9, 2015, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/977,613 filed on Apr. 9, 2014, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">For the last few decades the number of mobile devices has grown exponentially thereby resulting in increase in demand for data and data delivery capacity of mobile wireless networks. In order to meet this rapidly growing demand for mobile data, a large number of smaller cells may be deployed. However, the bandwidth provided by heterogeneous networks include macro and small cell networks may not be adequate. Therefore other mechanisms, for example, use of millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies may be utilized to provide significant capacity improvement related to user-specific data transmission. The narrow beam pattern of mmW beams, however, may pose challenges for standalone mmW base station solutions, e.g., in delivering cell-specific and/or broadcast information.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU), e.g., a millimeter wave WTRU (mWTRU) may receive a first control channel using a first antenna pattern. The first control channel may be one of: a common physical downlink directional control channel (PDDCCH), a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), an enhanced PDCCH (EPDCCH), or a millimeter wave physical downlink control channel (mmPDCCH). The first control channel may be configured per beam. The first control channel may be read by multiple WTRUs. The first control channel may be carried using a broad beam (e.g., a long term evolution (LTE) beam) or a millimeter (mmW) beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The WTRU may receive a second control channel (e.g., a dedicated PDDCCH) using a second antenna pattern. The WTRU may demodulate and decode the first control channel and the second control channel. The resource allocation of the first control channel and/or the second control channel may be received from a network, e.g., via higher layers signaling. The first control channel may be carried using a mmW beam or an LTE beam that may be wider than the mmW beam used to carry the second control channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The WTRU may determine, using at least one of: the decoded first control channel or the decoded second control channel, beam scheduling information associated with the WTRU and whether the WTRU is scheduled for an mmW segment. The beam scheduling information may include transmit and receive beam scheduling information. The WTRU may form a receive beam using the determined beam scheduling and receive the second control channel using the receive beam, when the WTRU is scheduled for the mmW segment. The WTRU may determine, by demodulating and decoding the second control channel, dynamic per-transmission time interval (TTI) scheduling information related to a data channel (e.g., a physical downlink directional data channel (PDDDCH)) associated with the second control channel. The WTRU may receive the data channel using the dynamic per-TTI scheduling information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The WTRU may determine a validity period associated with per-TTI scheduling information and applying the per-TTI scheduling information to one or more mmW TTIs. The per-TTI scheduling information is identical for a plurality of consecutive TTIs within a subframe.</div>

An SCmB may provide an antenna configuration and beamforming technique that may allow the SCmB to transmit LTE channels in a wide beam pattern and mmW channels in a narrow beam pattern. The SCmB may transmit the wide beam pattern and the narrow beam pattern. The wide beam pattern and the narrow beam pattern may be transmitted simultaneously. To support WTRUs without mmW transmitters, the SCmB may support a mode in which the uplink may operate the LTE air interface, e.g., only the LTE air interface. WTRU, e.g., an mmW WTRU (mWTRU), may be capable of operating an mmW downlink air interface in parallel with the LTE air interface in the downlink. The mWTRU may have multiple sets of antennas (e.g., two sets of antennas), and associated radio frequency (RF) chains (e.g., one operating in an LTE band and another operating in an mmW band). Each instance of antenna and an RF chain may be associated with a baseband processing function (e.g., an independent baseband processing function). The plurality of baseband functions may share one or more blocks, for example, if the mmW air interface is similar to the LTE system. The mmW hardware and/or software may be implemented as a receiver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">One or more mmW channels (e.g., add-on mmW channels) may be implemented as part of a carrier aggregation scheme. In such a carrier aggregation scheme, a carrier type may be in an mmW frequency band but may apply a different air interface. mmW channels may be applied for high throughput or low latency traffic data applications. Control signaling, which may include system information update, paging, radio resource control (RRC) and non-access stratum (NAS) signaling (e.g., signaling radio bearers), and/or multicast traffic, may be carried in LTE channels. Certain mmW control signaling may use LTE channels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary mmW downlink data system <b>200</b>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, due to potentially significant propagation loss, for example, in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) at the mmW frequency band, SCmB and/or mWTRU may employ narrow beamforming in transmit (Tx) and/or receive (Rx) directions to ensure a satisfactory link budget for high throughput and low latency traffic data. An example outage study conducted at 28 GHz and 38 GHz in an urban area using a steerable 10° beam 24.5 dBi horn antenna at both the transmitter and the receiver may indicate that a consistent coverage may be achieved with a cell radius of 200 meters when such antennas are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The SCmB and mWTRU may employ a wider beam pattern for LTE operation, which may include cell search, random access, cell selection and/or reselection, etc. An omnidirectional radiation pattern with an antenna gain of 0 dBi may be used in simulation and development of LTE technologies, including beamforming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">The mmW downlink data system <b>200</b> may identify and mitigate the impact of the directivity in mmW transmit and/or receive beam patterns on a set of procedures that may include mmW physical layer control signaling, physical layer data scheduling, beam or channel measurement and feedback, transmit and/or receive beam alignment, etc. Receive beamforming may perform a narrow spatial filtering, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> so that a mWTRU may see a channel impulse response in a specific spatial direction. A LTE WTRU may have an omnidirectional receive beam pattern and may perceive a superimposed channel impulse response over the angular domain, e.g., the entire angular domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a comparison between a frequency domain filtering and spatial/angular domain filtering. An aligned transmit/receive beam may provide an extra degree of freedom in the angular domain and may afford the mmW layer a greater degree of spatial separation relative to an LTE system. This may be a result of the propagation of mmW and the large number of antenna elements that may be included in an mmW antenna. For example, the spatial filtering may result in an effective channel that may be fairly flat by excluding paths outside of its beam width.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">The mmW system may use a carrier frequency of 28 GHz, 38 GHz, 60 GHz, etc. The system bandwidth may be variable, e.g., up to 1 GHz. The estimated RMS delay spread may be approximately 100-200 ns with a narrow beam pattern. Latency may be 1 ms. The waveform may be orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based or broadband single-carrier based. Connectivity may be provided via an LTE small cell eNB with mmW add-on channels and a plurality of RF chains, each connected to a different antenna. The data rate may be, e.g., 30 Mbit/s or more in the downlink for 95% or more of WTRUs. Mobility may be achieved by providing an optimized data connection that may be sustained, for example, at a speed of 3 km/h, and/or a data connection that may be maintained, for example, at a speed of 30 km/h. Data rate and mobility criteria may be met with a cell radius of, for example, less than 100 meters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">The candidates for the mmW air interface may include one or more of broadband cyclic prefixed single carrier (CP-SC), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), single carrier (SC)-OFDM, or multiple carrier-code division multiple access (MC-CDMA). The aspects of one or more of peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance, sensitivity to transmitter non-linearity, bit error rate (BER) performance with different equalization schemes ((zero-forcing decision feedback equalization (ZF-DFE) or frequency-domain linear equalization (FD-LE)), resource channelization, multiple access scheme, or implementation complexity of each candidate may be taken into account, e.g., with the help of a simulation based on mmW channel modeling</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">A single carrier waveform may have good PAPR properties compared to OFDM, but may lack the ability to schedule resources dynamically in the frequency domain and may be more difficult to channelize. The narrow beams of the mmW antennas may limit the ability to perform frequency domain scheduling. A simulation with accurate mmW channel modeling may be used for a proper evaluation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">The OFDM waveform may be utilized. The SCmB may operate LTE and mmW air interfaces, and a similar waveform may facilitate functional block sharing between these two implementations, e.g., clock distribution and fast fourier transform (FFT) block. One or more implementations disclosed herein may be disclosed in the context of an OFDM-based mmW waveform. However, certain system procedures may apply to a single carrier waveform, e.g., with minor modifications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">An OFDM frame structure may be provided. For example, to promote flexibility in coordination between the LTE and mmW channels and possibly enable common functional block sharing in an mWTRU device, the mmW sampling frequency may be an integer multiple of the LTE minimum sampling frequency of 1.92 MHz. An mmW OFDM system may adopt a subcarrier spacing Δf that may be an integer multiple of the LTE subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz, e.g., Δf=15*K kHz. The selection of the integer multiple K and the resulting Δf may achieve a balance between the sensitivity to the Doppler shift and different types of frequency errors and the ability to remove channel time dispersion. Orthogonality between subcarriers may deteriorate and inter-subcarrier interference may increase when the Doppler shift increases in proportion to the subcarrier spacing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">As the mmW downlink data link targets up to 30 km/h, the maximum Doppler shift at 28 GHz may be 778 Hz. The channel time dispersion on mmW frequencies may be measured, and an example 28 GHz measurement in a dense urban area indicates that an example root mean square (RMS) delay spread σ may be between 100 and 200 ns. The 90% coherence bandwidth may be estimated at 1/50σ 100 kHz and the 50% coherence bandwidth at ⅕σ 1 MHz. A subcarrier spacing between 100 kHz and 1 MHz may be reasonable. An example Δf may be 300 kHz, e.g., K=20. The wide subcarrier spacing may be robust against Doppler shift and other types of frequency error, which may reduce the implementation difficulty.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">The symbol length T<sub>symbol </sub>of the OFDM system may be 1/Δf. If the subcarrier spacing Δf is 300 kHz, the symbol length T<sub>symbol </sub>may be 3.33 μs. The cyclic parameter (CP) length may cover the entire length of the channel time dispersion to eliminate inter-symbol interference, but the CP may carry the cost of additional power and reduced data rate, e.g., a system overhead. In an example in which T<sub>symbol </sub>is 3.33 μs, the CP length T<sub>CP </sub>may be selected as 1/14 of T<sub>symbol</sub>, e.g., 0.24 μs, and the corresponding CP overhead may be 7% as calculated by T<sub>CP</sub>/(T<sub>CP</sub>+T<sub>symbol</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">To achieve low latency, the transmission time interval (TTI) length of the mmW downlink data enhancement may be reduced significantly compared to the 1 ms TTI length of the LTE system. The mmW downlink may have a subframe length of 1 ms to line up with the LTE 1 ms subframe timing. The mmW subframe may include multiple TTIs, and the TTI length may be closely tied to other frame structure parameters, such as subcarrier spacing, symbol length, CP length, FFT size, etc. Table 1 illustrates an example list of OFDM parameters with a conservative CP, e.g., 4× channel delay spread. CP length selection may be based on an assumption that the delay spread over mmW frequencies may be lower than 200 ns.</div>

A longer CP may be considered for an extended cell radius as the extended CP is designed for in the LTE system. A longer CP may be considered for a more conservative approach to ensure the channel time dispersion is entirely covered in the CP length. The nominal spectral efficiency may decrease as the overhead caused by the CP length increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">Certain example frame structures are disclosed in the context of an OFDM-based mmW downlink data enhancement that may be incorporated into an OFDM-based LTE small cell network. Other waveform implementations, including, for example, broadband SC and MC-CDMA may use different structures and/or parameters. The general principles disclosed herein may be applicable to other waveform implementations that may be used for mmW transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">The mmW downlink data enhancement may employ physical layer channels and reference signals as disclosed herein in addition to LTE physical channels. The mmW downlink data enhancement may employ a beam-specific reference signal (BSRS). BSRS may be a sequence associated with a transmit beam used for beam acquisition, timing and/or frequency synchronization, channel estimation for a physical downlink directional control channel (PDDCCH), fine beam tracking, beam measurement, etc. BSRS may carry (e.g., implicitly carry) beam identity information. There may be different types of BSRS. For example, there may be BSRS for an mmW sector and its member segments. The segment may be used in a switch beam system as disclosed herein and as illustrated, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The segment may be referred as a beam direction (e.g., a narrow beam direction a wide beam direction).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">A physical downlink directional data channel (PDDDCH) may be provided. PDDDCH may carry payload information received as a medium access control protocol data unit (MAC PDU) from the MAC layer. The resource allocation of this channel may be determined by the downlink scheduling information carried in PDDCCH. The PDDDCH for an mWTRU may be transmitted in a narrow transmit beam.

The dedicated PDDCCH may be associated with a PDDCCH on a per-TTI basis. A common PDDCCH may include beam-specific information, such as segment identity, for an mWTRU to identify the transmit beam.

One or more of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), or Hybrid Multiplexing may be applied. PDDCCH and PDDDCH may be multiplexed in the time domain in a TTI. The PDDCCH may be decoded, and the PDDDCH demodulation and decoding may start before the end of a TTI. This may be less demanding of data buffering resources and may reduce latency. PDDCCH occupancy of the allocated frequency spectrum may reduce the efficiency. PDDCCH and PDDDCH may be multiplexed in the frequency domain in a TTI. PDDCCH and PDDDCH decoding may not start until the end of a TTI. An mWTRU may use a large buffer for the data because the allocated bandwidth may be large in the mmW frequency band.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Intra-beam multiple access may involve scheduling multiple mWTRUs in a downlink transmit beam. For example, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) may involve multiple mWTRUs assigned with different frequency allocation and receiving simultaneously. The mWTRUs may receive a strong downlink signal in similar angular incoming directions. The best beam for one mWTRU may not be the best beam for another mWTRU. A jointly configured (e.g., optimized) beam (e.g., suboptimal for all) may be used. The SCmB may schedule an mWTRU within a beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Time division multiple access (TDMA) may involve multiple mWTRUs assigned with frequencies allocated in the transmit beam.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) may involve multiple mWTRUs located at a distance from each other in the transmit beam and a large path loss difference. The mWTRUs may use the same frequency and time resources, e.g., non-orthogonal, but may use superposition coding and successive interference cancellation (SIC) to remove the interfering signal successively. The channel estimation for an mWTRU may use a more complex design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Inter-beam multiple access may involve scheduling multiple mWTRUs in different downlink transmit beams. Spatial division multiple access (SDMA) may involve multiple mWTRUs assigned in different transmit beams. The mWTRUs may be allocated with identical frequency resources and may receive simultaneously (e.g., MU-MIMO). Receive beamforming may use interference rejection combining (IRC). FDMA may involve multiple mWTRUs assigned in different transmit beams allocated with different frequency resources. TDMA may involve multiple mWTRUs assigned in different transmit beams assigned with identical frequency resources and receiving in turn according to scheduling. This may be similar to intra-beam TDMA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">An mWTRU may use a phase antenna array to achieve an antenna gain for compensating for the high path loss at mmW frequencies, at which the short wavelength may allow a compact form factor of the device design. While an element spacing of 0.5λ may be used in theoretical performance analysis, in practice a larger spacing, such as 0.7λ, may be applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">An antenna element may have a dedicated RF chain, which may include RF processing and analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The signal processed by an antenna element may be controlled independently in phase and/or amplitude to configure (e.g., optimize) the channel capacity. While this mWTRU antenna configuration may provide very high performance, it may have a high cost and complexity in implementation and high energy consumption in operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">An mWTRU may employ a hybrid approach in which analog beamforming may be performed over phase array elements associated with a phase shifter and connected to an RF chain. The phase of the signal at an antenna element may be adjusted in the beamforming. Digital precoding may be applied on the baseband signals of one or more RF chains (e.g., all RF chains) when there is more than one RF chain. Spatial diversity and MIMO schemes may be implemented using digital precoding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">System parameters of hybrid beamforming may include a number of data streams N<sub>DATA</sub>, a number of RF chains (TRX) N<sub>TRX</sub>, a number of antenna ports N<sub>AP</sub>, a number of antenna elements N<sub>AE</sub>, and/or a number of phase antenna arrays N<sub>PAA</sub>.</div>

Multicast-broadcast single-frequency network (MBSFN) reference signals may be transmitted on antenna port p=4. mWTRU-specific reference signals associated with physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) may be transmitted on one or more antenna ports p=5, p=7, p=8, or one or more of p∈{7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}. Demodulation reference signals associated with enhanced physical downlink control channel (EPDCCH) may be transmitted on one or more of antenna ports p∈{107, 108, 109, 110}.

When N<sub>DATA</sub>=N<sub>TRX</sub>=1, an mWTRU may have a single-beam configuration and may operate one beam at a time. The mWTRU beamforming may form a narrow beam pattern, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, at an angular direction, e.g., the strongest angular direction, e.g., a LOS path estimated from beam measurement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The mWTRU may form a broad beam pattern having a wide main lobe, an example of which is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, to cover a range of continuous angular directions including strong and weak ones in between.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The mWTRU may adaptively form a beam pattern with multiple distinct strong lobes, an example of which is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, to receive at two or more different incoming angular directions. Multiple transmit beams may be directed, for example, at multiple strong specular reflection paths to take advantage of spatial diversity. The forming of this beam pattern may reduce the antenna gain compared to a narrow beam pattern. The adaptive beam pattern may use a beamforming algorithm to have continuous steering and forming capability to dynamically adjust the beam pattern in response to the estimated channel conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">When N<sub>DATA</sub>=1&lt;N<sub>TRX</sub>, for example, when N<sub>TRX</sub>=2, an mWTRU may have two simultaneous beam patterns and the beam patterns may be different and used for different applications. The mWTRU may place two narrow beam patterns at different angular incoming directions to utilize spatial diversity and mitigate the blockage effect and/or weak LOS condition. This may facilitate beam combining. The mWTRU may place two narrow beam patterns at different angular incoming directions and may apply a fast beam switching mechanism when one beam's channel conditions deteriorate, e.g., quickly. The mWTRU may form a narrow beam and a broad beam for different applications. For example, the narrow beam may be used for traffic, and the broad beam may be used for control signaling.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In fixed codebook-based beamforming, a grid of beams may include a set of fixed beams. A beam may be formed by the mWTRU applying a beamforming vector v chosen from a predefined codebook v∈{v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3 </sub>. . . v<sub>n</sub>}, where N may denote the number of fixed beams. Each vector may include pre-calibrated phase shifts for phase shifters and may represent an analog beam direction, e.g., a beam. The number of beams may depend on the half-power-beam-width (HPBW) and desired coverage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Eigenvalue-based beamforming may involve a precoding applied eigenvalue-based weight vector based on short-term channel information. The algorithm may perform well in scenarios with increased multipath and high angular spread and low mWTRU mobility. Such beamforming may provide the adaptive beamforming capability to track channel conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Small cell mmW base station (SCmB) beamforming schemes may include fixed beam, adaptive beamforming, e.g., codebook-based and non-codebook-based, and classical beamforming, e.g., DoA estimation. A scheme may use different procedures. For example, the DoA estimation may use a smaller angular spread, and an mWTRU may transmit an LTE band uplink reference signal for AS range estimation to provide DoA accuracy. The fixed beam system may use beam cycling and beam switch mechanisms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">A legacy (e.g., LTE) WTRU antenna configuration may have an omnidirectional radiation pattern with an antenna gain of 0 dBi. Such antenna configuration may be used in RAN1/RAN4 system and link simulation for evaluation of various technologies, including, e.g., release 12 (R12) 3D MIMO/beamforming. The WTRU antenna beam may be fixed at a wide beam width, e.g., 120° with a maximum 3 dBi gain in elevation and 0 dBi in azimuth. The WTRU may receive a downlink beamformed physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) with the help of a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) carrying information including antenna port, number of layers, scrambling identity, etc. The associated demodulation reference signal (DMRS) may be WTRU-specific and may be beamformed along with data symbols.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">SCmB and mWTRU may form highly directional and narrow beam patterns to provide beamforming gain, for example, to overcome the significant path loss experienced by the mmW channels and to meet the link budget for the SCmB deployment. The mmW control information may be transmitted and received within a beam pair. The dedicated nature of the control signaling due to the spatial isolation may involve a different control signaling and data scheduling than may be used in some LTE systems. Systems, methods, instrumentalities may be provided to receive mmW scheduling information in paired mmW narrow beam patterns, e.g., from narrow-beam-common PDDCCH and/or dedicated PDDCCH to PDDDCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">An SCmB and one or more mWTRUs may operate in LTE and mmW frequency bands. Such SCmB and mWTRUs may use the mmW frequency band for data, e.g., transmit data in mmW narrow beam patterns. Such SCmB and mWTRUs may apply a cross-system scheduling, e.g., schedule mmW data via LTE downlink channels. The mmW DCI carried in LTE channels may include dynamic per-TTI scheduling information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Control signaling and scheduling design may take into account multiple design issues, including the timing difference between the two systems, the inequality of TTI lengths of the two systems, and/or the LTE scheduling mechanism. Procedures may use LTE channels to schedule PDDDCH, e.g., from PDCCH/EPDCCH/PDSCH to PDDDCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Carrying dynamic per-TTI mmW DCI in LTE channels may reduce cross-system scheduling efficiency due to operation difference between the two systems. To better utilize the LTE channel resources, the SCmB may use LTE channels for relatively static mmW DCI and may transmit PDDCCH in mmW narrow beams to convey the dynamic per-TTI mmW DCI. The design may use coordination and sequencing of the mmW DCI over different LTE channels and PDDCCH. Procedures may apply such a multi-stage cross-system scheduling, e.g., from PDCCH/EPDCCH/PDSCH to dedicated PDDCCH to PDDDCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">An SCmB may form an mmW broad beam pattern to carry control information (e.g., layer one (L1) control information) for mWTRUs associated with an mmW cell or sector. mWTRU receive beam may receive a downlink broad beam in a configured beam position. A broad beam may carry control information for one or more users. The signaling associated with control information may be multiplexed. Systems, methods, instrumentalities may be provided to an mWTRU to detect and/or receive control signaling from a downlink mmW broad beam pattern, e.g., broad beam PDDCCH to PDDDCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Millimeter wave (mmW) downlink control information (mDCI) may include mWTRU beam scheduling and dynamic per-beam pair structure configuration information. mDCI signaling may carry control information that may be used for the downlink mmW data scheduling, e.g., information used for an mWTRU to locate, demodulate, and/or decode the PDDDCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include transmit and receive beam scheduling information. Such scheduling information may be used for an mWTRU to identify transmit and/or receive beam to be used for the scheduled data transmission. The information may be signaled, for example, using an antenna port number or a beam identification number or may be derived, for example, from a code assignment, such as BSRS index. An SCmB scheduler may assign mmW data to an mWTRU, for example, based on channel measurements specific to a receive beam and a LTE channel measurement. For example, channel quality indication (CQI) may not be associated with a receive beam that is used for the measurement. The network at the transmitter may have information regarding the available options for the receive beam. Since the receiver orientation may alter, a receiver beam may be specified in global coordinates rather than relative to the mWTRU orientation, for example, by compensating via use of gyros, compasses, and the like. This beam-specific scheduling information may be carried in a common PDDCCH or a dedicated PDDCCH or an LTE channel, for example, depending on the control signaling design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include dynamic frame structure configuration information. The time slot or subframe configuration for downlink and uplink allocation may be altered (e.g., dynamically altered) to adapt to the downlink and uplink traffic load. This configuration may be per beam pair, e.g., between an SCmB and an mWTRU. A plurality of (e.g., two) beam pairs may use different time division duplex (TDD) configurations without downlink-to-uplink and/or uplink-to-downlink interference between the beam pairs, for example, because of spatial isolation that may be provided due the narrow beam pairing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include scheduling duration information. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates examples of dynamic predictive scheduling per beam pair (e.g., between SCmB transmit (Tx) Beam 1 and mWTRU Rx Beam 3, and between SCmB Tx Beam 2 and mWTRU Rx Beam 2). As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the number of mmW TTIs scheduled in a PDDCCH may vary, for example, using predictive scheduling. The SCmB may configure (e.g., predictively configure) multiple consecutive TTIs in a beam pair to be scheduled at one time. The configuration of multiple consecutive TTIs may depend on the channel condition. For example, in case of SCmB Tx Beam 1/mWTRU Rx Beam 3 beam pair, for subframe N <b>1302</b>, three consecutive TTIs (<b>1304</b>) may be configured, whereas, in case of SCmB Tx Beam 2/mWTRU Rx Beam 2 beam pair, for sub-frame N <b>1302</b>, four consecutive TTIs (<b>1306</b>) may be configured. The number of the consecutive TTIs may be conveyed in the dynamic frame structure configuration information carried in the dedicated PDDCCH. For example, a scheduling validity period value indicating the number of consecutive TTIs. The multiple TTI configuration may save signaling overhead. Because of the exclusive nature of the dedicated PDDCCH, the interference between different mWTRUs may be eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include PDDDCH frequency resource allocation information. For example, the PDDDCH frequency resource allocation may include location of the frequency resource that the PDDDCH applies, e.g., RBs in the OFDM-based system or carrier indicator in the SC-based system. The number of bits used may depend on one or more factors including the system bandwidth, scheduling granularity, etc. Localized or distributed allocation may be considered. The mmW channel within the narrow beam may not have as much frequency selectivity as the distributed allocation may exploited, e.g., as in the LTE channel. The DMRS associated with the PDDDCH may be placed in the allocated region according to a pre-standardized pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include PDDCCH frequency resource allocation information. For example, the PDDCCH frequency resource allocation information may include the location of the frequency resource that the PDDCCH applies. This may be similar to PDDDCH frequency resource allocation when PDDCCH and PDDDCH are time-multiplexed in an mmW narrow beam as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. PDDCCH may be placed separately in an mmW broad beam. The allocation of PDDCCH may be pre-standardized without explicit real-time signaling in a similar way as how PDCCH operates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include code assignment information. For example, the code assignment information may include configuration of BSRS sequence index or scrambling code index that an mWTRU may use to detect and/or demodulate the BSRS and/or data transmission. The scrambling code may be used on PDDDCH or PDDCCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include carrier indicator information. Within a beam pair, the mmW data transmission may use carrier aggregation. An mWTRU may receive scheduling information applicable to a different SC-based or OFDM-based carrier than the one that carries the control information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include information associated with the modulating and coding scheme, such as the transport format of the data transmitted in the scheduled TTI, including information relating to a coding rate and modulating scheme. A set of predefined MCS values corresponding specific coding rates and modulation schemes may be used, for example, in the form of an MCS table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include data indication information that may indicate whether the scheduled TTI has a new data transmission or a retransmission. mDCI may include redundancy version information that may identify which redundancy version of a retransmission is carried in the scheduled TTI. The redundancy version may be applied in an incremental redundancy retransmission scheme.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include information relating to the number of layers. An mmW data transmission may include multiple layers to utilize multiple input multiple output (MIMO) application along with beamforming. A mWTRU may de-map the data from different layers based on this information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include a channel state information request. The SCmB may request channel state information, including channel quality indicator (CQI), precoding matrix indicator (PMI), rank indicator (RI), etc. The CQI measurement may be beam specific and based on BSRS. The SCmB may transmit specific CSI-RS in the frequency allocation in the beam. Such a beam may not be used for the data or for scheduling purpose. The CQI may be wide band or subband.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include a beam-specific measurement request. The SCmB may request a quality measurement specific to a certain transmit beam for scheduling purpose. An associated beam measurement occasion may be configured explicitly in this request or may be implicitly indicated based on configurations signaled beforehand, for example, in SIB. The beam specific measurement may be an analog measurement as opposed to a digital signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based CQI measurement. For example, an mWTRU may detect energy at a specific frequency resource to determine the strength of a beam. The beam quality measurement may be a layer 1 (L1) measurement and feedback mechanism that provide real-time beam-specific information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) may include mmW UCI resource allocation. The uplink resource may be allocated implicitly for mmW uplink channel state information or other reporting of measurement. The association between a downlink mmW transmission and the UCI resource allocation may be realized in, for example, the specific beam information, frequency resource allocation, code assignment, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">Certain scheduling information, such as beam scheduling, may be provided for long-term. The decoding of the long-term scheduling information may be periodic or triggered by certain predefined events. These events may include, for example, degradation of beam strength or SINR, a higher layer command, and/or consistent measurement of a better beam pair for the mmW sector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">Periodic and configured mWTRU receive narrow beam cycling may be used to detect mmW sector BSRS. Such receive beam cycling may also be used to read common PDDCCH for mmW segment identity for two-dimensional beam-specific measurement of beam signal strength or beam signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) metrics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) transmission may vary, e.g., based on the control signaling and/or scheduling procedure design. The control signaling and scheduling procedure design may be based on the transmit beam configuration and/or the receive beam configuration, the cooperation between LTE and mmW systems, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">Transmission of one or more DCI parameters may be conveyed, for example, depending on the system design. Certain DCI parameters may be transmitted differently from others and may have different application in each scheduling instance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">Millimeter wave downlink control information (mDCI) transmission for an mWTRU may be carried out in a physical layer channel or sequentially in multiple (e.g., two) physical layer channels. For example, a dedicated PDDCCH may carry per-TTI scheduling information including MCS. The per-TTI scheduling information may be applied to an associated PDDDCH without beam specific information. A common PDDCCH may be used by an mWTRU to identify the beam and extract the dedicated PDDDCH. A portion of the mmW DCI may be carried in higher layer signaling.</div>

The small cell coverage <b>1402</b> may be located within a broad beam system, e.g., a macro LTE sector <b>1404</b>. The mmW coverage may be implemented by using, for example, six mmW PAAs. Each of the PAAs may be used with one or more narrow beams of, for example, 10° horizontal beam width. The number of simultaneous SCmB beams within an mmW sector may be limited due to hardware complexity and cost. For example, six beam directions that may be considered as a segment, when an SCmB operates a fixed beam system with a narrow beam of 10° half power bandwidth (HPBW) in a mmW sector. The SCmB may cycle the narrow beam in the segments according to certain configurations, including pattern, periodicity, power, etc.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">The received configuration may include configuration regarding mmW sector BSRS code indices that may identify each mmW sector. For example, the BSRS may use a pseudorandom sequence, such as a Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence with good auto- and cross-correlation properties and with good performance against timing and frequency offsets.

The mmW sector and segment to detect and measure at a receive beam direction may be requested and/or configured by the network. For example, an mWTRU may be configured to use a subset of receive beam directions and mmW segments for subsequent measurement.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">The mWTRU may synchronize in timing and frequency with the strongest BSRS that may belong to its associated SCmB. The mWTRU may synchronize with the strongest BSRS from a non-co-sited mmW sector, e.g., if there is no BSRS strong enough to be detected. The mWTRU may report zero or no metric at this receiver beam direction, e.g., if no BSRS is detected.</div>

The metric may be quantized to integer values according to a predefined table. This information may be on a per-receive-beam basis as illustrated in Table 2 with a beam configuration of six segments per mmW sector and six receive beam positions of an mWTRU. The example may assume a metric table ranging from 1 (e.g., minimum SINR or beam strength) to 32 (e.g., maximum SINR or beam strength).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">The mWTRU may report the measured mmW segment metric at an mWTRU receive beam direction to the network. This receive beam cycling and measurement of an mmW sector and segment may provide the network with the information for mmW sector association and data scheduling. The reporting may include the beam-specific measurement results as illustrated in Table 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">The mWTRU may report the measurement metric whose values are above a preconfigured threshold. For example, Table 3 illustrates a threshold-based measurement with a threshold of 10.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">A periodic and selectively-configured beam cycling and measurement may provide input to the scheduling procedure. The mmW DCI may include beam allocation information. The scheduled mWTRU may place the receive beam accordingly and may synchronize with the BSRS without searching for a transmit beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">An mmW narrow-beam-common PDDCCH may be used for long-term scheduling of an mWTRU receive beam. A dedicated PDDCCH may be used for per-TTI dynamic scheduling of PDDDCH. The mmW narrow beam pattern transmitted by an SCmB may carry PDDCCH and PDDDCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">Per-TTI mmW data scheduling information may be carried in a dedicated PDDCCH. The transmit and receive beam scheduling information may be carried in a common PDDCCH. The transmit and receive beam scheduling information may be intended for one mWTRU per beam. An mWTRU may detect its beam scheduling information of the common PDDCCH using an WTRU specific identity information, e.g., international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI)/cell radio network temporary identifier (C-RNTI)/mmW radio network temporary identifier (mmW-RNTI) scrambled cell-specific reference signal (CRS) and/or payload may be scrambled with the identity information as provided above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">An mWTRU may begin with a periodic or requested beam cycling as disclosed herein. Configuration parameters may be used for the initial beam acquisition, such as transmit beam cycling periodicity, number of transmit beams, transmit beam BSRS code index, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">The mWTRU may cycle its coverage and may detect transmit beams, e.g., mmW segments, at a receive beam direction (e.g., each receive beam direction). The transmit beam that carries the data transmission may have mWTRU-specific information in the common PDDCCH, e.g., the mWTRU's C-RNTI, mmW-RNTI, or other identity. The mWTRU may detect a transmit beam at a receive beam direction. The mWTRU may decode the common PDDCCH. The mWTRU may detect the scheduling and may start the data transmission. The per-TTI scheduling data may be obtained from the dedicated PDDCCH, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The mWTRU may receive transmit and/or receive beam scheduling information in the common PDDCCH and the dynamic per-TTI scheduling information in the dedicated PDDCCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a mWTRU (e.g., mWTRU1) may form an mmW narrow receive beam. The mWTRU may form an mmW narrow receive beam according to the cycling pattern, periodicity, and/or other configuration parameters. The other configuration parameters may be determined according to the mWTRU capability and/or signaling from the network. The receive beam forming may be based on an event-triggered monitoring of the common or dedicated PDDCCH for upcoming scheduling instances or a periodic cycling for measurement and scheduling monitoring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">The mWTRU may correlate and detect sector BSRS. The mWTRU may subsequently segment BSRS according to the BSRS configuration. The duration at an mWTRU receive beam direction may be derived from the duration of the SCmB beam at a segment.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">The scheduling information used for a TTI within a transmit/receive beam pair, based on channel condition, may be suitable for one or more TTIs (e.g., consecutive TTIs).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">The mmW DCI in the dedicated PDDCCH may carry a control field to indicate the validity period in terms of a number of TTIs during which the same scheduling information may apply. The mWTRU may not attempt to decode the dedicated PDDCCH in the subsequent TTIs, as the entire TTI length may be occupied by the PDDDCH. This may save control signaling overhead, and such configuration may vary in a beam pair and due to the spatial isolation between beam pairs, no interference may arise from this configuration. The validity period may vary depending on the channel condition of a beam pair.</div>
