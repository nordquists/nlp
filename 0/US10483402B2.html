<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In this specification, a semiconductor device means all devices which can function by utilizing semiconductor characteristics, and an electrooptic device, a semiconductor circuit, and an electronic device are all semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A metal oxide silicon field-effect transistor (MOSFET), which is formed over a silicon substrate, has been applied to a wide range of electronic devices such as an integrated circuit (IC) and an image display device (display device).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The operation speed and integration degree of a MOSFET are improved by miniaturization in accordance with the scaling law as follows: reduction in the size of a MOSFET to 1/k increases its speed k times and reduces its electric power to 1/k<sup>2</sup>. In this manner, reduction in the channel length and reduction in the thickness of a gate insulating film of a MOSFET have been achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">With the reduction in the channel length of a MOSFET, however, deterioration in electric characteristics becomes pronounced, that is, a problem of a short-channel effect occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">An example of the short-channel effects is deterioration in electric characteristics due to a punch-through phenomenon. The punch-through phenomenon is a phenomenon in which an electric field on the drain side adversely affects a diffusion potential on the source side and decreases it, and a current flows between the source and the drain even in the state where a channel is not formed. In other words, a depletion layer on the drain side extends to the source and produces, on the source, an effect of the electric field on the drain side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Another example of the short-channel effects is deterioration in electric characteristics due to hot carriers. Hot carriers generated by application of high electric field to the vicinity of a drain region have energy large enough to pass an oxide film such as a gate insulating film, and part of the hot carriers causes deterioration, such as change (shift) in threshold voltage, increase in sub-threshold value (S value), or increase in leakage current in a transistor, by being captured in the gate insulating film or by forming an interface level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, injection of a carrier generated due to collisional ionization or avalanche breakdown into an oxide film as a hot carrier (such a carrier is called drain avalanche hot carrier: DAHC) and injection of a hot carrier generated due to the second collisional ionization (such a carrier is called secondarily generated hot electron: SGHE) also cause deterioration in electric characteristics of a transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">To suppress such a short-channel effect of a MOS transistor, reduction in thickness of a gate insulating film has been attempted. With a thin gate insulating film, the gate electrode layer can be close to a channel region, and thus influence of the gate electrode layer on the channel region is enhanced, which can suppress the above short-channel effect. Accordingly, reduction in the thickness of the gate insulating film, which improves the operation speed and integration degree of a MOSFET and suppresses a short-channel effect of the MOSFET, has been used as an effective technique for the MOSFET.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">However, reduction in the thickness of the gate insulating film (3 nm or less, for example) causes a problem of a tunnel current passing through the gate insulating film. To solve this problem, study in which instead of silicon oxide, a high-k material (e.g., hafnium oxide), which has a higher permittivity than silicon oxide, is used as a material of the gate insulating film has been conducted (e.g., see Patent Documents 1 and 2). With the use of a high-k material, effective thickness for silicon oxide (equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) which is obtained by convertion into a film thickness of silicon oxide) of the gate insulating film can be reduced (to 3 nm or less, for example) while the physical thickness thereof can be large enough to prevent a tunnel current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, some measures for preventing a short-channel effect of a MOSFET including a silicon semiconductor have been needed; for example, a special impurity region (such a region is called a pinning region) is formed in a channel formation region (e.g., see Patent Document 3).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, as a means for preventing deterioration of a MOS transistor due to hot carriers, a structure having a region where an impurity element is added at a low concentration (hereinafter also referred to as LDD (lightly doped drain) region) between a channel formation region and a source or drain region has been known (for example, see Patent Document 4). Since an electric field in the vicinity of the drain region is increased as the distribution of an impurity concentration at a junction between the drain region and a channel region is steeper, the formation of such an LDD region between the drain region and the channel region can reduce electric-field concentration and relieve a hot carrier effect. On the other hand, the formation of the LDD region increases the diffusive resistance in a drain part, which leads to decrease in switching speed of a transistor; or the formation of the LDD region increases series resistance in the drain part, which leads to decrease in on-state current of the transistor. Furthermore, a transistor increases in its size by an area of the LDD region, which runs counter to a demand for miniaturization of a transistor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of the above, an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device including a transistor with a shortened channel length in which a short-channel effect is not or is hardly generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a minute transistor in which a short-channel effect is not or is hardly generated even when the transistor is not provided with an LDD region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a high-performance semiconductor device including a minute transistor which achieves high-speed operation, high integration, and low power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device including a minute transistor which achieves high reliability and low cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">One embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor device including a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film having a channel formation region, a gate insulating film, and a gate electrode layer. In the transistor, the channel length is short (greater than or equal to 5 nm and less than 60 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 40 nm), and the thickness of the gate insulating film is large (equivalent oxide thickness which is obtained by converting into a thickness of silicon oxide containing nitrogen is greater than or equal to 5 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 40 nm). In the transistor of the semiconductor device, a short-channel effect is not or is hardly generated. Furthermore, the transistor has favorable electric characteristics as a switching element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">As described above, in an FET (MOSFET, Si-FET) including bulk silicon, a short-channel effect is generated because of miniaturization of a MOSFET in accordance with the scaling law. Although reduction in the thickness of the gate insulating film is effective in suppressing a short-channel effect, a tunnel current passing through the gate insulating film is generated. As to a MOSFET, when the thickness of a gate insulating film, such as an insulating film containing silicon oxide (e.g., a silicon oxide film or a silicon oxide film containing nitrogen), is not reduced, a depletion layer is less likely to extend and thus high-speed operation is difficult; on the other hand, when the thickness of the gate insulating film is reduced, a tunnel current is generated. Accordingly, to achieve high-speed operation and ensure the reliability, a high-k material (whose relative permittivity is about 20 to 30, for example) having a higher permittivity than the insulating film containing silicon oxide (whose relative permittivity is 3.8 to 4.1, for example) is used for the gate insulating film without reduction in the film thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">An oxide semiconductor used in one embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor whose physical properties are unique and completely different from those of a silicon semiconductor. The oxide semiconductor has a small number of minority carriers, so that a depletion layer is likely to extend over an extremely large area. Therefore, the use of the high-k material having a high permittivity for the gate insulating film is not needed, and an insulating film having an equivalent oxide thickness which is obtained by converting into a thickness of silicon oxide containing nitrogen of greater than or equal to 5 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 40 nm can be used. Even with the use of an insulating film with the equivalent oxide thickness, a depletion layer of an oxide semiconductor extends over an extremely large area, which makes high-speed operation possible, and a tunnel current is not generated and thus leakage current is also not generated, which leads to high reliability. Furthermore, defects in shape, such as poor coverage, due to reduction in the thickness of the gate insulating film can be also suppressed, thereby suppressing variations in yield and characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Another embodiment of the present invention is a transistor with a single drain structure in which an oxide semiconductor is used for a channel formation region and an LDD region is not provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">With the use of an oxide semiconductor for a channel formation region of a transistor, a short-channel effect is not generated or is not generated substantially even in the case where the channel length of the transistor is shortened. That is, the transistor including an oxide semiconductor does not need a structure (typified by an LDD region) which has been applied to a conventional transistor including silicon for suppressing a short-channel effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">A short-channel effect, which may be generated in a transistor including silicon (hereinafter also referred to as Si-FET), is less likely to be generated in a transistor including an oxide semiconductor (hereinafter also referred to as OS-FET), which will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">As an example of short-channel effects generated in a Si-FET, there is a punch-through phenomenon caused by drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL). By focusing on the curve widths of the band near junctions between an oxide semiconductor and source and drain electrodes, the reason why DIBL generated in a Si-FET is less likely to be generated in an OS-FET will be explained below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> each schematically illustrate a band structure between a source and a drain in an n-type Si-FET. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates a band structure with a long channel, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> illustrates a band structure with a short channel. The case where the gate voltage V<sub>g </sub>is 0 (i.e., the transistor is off) will be described below as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown by solid lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, even when the drain voltage V<sub>d </sub>is 0, the bands are curved in the vicinity of the p-n junction interface. This is because carriers transfer such that the Fermi levels of an n<sup>+</sup> region and a p region are equal to each other, so that a space-charge region (a depletion layer) of donor ions and acceptor ions is formed and an electric field is generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Here, by application of drain voltage V<sub>d</sub>, the band in the n<sup>+</sup> region on the drain side decreases by eV<sub>d </sub>and the area of the depletion layer increases, as shown by dotted lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>. At this time, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the band on the source side is not influenced in the case where the channel length is sufficiently long. On the other hand, in the case of a short channel shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the depletion layer on the drain side easily extends toward the source side, which leads to decrease in the potential of the p region (DIBL). As a result, a current is likely to flow and the threshold voltage is shifted in the negative direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above, a cause of a short-channel effect in the Si-FET illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> is increase in the width of the depletion layer on the drain side, i.e., the increase in the width of the curve of the band, due to the drain voltage V<sub>d</sub>. The curve widths of the band near junctions between source and drain electrodes and a channel formation region in a Si-FET and an OS-FET are analytically derived, and the easiness (difficulty) of occurrence of a short-channel effect in each transistor will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a band structure on a source side of an n-type Si-FET. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, first, the curve width L<sub>S</sub> <sup>Si </sup>of a band on the source side in a p region of the n-type Si-FET is obtained. Note that L<sub>S</sub> <sup>Si </sup>represents the curve width of a band on the source side in a p region, and is equal to the width of a space-charge region (a depletion layer) having acceptor ions. Note that y represents a distance from the p-n junction interface, and the origin of a potential is the intrinsic level E<sub>ip</sub>L<sup>Si </sup>in the p region. Furthermore, ϕ(y) represents the potential of a region at a distance of y from a p-n junction interface, and the origin of ϕ(y) is the intrinsic level E<sub>ipL</sub> <sup>Si </sup>in the p region. Furthermore, eϕ<sub>F</sub> <sup>Si </sup>represents a difference between E<sub>ipL</sub> <sup>Si </sup>and a Fermi level E<sub>F</sub> <sup>Si</sup>, and is defined as follows: eϕ<sub>F</sub> <sup>Si</sup>=E<sub>ipL</sub> <sup>Si</sup>−E<sub>F</sub> <sup>Si</sup>. Here, e represents elementary charge. The curve width of the band reflects a spatial variance of potential ϕ(y), and Poisson equation in Formula (1) needs to be solved.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a band structure between a source and a drain in an OS-FET.

In this case, the curve of the band in the oxide semiconductor region is thought to be derived from the electron density n<sup>OS</sup>(y) (electrons correspond to majority carriers), so that the charge density ρ is represented by Formula (8).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Surprisingly, in the transistor including an oxide semiconductor, L<sub>D</sub> <sup>OS </sup>does not depend on V<sub>d </sub>as described above. Therefore, DIBL does not occur or hardly occurs in the transistor including an oxide semiconductor, and it can be said that a short-channel effect caused by DIBL does not occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The depletion layer extends toward a lower concentration region. In the transistor including silicon, a low concentration n-type region (LDD region) is provided to suppress the extension of the depletion layer in a channel; thus, decrease in the potential of the p region (DIBL) can be suppressed. However, since DIBL does not occur in the transistor including an oxide semiconductor as described above, a short-channel effect can be suppressed without an LDD region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The energy gap (Eg) of the oxide semiconductor is 2.8 eV to 3.2 eV, which is wider than the energy gap (Eg) of silicon of 1.1 eV. This also contributes to non-occurrence or extremely low occurrence of a short-channel effect in the transistor including an oxide semiconductor. The collisional ionization occurs when the kinetic energy of a carrier (electron or hole) is greater than or equal to the band gap of a semiconductor; accordingly, the wider the band gap is, the lower the possibility of occurrence of collisional ionization becomes. Similarly, an avalanche breakdown phenomenon, in which a pair of an electron and a hole generated by collisional ionization is accelerated by an electric field and collisional ionization repeatedly occurs, so that current is exponentially increased, is less likely to occur in the transistor including an oxide semiconductor than in a transistor including silicon. Therefore, the transistor including an oxide semiconductor has higher resistance to hot carrier degradation than the transistor including silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the transistor including an oxide semiconductor of one embodiment of the present invention has an extremely low density of minority carriers which is about 1×10<sup>−9 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>while the transistor including silicon has a high density of minority carriers which is about 1×10<sup>11 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. Therefore, in the transistor including an oxide semiconductor, majority carriers (electrons) come from only a source of the transistor, so that a punch-through phenomenon and an avalanche breakdown phenomenon do not occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">By the manufacturing method of one embodiment of the present invention, a hydrogen atom and an impurity containing a hydrogen atom, such as water, are thoroughly eliminated from an oxide semiconductor, and the oxide semiconductor and/or an insulator in contact with the oxide semiconductor are/is made to contain oxygen in excess of the stoichiometric composition to compensate oxygen vacancy in the oxide semiconductor, whereby the sources of generating carriers in the oxide semiconductor can be extremely reduced. In the transistor including the oxide semiconductor film having an extremely low density of minority carriers, less oxygen vacancy, and less sources of generating carriers such as hydrogen, leakage current can be extremely small in an off state. For example, in the transistor of one embodiment of the present invention, the leakage current in an off state is about 1 zA/μm at 85° C. to 95° C. (substrate temperature), and is about 1 yA/μm at room temperature (substrate temperature), which are extremely low; thus, the transistor has high reliability. Furthermore, the subthreshold value (S value) of the transistor of one embodiment of the present invention is small and is close to an ideal value. Moreover, the transistors can be stacked to have a higher density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The scale of a depletion layer of the transistor including an oxide semiconductor is meter (m) level, which is extremely large, while the scale of a depletion layer of the transistor including silicon is nanometer (nm) level, which is small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">As described above, the transistor including an oxide semiconductor of one embodiment of the present invention has characteristics completely different from those of a transistor including bulk silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">One embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor device including a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film (typifird by an oxide semiconductor film containing indium, e.g., an oxide semiconductor film containing indium, gallium, and zinc) having a channel formation region; a gate insulating film; and a gate electrode layer. In the semiconductor device, the channel length of the transistor is greater than or equal to 5 nm and less than 60 nm (preferably greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 40 nm), and the equivalent oxide thickness which is obtained by converting into a thickness of silicon oxide containing nitrogen of the gate insulating film is greater than or equal to 5 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm (preferably greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 40 nm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Another embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor device with the above-described structure, in which a barrier layer (typified by an aluminum oxide film) with a thickness greater than or equal to 3 nm and less than or equal to 30 nm is provided over the gate insulating film.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">In this embodiment, embodiments of a semiconductor device and one embodiment of a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device will be described using <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">A transistor <b>440</b> <i>a </i>illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> is an example of a top-gate transistor. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a plan view of the transistor <b>440</b> <i>a</i>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line A-B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Note that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, some components of the transistor <b>440</b> <i>a </i>are not illustrated for clarity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> which is a cross-sectional view in the channel length direction, a semiconductor device including the transistor <b>440</b> <i>a </i>includes, over a substrate <b>400</b> having an insulating surface provided with an insulating film <b>436</b>, an oxide semiconductor film <b>403</b>, a source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a</i>, a drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b</i>, a gate insulating film <b>402</b>, a gate electrode layer <b>401</b>, an insulating film <b>407</b> provided over the gate electrode layer <b>401</b>, and an interlayer insulating film <b>415</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">In the transistor <b>440</b> <i>a</i>, the channel length is short (greater than or equal to 5 nm and less than 60 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 40 nm), and the gate insulating film <b>402</b> is thick (the equivalent oxide thickness which is obtained by converting into a thickness of silicon oxide containing nitrogen is greater than or equal to 5 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 40 nm). The transistor <b>440</b> <i>a </i>exhibits excellent electric characteristics as a switching element, in which a short-channel effect does not occur or hardly occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">The concentration of nitrogen in the silicon oxide film containing nitrogen may be higher than or equal to 0.01 atoms %, preferably higher than or equal to 0.1 atoms % and lower than or equal to 50 atoms %, more preferably higher than or equal to 0.5 atoms % and lower than or equal to 15 atoms %. A silicon oxide film that contains nitrogen at the above concentration is referred to as a silicon oxynitride film in some cases. The relative permittivity of the silicon oxide film containing nitrogen is typically 3.8 to 4.1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">An oxide semiconductor used for the oxide semiconductor film <b>403</b> contains at least indium (In). In particular, In and zinc (Zn) are preferably contained. In addition, as a stabilizer for reducing the variations in electric characteristics of a transistor including the oxide semiconductor, the oxide semiconductor preferably contains gallium (Ga) in addition to In and Zn. Tin (Sn) is preferably contained as a stabilizer. Hafnium (Hf) is preferably contained as a stabilizer. Aluminum (Al) is preferably contained as a stabilizer. Zirconium (Zr) is preferably contained as a stabilizer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">As another stabilizer, one or more selected from lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), or lutetium (Lu) which belong to lanthanoid may be contained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">As the oxide semiconductor, for example, any of the following can be used: indium oxide; tin oxide; zinc oxide; a two-component metal oxide such as an In—Zn-based oxide, an In—Mg-based oxide, or an In—Ga-based oxide; a three-component metal oxide such as an In—Ga—Zn-based oxide (also referred to as IGZO), an In—Al—Zn-based oxide, an In—Sn—Zn-based oxide, an In—Hf—Zn-based oxide, an In—La—Zn-based oxide, an In—Ce—Zn-based oxide, an In—Pr—Zn-based oxide, an In—Nd—Zn-based oxide, an In—Sm—Zn-based oxide, an In—Eu—Zn-based oxide, an In—Gd—Zn-based oxide, an In—Tb—Zn-based oxide, an In—Dy—Zn-based oxide, an In—Ho—Zn-based oxide, an In—Er—Zn-based oxide, an In—Tm—Zn-based oxide, an In—Yb—Zn-based oxide, or an In—Lu—Zn-based oxide; a four-component metal oxide such as an In—Sn—Ga—Zn-based oxide, an In—Hf—Ga—Zn-based oxide, an In—Al—Ga—Zn-based oxide, an In—Sn—Al—Zn-based oxide, an In—Sn—Hf—Zn-based oxide, or an In—Hf—Al—Zn-based oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Note that here, for example, an “In—Ga—Zn-based oxide” means an oxide containing In, Ga, and Zn as its main component and there is no particular limitation on the ratio of In:Ga:Zn. The In—Ga—Zn-based oxide may contain a metal element other than In, Ga, and Zn.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">Alternatively, a material represented by InMO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&gt;0, and m is not an integer) may be used as the oxide semiconductor. Note that M represents one or more metal elements selected from Ga, Fe, Mn, and Co. Alternatively, a material represented by In<sub>2</sub>SnO<sub>5</sub>(ZnO)<sub>n </sub>(n&gt;0, n is an integer) may be used as the oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">For example, an In—Ga—Zn-based oxide with an atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1 (=1/3:1/3:1/3), In:Ga:Zn=2:2:1 (=2/5:2/5:1/5), In:Ga:Zn=3:1:2 (=1/2:1/6:1/3), or any of oxides whose composition is in the neighborhood of the above compositions can be used. Alternatively, an In—Sn—Zn-based oxide with an atomic ratio of In:Sn:Zn=1:1:1 (=1/3:1/3:1/3), In:Sn:Zn=2:1:3 (=1/3:1/6:1/2), or In:Sn:Zn=2:1:5 (=1/4:1/8:5/8), or any of oxides whose composition is in the neighborhood of the above compositions may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">However, without limitation to the materials given above, a material with an appropriate composition may be used as the oxide semiconductor containing indium depending on needed semiconductor characteristics (e.g., mobility, threshold voltage, and variation). In order to obtain needed semiconductor characteristics, it is preferable that the carrier concentration, the impurity concentration, the defect density, the atomic ratio between a metal element and oxygen, the interatomic distance, the density, and the like be set to appropriate values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">For example, high mobility can be obtained relatively easily in the case of using an In—Sn—Zn-based oxide. However, in the case of using an In—Ga—Zn-based oxide, mobility can be increased by reducing the defect density in a bulk.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Note that for example, the expression “the composition of an oxide containing In, Ga, and Zn at the atomic ratio, In:Ga:Zn=a:b:c (a+b+c=1), is in the neighborhood of the composition of an oxide containing In, Ga, and Zn at the atomic ratio, In:Ga:Zn=A:B:C (A+B+C=1)” means that a, b, and c satisfy the following relation: (a−A)<sup>2</sup>+(b−B)<sup>2</sup>+(c−C)<sup>2</sup>≤r<sup>2</sup>. For example, r may be 0.05. The same applies to other oxides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The oxide semiconductor film <b>403</b> is in a single crystal state, a polycrystalline (also referred to as polycrystal) state, an amorphous state, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The oxide semiconductor film <b>403</b> is preferably a c-axis aligned crystalline oxide semiconductor (CAAC-OS) film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The CAAC-OS film is not completely single crystal nor completely amorphous. The CAAC-OS film is an oxide semiconductor film with a crystal-amorphous mixed phase structure where crystal parts and amorphous parts are included in an amorphous phase. Note that in most cases, the crystal part fits inside a cube whose one side is less than 100 nm. From an observation image obtained with a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a boundary between an amorphous part and a crystal part in the CAAC-OS film is not clear. Furthermore, with the TEM, a grain boundary in the CAAC-OS film is not found. Thus, in the CAAC-OS film, a reduction in electron mobility, due to the grain boundary, is suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">In each of the crystal parts included in the CAAC-OS film, a c-axis is aligned in a direction parallel to a normal vector of a surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed or a normal vector of a surface of the CAAC-OS film, triangular or hexagonal atomic arrangement which is seen from the direction perpendicular to the a-b plane is formed, and metal atoms are arranged in a layered manner or metal atoms and oxygen atoms are arranged in a layered manner when seen from the direction perpendicular to the c-axis. Note that, among crystal parts, the directions of the a-axis and the b-axis of one crystal part may be different from those of another crystal part. In this specification, a simple term “perpendicular” includes a range from 85° to 95°. In addition, a simple term “parallel” includes a range from −5° to 5°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Note that in the CAAC-OS film, distribution of crystal parts is not necessarily uniform. For example, in the formation process of the CAAC-OS film, in the case where crystal growth occurs from a surface side of the oxide semiconductor film, the proportion of crystal parts in the vicinity of the surface of the oxide semiconductor film is higher than that in the vicinity of the surface where the oxide semiconductor film is formed in some cases. Furthermore, when an impurity is added to the CAAC-OS film, the crystal part in a region to which the impurity is added becomes amorphous in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Since the c-axes of the crystal parts included in the CAAC-OS film are aligned in the direction parallel to a normal vector of a surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed or a normal vector of a surface of the CAAC-OS film, the directions of the c-axes may be different from each other depending on the shape of the CAAC-OS film (the cross-sectional shape of the surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed or the cross-sectional shape of the surface of the CAAC-OS film). Note that the direction of c-axis of the crystal part is the direction parallel to a normal vector of the surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed just after the formation of the CAAC-OS film or a normal vector of the surface of the CAAC-OS film just after the formation of the CAAC-OS film. The crystal part is formed by film formation or by performing treatment for crystallization such as heat treatment after film formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">With the use of the CAAC-OS film in a transistor, a change in electric characteristics of the transistor due to irradiation with visible light or ultraviolet light is small. Thus, the transistor has high reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">For example, the CAAC-OS film is formed by a sputtering method with a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor sputtering target. When ions collide with the sputtering target, a crystal region included in the sputtering target may be separated from the target along an a-b plane; in other words, a sputtered particle having a plane parallel to an a-b plane (flat-plate-like sputtered particle or pellet-like sputtered particle) may flake off from the sputtering target. In that case, the flat-plate-like sputtered particle reaches a substrate while maintaining their crystal state, whereby the CAAC-OS film can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">For the deposition of the CAAC-OS film, the following conditions are preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">By reducing the amount of impurities entering the CAAC-OS film during the deposition, the crystal state can be prevented from being broken by the impurities. For example, the concentration of impurities (e.g., hydrogen, water, carbon dioxide, or nitrogen) which exist in the deposition chamber may be reduced. Furthermore, the concentration of impurities in a deposition gas may be reduced. Specifically, a deposition gas whose dew point is −80° C. or lower, preferably −100° C. or lower is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">By increasing the substrate heating temperature during the deposition, migration of a sputtered particle is likely to occur after the sputtered particle reaches a substrate surface. Specifically, the substrate heating temperature during the deposition is higher than or equal to 100° C. and lower than or equal to 740° C., preferably higher than or equal to 200° C. and lower than or equal to 500° C. By increasing the substrate heating temperature during the deposition, when the flat-plate-like sputtered particle reaches the substrate, migration occurs on the substrate surface, so that a flat plane of the flat-plate-like sputtered particle is attached to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Furthermore, it is preferable that the proportion of oxygen in the deposition gas be increased and the power be optimized in order to reduce plasma damage at the deposition. The proportion of oxygen in the deposition gas is 30 vol. % or higher, preferably 100 vol. %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">As an example of the sputtering target, an In—Ga—Zn—O compound target is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">The In—Ga—Zn—O compound target, which is polycrystalline, is made by mixing InO<sub>X </sub>powder, GaO<sub>Y </sub>powder, and ZnO<sub>X </sub>powder in a predetermined molar ratio, applying pressure, and performing heat treatment at a temperature higher than or equal to 1000° C. and lower than or equal to 1500° C. Note that X, Y, and Z are each a given positive number. Here, the predetermined molar ratio of InO<sub>X </sub>powder to GaO<sub>Y </sub>powder and ZnO<sub>Z </sub>powder is, for example, 2:2:1, 8:4:3, 3:1:1, 1:1:1, 4:2:3, or 3:1:2. The kinds of powder and the molar ratio for mixing powder may be determined as appropriate depending on the desired sputtering target.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">In an oxide semiconductor having a crystal part such as the CAAC-OS, defects in the bulk can be further reduced and when the surface flatness of the oxide semiconductor is improved, mobility higher than that of an oxide semiconductor in an amorphous state can be obtained. In order to improve the surface flatness, the oxide semiconductor is preferably formed over a flat surface. Specifically, the oxide semiconductor may be formed over a surface with the average surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) of less than or equal to 1 nm, preferably less than or equal to 0.3 nm, more preferably less than or equal to 0.1 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Note that R<sub>a </sub>is obtained by expanding arithmetic mean surface roughness, which is defined by JIS B 0601: 2001 (ISO4287: 1997), into three dimensions so as to be applied to a curved surface.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0355" num="0354">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, a first wiring (1st line) is electrically connected to a source electrode of the transistor <b>160</b>. A second wiring (2nd line) is electrically connected to a drain electrode of the transistor <b>160</b>. A third wiring (3rd line) is electrically connected to one of a source electrode and a drain electrode of the transistor <b>162</b>, and a fourth wiring (4th line) is electrically connected to a gate electrode of the transistor <b>162</b>. A gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> and the one of the source electrode and the drain electrode of the transistor <b>162</b> are electrically connected to one electrode of the capacitor <b>164</b>. A fifth line (5th line) is electrically connected to the other electrode of the capacitor <b>164</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0356" num="0355">The semiconductor device in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> utilizes a characteristic in which the potential of the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> can be held, and can thus write, hold, and read data as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0357" num="0356">Writing and holding of data is described. First, the potential of the fourth line is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>162</b> is turned on, so that the transistor <b>162</b> is turned on. Accordingly, the potential of the third line is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> and the capacitor <b>164</b>. That is, predetermined charge is given to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> (writing). Here, charge for supply of a potential level or charge for supply of a different potential level (hereinafter referred to as Low level charge and High level charge) is given. After that, the potential of the fourth line is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>162</b> is turned off, so that the transistor <b>162</b> is turned off. Thus, the charge given to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> is held (holding).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0358" num="0357">Since the off-state current of the transistor <b>162</b> is extremely low, the charge of the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> is held for a long time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0358">Next, reading of data is described. By supplying an appropriate potential (reading potential) to the fifth line while a predetermined potential (constant potential) is supplied to the first line, the potential of the second line varies depending on the amount of charge held in the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b>. This is because in general, when the transistor <b>160</b> is an n-channel transistor, an apparent threshold voltage V<sub>th_H </sub>in the case where a high-level charge is given to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> is lower than an apparent threshold voltage V<sub>th_L</sub>, in the case where a low-level charge is given to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b>. Here, an apparent threshold voltage refers to the potential of the fifth line, which is needed to turn on the transistor <b>160</b>. Thus, the potential of the fifth line is set to a potential V<sub>0 </sub>that is between V<sub>th_H </sub>and V<sub>th_H</sub>, whereby charge given to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> can be determined. For example, in the case where a high-level charge is given in writing, when the potential of the fifth wiring is set to V<sub>0 </sub>(&gt;V<sub>th_H</sub>), the transistor <b>160</b> is turned on. In the case where a low level charge is given in writing, even when the potential of the fifth wiring is set to V<sub>0 </sub>(&lt;V<sub>th_L</sub>), the transistor <b>160</b> remains in an off state. Therefore, the data held can be read by the potential of the second line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0360" num="0359">Note that in the case where memory cells are arrayed to be used, only data of desired memory cells needs to be read. In the case where such reading is not performed, a potential at which the transistor <b>160</b> is turned off regardless of the state of the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b>, that is, a potential smaller than V<sub>th_H </sub>may be given to the fifth wiring. Alternatively, a potential which allows the transistor <b>160</b> to be turned on regardless of a state of the gate electrode, that is, a potential higher than V<sub>th_L </sub>may be applied to the fifth line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0361" num="0360">When a transistor having a channel formation region formed using an oxide semiconductor and having extremely small off-state current is applied to the semiconductor device in this embodiment, the semiconductor device can hold stored data for an extremely long period. In other words, power consumption can be adequately reduced because refresh operation becomes unnecessary or the frequency of refresh operation can be extremely low. Moreover, stored data can be held for a long period even when power is not supplied (note that a potential is preferably fixed).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0362" num="0361">Furthermore, in the semiconductor device described in this embodiment, high voltage is not needed for writing data and there is no problem of deterioration of elements. For example, unlike a conventional non-volatile memory, it is not necessary to inject and extract electrons into and from a floating gate, and thus a problem such as deterioration of a gate insulating film does not occur at all. In other words, the semiconductor device according to one embodiment of the present invention does not have a limit on the number of times of writing which is a problem in a conventional non-volatile memory, and reliability thereof is drastically improved. Furthermore, data is written depending on the on state and the off state of the transistor, whereby high-speed operation can be easily realized.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0368" num="0367">Next, writing and holding of data in the semiconductor device (a memory cell <b>250</b>) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0369" num="0368">First, the potential of the word line WL is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>162</b> is turned on, so that the transistor <b>162</b> is turned on. Accordingly, the potential of the bit line BL is supplied to the first terminal of the capacitor <b>254</b> (writing). After that, the potential of the word line WL is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>162</b> is turned off, so that the transistor <b>162</b> is turned off. Thus, the potential of the first terminal of the capacitor <b>254</b> is held (holding).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0370" num="0369">Off current is extremely small in the transistor <b>162</b> formed using an oxide semiconductor. For that reason, the potential of the first terminal of the capacitor <b>254</b> (or a charge accumulated in the capacitor <b>254</b>) can be held for an extremely long period by turning off the transistor <b>162</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0371" num="0370">Next, reading of data is described. When the transistor <b>162</b> is turned on, the bit line BL which is in a floating state and the capacitor <b>254</b> are electrically connected to each other, and the charge is redistributed between the bit line BL and the capacitor <b>254</b>. As a result, the potential of the bit line BL is changed. The amount of change in potential of the bit line BL varies depending on the potential of the first terminal of the capacitor <b>254</b> (or the charge accumulated in the capacitor <b>254</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0372" num="0371">For example, the potential of the bit line BL obtained after charge redistribution is (CB*VB0+C*V)/(CB+C), where V is the potential of the first terminal of the capacitor <b>254</b>, C is the capacitance of the capacitor <b>254</b>, CB is the capacitance of the bit line BL (hereinafter also referred to as bit line capacitance), and VB0 is the potential of the bit line BL obtained before the charge redistribution. Therefore, it can be found that the potential of the bit line BL, in the case of holding the potential V1, (=(CB*VB0+C*V1)/(CB+C)) is higher than the potential of the bit line BL, in the case of holding the potential V0, (=(CB*VB0+C*V0)/(CB+C)) assuming that the memory cell <b>250</b> is in either of two states in which the potentials of the first terminal of the capacitor <b>254</b> are V1 and V0 (V1&gt;V0).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0373" num="0372">Then, by comparing the potential of the bit line BL with a predetermined potential, data can be read.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0374" num="0373">As described above, the semiconductor device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> can hold charge that is accumulated in the capacitor <b>254</b> for a long time because the off-state current of the transistor <b>162</b> is extremely small. In other words, power consumption can be adequately reduced because refresh operation becomes unnecessary or the frequency of refresh operation can be extremely low. Moreover, stored data can be held for a long time even when power is not supplied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0375" num="0374">Next, the semiconductor device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is described.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0378" num="0377">It is preferable that a semiconductor material of the transistor provided in the peripheral circuit <b>253</b> is different from that of the transistor <b>162</b>.

Alternatively, an organic semiconductor material or the like may be used. A transistor including such a semiconductor material can operate at sufficiently high speed. Therefore, a variety of circuits (e.g., a logic circuit or a driver circuit) which needs to operate at high speed can be favorably achieved by using the transistor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0391" num="0390">In this embodiment, examples of application of the semiconductor device described in any of the above embodiments to portable devices such as mobile phones, smartphones, and e-book readers will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0392" num="0391">In portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, smartphones, and e-book readers, an SRAM or a DRAM is used to store image data temporarily. This is because response speed of a flash memory is low and thus a flash memory is not suitable for image processing. On the other hand, an SRAM or a DRAM has the following characteristics when used for temporary storage of image data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0393" num="0392">In a normal SRAM, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, one memory cell includes six transistors, which are a transistor <b>801</b>, a transistor <b>802</b>, a transistor <b>803</b>, a transistor <b>804</b>, a transistor <b>805</b>, and a transistor <b>806</b>, and they are driven by an X decoder <b>807</b> and a Y decoder <b>808</b>. The transistors <b>803</b> and <b>805</b> and the transistors <b>804</b> and <b>806</b> each serve as an inverter, and high-speed driving can be performed therewith. However, an SRAM has a disadvantage of large cell area because one memory cell includes six transistors. Provided that the minimum feature size of a design rule is F, the area of a memory cell in an SRAM is generally 100F<sup>2 </sup>to 150F<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, a price per bit of an SRAM is the most expensive among a variety of memory devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0394" num="0393">On the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a memory cell in a DRAM includes a transistor <b>811</b> and a storage capacitor <b>812</b>, and is driven by an X decoder <b>813</b> and a Y decoder <b>814</b>. One cell includes one transistor and one capacitor and thus the area of a memory cell is small. The area of a memory cell of a DRAM is generally less than or equal to 10F<sup>2</sup>. Note that in the case of a DRAM, a refresh operation is always necessary and power is consumed even when a rewriting operation is not performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0395" num="0394">However, the area of the memory cell of the semiconductor device described the above embodiments is about 10F<sup>2 </sup>and frequent refreshing is not needed. Therefore, the area of the memory cell is reduced, and the power consumption can be reduced.</div>

The stored image data A is read periodically from the memory <b>952</b> through the switch <b>955</b> even during that time. After the completion of storing the new image data (the stored image data B) in the memory <b>953</b>, from the next frame for the display <b>957</b>, the stored image data B starts to be read, transmitted to the display <b>957</b> through the switch <b>955</b> and the display controller <b>956</b>, and displayed on the display <b>957</b>.
