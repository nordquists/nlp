<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates generally to the field of medicine and more specifically to a system and method for targeting rhythm irregularities and other rhythm disorders of biological rhythms using shaped ablation. In particular, the present invention can be applied to minimally invasive techniques or surgical techniques to detect, diagnose and treat the biological rhythm disorders. Some embodiments are directed to disorders of heart rhythm, others to electrical disorders of the brain and nervous system and still others to electrical or contractile disorders of the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Brief Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Heart rhythm disorders are very common in the United States, and are significant causes of morbidity, lost days from work, and death. Heart rhythm disorders exist in many forms, of which the most complex and difficult to treat are atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Other rhythms are more simple to treat, but may also be clinically significant including atrial tachycardia (AT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial flutter (AFL), premature atrial complexes/beats (SVE) and premature ventricular complexes/beats (PVC). Under certain conditions, rapid activation of the normal sinus node can cause the heart rhythm disorder of inappropriate sinus tachycardia or sinus node reentry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Treatment of heart rhythm disorders, particularly the complex rhythm disorders of AF, VF and VT, can be very difficult. Pharmacologic therapy is particularly suboptimal for AF (Singh, Singh et al. 2005) and VT or VF (Bardy, Lee et al. 2005) and, as a result, there is significant interest in non-pharmacologic therapy. Ablation is a promising and increasingly used therapy to eliminate heart rhythm disorders by maneuvering a sensor/probe to the heart through the blood vessels, or directly at surgery, then delivering energy to the cause(s) for the heart rhythm disorder to terminate it. Ablation was initially used for ‘simple’ disorders such as SVT, AFL, PVC, PAC, but is increasingly used for treatment of AF (Cappato, Calkins et al. 2005), VT (Reddy, Reynolds et al. 2007) and, to a lesser extent, VF (Knecht, Sacher et al. 2009).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Ablation therapy has been increasingly applied to treat simple and complex heart rhythm disorders. However, the manner in which ablation is applied was derived and adapted from simple heart rhythm disorders, in which activation does not vary from beat to beat, without a clear appreciation of the critical differences in treating complex heart rhythm disorders, in which activation varies from beat to beat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In particular, almost all ablation therapy is delivered to heart tissue as a single point ablation (or ‘lesion’) or as a combination of such lesions with the object of bisecting a continuous reentry circuit to join non-conducting regions of the heart (often by contiguous clusters of such ‘point regions’). This is based on the concept that simple rhythms, such as atrial tachycardias, pulmonary vein tachycardias, focal ventricular tachycardias, atrioventricular nodal reentry and atrioventricular reentry requiring an accessory pathway involve specific abnormalities at small point regions of the heart. After identifying the locations, ablation is applied to these point regions. Other simple rhythms, exemplified by typical and atypical atrial flutter, involve passage of electrical activation through a special region of tissue called an “isthmus”. Ablation is then achieved by a contiguous series of points often named an ablation “line” designed to interrupt or bisect the isthmus, although such ablation lines are often not linear if examined surgically (Cox, <i>Heart Rhythm </i>2005).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">However, ablation therapy for complex rhythm disorders in which activation paths may change from beat-to-beat, such as atrial fibrillation, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, is far more difficult. This is in part because tools to identify and locate the cause of the heart rhythm disorder are poor, hindering attempts to deliver energy to the correct region to terminate and eliminate the disorder. In persistent AF, a highly prevalent form of AF, ablation has a one procedure success rate of only 50-60% (Cheema, Vasamreddy et al. 2006; Calkins, Brugada et al. 2007) despite lengthy 4-5 hour procedures and a 5-10% rate of serious complications (Ellis, Culler et al. 2009) including death (Cappato, Calkins et al. 2009).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">For ‘simple’ disorders such as atrial tachycardia, tools do not exist to precisely identify the size and shape of ablation therapy. This is particularly important since electrical activation does not spread concentrically within the heart from a point source. Differences in longitudinal versus transverse conduction from normal structures such as the sinus node are well described even in normal tissue, and may be more dramatic in abnormal tissue that sustains atrial tachycardias. Nevertheless, the approach to ablation of these rhythms involves either a clustering of points or an ablation “line.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Even less is known about the size and shape of ablation therapy to eliminate complex rhythms such as atrial fibrillation (AF), polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ongoing ventricular fibrillation. Ablation of AF provides a stark example where ablation in many patients typically destroys more than 50% of the atrial surface (Cox, <i>Heart Rhythm </i>2005), yet has a single procedure cure rate at one year of 50-60% (Calkins, <i>Heart Rhythm </i>2012; Weerasooriya, <i>J Am Coll Cardiol. </i>2011). This discrepancy occurs because the sources for AF are extremely difficult to identify. Accordingly, the precise size and shape of ablation to treat AF is essentially unknown. The ablation of substantial portions of heart tissue without clear evidence of their involvement in the rhythm disorder may explain the 5-10% risk of adverse effects from AF ablation (Dixit, Heart Rhythm 2007; Ellis, Heart Rhythm 2009), including death from perforation of the heart into the esophagus, narrowing (stenosis) of the pulmonary veins, damage to the phrenic nerve, and the recently described stiff left atrial syndrome in extreme atrial destruction from ablation leads to a non-distensible chamber, which leads to heart failure even in previously healthy AF patients (Gibson, <i>Heart Rhythm </i>2011).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The vast majority of catheter systems used for ablation therapy deliver lesions as points from a tip at the end of a tubular/shaft catheter. Ablation lines are achieved by moving the catheter tip to contiguous locations, but this is empiric with regards to the rhythm disorder source. Although newer systems have been designed to ablate different shapes, such as the PVAC, TVAC or MAC catheters by Ablation Frontiers (Scharf, 2009), these shapes are also empiric (the line shape of the TVAC, or the star shape of the MAC) or designed to conform to anatomic regions (such as the pulmonary vein ostium for the PVAC). None of the catheter systems is designed to conform ablation therapy to the shape of the actual source of the rhythm disorder within heart tissue, since such source shapes are currently not discussed, studied or defined, particularly for complex heart rhythm disorders.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Difficulties in identifying the precise source of a heart rhythm disorder for ablation depend on the fact that most sophisticated known systems display data that the practitioner must interpret, without directly identifying and locating the cause of the disorder to enable the practitioner to detect, diagnose and treat it. This includes currently used methods, described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,662,108, 5,662,108, 6,978,168, 7,289,843 and others by Beatty and coworkers, U.S. Pat. No. 7,263,397 by Hauck and Schultz, U.S. Pat. No. 7,043,292 by Tarjan and coworkers, U.S. Pat. No. 6,892,091 and other patents by Ben-Haim and coworkers and U.S. Pat. No. 6,920,350 by Xue and coworkers. These methods and instruments detect, analyze and display electrical potentials, often in sophisticated 3-dimensional anatomic representations, but still fail to identify and locate the cause of heart rhythm disorders, particularly for complex disorders such as AF. This is also true for patents by Rudy and coworkers (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,975,900 and 7,016,719, among others) that use signals from the body surface to ‘project’ potentials on the heart.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Certain known methods for identifying and locating causes for heart rhythm disorders may work in simple rhythm disorders, but there are no known methods that have been successful with respect to identifying causes for complex disorders such as AF, VF or polymorphic VT. Moreover, no technique currently identifies the size and shape of ablation therapy to eliminate the heart rhythm disorder while minimizing damage to non-involved (normal) tissue of the heart. Activation mapping (tracing activation back to the earliest site) is useful only for simple heart rhythm disorders such as tachycardias, works poorly for AFL (a continuous rhythm without a clear ‘start’), and not at all for AF with variable activation paths. Entrainment mapping uses pacing to identify sites where the stimulating electrode is at the cause of a rhythm, yet pacing cannot be applied in AF and even some ‘simple’ rhythms such as atrial tachycardias due to automatic mechanisms. Stereotypical locations are known for the cause(s) of atrioventricular node reentry, typical AFL and patients with early (paroxysmal) AF, but not for the vast majority of patients with persistent AF (Calkins, Brugada et al. 2007), VF and other complex disorders. Thus, no methods yet exist to precisely identify the position, size and shape of sources for complex heart rhythm disorders such as AF (Calkins, Brugada et al. 2007) for ablation while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue that is not involved in the rhythm disorders.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">An example of a system for ‘simple’ rhythms with consistent activation from beat to beat is given by U.S. Pat. No. 5,172,699 by Svenson and King. This system is based upon finding diastolic intervals that can be defined in ‘simple rhythms’, but not in complex rhythms such as atrial fibrillation (AF) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) (Calkins, Brugada et al. 2007; Waldo and Feld 2008). Moreover, this system does not identify or locate a cause, since it examines diastolic intervals (between activations) rather than activation itself. In addition, it is focused on ventricular tachycardia rather than AF or VF, since it analyzes periods of time between QRS complexes on the ECG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Another example is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,883 by Ciaccio and Wit. This system uses a concentric array of electrodes to identify and localize reentrant circuits. Accordingly, this will not find non-reentrant causes such as focal beats. Moreover, the method of using feature and detection localization algorithms will not work for complex rhythms such as AF and VF, where activation within the heart changes from beat to beat. It identifies ‘slow conduction within an isthmus of the reentry circuit’, which is a feature of ‘simple’ arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, but is not defined for AF and VF. Moreover, the size and shape of the isthmus are not defined, such that ablation is directed empirically to a point, an amorphous cluster of points (with an unclear endpoint of when to stop ablating) or a ‘line’.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In U.S. Pat. No. 6,847,839, Ciaccio and coworkers describe an invention to identify and localize a reentry circuit in normal (sinus) rhythm. Again, this will not find causes for an arrhythmia that are not reentrant but focal, from where activation emanates radially. Second, this patent is based on the presence in sinus rhythm of an “isthmus” for reentry, which is accepted for ‘simple’ rhythms with consistent activation between beats such as VT (see (Reddy, Reynolds et al. 2007)). However, this is not accepted for complex rhythms with varying activation paths such as AF or VF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">U.S. Pat. No. 6,522,905 by Desai uses the principle of finding the earliest site of activation, and determining this to be the cause of an arrhythmia. This approach will not work for simple arrhythmias due to reentry, in which there is no “earliest” site in reentry because activation is a continuous ‘circle’. This approach will also not work for complex arrhythmias in which activation varies from beat to beat, such as AF or VF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">However, even in simple heart rhythm disorders, it is often difficult to apply known methods to identify causes. For instance, ablation therapy success for atrial tachycardias (a ‘simple’ disorder) may be as low as 70%. When surgeons perform heart rhythm disorder procedures (Cox 2004; Abreu Filho, 2005) it is ideal for them to be assisted by an expert in heart rhythm disorders (cardiac electrophysiologist). Thus, ablating the cause of a heart rhythm disorder can be challenging, and even experienced practitioners may require hours to ablate certain ‘simple’ rhythm disorders (with consistent beat-to-beat activation patterns) such as atrial tachycardia or atypical (left atrial) AFL. The situation is more difficult still for complex heart rhythm disorders such as AF and VF where activation sequences vary from beat-to-beat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Diagnosing and treating heart rhythm disorders often involves the introduction of a catheter having sensors (or probes) into the heart through the blood vessels. These sensors detect electrical activity at the sensor locations in the heart. The prior art for diagnosing rhythm disorders often measures times of activation at the sensors. However, such prior art has been applied to signals that, at each recording site (or sensor location), are quite consistent from beat to beat in shape and often timing. These prior art solutions are extremely difficult to apply to complex rhythms such as AF or VF where signals for each beat at any site (‘cycle’) may transition between one, several, and multiple deflections over a short period of time. When a signal, for instance in AF, comprises 5, 7, 11 or more deflections, it is difficult if not impossible to identify which deflections in the signal are at or near the sensor (‘local’) versus a further removed site in the heart sensed by the sensor (‘far-field’), as noted in studies to analyze AF rate (Ng and coworkers, Heart Rhythm 2006). In another recent report, signals in rhythms, such as AF, require ‘interactive methods’ to identify local from far-field activations (Elvan et al. Circulation: Arrhythmias and Electrophysiology 2010).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In the absence of methods to identify and locate causes for human AF, physicians have often turned to the animal literature. In animal models, localized causes for complex and irregular AF (induced by artificial means) have been identified and located in the form of localized ‘electrical rotors’ or repetitive focal beats (Skanes, Mandapati et al. 1998; Warren, Guha et al. 2003). In animals, rotors are indicated by signals that show a high spectral dominant frequency (DF) (a fast rate) and a narrow DF (indicating regularity) (Kalifa, Tanaka et al. 2006). Such uses of spectral dominant frequencies is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,117,030 issued to Berenfeld and coworkers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Unfortunately, these animal data have not translated into effective human therapy. Animal models of AF and VF likely differ from human disease. For instance, animal AF is rarely spontaneous, and it rarely initiates from pulmonary vein triggers (that are common in human paroxysmal AF). Both AF and VF are typically studied in young animals without the multiple co-existing pathology (Wijffels, Kirchhof et al. 1995; Gaspo, Bosch et al. 1997; Allessie, Ausma et al. 2002) seen in older humans who typically experience these conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In AF patients, sites where rate is high (or, sites of high spectral dominant frequency, DF) have not been useful targets for ablation. A recent study by Sanders and coworkers showed that AF rarely terminated with ablation at sites of high DF (Sanders, Berenfeld et al. 2005a). Other studies show that sites of high DF are common in the atrium, and ablation therapy at these sites does not acutely terminate AF (as would be expected if high DF sites were causes) (Calkins, Brugada et al. 2007). In part, this may be because the DF method that is effective in animals may be inaccurate in human AF for many reasons, as shown by many workers (Ng, Kadish et al. 2006; Narayan, Krummen et al. 2006d; Ng, Kadish et al. 2007). Nademanee and coworkers have suggested that signals of low amplitude with high-frequency components (complex fractionated atrial electrograms, CFAE) may indicate AF causes (Nademanee, McKenzie et al. 2004a). This diagnostic method has been incorporated into commercial systems by Johnson and Johnson and Biosense. However, this method has also been questioned. Oral and coworkers showed that ablation of CFAE does not terminate AF or prevent AF recurrence alone (Oral, Chugh et al. 2007) or when added to existing ablation (Oral, Chugh et al. 2009).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Several inventions in the prior art acknowledge what was believed true until now—that AF is a “cardiac arrhythmia with no detectable anatomical targets, i.e., no fixed aberrant pathways,” such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,718,241 by Ben-Haim and Zachman. This patent, as a result, does not identify and locate the cause for a heart rhythm disorder. Instead, it focuses treatment on heart geometry by delivering lines of ablation to “interrupt each possible geometric shape.” This patent creates maps of various parameters and geometries of the heart, rather than of the actual causes of the heart rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Many inventions use surrogates for the actual cause for a cardiac arrhythmia, without identifying and locating the cause. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,680 by Steiner and Lesh uses measures of organization within the heart, which are constructed by comparing the activation sequence for one activation event (beat) to the activation sequence for subsequent beats, to determine if “any spatiotemporal order change has occurred”. However, that invention assumes that organization is greatest near a critical site for AF and is lower at other sites. However, this assumption may not be correct. In animal studies, indexes of organization fall with distance from an AF source, then actually increase again as activation re-organizes at more distant sites (Kalifa, Tanaka et al. 2006). Moreover, U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,680 requires more than one beat. As a result, methods such as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,680 identify many sites, most of which most are not causes of AF. This lack of identifying and locating a cause for AF may explain why methods based on organization have not yet translated into improved treatment to acutely terminate AF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,301,496 by Reisfeld is based on the surrogate of mapping physiologic properties created from a local activation time and vector function. This is used to map conduction velocity, or another gradient function of a physiologic property, on a physical image of the heart. However, this patent does not identify or locate a cause of a heart rhythm disorder. For instance, multiple activation paths in AF mean that the conduction path and thus conduction velocity is not known between the points used for triangulation. In addition, in the case of a rotor, activation sequences revolving around, or emanating symmetrically from, a core region may actually produce a net velocity of zero.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">For these reasons, experts have stated that “no direct evidence of electrical rotors has been obtained in the human atria” in AF (Vaquero, Calvo et al. 2008). Thus, while it would be desirable to identify (and locate) localized causes for human AF, this has not been possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">For human AF, particularly persistent AF, the absence of identified and located causes means that ablation therapy is empiric and often involves damage to approximately 30%-40% of the atrium that could theoretically be avoided if the cause(s) were identified and located for minimally invasive ablation and/or surgical therapy (Cox 2005).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Human VT or VF are significant causes of death that are poorly treated by medications (Myerburg and Castellanos 2006). Treatment currently involves placing an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in patients at risk, yet there is increasing interest in using ablation therapy to prevent repeated ICD shocks from VT/VF (Reddy, Reynolds et al. 2007). Identifying and locating causes for VT may be difficult and ablation is performed at specialized centers. In VF, animal data suggest that causes of VF lie at fixed regions near His-Purkinje tissue (Tabereaux, Walcott et al. 2007), but again this is very poorly understood in humans. The only prior descriptions of identifying and locating causes for VF required surgical exposure (Nash, Mourad et al. 2006) or were performed in hearts removed from the body after heart transplant (Masse, Downar et al. 2007)). Thus, minimally invasive ablation for VF focuses on identifying its triggers in rare cases (Knecht, Sacher et al. 2009) but cannot yet be performed in a wider population.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Existing sensing tools are also suboptimal for identifying and locating cause(s) for complex disorders such as AF, including single or multi-sensor designs exist (such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,848,972 by Triedman et al.). However, such tools typically have a limited field of view that is inadequate to identify causes for AF, that may lie anywhere in either atria and vary (Waldo and Feld 2008). Alternatively, they may require so many amplifiers for wide-area sampling that they are impractical for human use. Wide area sampling is advantageous and, in animals, is achieved by exposing the heart surgically (Ryu, Shroff et al. 2005) or removing it from the body (Skanes, Mandapati et al. 1998; Warren, Guha et al. 2003). In humans, even surgical studies only examine partial regions at any one time (for instance (Sahadevan, Ryu et al. 2004)), and introduce problems by exposing the heart to air, anesthesia and other agents that may alter the rhythm disorder from the form that occurs clinically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, prior systems and methods have largely focused on mapping of the anatomy of the heart to identify whether a patient has a heart rhythm disorder, rather than determining the cause or source of the rhythm disorder, and defining its size and shape within the heart. There is an urgent need for methods and tools to directly identify and locate causes for heart rhythm disorders in individual patients to enable curative therapy. This is particularly critical for AF and other complex rhythm disorders for which, ideally, a system and method would detect, locate and define the size and shape of the localized cause(s) for ablation therapy that can be delivered by minimally invasive, surgical or other methods.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention discloses methods, systems and devices for diagnosing, identifying, locating and treating biological rhythm disorders, such as heart rhythm disorders, using shaped ablation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Locating and identifying the source(s) of the rhythm disorders enhances the ability to guide, select and apply curative therapy, such as ablation. Determining the size and shape of a source(s) of a rhythm disorder enables therapy to be tailored to the particular source(s) to minimize damage to healthy tissue. In particular, the present invention provides a method to identify and locate electrical rotors, focal beats and other heart rhythm disorders, and to identify the size and shape of a region of tissue in which they migrate, which has never previously been determined. This property of migration is quite separate and distinct from a point source or a reentrant circuit that does not migrate, and defines a feature of complex rhythm disorders such as fibrillation of the atrium (AF) or the ventricle (VF), or other complex biological rhythm disorders. Once the shape is determined, treatment may be applied to at least a portion of the region and/or proximately to the region in certain cases to ameliorate and potentially eliminate the disorder with minimal collateral damage, desirably using minimally invasive techniques as further described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">This invention is a significant advance over the prior art. For example, unlike the apparatus and method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,718,241, the present invention identifies and locates cause(s) (target(s)) for AF and other heart rhythm disorders, which may migrate within well-circumscribed regions of the heart for hours (see example in a 47-year-old man). Unlike the system and method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,847,839, the present invention is capable of finding source(s) that transiently appear or disappear or that may migrate over time (because they are “functional”), explaining variations in AF. Unlike the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,868,680, the present invention directly identifies and locates cause(s) for a heart rhythm disorder, using as little as one activation event (beat) as shown in our examples. And, unlike the method of U.S. Pat. No. 6,301,496, the present invention directly identifies and locates electrical rotors, in which activation revolves around a core region, or focal beats with activation radiating radially therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The present invention shows that the source(s) of a rhythm disorder migrates within the heart and that migration paths remain spatially constrained for hours, months or even years, such that a shaped region of tissue in the heart can be determined. The determined region can be treated by ablation therapy or other therapy to eliminate the disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In one aspect of the present invention, a method of targeting a heart rhythm disorder is provided. The method includes processing cardiac signals to determine a shape in a region of tissue defined by at least one source associated with the heart rhythm disorder migrating spatially on or within the shape, and identifying at least one portion of tissue proximate to the shape to enable selective modification of the at least one portion of tissue in order to terminate or alter the heart rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Similarly, in another aspect of the invention, a method of targeting a biological rhythm disorder of an organ is provided. The method includes processing biological signals to determine a shape in a region of tissue defined by at least one source associated with the biological rhythm disorder migrating spatially on or within the shape, and identifying at least one portion of tissue proximate to the shape to enable selective modification of the at least one portion in order to terminate or alter the biological rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In still another aspect of the invention, a system to target a heart rhythm disorder is included. The system includes at least one computing device configured to process cardiac signals to determine a shape in a region of tissue defined by a source associated with the heart rhythm disorder that migrates spatially on or within the shape. The at least one computing device is further configured to identify at least one portion of the tissue proximate to the shape to enable selective modification of the at least one portion in order to terminate or alter the heart rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In yet another aspect of the invention, a system to target a biological rhythm disorder of an organ is disclosed. The system includes at least one computing device configured to process biological signals to determine a shape in a region of tissue defined by a source associated with the biological rhythm disorder that migrates spatially on or within the shape.

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007">Definitions</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">For purposes of this invention, the following definitions shall apply:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">“Detecting/Diagnosing”: The terms detecting and diagnosing a rhythm disorder are used interchangeably in this application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">“Activation time”: For a given heart signal, this is the time of activation onset.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">“Activation time duration”: For the signal of a given heart beat, the time period and the signal waveform between the times of activation onset and offset. Diastolic interval is the time period from activation offset of the prior beat to activation onset of the present beat (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">“Activation trail”: This is the ordering of the activation time onset at the sensor locations to create a discernible signature pattern, for example, including without limitation a rotational pattern around a core region indicative of a rotor, a radially emanating pattern from a core region, indicative of a focal beat cause, or a dispersed pattern, requiring further signal sampling and repeating of above analysis steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">“Identify and locate”: The process of discerning the presence of a localized or dispersed cause of the heart rhythm disorder, then locating said cause relative to sensor locations or relative to known anatomic positions in the heart.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">“Heart rhythm disorder”: This term refers to an abnormal rhythm, which often requires treatment. Abnormal rhythms include without limitation, rapid rhythms of the top chambers of the heart (atria) such as rapid and abnormal activation of the normal sinus node (inappropriate sinus tachycardia or sinus node reentry), atrial tachycardia (AT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial flutter (AFL), premature atrial complexes/beats (PAC) and the complex rhythms of atrial fibrillation (AF) and certain forms of atypical atrial flutter. Rapid rhythms can also occur in the bottom chambers of the heart (ventricles), including such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), torsades de pointes and premature ventricular complexes/beats (PVC). Heart rhythm disorders can also be slow, including sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial bradycardia junctional bradycardia, atrioventricular block and idioventricular rhythm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">“Cause of biological or heart rhythm disorder”: This term is used interchangeably with ‘source’ of the biological or heart rhythm disorder in this application. It refers to, without limitation, a rotational pattern of activation sequence around a core region indicative of a rotor, a radially emanating pattern from a core region indicative of a focal beat cause, or a dispersed pattern. In this invention, when a dispersed cause is found, signal sampling is extended to additional multiple locations and the detection and analysis steps of the invention are repeated. These causes are directly responsible for the perpetuation of the heart rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">“Sensor”: This term is used interchangeably with electrode in this application. It refers to an apparatus or device for detecting and transmitting signals from the heart or to the heart.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">“Electrical rotor”: This term is used to reference a spiral (rotating) wave of electrical activation within the heart. Such rotors may be sources for complex rhythm disorders such as AF, as well as simple rhythm disorders. This invention describes, for the first time, methods and systems to detect the shapes of tissue that such rotors lie within, and systems to provide shaped ablation to eliminate such sources to cure the heart rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">“Focal beat”: This term is used to reference a point source of electrical activation within the heart. Such focal beats, if they migrate (move) within the heart may be sources for complex rhythm disorders such as AF. This invention describes, for the first time, methods and systems to detect the shapes of tissue that such focal beats lie within, and to provide shaped ablation to eliminate such source(s) to cure the heart rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">“Migration”: This term is used to describe the movement of the core of a rotor, or origin of a focal beat, over several beats (‘cycles’) of the complex heart rhythm disorder over time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">“Locus of migration”: Movement of the source for a heart rhythm disorder, which is a rotor or focal beat, defines a path also known as the locus of migration. This locus defines a shape, bounded by a circumference (or perimeter), with a center of area and a center of mass (when considering the three dimensionality of any heart tissue). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A-45D</figref>, the locus of migration can be consistent for a given patient for prolonged periods of several months or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">“Size and shape of source”: This term is used to describe characteristics of the locus of migration of the source (rotor or focal beat) of a complex rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">“Shaped ablation”: This term is used to describe ablation therapy (e.g., lesions) delivered in a tailored fashion to eliminate one or more portions of the locus of migration and/or one or more portions proximate to the locus of migration in a complex heart rhythm disorder. This may include destruction of the entire region or portions of the region defined by the locus of migration of the source. Alternatively, or in addition, this may involve destruction of tissue proximately located (or ‘proximate’) to the locus of migration (perimeter) of the source. For example, such proximate therapy (e.g., ablation) can be useful in certain cases where therapy to at least a portion on or within the perimeter is not possible or desirable (e.g., the portion overlies the phrenic nerve). In these cases, it may be desirable to alter or interrupt aberrant activation of the heart by the source by delivering therapy to a portion of the tissue outside the perimeter. Specialized catheters, electrode designs, and approaches can be used for differently shaped sources in different regions of the heart with different tissue thickness, structural and functional properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">“Proximate”: This term means within a biologically relevant zone associated with the perimeter defined by at least one source of a heart rhythm disorder spatially migrating on or within the perimeter. Biological relevance is defined as a zone that, if modified, affects the aberrant activation of the heart from the source of the heart rhythm disorder. This will vary with different conditions. For example, in the atrium (e.g., diameter 4-6 cm), this zone may be 2 cm or less from the perimeter of the source, desirably 1 cm or less, or may be defined in a smaller zone if modification in this zone is sufficient to alter aberrant activation of the heart from the source. In the larger ventricle (e.g., a prolate ellipse with maximum diameter approximately 10 cm) this zone may be 2-3 cm or less, desirably 2 cm or less, and more desirably 1.5 cm or less. In some embodiments, the term ‘proximate’ can include one or more portions of the region inside the perimeter. In other embodiments, the term ‘proximate’ can include a portion of the region outside the perimeter. In some other embodiments, the term ‘proximate’ includes a portion of the region inside the perimeter and a portion of the region outside the perimeter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Prior to the discovery of the present invention, the causes of human biological rhythm disorders, and particularly heart rhythm disorders, had not been identified. The present invention represents the first known instance where a method of detecting, diagnosing and subsequently effectively treating, in an accurate and minimally invasive manner, the cause(s) that sustain, perpetuate, or ‘drive’ human biological disorders has been described. This method enables the physician to target these sources precisely for modification or elimination to abolish the rhythm disorder, with minimal targeting of or damage to the surrounding non-critical tissue. Although some embodiments are for minimally invasive procedures for heart rhythm disorders (e.g., heart impulse generators), the invention can also be applied to surgical therapy, and for disorders of electrical impulse generation or propagation in organs such as the brain, central nervous system (where it may locate causes of epilepsy or seizure), peripheral nervous system (where it may detect tumors), skeletal muscle and smooth muscle such as the gastrointestinal tract, bladder and uterus, as well as other organs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, there is disclosed an apparatus to sample signals, for example a sensor device such as an electrode catheter from multiple locations within a human organ, such as the human heart, at varying spatial resolutions and fields of view and with apparatus to alter the number of sensing channels accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, there is disclosed a method to identify and localize electrical rotors, focal beats and other localized causes of heart rhythm disorders that migrate spatially, including complex rhythms such as AF, VF and polymorphic VT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Embodiments of the invention may use processes and software methods such as ordering the activation sequence to create an activation trail, processes such as the Hilbert transform, other phase delay methods, spatial coherence analysis and other methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">In one embodiment of the invention, data collected from sensors and analyzed is stored as data in a database that is automatically updated. This database is used to assist the physician in the diagnosis/detection of localized causes, or to classify a pattern of causes of rhythm disorders. This may take the form of a probability distribution map of causes in patients with specific characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, there is provided an apparatus to display causes for the biological rhythm disorders in a format that can assist the physician in treatment. For example, a visual display screen may be connected to a processor to allow for viewing of the activation trail and to allow for visual location of the core of a rotor, focal source or other cause of the disorder that can migrate spatially. Audio formats may also be used alone or in combination with the visual format. For example, in addition to or instead of the visual depiction of the source such that the core can be visually identified, the coordinates of the source and its core can be provided to the user by audio indications as to the location and cause of the disorder. Visual depiction is particularly desirable because it provides the practitioner with a clear representation of the cause and provides a reference for identifying the core of the cause, which greatly facilitates the selection of treatments. For example, a visual representation of the actual rotor or focal beat, as well as a region (e.g., perimeter) defined by a spatially migrating rotor or focal beat, allows the practitioner to accurately determine where to direct the ablation catheter or other treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, once the cause of the disorder is identified (including spatially migrating cause), use of a treatment device or method, to modify or destroy a region of heart tissue associated with the identified and localized source may be employed to treat or eliminate the rhythm disorder. Non-limiting examples of treatment devices and methods include the use of destructive energy (ablation) such as by ablation catheters, surgical ablation methods, surgical removal or using devices inside the heart such as implanted leads or other physical device, stimulating energy (pacing), direct delivery of pharmacologic agents, cellular therapy or other intervention techniques. In one embodiment, a catheter capable of sensing signals from the body, and particularly from the heart, may also include a means of treatment, such as the ability to delivery ablation energy, stimulation energy, drug therapy, cellular therapy such as stem cells or gene therapy, or other treatment means. Thus, such a catheter may be employed both in the detection and in the treatment of the disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The present invention is particularly suited for the detection, diagnosis and treatment of complex heart rhythm disorders such as, for example, VF, polymorphic VT, torsade de pointes and AF, where once the localized cause is accurately identified and pinpointed, accurate and targeted ablation of the localized cause (including migrating cause) may be implemented. As discussed above, identification and physical location of the cause was previously not possible, and hence extraordinarily difficult even for experienced practitioners to treat successfully, much less to substantially ameliorate or eliminate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">In addition to finding or identifying the cause (including migrating cause) of and subsequently treating complex heart rhythm disorder, the present invention may also be applied to help diagnose and treat ‘simple’ rhythms that emanate from a single site by accelerating and simplifying analysis for the practitioner. For heart rhythm disorders, such simple disorders include focal atrial tachycardias, multifocal atrial tachycardias (MAT), sinus nodal reentry or inappropriate sinus tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia (VT), premature atrial complexes (PACs) and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">Included in the invention are a process and system to collect data, including sensing devices and recording systems. The collected data includes at least the location of each sensor which transmitted one or more signals and the onset time at which each activation signal or activation time duration occurred. The processor receives this information and sequentially orders the activation onset times. The result of this computation is the creation of an activation trail which creates a signature pattern for the disorder and indicates both the location and the type of the cause to the disorder, i.e. whether it is a rotor, focal source or a dispersed pattern, i.e. no localized source, hence requiring further data to be collected from a different area of the heart or other body region. The data once ordered in this manner creates an activation trail (e.g., source of the rhythm disorder) which can visually be depicted on a visual display to show, in the case of a rotor source, the actual rotational pattern of the rotor such that the core of the rotor is visually apparent and can easily be identified and hence treated. The same hold true for the depiction of a radially emanating source, such as a focal beat. The sequential ordering of the activation onset times at each sensor permits the location of focal rhythm disorders, such that the focal core can be easily located on the visual display for targeted and accurate treatment. Desirably, the sources or causes of the rhythm disorder are displayed over a period of time to allow the practitioner to fully observe the causal point or area and to make a comfortable assessment as to the appropriate treatment at the causal location. For a spatially migrating source, a perimeter around such sources can be determined and visually depicted to identify the extent of the migrating source. In one embodiment, the data and/or the visual displays of the processed data (i.e., a “movie” of the activation trail) elucidates the signature pattern of the cause of the rhythm disorder. Such stored information allows for the practitioner to consult previous patterns to aid in improving the identification, localization and treatment of similar causes. In some instances, such stored information allows for extrapolation of measured real-time data to provide predictive models or to clarify certain measured patterns using similar known patterns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">A further embodiment of the invention provides a process and system for the treatment of such causes, often by modification or destruction of tissue where causes reside. In one embodiment, the invention can be used in an ‘offline’, non-real-time review mode, rather than directly during a procedure to treat a patient. In other embodiments, the invention can be used in a real-time mode, intraoperatively during a procedure, to find and treat cause(s) of rhythm disorders with expediency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The process and system of the invention can be used for biological rhythm disorders. Specifically, the process and system of the invention may be employed to localize sources (i.e., find the physical location of the cause) for abnormal electrical impulse generation or propagation in the brain or central nervous system using the electroencephalogram or other index to guide invasive therapy (surgery) or external beam irradiation to identify and treat seizure or epileptic foci, or focal tumors (malignant or otherwise). The invention may also be used to identify sources for abnormal impulse propagation in striated muscle (such as injury in skeletal muscle), the gastrointestinal system (such as esophageal spasm), the urogenital and respiratory systems, or in other human organs or systems. The invention may also be used to detect tumors (malignant or otherwise) in any body system. The invention also has applications outside of medicine, such as for locating the source of a seismic event or for locating energy sources in tandem with methods such as radar or sonar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The invention has several aspects to its process and the system for carrying out the process. By way of example and not of limitation, in one aspect of the invention, signals are detected from multiple locations in an organ in the rhythm disorder, altering the spacing between sensors to optimize clarity of said sensing. A particularly desirable embodiment also records these signals from a heart, or other body part, during a rhythm disorder and stores them in a data base. The location of each sensor associated with a particular signal, as well as the activation onset times at each sensor are transmitted to a processor for analysis including sequential ordering to form the activation trail identifying the cause of the disorder and its specific location in the body. Creating a database of causes, which may be manually or automatically updated allows for accessing the data base to assist in the identification and localization of disorder causes. This is used when data collection in the current patient is of limited quality, to compare the pattern in a patient to prior recorded rhythms in the patient to determine if the rhythm is the same or different, or to compare the pattern in a patient to that from another patient, such as one with similar clinical characteristics. Previously stored data from a previous case may be used to help identify, localize and display causes for the rhythm disorder in a present case.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Visually displaying the source(s) of the rhythm disorder, as well as regions defining migrating source(s) of the rhythm disorder, is extremely useful to the practitioner because it serves as a visual guide to the existence and location of the cause, and permits subsequent targeted and accurate treatment to ameliorate or eliminate the rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">In other aspects of the invention, previously stored data from another case may be used to identify, localize and display causes for the rhythm disorder in a present case. This can then be used to plan the use of this invention in a future procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">Description of Useful Components, Modules, and Devices</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic of various useful components (modules) which may be used in the process and system of the invention. The modules may be separate form each other and cooperatively interfaced to provide their function, or one or more of them may be integrated with each other of contained in the processor, such that the system has less separate hardware units. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an embodiment which allows a cause of the disorder to be localized during a minimally invasive percutaneous procedure, or other procedures such as using surface ECG, a magnetocardiogram, an echocardiographic and/or Doppler measurements from ultrasound, electromagnetic radiation, sound waves, microwaves, or electrical impedance changes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, electrical events in the heart <b>10</b> are recorded with sensing electrodes. These electrodes may be one or more catheters <b>20</b> placed within the chambers or vasculature of the heart, including custom-designed recording catheters exemplified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. The electrodes may also be extensions of leads from an implanted pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator, catheters used to record monophasic action potentials or other signals, which typically arrive via the vena cavae or coronary sinus <b>22</b>. Thus, although particularly useful in the invention, the process and system of the invention need not, however, employ the specialized catheters of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, as any catheters or sensing devices used inside or outside of the body which capable of accurately transmitting the activation times and location of their occurrence may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Electrodes <b>23</b> may record from the epicardial or pericardial surface of the heart, accessed via electrodes <b>21</b> in the coronary sinus, via the electrodes <b>23</b> in the pericardial space or other routes. Electrodes may be located in proximity to the nerves supplying the heart <b>10</b>, which may be located in the left atrium and ventricles. Electrodes may be virtual (computed) electrodes from a computerized mapping system, routine or high-resolution ECG mapping electrodes <b>30</b>, electrodes implanted under or on the skin, or derived from methods to non-invasively detect signals without directly contacting the heart or body. Electrode information may also be derived from stored electrograms in a database <b>160</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">An electrode <b>25</b> placed near the heart may be used to modify or destroy regions that are near or at the cause(s) for a rhythm disorder. If the electrode is an ablation catheter, it interfaces to an energy generator <b>60</b>. Other electrodes may interface with a controller <b>40</b>, and a pacing module <b>50</b>, and all desirably communicate with a process controller <b>70</b>. Ablation or pacing can be directed to nerves supplying the heart <b>10</b>, which are located at many locations of the heart. Internal ablation electrodes may be replaced with an external ablation system, such as external probes during surgery, or as in external focused irradiation or photon beam as for cancer therapy. In addition, modification of sources, i.e. treatment of the causes of the disorder, may be achieved by delivering appropriate pharmaceutical compositions, gene therapy, cell therapy, or by excluding tissue (at surgery or by using specialized devices).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">The process controller <b>70</b> may include various components or modules. On such component or module includes a sampling module <b>80</b> which is capable of recording signals during the rhythm disorder, recording at various rates not in the rhythm disorder (by pacing), and/or recording during rates that simulate the heart rhythm disorder (by pacing or other methods). Signal amplifiers (not shown) may be used to enhance the signal clarity and strength, and the process controller may also intelligently assign the fewest number of recording amplifiers to sense from a sufficient number of locations to identify and localize the cause. For instance, the system may use only 50-60 physical amplifier channels to record from 128 sensors (for example, from two commercially available multipolar catheters), by recording those 128 sensors on a ‘time-share’ basis by time-slicing, or by activating individual/multiple sensors close to a rhythm cause while deactivating others. This ‘switching’ functionality may be performed by a switching component that connects the sensor device with the electronic control system, and that may be embodied in one or more other components. Switching may be manual or automatic, determined for instance on where causes of the heart rhythm disorder lie. Module <b>90</b> interfaces with the pacing module to provide additional heart rates for sensing the biosignal. This is particularly useful for the non-real time mode (mode 6), described herein, because it can study the heart at different heart rates even when not in the particular heart rhythm disorder being diagnosed and treated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The inventive method and system process the collected data using analytical methods, which may be performed by analytic modules. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, module <b>100</b> is part I of an “Analytic Engine.” This portion of the Analytic Engine determines the onset and offset for the biologic signal over time, at each sensed location. This is implemented by creating a series of activation times (onset timing) and recovery times (offset timing) during the rhythm over time (see, e.g., signal <b>425</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The signal is typically represented as voltage over time (that is, as a voltage-time series). Activation time can be processed in many ways. The simplest includes manual assignment at each location. Automated or calculated assignment can be achieved by using zero of the first derivative to define maxima or minima, zero of the second derivative to indicate maximum upstroke or downstroke, or similar methods. Activation onset times and offset times can also be assigned when the voltage time-series crosses a threshold. Another possible method to assign activation times is using pattern-matching. For instance, a pattern selected to represent the activation duration can be correlated to the signal at multiple timepoints over time. The time when said correlation values are high indicate recurrences of said template, and thus are considered activation times. The template used for this analysis can also be obtained from stored data in a database, or computed from a rate estimate for the rhythm at that location. Simultaneous recordings from multiple sensors can help in analyzing activation, particularly for complex rhythms such as AF or VF when signal quality may be noisy, of poor quality or show multiple components at different times. From simultaneous recordings, a reference signal is selected, preferably at a nearby location to the channel being analyzed. Signals on the reference channel are used to select signal or signal components on the channel being analyzed. This can be done by using components that retain a similar timing over time, using pattern matching or correlation functions, vectorial analysis or other methods. If many methods are required, heuristics, pattern recognition methods and so-called “fuzzy logic” approaches can be applied, constrained by known pathophysiology of the atrium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Module <b>110</b> is part II of the Analytic Engine that computes and localizes, i.e., determines the existence and location of sources (causes) for the heart rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Some embodiments of the invention include a “Therapy Engine,” which may contain one of more modules designed to cooperatively perform different functions in the system and process. For example, module <b>120</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be responsible for determining the location and migration pattern of sources for the rhythm disorder within the heart. This may be a first module of the Therapy Engine, and is used to compute the location and spatial region which is required to be modified in order to treat or eliminate the rhythm disorder. Treatment may be by delivery of ablation energy or other means as discussed herein, and is not simply one point or region if the source migrates during ablation. Module <b>130</b> is representative of another module of the Therapy Engine, and desirably interfaces with the energy generator <b>60</b> via process controller <b>70</b> to ablate (destroy), modify (ablate or pace) or stimulate (pace) tissue at sites likely to represent sources. Alternatively, module <b>130</b> may be used to modify tissue without destructive energy, for example by delivering pharmaceutical agents, or gene or cellular therapies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Module <b>170</b> of the system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is representative of a tool to display the identification or location of causes (including migrating causes) visually or in auditory fashion, to assist the physician in treating or eliminating the rhythm disorder. For example, this module may include a display screen which permits the textual, graphic and/or auditory visualization on the screen of the rotor, focal or other cause of the disorder, as well as migrating cause of the disorder, to be clearly seen by the practitioner. In some embodiments, a “movie” clip of the rhythm disorder found will be presented on the screen. This movie clip is a real-time presentation of the actual cause (including migrating cause) and location of the disorder. For example, once the analysis of the data has been performed in accordance with the process of the invention, i.e. the location of the signals and their activation onset times have been sequentially ordered, the result of this analysis and computation can be shown on the screen in the form of an activation trail. If the pattern of the activation trail signifies a series of activations revolving around a central core, then a rotor has been found and is, in fact, a cause of the disorder. Similarly, if the pattern of the activation trail signifies a series of activations which emanate radially from a central core region, then a focal beat has been found and is, in fact, a cause of the disorder. Thus, the inventive process permits the direct finding of the cause of the disorder and the convenient visualization of the existence, type and location of the disorder for the practitioner. In the event that no discernable pattern is found, i.e., the activation trail is not localized, then additional signal sampling by moving the sensor locations and/or turning-on already placed sensors may be appropriate. The additional signal samples may then be processed in accordance with the invention and shown on the screen. If a cause is found via the additional sampling and processing of the data, then a decision as to the appropriate treatment may be made. In the event that a dispersed activation trail and pattern is found, further additional sampling may be advisable until such time as the practitioner feels is sufficient. In some instances, the result of the process will render a finding of the existence and location of a rotor or a radially emanating focus. In other instances, where a dispersed pattern remains even after repeated sampling and processing, a diagnosis may be made ruling out a rotor or focal beats as the cause. Thus, the finding of a rotor or a focal point (beat) will be essentially a detection and diagnosis concurrently, whereas the lack of such a finding will be a diagnosis which may rule out the presence of either of these causes of the disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">Mode 1. Signal Sampling (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, Reference <b>80</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Signal sampling can be done in real time, during a procedure to ablate or treat the rhythm disorder, beforehand to plan for a procedure, or afterwards to review the disorder. As stated above, signals are collected at one or more locations from the organ using a variety of sensor types. Contact sensors should maintain as good a contact with the tissue as possible. In the preferred mode, electrodes should record at multiple sites simultaneously or nearly simultaneously. The fastest heart rhythm disorders such as AF have cycle lengths &gt;100 ms, so that signal acquisition for substantially less than this time is considered ‘nearly simultaneous’. An alternative mode of operation allows moving a sensor to sequential sites. The invention may be used with any existing sensor apparatus or device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Although a variety of commercially available electrode devices may be used to obtain signal sampling, particularly useful device embodiments for signal sampling are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. These devices use multiple sensors that may be individually activated or deactivated, or moved relative to one another. This enables adaptive spatial resolution, in that sensor spacing can be increased or decreased as desired. Widely-spaced sensors provide a wide field of view to ‘survey’ the rhythm for a large portion of the organ (e.g., left atrium of the heart). Once the source location is approximated, the configuration is desirably altered to reduce sensor spacing for higher spatial resolution over a narrow field of view. A tightly spaced sensor configuration is preferred for applying energy to a focused region to treat a source of a rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Adaptive spatial resolution is an important advantage of various embodiments of the present invention. This can be achieved by physically moving sensors. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a first multi-spiral sieve design illustrating how torsional movement alters electrode spacing and how advancement/retraction expands/shrinks a catheter. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows concentric helices <b>200</b>, with multiple sensing elements <b>205</b> (electrodes or probes) for sensing signals and in some instances delivering energy or other treatment therapy. The helices <b>200</b> are widely spaced when parts <b>210</b> of the catheter remains non-deployed inside the shaft <b>215</b>. Rotating and advancing the assembly introduces more probes into the chamber, and reduces their spacing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates another embodiment of an inventive sensor catheter in the form of an adjustable fan catheter with multiple meridians <b>230</b>, each containing multiple sensing elements <b>240</b> (electrodes or probes), also for sensing and in some instances for delivering energy or other treatment therapy. By a combination of twisting or tortional motion along the shaft axis <b>245</b>, depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the meridians <b>230</b> may be more widely spaced, or more closely spaced (meridians <b>235</b> in the right image), i.e., spatially adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows another embodiment of an inventive sensor catheter in the form of an adjustable corkscrew design, with a small number of spiral meridians <b>260</b> ending on a blunt non-traumatic end <b>270</b>. As with the design structures of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the meridians of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may include multiple elements <b>265</b> (electrodes or probes). The corkscrew can be advanced or retracted into the sheath by manipulating the shaft <b>280</b> to increase or decrease the corkscrew size and/or probe spacing. These designs can be made larger or smaller to fit a larger or smaller organ (e.g., atria of varying sizes), or substructures including pulmonary veins or the superior vena cava that may be sources for rhythms such as AF. Physical movement can be achieved manually by the physician or automatically by using machines. Given the observed properties of sources for heart rhythm disorders observed by the inventors, it is desirable that the sensors sense from at least about 25% of the surface area of each one or more chambers of the heart. These designs are illustrative only, and are not intended to limit the actual physical design or application of this invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Optimal contact for each sensor can be monitored by the process controller <b>70</b> for adequacy in various ways. For example, the process controller <b>70</b> can verify contact via stability in the amplitude of sensed signals. Alternatively, the process controller <b>70</b> can condition the pacing module <b>50</b> to emit signals through electrodes <b>20</b>-<b>30</b>, and use the amplitude of evoked responses to verify contact. As a third alternative, the processing controller <b>70</b> can determine contact by confirming stable tissue impedance (in AF, for instance, where pacing is not possible). As other alternatives, catheters designed to examine mild injury patterns, or designed to directly measure contact force, can be used. In addition, catheter manipulation can be controlled robotically in semi-automated or automated fashion, as well as manually.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Adaptive spatial resolution can also be achieved electronically. Sensors in this adjustable sensor device are connected to an electronic control system that may activate or deactivate individual sensors. This may be performed manually, such as if the physician wishes only to focus on one region of the organ, or automatically by the process controller in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to focus on a region determined to be where the heart rhythm source lies. An electronic switching apparatus controls independent switching of connections between the sensors and electronic control system, in order to maximize use of a practical number of amplifier channels. These electronic components may be embodied by various combinations of traditional (wired) electrodes, fiber optics, etched-wafer circuit designs, biologic sensors, chemical sensors, pharmaceutical sensors, piezoelectric sensors, infrared sensors, patient-compliant optical imaging, optrodes, remote sensors and other designs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Electronic switching may also be achieved by time-slicing. A large number of locations may need to be sensed, but the number of sensing channels may be limited. Signal time-slicing can record a larger number of sensing channels from a smaller number of available or physical channels. For instance, signals are often sampled every 1 ms (at 1 kHz) although data acquired every 10 milliseconds (ms) or so is often sufficient for AF or VF source analysis. Thus, the system can sense at location “#<b>1</b>” for 3 ms, locations “#<b>2</b>” and “#<b>3</b>” for 3 ms each then return to sensor “#<b>1</b>” to repeat the cycle at the 10 ms timepoint. In this way, 90 locations can be sensed using 30 channels. Any appropriate configuration can be used, depending on the switching time in hardware or software, and allowing for noise factors when switching between channels. Many other methods can be used to increase the effective number of channels, including sending multiplexed signals along a fiber optic or other device, or storing signals in random access memory, then using off-line analysis to amplify and analyze each in turn.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Numbers of sensed locations can also be increased using a combination of sensors lying in contact with different heart planes. For instance, electrodes on the endocardial (inner) surface of the heart may be complemented by electrodes on the epicardial (outer) surface and possibly those in the heart muscle itself (via implanted electrodes) to increase overall spatial resolution. This is of particular value in the atrium, whose wall is thin and where epicardial and endocardial electrodes may target similar regions. In the ventricle, or in thick walled regions of the atrium, different planes may provide different information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">In certain preferred embodiments, sensing can be performed using one or more sensors (probes) moved sequentially within the organ, such as during the heart rhythm disorder. When a single probe is used, signals from each location are aligned relative to a timing signal fiducial. This method is easy to apply when a rhythm is relatively regular within the heart, such as the ‘simple’ disorders of focal atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter. However, this method can also be used as an approximate guide if the rhythm is irregular within the heart, such as the complex rhythms of AF or VF. This has the advantage of requiring fewer sensors, and will work if sources show some stability in space. For instance, while AF is irregular, activation may be regular at localized sources, for example at certain locations such as near the pulmonary veins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">One particularly useful embodiment for using sequential sensing at multiple locations is now illustrated for a moving probe with two sensors (such as the two bipoles of a clinical quadripolar catheter), although more sensors may be applied if available. At each location, one sensor is considered the reference and the onset times for successive cycles (beats) are fiducials. The difference in activation time at the second sensor is used to indicate relative timing. The probe is now moved so that one sensor overlies the previously sensed location. The second sensor now senses a fresh location and can record relative timing onsets for multiple beats here. The process is repeated for the entire region of interest. Because this process introduces stability in relative timing between locations, variability can be reintroduced stochastically using observed beat-to-beat timing variations at each location.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">An alternative approach is to use gradients in rate and/or organization within the chamber, compared to stored data from a database for that rhythm (including AF or VF). After sensing sequential locations, the activation rate in both chambers is compared to stored patterns that describe this relationship at various sources (rotors or focal beats) and surrounding sites. An error-minimization approach (such as least-square-errors) may be used to estimate the source location. Estimates may be refined adaptively, based on similarity to subsets of stored patterns and using algorithmic, heuristic, fuzzy logic or other pattern recognition scheme. This process can be repeated iteratively. For a spatially consistent source, second and subsequent iterations will add precision to the original estimate, and may be focused at locations closest to the estimated source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Delivery of treatment therapy may be another feature of the sensor device that will be described in detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">Mode 2. Computing Causes of Heart Rhythm Disorders</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">The first step in analysis is to determine the signal type, using a lookup table as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, reference numerals <b>400</b>-<b>460</b>. This step determines if the signal arises from the heart (cardiac), brain, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital system, and so on. If cardiac, the signal may be a surface ECG, intracardiac, echocardiographic or other signal. If intracardiac, the signal is further classified as an action potential (monophasic action potential, MAP), bipolar electrogram, unipolar electrogram or other. Some of these signals provide high quality information (e.g., monophasic action potential recordings in the heart), while others do not. It should be noted that the use of MAP (uppercase) herein refers to “monophasic action potential”, which is in contrast to the lowercase term(s) “map”, “mapping”, “mapped” and variations thereof, all of which refer to cartography or topology of various aspects of the heart. Lower quality signals are more likely to require pre-processing, filtering, averaging, comparison against stored signals in a database, in that patient at different times and other computational steps to allow source localization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the signal is parsed between steps <b>800</b>-<b>840</b> to identify its type in the lookup table (from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). This includes assigning activation onset (block <b>810</b>) and offset (block <b>805</b>), and the interval between beats (diastolic interval) that depends upon the signal type illustrated in the lookup table in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The lookup table can be a comprehensive biosignal inventory (databases identified in blocks <b>815</b>-<b>825</b>), with data on the distinct physiological role of each component for computational purposes. Components may vary with rate and may fluctuate from beat to beat. Each signal component may reflect a distinct aspect of normal or abnormal physiology and thus indicate likelihood that the rhythm disorder may arise. Examples are not intended to limit the scope of the lookup table, which may include signals from other muscles (e.g., skeletal muscle, bladder and gastrointestinal tract), the brain and the nervous system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">The next step in analysis is to define, for each sensed location, the physiological signal to be analyzed (block <b>830</b>). The goal is that the resulting signal best represents actual physiological activation and recovery occurring in the heart rhythm disorder at each location. When the recorded signal is ‘clean’ (has a high signal-to-noise ratio), this will be the physiological signal. If signals are noisy, then filtering, noise reduction and other schemes may be needed to reveal the physiological signal. For analysis of atrial rhythm disorders, the physiological signal is best recorded between ventricular activations (in the R-R interval), that may be facilitated if the heart beat is reduced (R-R interval is prolonged) using agents to slow ventricular rate or by reducing pacemaker rate in patients with such devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">The next step is to repeat the foregoing processes at all sensed locations (block <b>840</b>) to plot a line encompassing the activation onset times in increments of time to plot a series of contour lines. That is, the first contour may be for all points activating from 0 ms to 9 ms, the second for points from 10 ms to 19 ms, and so on. In this way, activation contours (also known as ‘isochrones’) can be used to define spatial points around which activation completes rotations (i.e., reentrant circuits, or ‘rotors’) or from where activation emanates (‘focal beat’ sources) during the heart rhythm disorder (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and other figures). Other examples of isochrones during cardiac rhythm disorders (for example, AF) are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref>. Block <b>830</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> indicates the determination of sources from these data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7G</figref> illustrate a particularly useful embodiment for constructing physiological signals using computational methods to compensate for limitations due to noisy or low quality data. First, the response to rate of each signal type (monophasic action potentials, MAP, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref> (patient without AF), <b>7</b>C (AF patient) and <b>7</b>E (AF patient)) is determined. This is performed by sensing signals at varying rates when in the rhythm disorder, or when not in the rhythm disorder (such as by pacing, see mode 6, discussed below). The response of the signal duration (illustrated for MAP) to varying rate is shown in panels <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B, 7D and 7F</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> (no AF) shows no shortening with rate, while, with AF, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7D and 7F</figref> show that MAP shortens at increasing rate (that is, when diastolic interval shortens). It is to be noted that the response to the same set of rates may vary when the patient is and is not in the heart rhythm disorder. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8E</figref> show this. Pacing with delivery of a single extra beat in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> results in the restitution plot shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> as soon as AF begins. However, after several minutes, the restitution curve changes as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8C-8E</figref>, which illustrate that the action potential restitution is flattened in established AF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">One approach embodied in the present invention is to create a ‘hybrid’ signal by inserting a physiological pattern at the time of each activation time onset (waveforms <b>660</b>-<b>670</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7G</figref>). The physiological pattern may be obtained by averaging recorded signals over time (algebraically, from the median beat average or other method), averaging signals at neighboring locations (spatial averaging), from monophasic action potentials at various locations (waveforms <b>660</b>-<b>670</b>), by filtering existing unipolar or bipolar signals in the frequency or time-frequency domain, or by using stored patterns from a database <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, database <b>160</b>). When stored signals are used, properties including duration of these physiological patterns may be adjusted for rate using rate-response (restitution) behavior. Stored signals may be obtained from this patient, another patient with similar characteristics or another stored relationship. These processes may be applied to individual activations, or to the entire signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">This method results in a physiological representation of activity at each location over time that may otherwise be difficult to obtain in the beating heart of patients during minimally invasive procedures. It has applications outside of heart rhythm disorders. For instance, the physiological pattern may be a model of cellular ion function. This enables the function of these ion currents at each sensor to be modeled cells timed to each observed activation, for the study of dynamics of calcium fluxes, potassium currents or other processes within the beating heart of this patient. By way of a further example, this physiological pattern may be a model of a pharmacological ligand, allowing study on the behavior of the beating heart to specific pharmacologic agents. In the gastrointestinal tract, cellular hormone release models may be studied for each peristaltic ‘beat’. In the brain, known kinetics of neurotransmitter or endorphin release for discrete brain waves (non-invasive, via the scalp electroencephalogram or invasive, as surgery) may help to understand and treat various conditions. Treatment of conditions of epilepsy, for example, using the present invention is one embodiment of the invention. This invention also includes a method for determining the effect of a pharmacological or bioeffective agent on the body by correlating the behavior of the beating heart or rhythm of another body part with the release, binding capacity or rate, or other action of the agent on the body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">An activation trail is then determined from sequences of activation in the physiological signal at multiple locations. The simplest form of this analysis is to order activation at each location sequentially in time. In other embodiments, analysis may identify and locate causes for a rhythm disorder using frequency domain methods, time-domain methods or spatial-phase methods. Frequency domain methods include the Hilbert transform or wavelet transform or phase delay methods. Spatial phase methods involve analyzing the spatial inter-relationships between sites showing activation at a certain location, in order to define the activation trail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Pertaining to phase-space methods, a well-known technique assigns a phase ϕ to the signal at every electrode and at every time point. The phase at the exact location of the tip of the rotor is undefined and summing up the phase of neighboring electrodes results in a “phase jump” of 2π. Thus, a rotor location corresponds to a phase singularity. Mathematically, these phase singularities can be found by evaluating a line integral over a closed curve as {circle around (∫)}{right arrow over (∇)}ϕ·{right arrow over (dl)}=±2π where the line integral is taken over a path l surrounding the phase singularity. Since the signal from the electrode is a single observable, the determination of the phase requires special attention. Several different methods can be employed depending on the quality of the electrode signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">The first phase-space method will be utilized if the signal from the electrodes is noisy and/or has small amplitude. In this case, activation times for each electrode will be determined, followed by a novel analysis of wave front dynamics. As a first step, the spatial resolution of the probes and their activation times may be increased using a bi-linear interpolation scheme that interpolates activation using a fine regular grid created across the surface. In high quality physiological signals that contain activation, recovery and diastolic interval information, this results in a time trace V(t) for each point of the refined grid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Since the shape of the action potential may be stable between beats, the method next defines a mapping from the membrane potential V to the phase ϕ. This map assigns a unique value of ϕ to each value of V such that the maximum and minimum of the phase variable differs by 2π. The detailed form of this map is arbitrary and the phase is computed using ϕ=2π(V−0.5). The corresponding time trace of the phase variable results in construction of the signal and its phase instantaneously as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">Once the phase map is constructed the method will calculate, for each time, the sum of the phase for all four points of the fine regular grid separated by a grid spacing that form a square (topological charge method). A result not equal to zero indicates the existence of a phase singularity and a rotor. The analysis will be further aided by the tracking of wave fronts. The location of these fronts will be computed using the regular fine grid by determining where and when V crosses a threshold value with a positive derivative dV/dt. Performing this calculation along the x and y direction of the fine regular grid and using linear interpolation between the grid points, will result in a set of points that lie on the wave front.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">The wave front is then constructed by connecting these points. A similar analysis will be performed for phase, where isophase lines are tracked. A two-dimensional visual representation is then constructed that plots for each time point the value of the membrane potential using a grayscale or color scale, lines representing the wave fronts, lines representing similar phase (isophase lines), and symbols locating the phase singularities. This visual aid will greatly benefit the practitioner in interpreting the results of the inventive process and system. Note that the crossings of the lines representing the wave fronts and the isophase lines represent the phase singularity. Phase singularities indicate core regions, and thus can be used to localize the rotors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">The phase transform demonstrates focal beats in AF—typically as centrifugal sources emanating from a localized area. A focal beat is characterized by a location that fulfills three criteria: 1) its activation time is earlier that at surrounding locations; 2) this region was previously inactive (in diastole) for a specified period of time; 3) the subsequent spread of activation emanates radially from the core region. Recognizing these 3 criteria, the invention finds these sources automatically. This algorithm will first determine locations that exhibit activation times ahead of their four nearest and four next-nearest neighbors and mark these as potential focal sources. Next, it determines the activation times at locations surrounding a potential focal source. If the activation times of these locations are earlier than their surrounding electrodes, the potential focal source is confirmed and is marked accordingly. These sites are plotted using our plotting technique as described above, greatly aiding the practitioner in localizing and interpreting these sources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref> show direct assignment of phase. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> illustrates two consecutive cardiac activation cycles (beats) at one spatial point in the heart during a heart rhythm disorder. Each beat has a beginning (early phase, or depolarization), a middle and an end (late phase, or repolarization). Thus, the early phase can be used to define the activation onset time, and the late phase the activation end time (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> illustrates how this approach can be used to replot the same two beats in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> as a function of phase in panel <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>. This process can then be repeated at a plurality of spatial points. The points in the heart around which activation completes an entire phase cycle (i.e., 0°-360°) can thus be identified as the cores (singularities) of a reentrant circuit or ‘rotor’ source for a heart rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Alternatively, frequency domain methods may be used. On the physiological signal during the heart rhythm disorder, that may be the recorded signal or a signal derived after filtering, noise reduction and other strategies described above, one may employ several methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">One such method is the Hilbert transform. The Hilbert transform shifts the phase of the negative frequencies of a signal by π/2 and the phase of the positive frequencies by −π/2. In this approach, determination of the phase ϕ of the signal is achieved by plotting voltage against the Hilbert transform of the voltage. The particularly useful embodiment applies a detrending algorithm to set the voltages at the activation times (maximum MAO to zero. The Hilbert transform is used to construct the phase plane of detrended signals. The Hilbert transform at all locations is interpolated across the fine regular grid created across the biological surface. Phase is then calculated from the state-space plot of voltage versus its Hilbert transform. Again, the spatial distributions of phase will be analyzed with the topological charge technique described above to locate phase singularities associated with phase singularities (the ends of wavefronts) such as at the tip of a reentrant wave. Activation wavefronts are constructed using the same technique as described above while isolines of zero phase will also be tracked. An example of the present methods in the human atria is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12C</figref>, which show rotors in the right atrium computed using frequency-domain methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">Another useful method employs a time delay embedding technique to determine the phase of the signal. This technique consists of plotting V(t+τ)−V*vs. V(t)−V* for a fixed time delay τ and offset V*, resulting in a value of the phase ϕ for each time point and each location. In practice, the time delay and offset will be determined by the practitioner after examining these plots for several locations using different values for τ and V*. Optimal values lead to trajectories that do not cross (that would lead to a non-unique value for the phase) and that encircle the origin (ensuring that the minimum and maximum phase differs by 2π). Both the signal and the phase are interpolated across a fine regular grid created across the biological surface. The resulting phase map will then be examined for phase singularities and wave fronts will be tracked as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">Yet another useful method used to determine the phase of the signal is a wavelet transform. The exact form of this wavelet is variable, and an example includes the Haar wavelet. The wavelet transform will be computed for each location. The wavelet allows us to view the signal in multiple frequency resolutions. This will enable us to filter unwanted noise at specific frequencies (or frequency bands). In this approach, the phase transformation is achieved by plotting voltage against the phase shifted wavelet transform of the voltage. Once the phase ϕ has been calculated, the method can proceed as before, including refining the grid through bi-linear interpolation, finding phase singularity and tracking wave fronts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">Other information, such as locations within the organ of sites of rapid rate during the rhythm disorder, the presence of very regular sites surrounded by less regular sites, the presence of stable beat-to-beat configuration (shape) for successive signals as opposed to varying signal configurations, proximity to anatomic features known to be associated with particular rhythm disorders (such as pulmonary veins in AF, His-Purkinje system in VF), or a combination thereof may also assist in identifying and locating sources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">Several types of activation trails may result, producing corresponding discernible signature patterns for various types of causes for a rhythm disorder. An activation trail in which sequences of activation revolve around a central ‘core’ region is termed a rotor. An activation trail that emanates radially from a core region is termed a focal beat (or a site of repetitive focal activations or beats). Another activation trail type is a dispersed pattern, in which a localized source is not clearly identified. In particularly useful embodiment, in such cases, signal sensing is repeated at additional locations or for additional periods of time. Localization of a cause for a heart rhythm disorder is based on the location of the core region and additional activation from this region. Some embodiments identify the core region directly. For instance, the Hilbert Transform method and direct phase assignment method (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) identify the core region as the site where real and imaginary parts of the analysis intersect. In contrast, the direct sequential ordering method of the present invention indicates a core region either visually or analytically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, operations <b>1400</b>-<b>1495</b> describe the process of identifying, locating and selecting cause(s) that are most likely to indicate primary causes of the rhythm disorder. In one particularly desirable embodiment, a probability map <b>1480</b> for sources of the rhythm disorder is constructed. This indicates likelihood that each sensed location harbors a cause of the rhythm disorder, relative to other sensed locations. A higher relative likelihood is assigned for sites where core regions sustain for longer periods of time (or, for more rotations or beats), where the rate of activation is faster, where the rate of activation is more organized, that activate surrounding tissue in a 1:1 fashion (thus, there is electrogram linking) and activate larger regions of tissue in phase (and thus have a large space constant), when fewer concurrent sources are identified, for sources that lie near known regions of high likelihood for rhythm disorders such as the pulmonary veins in human AF, for sources with less migration over time, and for rotor versus focal beat types of source. In one particularly useful embodiment, probabilities are assigned after comparison with stored examples in a database; the comparison may take the form of a stepwise multivariate comparison. In the limited case, a spatially fixed source, that is a solitary electrical rotor and that directly activates the entire organ is by definition a primary cause of that heart rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">As described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A-44B</figref>, sources or causes of complex biological or heart rhythm disorders (e.g., AF) may be localized and yet migrate within spatially constrained shapes (e.g., activation trails) over periods of time. As further shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, the source of the heart rhythm disorder can be caused by a localized impulse generator that migrates within a spatially constrained shape (panel A), a fixed localized impulse generator that generates multiple excitation waves within a spatially constrained shape (panel B), and at least one migrating reentrant impulse generator that generates multiple excitation waves within a spatially constrained shape (panel C).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">Surrogates for the activation trail also exist. These are data that approximate the identification and localization provided by the invention using data from fewer locations, less lengthy or detailed recordings, or using information from other resources such as the ECG rather than from within the heart. Thus, surrogates enable approximation of the activation trail using a reduced number of sensor locations compared to an analysis that directly measures the activation trail. These surrogates, used independently or in combinations, include sites of rapid rate during the rhythm disorder, the presence of very regular sites surrounded by less regular sites, the presence of stable beat-to-beat configuration (shape) for successive signals as opposed to varying signal configurations, signals where amplitude is particularly low, signals that are very prolonged for each activation is very prolonged, proximity to anatomic features known to be associated with particular rhythm disorders (such as pulmonary veins in AF, His-Purkinje system in VF), or a combination thereof may also assist in identifying and locating sources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">Surrogates may be detected from the ECG, and thus be used to plan a procedure or guide therapy in a patient. Vectorial analyses of the ECG for regions of regularity and high rate, particularly if surrounded by regions of lower regularity and rate, indicate locations within the heart where sources lie.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, operations <b>1400</b>-<b>1495</b> summarize the approach to identify and locate sources. Operations <b>1400</b>-<b>1450</b> determine if sufficient sensor resolution is present to identify a cause. Criteria for sufficiency include the absence of discontinuities in the wave front calculation, and absence of jumps in the location of core regions, and an absolute sensor spacing that should not exceed approximately 1 cm. This is based upon computations that the minimum circumference of a reentry wave is &gt;2 cm in the human atrium and larger in the human ventricle. Operations <b>1460</b>-<b>1490</b> then use a combination of sensed data and stored data to compute sources, that are then treated, operation <b>1495</b>. The present invention includes the wide use of filtered or unfiltered clinical data, data from a database including this and other patients, or computational estimates to represent the signal to be analyzed as well as the results of analysis. In addition, the hybrid use of existing patient-acquired data, signal processing methods, numerical methods and stored signals from a database are major advantages of the inventive process and system, particularly because high-resolution physiological data from human atria or ventricles may be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain at clinical electrophysiologic study without open heart surgery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">Any of the above approaches may be applied to any complex rhythm disorder, including VF. Of course, these approaches may also be applied to “simple” rhythm disorders such as reentry around an anatomical obstacle or rotors anchored at scar tissue (such as atrial flutter).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">These inventive processes may be implemented in software, operated very quickly and are suitable for real-time, as well as off-line analysis, using small scale components such as those found in implantable devices, portable ambulatory machines, wristwatch-sized devices, as well as larger scale computers found in electrophysiology laboratories.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">Mode 3. Storing Data on Heart Rhythm Sources in Database</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">Data on sources for rhythm disorders desirably may be stored in a database <b>160</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This may be useful to classify sources in different patients, to help identify sources in a single patient, or to determine if a patient has returned with the same or a different source. Data in the database <b>160</b> can thus include the characteristics described above, including the number of concurrent sources, rate, variability in rate over time, duration, size of biological organ whose activation is directly caused by the source (the space constant), location, whether this location migrates over time, rate within multiple regions of the heart at the time that the source was detected (such as left and right atrial rate during AF), and the response of each source to ablation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">In some embodiments, additional information that can be stored in the database include one or more clinical factors from a group comprising gender (male/female), age, weight, height, presence of diabetes mellitus, blood pressure, atrial size, ventricular size, regions of atrial or ventricular scar, the left ventricular ejection fraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">In a particularly useful embodiment, a database of AF Sources (e.g., database <b>160</b>) will be continuously updated, based upon new source localization from additional cases. This will be used to help source localization for practitioners studying new patients, by way of a software expert system that will match the new patient to already stored patterns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Source data to be stored will be analyzed for consistency with existing data, matched by the above variables. Only raw data that meets rigorous standards for data integrity will be incorporated, others will be rejected. After ensuring data integrity, data will be added to the database to improve localization for future patients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">The invention and database interface may include an expert system that compares current data with stored data. Based on the closest match or matches, logic within the invention determines if additional heart rhythm sources or additional characteristic should be studied, and whether they may lie based on stored information. This uses a ‘goodness of fit’ against various stored parameters. This functionality is included because in practice, the number of sensed locations is limited by time constraints, in practice, many sensor locations may provide suboptimal data, thus limiting the actual sensed resolution, and because the inventor has observed that many patients show similar source locations and characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">Database updates will be available to the practitioner regularly from a centrally located, secured database that contains the above information. No information on patient name, geographical location, study date or other items prohibited by the Health Information Portability Act (HIPAA) will be included. This database can be maintained at a remote location but available electronically by means including wired and wireless communication, electronic media such as CDs, DVDs, and solid state storage devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">Mode 4. Display of Sources of Biological Rhythm Disorder</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">The invention includes methods and apparatus to communicate the identification, location and above characteristics of sources for biological rhythm disorders to the practitioner. This includes a visual display means, typically in the form of a graphical display on a computer monitor, or a printout showing the source in relation to cardiac anatomy, or a basic textual line summary of the location and/or sensor site where the source lies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">An auditory display may also be used, that vocalizes the identification, location and above characteristics of sources for biological rhythm disorders to the practitioner. In one embodiment, this would include the conclusions or a summary of analysis rather than the analysis results themselves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">Mode 5. Therapy at Causes of Biological Rhythm Disorder</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">In addition to the processes and systems of the invention used to detect and diagnose the cause of the rhythm disorder, the invention also includes devices and methods to treat the source for the biological rhythm disorder, in order to modify, ameliorate or eliminate the rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">Treatment of the source may employ any useful technique, including ablation with radiofrequency, freezing energy, microwaves, as well as other useful techniques. Modification may also include cell therapy (such as with stem cells), gene therapy, pharmaceutical delivery, ionizing or non-ionizing radiation delivered by devices inside or outside the heart, or other interventions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">Treatment is delivered to eliminate or modify the cause. In a simple heart rhythm disorder such as atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter, energy is applied directly to eliminate the cause. In a complex rhythm disorder, such as AF, energy can be applied to ablate (destroy) the source, to isolate the source by destroying tissue between the source and the remainder of the viable heart chamber, or to modulate the interaction between different sources. This latter form of treatment is very novel and has been shown in experiments by the inventor to be extremely effective. Modulation may be performed in a stochastic fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">In a particularly desirable embodiment, therapy can be targeted at the core region of an identified or localized cause for the rhythm disorder, with the intention of eliminating this cause to treat the heart rhythm disorder. This may be applied sequentially to identify, locate and treat more than one cause for said disorder</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">Alternatively, therapy may be targeted at locations neighboring the core region for a source, with the intention of disconnecting the source from surrounding tissue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">Alternatively, therapy may be targeted at locations neighboring the core region for a source, with the intention of causing the source to migrate towards tissue where definitive treatment is more easily accomplished. For instance, if the source lies at a location where ablation is difficult due to anatomy, tissue thickness or other factors, ablation on one side of the source may cause it to migrate towards a location that is easier to ablate due to thinner tissue or anatomic factors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">Alternatively, therapy may be targeted at locations neighboring the core region for a source, with the intention of preventing movement of the source and thus compartmentalizing it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">Alternatively, therapy may be targeted at locations neighboring the core region for a source, with the intention of reducing the mass of tissue available for the source to sustain and thus causing it to terminate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">In those cases where the cause migrates within a spatially constrained shape, therapy can be targeted to at least a portion of such shape, with the intention of eliminating this cause to treat the heart rhythm disorder. Additionally, or alternatively, therapy can also be targeted proximately to the constrained shape in cases where it is impossible or not desirable to target one or more portions of the shape itself, with the intention of disconnecting the source from surrounding tissue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Treatment may take the form of ablation, delivered via a catheter in the heart (element <b>25</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), on the epicardial surface, or an electrode present on one of the multi-electrode catheter designs included herein, for example see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">When a dispersed activation trail is observed, locations where sources may lie that are difficult to identify are targeted first. In patients with AF, such sites include the pulmonary veins and other thoracic veins, and the atrial appendages. Thus, pulmonary vein isolation is performed first, followed by therapy at additional sites if clinically suspected. Signal sensing is then repeated to identify and locate a cause.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">In preferred particularly desirable embodiment, the multi-sensor catheter (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>) includes an assembly that can deliver therapy in the form of ablation. In this embodiment, sensors at locations where the source lies are activated to deliver ablation energy to modify or eliminate the source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">The system may deliver therapy in a spatial locus, as well as at fixed locations. In this system, the location of the source core region is analyzed constantly throughout therapy. Therapy, such as ablation energy, is directed at varying locations and potentially multiple locations to constrain movement of the source. An analogy is to construct a ‘fence’ of ablated tissue around a moving source in order to keep it in one location. This may require therapy delivery (such as ablation) at multiple sensors of said poles of said assembly concurrently. This process is continued until the rhythm terminates or a remote source becomes dominant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">This invention is well suited to target therapy performed surgically in the operating room with direct exposure of the heart. This may be via a minimally invasive approach or traditional open chest heart exposure. The choice of recording electrode, sock, plaque or other equipment is up to the discretion of the surgeon and does not alter the principles of therapy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">Alternatively, the modulation can be applied by stimulating (pacing) the tissue. For pacing, the process controller <b>70</b> conditions the pacing module <b>50</b>, to stimulate the heart using electrodes <b>20</b>-<b>25</b> in the heart <b>10</b>, electrodes <b>30</b> on the body surface, or electrodes <b>150</b> elsewhere such as from the esophagus. The electrode controller <b>40</b> receives signals from the electrodes before, during and after pacing. Pacing is used to increase heart rate and introduce extra beats.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">In alternative embodiments, the invention can ablate or stimulate cardiac nerves to modify or eliminate the source. Thus, if sources lie at locations of heart ganglionic plexuses, ablation or pacing of such locations can be used to modify the source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">If the abnormal rhythm terminates after modifying or eliminating the source(s), attempts can be made to restart the rhythm disorder. In the case of heart rhythm disorders, this may include very rapid pacing, the administration of isoproterenol or other interventions. The entire application of this invention is then repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">In the event that the abnormal rhythm can no longer be initiated, the physician may exercise the discretion to modify additional regions that may be potential sources. This information may be available directly from stored data in the database, matching patients with a similar classification to the current patient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">Mode 6. Non-Real-Time Review Mode</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">In an important mode of operation, the invention can be used in a non-real time, offline analysis fashion. This review mode can be applied to data from the same individual (patient) at another time, such as a prior electrophysiologic study, data from a different device (such as an implanted pacemaker or defibrillator) or even a prior failed ablation. This can be used to review results from a prior procedure, to review data for the patient prior to planning the application of this invention, or to assess if the patient now presents with the same or a different source of a rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">Signals are first uploaded from stored electrograms in the database <b>160</b> to the processor controller <b>70</b>. This database can be the master database that stores data for multiple patients, or a patient-specific database. Data storage and retrieval can be implemented for any signal type. Stored signals can be derived from another source, a catalogued source, or computed or virtual signals such as from Ensite 3000 or NavX by St. Jude Medical, or Carto by Biosense-Webster. Signals may also be derived from a different individual, querying the database for a patient with similar demographics and heart rhythm disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">In a separate non-real-time mode, data obtained when the patient is not in the heart rhythm disorder can be used by the invention to identify and locate sources for a rhythm disorder. This may be useful, for example, if the heart rhythm disorder is not observed at the time of a procedure, and cannot be started using conventional methods. This mode uses biological properties of the chamber to predict locations where sources/causes may lie when in the heart rhythm disorder. Such locations include sites where the maximum slope of action potential duration restitution is &gt;1, sites where beat-to-beat oscillations in the repolarization signal shape or duration are observed, or where conduction velocity restitution is broad to indicate slowed conduction at critical rates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">In the preferred embodiment, to measure restitution it is necessary to sense signals for a wide range of rates at each location, as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, element <b>90</b>. This may be achieved using pacing. In this case, the process controller <b>70</b> conditions the pacing module <b>50</b>, to stimulate the heart using electrodes <b>20</b>-<b>25</b> in the heart <b>10</b>, electrodes <b>30</b> on the body surface, electrodes <b>150</b> in the esophagus, or elsewhere. The wider the range of rates, particularly fast rates, the more comprehensive the data range for that signal for analysis of restitution. When pacing is not an option, the inventive system will prompt the user to increase heart rate using other options or to use stored information from a database.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">In this embodiment, the rate-response (“restitution”) curve is created at each rate for each component of signals shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. For example, this step may compute how monophasic action potential duration (time from phase <b>0</b> to phase <b>3</b>) varies with rate (APD rate restitution). Examples of atrial APD restitution are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7G and 8A-8E</figref>. Using pacing to increase the range of sampled heart rates provides a comprehensive assessment of rate response of each biosignal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A, 7C and 7E</figref> illustrate a useful embodiment, whereby human action potentials are recorded in the left atrium <b>420</b>, each of which provides high quality information including depolarization (phase <b>0</b>), repolarization (phases <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>), phase <b>2</b> amplitude and action potential duration (time interval from phase <b>0</b> to phase <b>3</b>). Phase <b>4</b> indicates the interval between one beat and the next. The invention may determine rate response (restitution) of multiple components, focusing on rate-response of AP duration (time from phase <b>0</b>-<b>3</b>), and AP phase II amplitude.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">Signal <b>400</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an ECG. This includes intra-atrial components (the P wave and PR interval), and ventricular components including depolarization (the QRS complex) and repolarization (the T wave). For atrium, the invention records how P-wave duration varies with rate, using analyses shown later in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7F</figref>. For the ventricle, the invention records how QT interval varies with rate as a measure of ventricular APD rate-behavior (restitution). Individual QRS complexes are aligned using one of several columnar techniques, including methods that align electrograms about the point of largest positive or negative slope, their peak values or minimize their mean square differences, or metrics based on derived signals. T-waves are identified and aligned similarly. Atrial activity is considered to lie in the intervening intervals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">If the signal is a unipolar electrogram, it is also analyzed in analogous fashion. Each is analyzed for waveform shape as well as duration. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, signals <b>430</b> and <b>440</b> indicate unipolar electrograms from the human left atrium and left ventricle, respectively, with depolarization and repolarization measured collectively as the activation-recovery interval, a surrogate for the monophasic action potential duration. The invention determines adjustment of various components for rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">Signals can also be bipolar electrograms (signals <b>450</b> and <b>460</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The invention determines rate-response of each component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">In an alternative embodiment, ECG and electrogram data are uploaded from the database <b>160</b> for analysis in an analogous fashion to the described real-time mode of operation. Data from the database can be from the same or different patients, recorded at any time and using any acquisition system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">In AF, MAP restitution may differ from MAP when not in AF. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows the initiation of AF after pacing. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows MAP restitution during pacing (small black diamonds). Immediately after AF onset (black dots), APDs track previously derived MAP restitution. However, this may not be true for longer-lasting AF. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8C-8E</figref> show patients with long-lasting AF, in whom APD restitution differs from that obtained in pacing prior to AF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">Thus, it may be advantageous to use APD restitution obtained from the patient in AF, at this time or a previous time, or from stored APDs in this or other patients, or filtered or computed data, for signal processing and analysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">Locations where sources may arise during a subsequent heart rhythm disorder may now be predicted from these analyses. For monophasic action potentials, site where the maximum slope of MAPD rate-behavior (restitution) &gt;1 may be immediately adjacent to causes for VF or AF. Other indexes of high likelihood for the initiation of heart rhythm disorders include broad rate-response (restitution) of conduction, since such sites of dynamic conduction slowing may indicate sites where heart rhythm causes lie.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">The energy generator <b>60</b> may be activated to apply destructive energy (either radiofrequency, cryoablation or microwave radiation) via the ablation electrode <b>25</b>. This electrode can be moved within the heart manually by an operator, that is the traditional approach, or remotely using robotic or computer assisted guidance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">The implementation of the system described herein may be based largely upon digital signal processing techniques. However, it should be appreciated that a person of ordinary skill in this technology area can easily adapt the digital techniques for analog signal processing.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">Identification and Localization of Source for AF in 47-Year-Old Man.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates pre-ablation signals for a representative patient, a 47-year-old man with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) for over five years. The patient continued to have symptomatic racing of the heart, which required him to visit hospital emergency rooms for treatment, despite various therapy with amiodarone and other appropriate therapy, and despite prior ablation procedures for AF. Given the severity of his symptoms, the patient therefore elected to return to the electrophysiology laboratory for further evaluation and ablation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows signals from the right and left atria during AF at the commencement of electrophysiologic study. In the illustrated signals, the AF cycle length (time between successive activation onset times) is quite short, shown as 172 ms and 165 ms for the first two cycles in the right atrium (arrows <b>910</b>), and varies, as is typical for AF. Notably, signals were more fractionated and disorganized in shape in the left atrium (‘post LA’) and coronary sinus (‘CSP’ proximal coronary sinus; ‘CSD’ distal coronary sinus) than in the right atrium (‘HRA’ high right atrium; ‘Lat RA’ lateral right atrium; ‘post RA’ posterior right atrium), as is common.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">These findings would normally guide ablation towards the left atrium. A typical procedure in this case would commence by ablating near the pulmonary veins and confirming isolation, followed by additional ablation selecting at sites including: (a) left atrial sites of fractionated electrograms, linear ablation at the roof, linear ablation at the mitral annulus, other linear ablation, then (b) right atrial ablation including sites of fractionation and the cavotricuspid isthmus. This proposed procedure would normally take approximately 2-3 hours with a &lt;50% chance of terminating AF, meaning that electrical cardioversion would be required to restore normal rhythm at the conclusion of the procedure (Calkins, Brugada et al. 2007).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">Rather than use this known approach, an embodiment of the method and treatment of the present invention was applied. A catheter assembly containing 64 sensors (electrodes) was inserted via the femoral veins into the right atrium, and across a trans-septal puncture into the left atrium of the patient. These were connected via wire cables to a recording system for collecting signals at each sensor during AF. These signals were converted to digital form, and input into a computer program. Activation onset times were recorded for 2 seconds of AF at each sensor. While two seconds was used with this patient, any greater or lesser periods of time may be useful. Desirably, one second or less may be used. In some embodiments, milliseconds may be used. Activation onset times at each sensor location were sequentially ordered in time. Stored action potential tracings were used to create an electrograph (voltage-time series), by inserting the action potential tracings at the activation time onsets for each sensor. Finally, a direct phase assignment technique was used to identify a core region. An activation trail is directly indicated by the relationship of these activation sequences to a core region—if they revolve around a core, then an electrical rotor is detected and considered to be a cause, but if they emanate radially from a core region, then a focal beat is detected and considered a cause. Results were displayed as an animation on a computer monitor for physician review.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">The activation trail <b>1030</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> revealed an electrical rotor as the cause for this man's AF. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, activation onset times can be seen to revolve around a core region in the right atrium at times color-coded from 10 ms (blue (“B”)) to 200 ms (red (“R”)). No localized cause was found in the left atrium, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> displays this same rotor in a different form, as three snapshots in time of tissue that is depolarized (activated; red (“R”)) and repolarized (not activated, turquoise (“T”)). Viewed chronologically (0 ms, 100 ms and 170 ms, from left to right), these snapshots also trace activation sequences revolving around a core region (a rotor). This core region had a high likelihood of being a cause, since it was a solitary source that controlled electrical activation for almost all of the surrounding atrium (large space constant).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">Clinically, it was surprising that this electrical rotor lay in the right atrium. The right atrial rotor site neither showed high spectral dominant frequency, nor low amplitude fractionated signals, and would not normally be identified or targeted for ablation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">Ablation commenced directly at the rotor core in the right atrium at a site indicated by the red (dark) dot <b>1060</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>. Notably, AF slowed within 30 seconds of energy delivery to a cycle length of 227 ms. Subsequent ablation at immediately adjacent sites, indicated by white dots <b>1070</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>, further slowed AF until it terminated to sinus rhythm within 6 minutes after ablation, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, AF can be seen to stop (arrow <b>1110</b>), followed by the restoration of normal sinus rhythm (arrow <b>1120</b>). At this point, AF could not be restarted using the typical technique of rapid pacing as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, where time segment <b>1210</b> shows rapid pacing with capture of the atrium, time segment <b>1220</b> shows no induction of AF and time segment <b>1230</b> shows sinus rhythm after the end of pacing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">This result is paradigm-shifting compared to the current state-of-the-art, where slowing of AF typically occurs after lengthy ablation that is widely and empirically applied (to 30-40% of the atrium), yet termination of persistent AF is still uncommon. Conversely, the invention was applied to acutely slow and acutely terminate AF with ablation of less than approximately 2-3% of the atrium. Ablating only at one site identified a priori in persistent AF, and seeing immediate slowing and termination of AF is not known to have been performed previously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0017" num="0000">Other Examples of Identification and Localization of Sources for AF</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0222">A 77-year-old man presented for ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). His history was notable for paroxysmal AF despite multiple antiarrhythmic medications, a slightly enlarged left atrium (diameter 45 mm) and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (58%). At invasive electrophysiology study, catheters were inserted into the atria as described. The invention was applied to multiple sensors. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> shows phase maps of activation in cardiac rhythm disorders (e.g., AF). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, panels <b>901</b>-<b>904</b> (left to right), indicate 90°, 180°, 270° and 360° phases of activation around a spatial point, i.e., a localized source (electrical rotor) at this spatial point near the left inferior pulmonary vein. Inspection of panels <b>901</b>-<b>904</b> (proceeding forward in time) reveals that the depolarized (activated) tissue in warmer colors (red (“R”)) revolves clockwise around a core region on the medial lip of the left inferior pulmonary vein (see outline as black hourglass). Ablation at this site terminated AF acutely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0223">A 40-year-old patient with persistent AF presented for ablation. The AF was resistant to flecainide and other anti-arrhythmic medications, his left atrial diameter was 52 mm and left ventricular ejection fraction was 69%. At invasive electrophysiology study, catheters were inserted into the atria as described above. The invention was applied to multiple sensors. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, panels <b>911</b>-<b>914</b> show a localized source in the form of an electrical rotor in the posterior wall of the left atrium. Again, viewing panels <b>911</b>-<b>914</b> from left to right shows that activated (depolarized) tissue revolves counter-clockwise around a core region on the posterior wall of the left atrium between the pulmonary veins. After ablation at this site, the patient remains free of AF. To the best of the inventors' knowledge, these are the first actual demonstrations of the existence of electrical rotors in human AF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0224">A 56-year-old patient with paroxysmal AF and significant symptoms presented for ablation. The AF continued despite several anti-arrhythmic medications. His left atrium was moderately enlarged. At invasive electrophysiology study, catheters were inserted into the atria as described above. The invention was applied to multiple sensors. Panels <b>1610</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> show the output of a localized source in the left atrium, between the pulmonary veins although not lying at these veins. The source was repetitive, as indicated by arrow <b>1620</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>. The activation trail (arrows <b>1630</b>) shows activation emanating radially from this site. In panels <b>1640</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, left atrial activation is seen to be fibrillatory (disorganized). Ablation was applied to this focal beat cause, and AF terminated acutely. At the time of filing, the patient has been completely free from AF for several months. This is a paradigm shifting because normal ablation lesions in this patient, that circle the pulmonary veins, would have missed this source. Thus, this patient would likely have been one who would have recurred after ablation, if the prior art known techniques of treating AF were used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0225"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref> illustrate a method of reconstructing cardiac signals associated with a complex rhythm disorder received over a plurality of channels from a patient's heart. The cardiac signals can be electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, signals from inside the heart (electrograms), representations of these signals, including magnetocardiogram signals or representations of mechanical activity (echo-cardiography, with or without Doppler), or generally any signals that represent the patient's biological rhythms. The cardiac signals can be received and recorded on a storage medium. The signals are captured by a plurality of sensors from the patient's heart and transmitted via the channels to at least one computing device. The at least one computing device is configured to reconstruct the cardiac signals in accordance with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref> also illustrate a constituent method of determining an activation time of a beat in the complex rhythm disorder. The at least one computing device is further configured to determine the activation time of the beat in accordance with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0226"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a flowchart of an example method to classify the plurality of channels according to quality of beats in signals received over the channels. The method starts at operation <b>1700</b> in which a channel is selected from the plurality of the channels. A signal (or part thereof) received over the channel is retrieved. At operation <b>1705</b>, one or more filters are applied to the remove baseline wander and noise from the signal. Additional filtering of the signal can be performed, such as, frequency domain filtering (e.g., bandpass, high-pass, low-pass, and/or other frequency domain filtering) and time-domain filtering (e.g., median-beat filtering, template-matching to produce correlation filtering, and/or other time-domain filtering). At operation <b>1710</b>, a portion of the received signal is identified or selected as a high-confidence level representation of a beat (e.g., template beat). For example, the template beat can be selected (algorithmically, from a database, or via user interaction) with one or more attributes including but not limited to: an acceptable amplitude (signal to noise ratio &gt;1), an acceptable cycle length (greater than the expected rate-related action potential duration), and absence of identifiable noise that may distort its signal shape. The selected template beat is used to identify other high-confidence beats in the signal. In one embodiment, the template beat can be selected using an expert system <b>1715</b> from a library of beat types according to one more criteria associated with the patient or the signal. These criteria include, but are not limited to age, gender, AF type (paroxysmal or persistent), length of AF history, AF cycle length, signal amplitude, recording location within the atria (e.g., left atrial, right atrial, coronary sinus), left ventricular ejection fraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0227">At operation <b>1720</b>, successive beats are identified in the signal, such as by performing template matching using the selected template beat. Alternate methods of identifying beats in the signal may also be used, including voltage above a threshold or maximum rate of change of voltage (first derivative, MAO exceeding a threshold. At operation <b>1725</b>, a determination is made as to whether the selected signal has an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR is generally greater than one (1) (i.e., the signal is larger than the noise floor) but can vary depending upon sensor location and nature of the noise. For example, if the signal and noise are periodic but with different periods, then each may be separated by their different spectral characteristics. If it is determined at operation <b>1725</b> that the SNR of the signal is not acceptable, the channel is marked as a non-interpretable or non-usable channel at operation <b>1730</b>. Alternatively, if it is determined at operation <b>1725</b> that the SNR of the signal is acceptable, the example method continues with operations <b>1735</b>-<b>1775</b> to classify the channel as a high-confidence channel or low-confidence channel according to the beats in the signal associated with this channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0228">At operation <b>1735</b>, an identified beat is selected from the plurality of identified beats in the signal of the selected channel. At operation <b>1740</b>, a determination is made whether the selected beat includes multiple components that could represent an activation onset (e.g., deflections), one of which can be selected as the activation onset of the selected beat. If it is determined at operation <b>1740</b> that the selected beat has multiple components, then at operation <b>1745</b> the selected beat is tagged as a “Class-B” beat and an activation onset is selected in association with a component of the selected beat. A Class-B beat is one in which the activation onset cannot be determined with a high-degree of confidence, as opposed to a “Class-A” beat, which is typically monophasic (i.e., a non-complex beat in which the activation onset is not in question) in a setting of low noise and thus considered a beat having a high-degree of confidence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0229">Activation onset is selected based on at least one of the following: maximum dV/dt of the selected beat; template match of the beat to a template (selected automatically, or from a database based on patient type and location within the heart, or interactively by the user); amplitude of the selected beat; a comparison of the components in the selected beat to components of corresponding beats on adjacent channels; and/or another one or more selection criteria. Thereafter, the method continues at operation <b>1750</b> described below. Alternatively, if it is determined at operation <b>1740</b> that the selected beat does not have multiple components that could represent activation onset (e.g., Class-A beat, as defined above (typically, a monophasic beat in an area of low noise), an activation onset is then selected and the method also continues at operation <b>1750</b> as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0230">At operation <b>1750</b>, a determination is made as to whether the cycle length of the selected beat based upon the selected activation onset is acceptable. An acceptable cycle length extending from the selected activation onset is defined as ranging from the minimum (rate-related action potential duration, APD) to the maximum (defined cycle length, CL). For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the deflections <b>608</b> are not acceptable since they fall within the minimum rate-related APD starting from that activation onset (depicted by <b>606</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>). The maximum CL is a measurement of time from the selected activation onset to the next beat. From the observations of the inventor, the minimum rate-related APD can range from 90 to 400 ms. The maximum CL can also range from about 90 ms to 400 ms. If at operation <b>1750</b> it is determined that the cycle length is acceptable the selected beat is tagged as a “Class-A” beat at operation <b>1753</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0231">However, if at operation <b>1750</b> the determined cycle length is not acceptable, then at operations <b>1756</b>, <b>1758</b>, the components (defections) of the selected beat are iterated for a predetermined number of iterations (e.g., 2 iterations) until the cycle length extending from the activation onset of a selected component is determined to be acceptable at operation <b>1750</b>. Beats that are considered to be “Class-A” (from operation <b>1740</b>) are not typically modified, that is, their activation onset is not altered by these operations. Thereafter, at operation <b>1760</b> a next beat is selected from the selected signal and the operations <b>1735</b>-<b>1760</b> are repeated for the selected beat, until no beats remain on the selected signal (or for a predetermined number of examined beats).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">At operation <b>1765</b>, a determination is made as to whether “Class-A” beats make up a predetermined percentage of a total number of beats or number of beats examined in the signal of the selected channel. The predetermined percentage can be selected to be 75% of the total beats or examined beats. It is noted that other predetermined percentages can be used. If it is determined that there is a sufficient number of Class-A beats at operation <b>1765</b>, then at operation <b>1770</b>, the selected channel is classified as high-confidence channel. Alternatively, if it is determined that there is not a sufficient number of Class-A beats at operation <b>1765</b>, then at operation <b>1775</b>, the selected channel is classified as low-confidence channel. The method continues at operation <b>1780</b>, where the next channel from the plurality of channels is selected and the operations <b>1700</b>-<b>1775</b> are repeated for this selected channel until the plurality of channels have been classified in accordance with the example method illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0233"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a flowchart of an example method to revise or update selected activation onsets of certain quality beats in signals received over the channels. Specifically, the method of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> iterates over Class-B beats of the plurality of channels to potentially revise or update selected activation onsets, tagging Class B low-confidence activation onsets. Accordingly, the method starts at operation <b>2700</b> in which a channel is selected and a Class-B beat is selected in the selected channel. Once Class-B beats are processed on the selected channel, the next channel having class-B beats is selected until Class-B beats of the plurality of channels are processed (excluding channels marked as non-interpretable in operation <b>1730</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">At operation <b>2710</b>, a determination is made as to whether there are Class-A beats that correspond to the selected Class-B beat (e.g., are within a predetermined time of the Class-B beat) in channels that are adjacent to the selected channel.

Alternatively, if at operation <b>2710</b> it is determined that there is no corresponding Class-A beat in the signals of adjacent channels, the method continues at operation <b>2750</b>, as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">At operation <b>2720</b>, a vector is computed using activation onsets of the corresponding (nearby) Class-A beats to guide selection of activation onset at the selected Class-B beat. At operation <b>2730</b>, the computed vector is refined based on at least one property. The computed vector is defined by channel locations surrounding the channel of interest. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, activation onsets are defined for the beat under consideration in each of these channels. These activation onsets are used to define a set of plausible vectors as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> (knowing the spatial location of each channel). The vector based upon these surrounding channel locations will allow the best activation onset time to be determined for the channel of interest for that beat (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24, 28, 30 and 32</figref>). The vector can also be refined based on the shape or polarity change of the selected beat, or whether activation from this site is rotational (i.e., a rotor) or radial (i.e., a focal beat) which both give zero vectors at the selected Class-B beat), and/or one or more other properties. Clearly, this vector may vary from beat-to-beat (cycle-to-cycle).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236">At operation <b>2740</b>, a time interval (i.e., acceptance window) is defined for the selected Class-B beat. The time interval indicates the earliest permissible onset of the selected Class-B beat (relative to a prior beat) and the latest permissible onset the selected Class-B beat (based upon at least one property). The properties considered or used include the vector, APD restitution, conduction velocity (CV) restitution, diastolic interval (DI), fiber angles, one or more anatomical factors, as well as one or more additional properties. Specifically, the inventor has recorded conduction velocity measurements at various atrial regions at various rates in different patient types; these conduction velocity dynamics can be used to determine if a proposed signal deflection occurs too early or too late to be conducted along the computed vector. Similarly, the inventor has recorded measurements of action potential duration rate-dynamics, based upon fiber angle orientations at multiple atrial locations, as well as anatomic factors (such as the known propensity for regions such as the crista terminalis to show conduction block).</div>

Parameters that are considered in the expert system <b>2745</b> include age, gender, whether AF is paroxysmal or persistent, blood pressure, atrial volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, presence of diabetes mellitus, and one or more other criteria.

In another embodiment, an expert system <b>2755</b>, which stores a library of signal shapes according to one or more criteria associated with the patient or the signal, can be used to select a component of the selected Class-B beat within the acceptance window.

The determined time interval is successively advanced along the signal of the selected channel to determine whether a deflection of the signal lies at or close to this time interval within the acceptance window. In one embodiment, the time interval can be averaged (or median used) based on successive Class-A beats, if available in the signal of the selected channel.

The purpose of is to ensure that activation onsets are consistent between all Class-A beats and Class-B beats. Final adjustment of activation onsets can be made to minimize inconsistencies that now arise. In one embodiment, an expert system <b>3725</b> can be used to provide one or more properties to define the acceptance window, such as APD and CV restitution, DI, and/or other properties. At operation <b>3730</b>, the computed vector is refined based on at least one property.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">The diastolic interval (DI) and action potential duration (APD) relationship can be used to identify activation onsets in a beat of a signal. In complex rhythm disorders (e.g., cardiac fibrillation), when a signal quality is insufficient to accurately determine an activation onset of a Class-B beat in a signal received over a channel, activation onset of a Class-A beat in the signal can be used along with the APD dependence on a previous DI to estimate an acceptance window for the Class-B beat. More specifically, an APD can be defined for each activation cycle based on a previous DI to reconstruct an action potential (AP) trace from the signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">An AP reconstruction attempt is deemed to have failed when any defined APD is less than a predefined minimum (e.g., 90 ms) or exceeds the available cycle length (CL) within which the APD must fit. The AP trace shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates such a failure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">For example, considering the red dashed lines to be selected activation onsets and the blue lines to be APDs in the AP reconstruction, the fifth APD has not fallen to an acceptable level for reactivation before the next activation onset is reached. This is deemed a reconstruction failure and implies that the APD-DI relationship used, paired with the initial DI used to calculate the first APD (DI seed) is not valid for representing the real APDs. It could be that the APD-DI relationship was incorrect, the DI seed was incorrect, or both.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">If the relationship between DIs and the following APDs is known, then a patient-specific restitution curve can be used to check a series of selected activation onsets without performing a number of calculations through a range of values for the constants in the DI-APD relationship. In accordance with patient specific restitution curve, a series of activation onsets is considered incorrect if there are no DI seeds that result in a correctly reconstructed AP trace. When reconstructing the AP trace, if a disproportionately high number of reconstruction attempts (for each DI seed) fails for any low confidence activation onset (after the first four activation onsets), that activation onset is deemed incorrect and should be re-evaluated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">A linear or logarithmic function (algorithm) can be used to relate DI and APD. For example, the linear function can be APD=C<b>1</b>*DI+C<b>2</b>. The logarithmic function can be APD=C<sub>1</sub>*ln(DI)+C<sub>2</sub>. If the constants in the relation between DI and APD are unknown, the linear function APD=C<b>1</b>*DI+C<b>2</b> can be assumed. AP reconstructions can be performed for plausible DI seeds and for plausible constants C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. The total number of AP reconstruction failures can be tracked for each activation onset that is marked. A largest number of failures in AP reconstruction are expected to occur in the first few activation onsets, as the incorrect DI seeds and constants will usually fail to fit the sequence within the first few activation onsets. If a disproportionately large number of failures occur later in the AP reconstruction, then the activation onset is considered “implausible” and marked for review and/or further analysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">If an assumption is made that the relation between DI and APD is invariant for all locations in the heart, then the accuracy of the calculation can be improved by excluding constants C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> that lead to failed trace reconstructions in signals that have high confidence activation onsets. In this way, the foregoing algorithm will exclude all mathematical DI-APD relationships that are not likely to apply to the specific patient being analyzed.</div>

The cardiac signals within window <b>402</b> represent electrical cardiac activity, during a complex rhythm disorder such as atrial fibrillation (AF), of various locations in the atrium, at which a corresponding sensor is located. It is to be noted that the detection of the “earliest” activation onset is impossible through mere visual inspection of the cardiac signals <b>404</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, as there is no discernable quiescent period in the cardiac signals <b>404</b> to enable detection of the earliest activation onset from the signals <b>404</b>.</div>

This is because multiple co-existing waves may exist in AF (unlike rhythms such as supraventricular tachycardia). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows some of these potential wave directions, indicating multiple potential wavepaths.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows examples of various methods for detecting beats, determining activation onsets, and disregarding noise on the time-varying cardiac signals shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. A time-varying cardiac signal from a high-confidence channel is shown as signal <b>802</b>. In a first approach, in order to mark or tag the activation onsets in signal <b>802</b>, a template <b>804</b> can be derived from one of the more discernible deflections (or beats) in a given time period of the signal <b>802</b>. This template <b>804</b> can then be used to detect subsequent and prior beats in signal <b>802</b> by using correlation functions, or other methods. A second method that can be used to tag activation onsets in signal <b>802</b> is shown using a rate-adapted APD <b>806</b>, which was essentially described above in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. That is, any deflections that occur in signal <b>802</b> before the end of the APD <b>806</b>, are eliminated or classified as noise since the heart tissue is physically unable to reactivate during this time. Accordingly, the deflections pointed to by arrow <b>810</b> are eliminated from being considered activation onsets. A third method of accurately determining activation onsets is by filtering out noise within a specified frequency range or bandwidth, as shown by arrows <b>812</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, which is then also eliminated from consideration as activation onsets. In a fourth approach, activation onset times, indicated by vertical arrows <b>814</b>, are determined using a combination of template match, crossing a predetermined voltage threshold, and a maximum dV/dt, which is defined as the maximum rate of change of the voltage with respect to time or slope of the time-varying cardiac signal.</div>

For low-confidence channels, different templates may be used to detect various shapes of signal components or deflections.

The task is to: a) find activation at C<b>5</b>C<b>6</b> (B Beat); and b) use vectors from surrounding channels. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> includes the same signals shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> (from window <b>402</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>), however it is stretched along the y-axis for enhanced clarity.

For example, assume that the activation onset at cardiac signal C<b>5</b>C<b>6</b>, which is denoted as a B-channel, is to be determined using vectors from surrounding channels having determinate activation onsets. From <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the most likely vector paths through cardiac signal C<b>5</b>C<b>6</b> (with the unknown activation onset) is from sensor C<b>78</b> to C<b>34</b> since alternate paths through, such as through sensor C<b>56</b>, would exhibit a conduction velocity that is either too fast (such as from sensor B<b>56</b> to C<b>56</b>), or less probable (such as a zig-zag progression through sensors B<b>78</b>, B<b>56</b>, C<b>78</b>, and C<b>56</b>) than that from sensors C<b>78</b> to C<b>34</b>. Accordingly, the outcome of the analysis indicates that the activation onset for the cardiac signal C<b>5</b>C<b>6</b> is derived using a vector, which is not necessarily linear, between the activation onsets associated with sensors C<b>78</b> and C<b>34</b>, and thus cardiac signals C<b>7</b>C<b>8</b> and C<b>3</b>C<b>4</b>, respectively.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">In addition, activation onsets are determined using APD restitution and repolarization times as well as fiber angles (anatomic paths). For instance, if fiber angles are perpendicular to the vector of propagation at the indicated collision, this adds confidence to the results. Otherwise, another iteration may be required to ensure that activation onset times were not skewed by particular deflections in class-B channels that gave this appearance of slowing. In general, it is expected that wave propagation perpendicular to fiber angles is slower than propagation parallel to fiber angles. Fiber angles are provided from experimentation, and from known angles and anisotropy at certain locations in the atrium, such as the posterior left atrial wall and the septopulmonary bundle of Papez.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">In general, it is considered that inversion of the beat signal polarity indicates that the wave is passing the bipolar recording electrode in the opposite direction.

Specifically, each reconstructed APD time series is used as an input to the Hilbert transform. A detrending algorithm is applied to set voltages at the activation times to zero. The Hilbert transform is used to construct the phase plane of detrended signals. Then, the Hilbert transform at all electrodes is interpolated across the fine regular grid. The spatial distributions of phase are analyzed with a topological charge technique to locate phase singularities associated with the ends of wavefronts such as at the tip of a reentrant wave. Activation wavefronts are then constructed by tracking isolines of zero phase using an active-edge technique. In summary, for a snapshot in time, the green line <b>2202</b> indicates the leading edge of depolarization across the tissue, and the blue line <b>2204</b> indicates the trailing edge of repolarization.

For example, such identification can be useful in certain cases where modification to at least a portion on or within the shape is not possible or desirable, as indicated by a portion of the shape that is shown in the gray box. In these cases, it may be desirable to alter or interrupt aberrant activation exits formed by the source, as indicated by the black curve interrupting exits “<b>1</b>”, “<b>2</b>” and “<b>4</b>” from the shape. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45E</figref> provides a key for interpreting the different types of impulse generators shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45A-45D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0291">Shaped ablation can be used to target at least a portion of a migrating locus of a source of a complex rhythm disorder of an organ (e.g., cardiac rhythm disorder of the heart) to eliminate or alter the complex rhythm disorder. In accordance with an example method of treating a heart rhythm disorder, a shape (e.g., indicated by circumference or perimeter) of a region of tissue defined by a migrating source for the rhythm disorder can be determined. Thereafter, at least one portion of the region of tissue defined by the shape can be identified for selective modification (e.g., ablation) to terminate or alter the rhythm disorder. As described above, in certain instances a portion of tissue outside the shape can be identified, in combination with or alternatively to the at least one portion of region identified in the shape. In some embodiments, the shape can be determined by identifying at least one spatial point in tissue of an organ (e.g., cardiac tissue) at a point in time, tracking migration of the at least one spatial point over multiple points in time to define a plurality of spatial points, connecting the plurality of spatial points to form at least one path, and defining a perimeter around the at least one path.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0292">The defined shape can be refined based upon the three-dimensional shape, width, height, depth and tissue type of the organ (e.g., heart) associated with the source of the rhythm disorder. Concerning the heart, heart rhythm disorders can include one or more of atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular flutter, or other electrical disturbance within the heart.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0294" num="0293">A shaped ablation system can be used to target at least a portion of a migration locus of a source of a complex rhythm to eliminate or to alter the complex rhythm disorder. An example system to target a heart rhythm disorder includes at least one computing device (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>). The computing device processes cardiac signals to determine the shape in a region of tissue defined by a source associated with the heart rhythm disorder that migrates spatially on or within the shape. The computing device further identifies at least one portion of the tissue proximate to the shape to enable selective modification of the at least one portion. A catheter can modify the identified at least one portion of the tissue proximate to the shape to terminate or alter the heart rhythm disorder. The computing device can refine the shape based upon width, height, depth and tissue type associated with the spatial migration of the source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0295" num="0294">The catheter can destroy the identified at least one portion of the tissue proximate to the shape. An example catheter can include a plurality of sensors and a circuit. The sensors can be disposed (e.g., using the circuit) in a first spatial relationship with respect to the heart to facilitate determination of the shape of a region of tissue defined by the migrating source of the heart rhythm disorder. The circuit can receive data from the computing device that indicates the shape (and/or the at least one portion) and can further adjust the first spatial relationship of sensors to a second spatial relationship of the sensors based on the received data the shape and/or the at least one portion of the tissue proximate to the shape. The sensors can thereafter deliver energy to the sensors in the second spatial relationship to terminate or alter the heart rhythm disorder.</div>
