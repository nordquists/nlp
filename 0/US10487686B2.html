<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Higher operating temperatures for gas turbine engines are continuously being sought in order to improve their efficiency. However, as operating temperatures increase, the high temperature durability of the components of the engine must correspondingly increase. Significant advances in high temperature capabilities have been achieved through the formulation of iron, nickel, and cobalt-based superalloys. While superalloys have found wide use for components used throughout gas turbine engines, and especially in the higher temperature sections, alternative lighter-weight component materials have been proposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are a class of materials that consist of a reinforcing material surrounded by a ceramic matrix phase. Such materials, along with certain monolithic ceramics (i.e. ceramic materials without a reinforcing material), are currently being used for higher temperature applications. These ceramic materials are lightweight compared to superalloys yet can still provide strength and durability to the component made therefrom. Therefore, such materials are currently being considered for many gas turbine components used in higher temperature sections of gas turbine engines, such as airfoils (e.g. turbines, and vanes), combustors, shrouds and other like components that would benefit from the lighter-weight and higher temperature capability these materials can offer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">CMC and monolithic ceramic components can be coated with environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) to protect them from the harsh environment of high temperature engine sections. EBCs can provide a dense, hermetic seal against the corrosive gases in the hot combustion environment, which can rapidly oxidize silicon-containing CMCs and monolithic ceramics. Additionally, silicon oxide is not stable in high temperature steam, but rather, can be converted to volatile (gaseous) silicon hydroxide species. Thus, EBCs can help prevent dimensional changes in the ceramic component due to such oxidation and volatilization processes. Unfortunately, there can be some undesirable issues associated with standard, industrial coating processes such as plasma spray and vapor deposition (i.e. chemical vapor deposition, CVD, and electron beam physical vapor deposition, EBPVD) currently used to apply EBCs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there remains a need for methods for environmental barrier coatings for ceramic component that are suitable for use in the high temperature steam environments present in gas turbine engines.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Also, as used herein, “organic processing aids” refers to any dispersants, plasticizers, thickeners, and surfactants present in the slurry. These organic processing aids are comprised primarily of carbon and other elements that volatilize during processing such that they are not present in the post-sintered coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The slurry can be formed by combining any or all of the previously described slurry components with mixing media in a container. The mixture can be mixed using conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art such as shaking with up to about a 1 inch (about 25.4 mm) diameter alumina or zirconia mixing media, ball milling using about a 0.25 inch to about a 1 inch (about 0.64 cm to about 2.54 cm) diameter alumina or zirconia mixing media, attritor milling using about a 1 mm to about a 5 mm diameter zirconia-based mixing media, planetary ball milling using from about a 1 mm to about a 5 mm diameter zirconia-based media, or mechanical mixing or stirring with simultaneous application of ultrasonic energy. The mixing media or ultrasonic energy can break apart any agglomerated ceramic particles in the slurry. Any mixing media present may then be removed by straining, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">If not added previously, thickener may be added to the slurry if desired and the resulting mixture may be agitated by such methods as mechanical stirring, rolling, blending, shaking, and other like methods until the thickener is fully dissolved, generally after about 5 to about 60 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Similarly, if not added previously, the addition of the sintering aids may follow along with mixing using the previously described methods until the sintering aids dissolve, which is about 5 to about 60 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Once all slurry components have been mixed, the slurry can be filtered through screens of varying mesh sizes to remove any impurities that may be present, such as after the initial mixing of the slurry or after use of the slurry to deposit coating layers. A 325 mesh screen, for example, can be used to filter out impurities having an average size of about 44 microns or greater.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">After mixing and optional filtering, the slurry can be agitated indefinitely by slow rolling, slow mechanical mixing, or other like methods to avoid trapping air bubbles in the slurry. In one embodiment, the slurry may be refreshed by adding additional solvent to account for that which has evaporated during processing. Alternately, once mixed, the slurry can be set aside until needed for application. Those skilled in the art will understand that the previous embodiment sets forth one method for making the slurry compositions described herein, and that other methods are also acceptable, as set forth in the Examples below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Optionally, masking can be applied to the ceramic component before the slurry is applied to prevent coating specific areas of the component. Masking may be carried out using conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, tapes, tooling, and paint-on adhesives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Once all desired masking of the ceramic component is complete, the slurry can be applied to the component to produce a coated component. The slurry can be applied to the component (or on top of a previously applied layer) using any conventional slurry deposition method known to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to, dipping the component into a slurry bath, or painting, rolling, stamping, spraying, or pouring the slurry onto the component. Slurry application can be carried out manually or it may be automated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Once the slurry has been applied to the component, and while the slurry is still wet, it may be leveled to remove excess slurry material. Leveling may be carried out using conventional techniques such as, but not limited to, spinning, rotating, slinging the component, dripping with or without applied vibration, or using a doctor blade, to remove excess slurry material. Similar to the slurry application, leveling can be conducted manually or it may be automated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, the coated component can be dried. Drying may be carried out in an enclosed area having additional organic solvent present in secondary containers. This can help slow the drying process because the atmosphere can be saturated with organic solvent. Since this process utilizes an organic solvent, it is not strongly sensitive to humidity. Temperature variation can be used to control the drying rate, however, those skilled in the art will understand that that temperatures can be kept below the flash point of the organic solvent. Placing a coated component in a vacuum chamber and pulling a vacuum can also be used to accelerate drying.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">After drying, any masking present may then be removed by peeling off tapes and adhesives, pyrolysis of tapes and adhesives, or removing multi-use tooling. Any rough edges remaining after masking removal may be scraped or cut away using a sharp or abrasive tool.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, burnout of the organic processing aids may be carried out by placing the dried component in an elevated temperature environment so that any residual solvent can be evaporated and the organic processing aids can be pyrolyzed. In one embodiment, burnout of the organic processing aids may be accomplished by heating the dried component at a rate of from about 1° C./min to about 15° C./min to a temperature of from about 400° C. to about 1000° C. and holding the component at this temperature for from about 0 to about 10 hours. In another embodiment, the coated component may be heated at a rate of from about 2° C./min to about 6° C./min to a temperature of from about 600° C. to about 800° C. and holding the component at this temperature for from about 0 to about 10 hours. In another embodiment, the hold time can be eliminated by slowly ramping up to the target temperature without holding, followed by ramping up or down to another temperature at a different rate. In another embodiment, binder burnout can occur rapidly by placing the coated component into a furnace heated to a temperature of from about 400° C. to about 1400° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Binder burnout and sintering heat treatments may be carried out in an ambient air atmosphere, or in an inert gas atmosphere where the inert gas is selected from hydrogen, a noble gas such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the inert gas atmosphere can be used in conjunction with Lnb and SiO<sub>2 </sub>sintering aids so as not to convert the rare earth metal to an oxide before it melts. Maintaining the Lnb metal in a metal state can promote liquid phase sintering and subsequent reaction with the SiO<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The dried component may then be sintered to produce a component comprising an environmental barrier coating. Sintering can serve to simultaneously densify and impart strength to the coating. Additionally, in the case of the transition and compliant layers of the EBC, sintering can impart a hermetic seal against high temperature steam present in the engine environment. In the case of the outer layer, sintering can provide a dense barrier against the infiltration of molten silicates, such as calcium-magnesium aluminosilicate (CMAS) that may be encountered as a result of particulate contamination (i.e. dirt and sand) in the engine environment. Sintering can be carried out using a conventional furnace, or by using such methods as microwave sintering, laser sintering, infrared sintering, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Sintering can be accomplished by heating the dried component at a rate of from about 1° C./min to about 15° C./min to a temperature of from about 1100° C. to about 1700° C. and holding the component at that temperature for from about 0 to about 24 hours. In another embodiment, sintering can be accomplished by heating the coated component at a rate of from about 5° C./min to about 15° C./min to a temperature of from about 1300° C. to about 1375° C. and holding the component at that temperature for from about 0 to about 24 hours. In another embodiment, sintering can occur rapidly by placing the coated component into a furnace heated to a temperature of from about 1000° C. to about 1400° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In an alternate embodiment, all layers of the EBC can be applied, one on top of the other, before masking removal, organic processing aid burnout, and sintering are carried out. Those skilled in the art will understand that after application of each layer, the layer should be dried, or partially dried, before the application of the subsequent layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In another embodiment, the sintering aid does not need to be added directly to the transition or outer layer of the slurry to achieve the desired result. The sintering aid can be added to one layer of the EBC slurry, and during sintering, the sintering aid can diffuse throughout the EBC to the remaining layers. In another embodiment, a primary material slurry with no sintering aid can be densified by applying the layer, allowing it to dry, and then back infiltrating a sol-gel solution comprising a sintering aid prior to heat treatment as explained below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Infiltration may allow for the densification of a thicker layer of EBC material at one time. Moreover, infiltration is a way to add more sintering aid after sintering if the coating is not as dense as desired. The sol-gel solution used for infiltration may be a solution of an organic solvent and a solvent soluble salt sintering aid, as defined previously, or a solution of water and a water soluble salt sintering aid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">As used herein “water soluble salt sintering aid” can refer to “water-soluble iron salts” such as iron nitrate and iron acetate; “water-soluble gallium salts” such as gallium nitrate and gallium acetate; “water-soluble aluminum salts” such as aluminum nitrate and aluminum acetate; “water-soluble nickel salts” such as nickel nitrate and nickel acetate; “water-soluble titanium salts” such as titanium chloride; “water-soluble boron salts” such as boric acid and ammonium borate; and “water-soluble alkaline earth salts” such as include Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Ba(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, MgC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CaC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, SrC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and BaC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">As used herein, “sintering aid(s)” can refer to any of a “slurry sintering aid,” a “solvent soluble sintering aid,” or a “water soluble salt sintering aid,” as defined previously. Without intending to be limited by theory, the inclusion of sintering aids to the EBC embodiments herein can increase the rate of diffusion of primary material such that surface area reduction (i.e. high surface area particles consolidating to form a dense coating) can occur at lower temperatures than it would have absent the sintering aid. As previously described, sintering at lower temperatures (i.e. about 1357° C. or below) can not only result in a highly dense (i.e. greater than about 85% for the transition layer, greater than about 70% for the compliant layer, and greater than about 70% for the outer layer) coating that can be less susceptible to the penetration of hot steam from the engine environment, but can also help prevent the degradation of the mechanical properties of the underlying component that could result from prolonged exposure to higher temperatures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Sintering aids can act in a variety of ways depending on the amount of sintering aid included in the EBC and the time at which the coating is exposed to sintering temperatures. For example, in one embodiment, the sintering aid can dissolve completely into the primary material (i.e. primary transition, outer, or compliant, material) to “dope” the material. In another embodiment, if the amount of sintering aid that is soluble in the primary material is exceeded, the remaining insoluble portion of sintering aid can react with the primary material to form the secondary material (i.e. secondary transition, outer, or compliant material). In another embodiment, primary material and secondary material can be present as described previously, along with residual sintering aid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In these latter two embodiments, when the secondary material is highly volatile in high temperature steam, such as but not limited to, alkali silicates, alkaline earth silicates, mullite, iron silicate, borosilicate glass, nickel silicate, and residual sintering aids of iron, aluminum, titanium, gallium, nickel, boron, alkali, and alkali-earth compounds, as long as the total volume of secondary material, plus porosity (plus residual sintering aid when present) in either of the intermediate layer or compliant layer (when present) of the EBC remains about 15% by volume or less, the hermetic seal can be maintained. Alternately, in these latter two embodiments, when the secondary material is highly resistant to volatilization in high temperature steam, such as when the secondary material comprises a rare earth containing compound, such as but not limited to rare earth oxide, rare earth titanate, rare earth iron compound, rare earth gallate, rare earth aluminate, and rare earth aluminosilicate, the porosity in either of the intermediate or compliant layer (when present) of the EBC need remain about 15% by volume or less to maintain the hermetic seal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">It should be noted that at low levels of sintering aid, the densified coating layer might not initially include any detectable secondary materials. In some embodiments, the secondary materials may never become detectable. In other embodiments, however, after hours of exposure to high temperature steam in the engine environment, the secondary materials can become detectable using techniques such as x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">EBC embodiments described herein can offer a variety of benefits over current EBCs and manufacturing processes thereof. Specifically, as previously described, the inclusion of a sintering aid in the EBC embodiments herein can permit sintering at lower temperatures (i.e. about 1357° C. or below). This can result in a highly dense (i.e. greater than about 85% for the transition layer, and greater than about 70% for each of the outer, and compliant, layers) coating that can be less susceptible to the penetration of hot steam from the engine environment, and can also help prevent the degradation of the mechanical properties of the underlying component that could result from prolonged exposure to higher temperatures. Also, the embodiments set forth herein can be made at less expense than current EBCs due to the use of the slurry deposition process, which is made possible by the incorporation of sintering aids into the various layers. Moreover, the present embodiments can provide for EBCs having a more uniform thickness than conventional techniques, such as plasma spraying, even when applying thin layers (&lt;2 mils). Additionally, the slurry deposition process can allow for the application of the EBCs to internal component passages as well as the ability to produce smooth surface finishes without an additional polishing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">There can be occasions when the EBC develops small and/or narrow defects (e.g. about 10 microns to about 5 mm in diameter; or about 10 microns to about 1 mm in width) that need to be repaired. The following repair processes are applicable to the EBCs described herein and may be carried out after sintering of an individual EBC layer, or after sintering the entire applied EBC, as explained herein below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In one embodiment, repairs may include remedying defects in one or more individual layers as the EBC is being applied using the methods described herein. In this embodiment, the repair can be carried out after sintering a given layer by applying a repair slurry comprising the same slurry materials used to make the layer having the defects. For example, if the transition layer develops a defect after sintering, the defect could be repaired using a “transition layer repair slurry” that comprises the same transition layer slurry materials used in the original application of the transition layer. In one embodiment, the repair slurry can comprise a higher solids loading of primary material ceramic particles than the original slurry layer as this can reduce shrinkage on drying and sintering of the repaired portion of the coating. In particular, the solids loading of primary material ceramic particles in the repair slurry can be greater than about 30% to about 55% by volume (as opposed to greater than about 10% by volume in one embodiment of the original slurry, and from about 10% to about 55% by volume in another embodiment of the original slurry used to make the layer). The repair slurry may be applied using any conventional method including those described previously, and the resulting “repair(ed) coating” may then be processed as described previously herein before application of any subsequent layer of the EBC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">In an alternate embodiment, repairs may include fixing defects after application and sintering of the entire EBC. In this embodiment, the repair may be carried out on the EBC having defects using a transition layer repair slurry comprising the same materials present in the previously defined transition layer slurry (i.e. primary transition material, a sintering aid, and optionally secondary material). This particular repair slurry can seep into any defects present in the EBC and provide a hermetic seal to the repaired EBC coating after sintering. Again, the solids loading of the transition layer repair slurry may comprise upwards of about 30% to 55% by volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Additionally, repair processes may be used to reduce surface roughness of a plasma sprayed EBC having any composition. Specifically, if the surface roughness of a plasma sprayed EBC is unacceptable the coating can be smoothed over by applying either of the previously described transition layer slurry or outer layer slurry. When applied over the plasma sprayed EBC, the transition layer slurry or outer layer slurry can fill in any gaps, grooves, or uneven portions of the plasma sprayed coating and reduce the surface roughness to an acceptable degree. More specifically, depending on the thickness of the transition layer slurry or outer layer slurry, surface roughness of the plasma sprayed EBC can be reduced from greater than 200 micro inch Ra, to between 40 micro inch Ra and 200 micro inch Ra in one embodiment, and from between 40 micro inch Ra to 150 micro inch Ra in another embodiment. In one embodiment, the transition layer slurry or outer layer slurry can comprise a thickness of at least about 0.5 mils, and in another embodiment from about 0.5 mils to about 3 mils. The applied transition layer slurry can then be processed as described previously to produce a repaired EBC having an acceptable surface roughness. Additional slurry layers may be applied to the EBC if desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Such repair processes can provide the ability to repair localized defects, at varying points during the application or life of the coating, as opposed to stripping off and reapplying the entire coating. This, in turn, can result in a savings of time, labor, and materials.</div>

<heading id="h-0008">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">A silicon bond coat was applied to a SiC—SiC CMC using a conventional air plasma spray process. Next, a primary transition material slurry was made by first mixing ytterbium disilicate (primary transition material), iron oxide nanoparticles (sintering aid), ethanol (solvent), and polyethylenimine (dispersant) in a plastic container, along with enough 0.25 inch (6.35 mm) diameter, spherical zirconia media to line the bottom of container. This mixture was placed on a roller mill for 15 hours. After taking the container off of the roller mill, the zirconia media was removed and the slurry was filtered through a 325 mesh screen to remove any large particle agglomerates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">The resulting primary transition material slurry (Slurry A) consisted of 56.11% ytterbium disilicate, 0.54% iron oxide, 0.57% polyethylenimine, and the balance ethanol (all percents by weight). The silicon-coated ceramic component was dipped into Slurry A, dried in ambient conditions, re-dipped into Slurry A, dried in ambient conditions, and heat-treated at 10° C./minute to 1000° C. to burn out any residual organic materials. Then, the temperature was increased at 10° C./minute from 1000° C. to 1344° C. and held for 10 hours to form a transition layer comprising iron-doped ytterbium disilicate. The entire heat treatment was carried out in air. The heating environment resulted in the transition layer having a porosity of less than 15% by volume. These dipping, drying, and heat treating processes were repeated 8 times to build thickness of the transition layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Next, a primary outer material slurry was made by first mixing ytterbium monosilicate (primary outer material), iron oxide nanoparticles (sintering aid), ethanol (solvent), and polyethylenimine (dispersant) in a plastic container, along with enough 0.25 inch (6.35 mm) diameter, spherical zirconia media to line the bottom of container. This mixture was placed on a roller mill for 15 hours. After taking the container off of the roller mill, the zirconia media was removed and the slurry was filtered through a 325 mesh screen to remove any large particle agglomerates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The resulting primary outer material slurry (Slurry B) consisted of 61.19% ytterbium monosilicate, 0.29% iron oxide, 0.61% polyethylenimine, and the balance ethanol (all percents by weight). The silicon and transition layer-coated ceramic component was dipped into Slurry B, dried in ambient conditions, re-dipped into Slurry B, dried in ambient conditions, and heat-treated at 10° C./minute to 1000° C. to burn out any residual organic materials. Then, the temperature was increased at 10° C./minute from 1000° C. to 1344° C. and held for 10 hours to densify the transition layer. After heat treatment, the layer comprised iron-doped yttrium monosilicate. The entire heat treatment was carried out in air. The heating environment resulted in the transition layer having a porosity of less than 15% by volume. The dipping, drying, and heat treatments were repeated 2 times to build thickness of the outer layer.</div>

The outer layer and transition layer appeared to consist only of iron-doped primary materials (iron-doped ytterbium monosilicate and iron-doped ytterbium disilicate, respectively), x-ray diffraction was not able to detect any secondary material present in the EBC. EDS analysis of the layers suggested that the iron oxide had dissolved into the primary materials.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">To demonstrate proof of principle, a primary transition layer was deposited on a silicon metal wafer using a slurry deposition process. A primary transition material slurry was made by first mixing ytterbium disilicate powder (primary transition material), gallium oxide powder (sintering aid), ethanol (solvent), and polyethylenimine (dispersant) in a plastic container, along with enough 0.25 inch (6.35 mm) diameter, spherical zirconia media to line the bottom of container. This mixture was placed on a roller mill for 15 hours. After taking the container off of the roller mill, the zirconia media was removed and the slurry was filtered through a 325 mesh screen to remove any large particle agglomerates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">The resulting primary transition material slurry (Slurry C) consisted of 56.35% ytterbium disilicate, 0.64% gallium oxide, 0.57% polyethylenimine, and the balance ethanol (all percents by weight). The silicon-coated ceramic component was dipped into Slurry C, dried in ambient conditions, re-dipped into Slurry C, dried in ambient conditions, and heat-treated at 10° C./minute to 1000° C. to burn out any residual organic materials. Then, the temperature was increased at 10° C./minute from 1000° C. to 1344° C. and held for 10 hours to form a transition layer comprising iron-doped ytterbium disilicate. The entire heat treatment was carried out in air. The heating environment resulted in the transition layer (<b>108</b>) having a porosity of less than 15% by volume as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. No secondary phases were observed in this coating via electron microscope examination. EDS analysis suggested that the gallium had dissolved into the ytterbium disilicate primary material.</div>
