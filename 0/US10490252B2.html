<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 15/796,340 filed Oct. 27, 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, for any purpose.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">High data reliability, high speed of memory access, and reduced chip size are features that are demanded from semiconductor memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which is a typical semiconductor memory device, stores information by charges accumulated in cell capacitors, and, therefore, the information is lost unless refresh operations are periodically carried out. Therefore, refresh commands indicating refresh operations are periodically issued from a control device, which controls a DRAM. The refresh commands are issued from the control device at a frequency that all the word lines are certainly refreshed one time in the period of 1 refresh cycle (for example, 64 msec). In addition, the refresh command is periodically stolen as Row-Hammer refresh (Rhr) which maintains data retention of a row-address of a victim caused by Row-Hammer attack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, a conventional static Row-Hammer refresh rate control may not prevent bit errors due to Row Hammer effects that may occur at various timings from various causes and dynamic Row Hammer refresh rate control may be desired.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Various embodiments of the present disclosure will be explained below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific aspects and embodiments in which the present invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the present invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and structure, logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The various embodiments disclosed herein are not necessary mutually exclusive, as some disclosed embodiments can be combined with one or more other disclosed embodiments to form new embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a semiconductor device <b>10</b> including a time based sampling circuit <b>11</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The semiconductor device <b>10</b> may be an LPDDR4 SDRAM integrated into a single semiconductor chip, for example. The semiconductor device <b>10</b> may include a plurality of memory banks <b>15</b>, a peripheral circuit <b>18</b>. A time based sampling circuit <b>11</b> may include a time based common sampling circuit <b>11</b> <i>a </i>shared by the plurality of memory banks <b>15</b> banks and a bank sampling circuit <b>11</b> <i>b </i>including a sampling circuit <b>16</b> per bank provided in each bank of the plurality of memory banks <b>15</b>. For example, the peripheral circuit <b>18</b> may be a DRAM interface that may receive and transmit clock signals, command signals, address signals and data signals, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The time based common sampling circuit <b>11</b> <i>a </i>may include a sampling timing generator circuit <b>12</b> and an RHR state-control circuit <b>13</b>. For example, the sampling timing generator circuit <b>12</b> may be provided for the plurality of memory banks <b>15</b> or for each memory bank of the plurality of memory banks <b>15</b> (e.g., Bank<b>0</b>, . . . Bank<b>7</b>). For example, the RHR state-control circuit <b>13</b> may receive an RXCNT signal. from the peripheral circuit <b>18</b>. For example, the RXCNT signal may be provided at an end of each refresh operation. The RHR state-control circuit <b>13</b> may count responsive to the RXCNT signal in an active state, and may provide an instruction signal StealSlot for executing row hammer refresh (RHR) instead of normal refresh. The sampling timing generator circuit <b>12</b> may receive the instruction signal StealSlot from the RHR state-control circuit <b>13</b> and may further receive a frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc) from an oscillator block <b>14</b> for self-refresh. The sampling timing generator circuit <b>12</b> may provide a trigger signal for sampling (ArmSample) to a sampling circuit <b>16</b> of each memory bank of the plurality of memory banks <b>15</b> (e.g., Bank<b>0</b>, . . . Bank <b>7</b>) at a random timing. The ArmSample signal may be randomized by randomization of a frequency of the activation of the ArmSample signal and a difference between an interval of RHR execution (e.g., each time auto-refresh command is provided) and an interval (e.g., a cycle) of the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc). For example, the time based common sampling circuit <b>11</b> <i>a </i>may further include an interval measurement circuit <b>17</b>. The interval measurement circuit <b>17</b> may dynamically measure the interval of RHR execution (e.g., each time auto-refresh command is provided) based on the interval of the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc) received, and may further generate and provide a steal rate timing signal in four bits (“Y&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt;”) indicative of a timing of Steal Slot in order to adjust or optimize a steal rate at which the RHR is executed after normal refreshes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Responsive to the ArmSample signal, the sampling circuit <b>16</b> may provide a sampling signal (Sample<b>1</b>). A latch <b>19</b> (e.g., a latch, a flip-flop, etc.) of each memory bank of the plurality of memory banks <b>15</b> (e.g., Bank<b>0</b>, . . . Bank<b>7</b>) may capture (e.g., latch) a column (X) address responsive to the sampling signal (Sample<b>1</b>), an adjacent address of the column address may be calculated and provided as an RHR refresh address. For example, the sampling circuit <b>16</b> may provide the sampling signal (Sample<b>1</b>) a plurality of times in the interval of RHR execution and the captured address may be overwritten each time, and an adjacent address of the address most recently captured becomes a valid address that is to be finally applied to the RHR refresh address and provided as an address to a peripheral circuit <b>18</b> that handles clock signals, command signals, address signals and data signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic diagram of a time based sampling circuit <b>20</b> that may include an interval measurement circuit <b>26</b> and a sampling timing generator circuit <b>27</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. For example, the time based sampling circuit <b>20</b> may be the time based sampling circuit <b>11</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the interval measurement circuit <b>26</b> may be the interval measurement circuit <b>17</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the sampling timing generator circuit <b>27</b> may be the sampling timing generator circuit <b>12</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The interval measurement circuit <b>26</b> may dynamically measure the interval of RHR execution (e.g., each time auto-refresh command is provided) using the interval of the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc) received as a count cycle, and may further generate and provide a period of counter circuit in four bits as “Y&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt;” signals indicative of a timing of StealSlot in order to detect or capture a steal rate at which the RHR is executed after normal refreshes. The interval measurement circuit <b>26</b> may include a P-counter unit <b>261</b>. The P-counter unit <b>261</b> may include a P-counter <b>262</b> that may continuously count an integer from 0 in an incremental manner responsive to the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc), and the P-counter <b>262</b> may provide a count signal. The P-counter <b>262</b> may be reset responsive to an RHR instruction signal Rhr that is generated from a refresh signal Rfsh and the instruction signal StealSlot. The P-counter unit <b>261</b> may also include a latch <b>265</b> and a logic circuit <b>264</b>. The latch <b>265</b> may receive a match signal (described later in details) from the sampling timing generator circuit <b>27</b>, latch the match signal by an inversion of the RHR instruction signal Rhr and provide an intermediate match signal match<b>2</b>. The logic circuit <b>264</b> may be a NAND circuit that may receive the intermediate match signal match<b>2</b> and the RHR instruction signal Rhr and provide a trigger signal Rhr<b>2</b> <i>f </i>to a latch <b>263</b>. The latch <b>263</b> may receive the count signal from the P-counter <b>262</b>, latch the count signal with the trigger signal Rhr<b>2</b> <i>f </i>and provide the Y&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt; signals to the sampling timing generator circuit <b>27</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The sampling timing generator circuit <b>27</b> may include an N-counter unit <b>271</b> that may receive the Y&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt; signals, the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc) and the RHR instruction signal Rhr. For example, if the Y&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt; signals represent an integer N (e.g., “5”), an N-counter <b>275</b> in the N-counter unit <b>271</b> may continuously count an integer from 0 to (N−1) (e.g., “4”) in an incremental manner up to the integer N (e.g., “5”) represented by the Y&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt; signals, such as 0, 1, 2 . . . , N−1, responsive to the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc), and the N-counter <b>275</b> may provide a count signal. The N-counter <b>275</b> may be reset when the integer matches the integer N (e.g., “5”), responsive to a reset signal. For example, a comparator <b>274</b> may be a logic exclusive NOR circuit that may receive the count signal and the Y&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt; signals and may further provide the reset signal. The RHR instruction signal Rhr may be provided apart from the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc) asynchronously, to a latch circuit <b>276</b>. The latch circuit <b>276</b> may latch the count signal (e.g., “3”) responsive to the RHR instruction signal Rhr and may further provide the latched count signal as a latched signal X&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt; (e.g., indicative of “3”) to an M-counter unit <b>272</b>. In the M-counter unit <b>272</b>, an M-counter <b>278</b> may start counting in an incremental manner to an integer M (e.g., “3”) responsive to an intermediate frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc<b>2</b>) that a logic circuit <b>277</b> may provide responsive to the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc). The M-counter <b>278</b> may provide a count to a comparator <b>279</b>. For example, the comparator <b>279</b> may be a logic exclusive NOR circuit. The comparator <b>279</b> may compare the count from the M-Counter <b>278</b> and the latched signal X&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt; (e.g., “3”) from the N-counter unit <b>271</b>. If the count of the M-counter <b>278</b> matches the latched signal X&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt;, the comparator <b>279</b> may provide a match signal which may control a logic circuit <b>277</b> to stop providing an RhrOsc<b>2</b> signal to the M-counter <b>278</b> and a mixer <b>280</b> in a sampling unit <b>273</b>. For example, the logic circuit <b>277</b> may be a NAND circuit that may receive an inversion of the match signal and the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc) and may further provide the intermediate frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc<b>2</b>). For example, the mixer <b>280</b> may receive the reset signal from the comparator <b>274</b>. The mixer <b>280</b> may also receive the intermediate frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc<b>2</b>) and the RHR instruction signal Rhr, and provide the intermediate frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc<b>2</b>) as the trigger signal for sampling (ArmSample) while the count of M-counter <b>278</b> is below (e.g., 0, 1, 2) the latched signal X&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt; (e.g., “3”) until the count of M-counter <b>278</b> matches the latched signal X&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt;. The latch circuit <b>19</b> may update a row address each time responsive to the trigger signal for sampling (ArmSample), and a final updated row address is used for Rhr operation. The value of the latched signal X&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt; may be randomly determined, thus a latching interval may become random.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a circuit diagram of a row hammer refresh (Rhr) signal generator in the time based sampling circuit <b>20</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. For example the row hammer refresh (Rhr) signal generator may be an AND circuit that may provide the RHR instruction signal Rhr based on the Rfsh signal for signaling refresh operations and the instruction signal StealSlot. For example, the one-shot Rhr signal may be provided every eight pulses of the Rfsh signal when a steal rate (the interval of RHR execution) is set to 1/8 (RHR is executed every eight refresh operations) as indicated by the StealSlot signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of a counter <b>30</b> in the interval measurement block in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. For example, the counter <b>30</b> may be a portion of the P-counter unit <b>261</b>. For example, the counter <b>30</b> may include a P-counter <b>31</b> that may be the P-counter <b>262</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The P-counter <b>31</b> may include four flip-flop (FF) circuits <b>32</b> <i>a</i>, <b>32</b> <i>b</i>, <b>32</b> <i>c </i>and <b>32</b> <i>d </i>coupled in cascade connection. The flip-flop circuit <b>32</b> <i>a </i>may receive the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc) for self-refresh from an oscillator (e.g., the oscillator block <b>14</b>) and may further provide an output signal to the flip-flop circuit <b>32</b> <i>b </i>and a latch <b>33</b> <i>a</i>. The flip-flop circuit <b>32</b> <i>b </i>may receive the output signal from the flip-flop circuit <b>32</b> <i>a </i>and provide an output signal to the flip-flop circuit <b>32</b> <i>c </i>and a latch <b>33</b> <i>b</i>.

The flip-flop circuit <b>32</b> <i>d </i>may receive the output signal from the flip-flop signal <b>32</b> <i>c </i>and provide an output signal to a latch <b>33</b> <i>d</i>.

An interval of the RHR instruction signal Rhr may be indicated by N×tRhrOsc (tRhrOsc=a period of the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc)). For example, the P-counter <b>31</b> and the frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc) may have a relationship that the P-counter <b>31</b> may be able to count a period that is approximately equal to an actual interval for executing row hammer refresh, rather than having a slightly longer period.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a circuit diagram of a sampling unit <b>50</b> in the arm sample generator in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. For example, the sampling unit <b>50</b> may be the sampling unit <b>273</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The sampling unit <b>50</b> may receive the intermediate frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc<b>2</b>) (e.g., the RhrOsc<b>2</b> signal from the logic circuit <b>277</b>), the RHR instruction signal Rhr and the reset signal (e.g., the reset signal from the comparator <b>274</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). The sampling unit <b>50</b> may include an RhrOsc<b>2</b> pulse circuit <b>51</b> and an RHR pulse circuit <b>53</b>. The RhrOsc<b>2</b> pulse circuit <b>51</b> may provide a pulse signal with a pulse width corresponding to a delay circuit in the RhrOsc<b>2</b> pulse circuit <b>51</b> at an end (e.g., a falling edge) of an active period of the intermediate frequency-divided RHR oscillation signal (RhrOsc<b>2</b>). The RHR pulse circuit <b>53</b> may provide a pulse signal with a pulse width corresponding to a delay circuit in the RHR pulse circuit <b>53</b> at an end (e.g., a falling edge) of an active period of the RHR instruction signal Rhr. The sampling unit <b>50</b> may also include a reset divider circuit <b>52</b>. The reset divider circuit <b>52</b> may include a 2-bit counter <b>521</b> that may provide two active signals as output signals every four counts (and a frequency is four times). Thus, a first AND circuit <b>522</b> in the reset divider circuit <b>52</b> that may receive the two active output signals from the 2-bit counter <b>621</b> may provide an active output signal every four counts. A second AND circuit <b>523</b> in the reset divider circuit <b>52</b> may provide an intermediate reset signal that may be active responsive to the active reset signal and the output signal of the first AND circuit <b>522</b> that may also be active but at every four counts of the 2-bit counter <b>521</b>. Thus, when the interval of RHR execution becomes longer (e.g., Y&lt;<b>3</b>:<b>0</b>&gt; increases to a larger value) and the N-counter <b>27</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> still keeps counting the earlier smaller number N, the sampling unit <b>50</b> may provide the intermediate reset signal.
