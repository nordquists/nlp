<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2017-0121742 filed on Sep. 21, 2017 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/484,150 filed on Apr. 11, 2017 in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">Field</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a pixel circuit of a display panel and a display device, and more particularly, to a pixel circuit of a display panel that expresses grayscales in accordance with an amplitude and a duration of a drive current and a display device.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A light emitting diode (LED) display panel in the related art mainly adopts passive matrix (PM) driving, but active matrix (AM) driving is necessary for low power consumption. Recently, an AM driving circuit has been applied to an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display panel. However, in the case of the LED that is different from the OLED, a color shift phenomenon due to forward voltage (Vf) deviation between LEDs or the size of a drive current becomes greater than that of the OLED, and thus it is difficult to apply the AM driving circuit, which has been applied to the OLED display, to the LED display as it is.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Specifically, a pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) driving method in which an amplitude of a drive current differs for each grayscale for grayscale expression has been widely adopted in the OLED display, but if a PAM driving circuit in the related art is applied to the LED display as it is, a color shift problem that a color is greatly changed for each grayscale may occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, in a pulse width modulation (PWM) driving method in which the pulse width (or duty ratio) of a drive current differs depending on the grayscale, a PWM driving circuit in the related art drives thin film transistors (TFTs) in a linear operation region, and thus luminance difference due to the forward voltage deviation of the LED greatly occurs. Particularly, in the case of a digital PWM method, since grayscales are expressed in a sub field method, the number of grayscales that can be expressed is limited, and a false contour problem occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there has been a need for a low-power AM driving circuit having high luminance uniformity and low color shift.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">First, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, if the pulse width setup voltage Vw is input to the data signal line <b>410</b> and an enable signal (reset signal RES(n)) for turning on the transistor <b>142</b>′ is input to the transistor <b>142</b>′, the voltage of the gate terminal of the transistor <b>141</b>′ (hereinafter referred to as “A point”) is set to a predetermined threshold voltage Vth while the reset signal is input.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">Specifically, as Vw is input, the A-point voltage is dropped from 0 to Vw (in this case, the transistor <b>144</b>′ is turned on in accordance with the control signal CIE, and is maintained in an on state until the input of Vw is completed). In this case, since Vw is lower than Vth, the transistor <b>141</b>′ is in an on state. On the other hand, if a reset signal is input while Vw is applied to A point, the transistor <b>142</b>′ is turned on, and current flows at A point through the transistor <b>142</b>′ to increase the voltage of A point. If the A-point voltage rises up to Vth, the transistor <b>141</b>′ is turned off, and thus the A-point voltage rises from Vw to Vth only. In this case, as the A-point voltage approaches Vth, the current flowing through the transistor <b>120</b>′ is reduced, and the A-point voltage rises slowly to Vth with the lapse of time. Accordingly, the A-point voltage is set to Vth before the input of the reset signal is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">On the other hand, although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates that Vw and the reset signal are simultaneously input, the A-point voltage starts to be dropped from the time when the reset signal is input, and thus it may help if the time when Vw is input somewhat precedes the time when the reset signal is input, but is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Further, although it is exemplified that the A-point voltage is 0 before Vw is input, but is not limited thereto. According to an example embodiment, a certain voltage may be applied to A point before Vw is input. In this case, as Vw is input, the A-point voltage further rises as much as Vw from the certain voltage, and even in this case, the A-point voltage is dropped to Vth before the input of the reset signal is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, even after the A-point voltage is set to Vth through completion of the input of the reset signal, the input of Vw is maintained for a predetermined time.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">On the other hand, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the input of the reset signal is completed, and after the predetermined time, Vw becomes 0 to complete the input of Vw.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">As described above, if the A-point voltage becomes Vth-Vw, the pulse width setup is completed, and thereafter, the A-point voltage Vth-Vw is maintained until the linearly changed voltage is applied together with the drive voltage VDD.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">The voltage as much as Vw-Vth is maintained at both ends of the capacitor <b>143</b>′, and if the linearly changed voltage Vsweep is applied to one end of the capacitor <b>143</b>′, the voltage of the other end of the capacitor <b>143</b>′, that is, A point, is changed with the same slope as the linearly changed slope of Vsweep from the starting point of Vth-Vw. Since the transistor <b>141</b>′ is in an off state until the A-point voltage reaches Vth according to the change, the voltage Va charged in the capacitor <b>111</b>′ is continuously applied to the B point to maintain the drive current Id.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">However, if the A-point voltage is changed to reach Vth in accordance with the linearly changed voltage Vsweep, the transistor <b>141</b>′ is turned on, and in this case, since the source terminal of the transistor <b>141</b>′ is connected to a drive voltage VDD terminal <b>121</b>, the drain terminal voltage of the transistor <b>141</b>′ and the B-point voltage also become the drive voltage VDD if the transistor <b>141</b>′ is turned on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">As described above, the B point is the gate terminal of the driving transistor <b>125</b>-<b>2</b> included in the current source <b>120</b>, and the source terminal of the driving transistor <b>125</b>-<b>2</b> is connected to the drive voltage terminal <b>121</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the drive current Id starts to flow with the amplitude corresponding to the amplitude setup voltage Va from the time when the drive voltage VDD is applied to the current source <b>120</b>, and if the A-point voltage is linearly decreased from Vth-Vw to reach Vth in accordance with a linearly decreased voltage Vsweep applied to the pulse width control circuit <b>140</b> simultaneously with applying of the drive voltage VDD, the output end voltage of the inverter <b>141</b>′ (or the drain terminal voltage of the transistor <b>141</b>′ or the gate terminal voltage of the driving transistor <b>125</b>-<b>2</b>) becomes the drive voltage VDD to stop the flow of the drive current Id.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">Through this, it can be expected that the time when the drive current Id is maintained (in other words, the duty ratio of the drive current Id or the pulse width of the drive current Id) is to be changed in accordance with the pulse width setup voltage Vw.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Specifically, according to an example embodiment, the variation rate (or slope) of the linearly changed voltage Vsweep is constant regardless of the level of the pulse width setup voltage Vw, and if an absolute value of Vw becomes smaller than that of the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the A-point voltage rises less than Vth-Vw as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> as the input of Vw is completed. Accordingly, if the linearly decreased voltage Vsweep is applied thereafter, the A-point voltage reaches Vth earlier than that in the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.

Further, in an example embodiment, if the display panel <b>500</b> is configured through application of the compensation circuit <b>1000</b> to the pixel circuit <b>100</b>, the display device <b>2000</b> may set the amplitude and the pulse width of the drive current Id using the amplitude setup voltage Va and the pulse width setup voltage Vw corrected through the compensation circuit <b>1000</b>, and thus the deviation in threshold voltage Vth and mobility μ between the TFT transistors can be reduced to heighten the luminance uniformity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0242">On the other hand, if both the amplitude and the pulse width of the drive current Id are set as described above, the display device <b>2000</b> applies the drive voltage VDD and the linearly changed voltage Vsweep to the respective pixel circuits <b>100</b> to display the image frame (S<b>1220</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">Specifically, if the drive voltage VDD is applied to the current source <b>120</b> of each pixel circuit <b>1000</b>, the light emitting element <b>130</b> of the pixel circuit <b>100</b> starts to emit light in accordance with the drive current Id having the set amplitude, and if the gate terminal voltage of the driving transistor <b>125</b> becomes the ground voltage (if the driving transistor <b>125</b>-<b>1</b> is an NMOSFET) or the drive voltage VDD (if the driving transistor <b>125</b>-<b>2</b> is a PMOSFET) in accordance with the linearly changed voltage, the driving transistor <b>125</b> stops to emit light, and thus an image with various grayscales can be displayed. Since other detailed contents are the same as those as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref>, duplicate explanation thereof will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is conceptual diagrams for comparing a pixel circuit according to an example embodiment with a pixel circuit in the related art. (a) and (b) of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> represent the related art, and (c) of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> represents a pixel circuit according to an example embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">(a) of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a scheme for directly controlling the light emitting element through the output end of the inverter. In this case, since the driving transistor of the light emitting element operates in a linear operating region, the deviation of the drive current due to the deviation of the forward voltage Vf between the light emitting elements becomes large, and thus the luminance uniformity becomes lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">On the other hand, (b) of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a scheme for controlling the switch located between the current source and the light emitting element through the output end of the inverter. In this case, since the inverter is implemented by a CMOSFET and oxide is unable to be used as the channel material of the TFT, the manufacturing process is limited, and unnecessary reactive power consumption occurs in the series switch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">In contrast, as illustrated in (c) of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in an example embodiment, if a scheme for directly controlling the current source <b>120</b> through the output end of the inverter is taken, it is possible to configure the TFT using any one kind of MOSFET, such as an NMOSFET or a PMOSFET, and thus the production cost can be saved and the yield can be improved as compared with the related art requiring the CMOSFET (of course, the pixel circuit according to the present disclosure can be implemented by the CMOSFET (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">Further, since a separate switch is not necessary between the current source <b>120</b> and the light emitting element <b>130</b>, unnecessary reactive power consumption can be prevented from occurring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">Further, since the amplitude setting circuit (PAM circuit) is used together with the pulse width control circuit (PWM circuit) as hybrid, it is possible to set the operating point through the amplitude setting circuit and to control the driving transistor to operate in the saturation region, and thus the luminance deviation can be reduced even if there is a deviation in forward voltage Vf between the light emitting elements <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">On the other hand, in various example embodiments as described above, the operation of the processor <b>300</b> of the display device <b>2000</b> or the method for driving the display device <b>2000</b> may be created by software and installed in the display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">For example, a non-transitory computer readable medium may be provided to store therein a program for performing a method for driving a display device including setting the pulse width and the amplitude of the drive current Id for driving the respective light emitting elements <b>130</b> of the plurality of pixel circuits <b>100</b> included in the display panel <b>500</b> and displaying an image by applying the drive voltage VDD and the linearly changed voltage Vsweep to the respective pixel circuits <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">Here, the non-transitory computer readable medium is not a medium that stores data for a short period, such as a register, a cache, or a memory, but means a medium which semi-permanently stores data and is readable by a device.
