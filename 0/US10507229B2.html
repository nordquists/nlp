<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">Description of the Relevant Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Cyclosporins are a group of nonpolar cyclic oligopeptides with known immunosuppressant activity. In addition, as set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,839,342, cyclosporin (sometimes referred to in the literature as “cyclosporine”) has been found as effective in treating immune medicated keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS or dry eye disease) in a patient suffering therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">As hereinabove noted, cyclosporin comprises a group of cyclic oligopeptides and the major component thereof is cyclosporin A (C<sub>62</sub>H<sub>111</sub>N<sub>11</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) which has been identified along with several other minor metabolites, cyclosporin B through I. In addition, a number of synthetic analogs have been prepared.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In general, commercially available cyclosporins may contain a mixture of several individual cyclosporins which all share a cyclic peptide structure consisting of eleven amino acid residues with a total molecular weight of about 1,200, but with different substituents or configurations of some of the amino acids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The activity of cyclosporins, as hereinabove noted, is as an immunosuppressant and in the enhancement or restoring of lacrimal gland tearing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Unfortunately, the solubility of cyclosporin in water is extremely low and as elaborated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,402, it has been considered not merely difficult but practically impossible to prepare a pharmaceutical composition containing cyclosporin dissolved in an aqueous medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">As reported, the solubility of cyclosporin in water is between about 20 μg/ml to 30 μg/ml for cyclosporin A. Hence, heretofore prepared formulations incorporating cyclosporin have been prepared as oily solutions containing ethanol. However, these preparations limit the bioavailability to oral preparations and this is believed to be due to the separation of cyclosporin as a solid immediately after it comes into contact with water, such as in the mouth or eye of a patient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Surface active agents such as polyoxyethylated castor oil have been utilized as solubilizers to inject preparations in order to prevent cyclosporin from separating. However, this also may give rise to safety problems (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,402).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,979 discloses a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a nonirritating emulsion which includes at least one cyclosporin in admixture with a higher fatty acid glyceride and polysorbate 80. More particularly, the cyclosporin may be cyclosporin A and the higher fatty acid glyceride may be castor oil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 6,582,718 discloses an ophthalmic composition particularly in the form of eye-drops suitable for the treatment of diseases of the eye and surrounding areas. The composition contains a cyclosporin and a surfactant selected from polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers and polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, or mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">U.S. Patent Application No. 60/503,137, filed Sep. 15, 2003, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/865,638, filed Jun. 9, 2004 also disclose compositions of interest.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="1184">A liquid which is ophthalmically acceptable is formulated such that it can be administered topically to the eye. The comfort should be maximized as much as possible, although sometimes formulation considerations (e.g. drug stability) may necessitate less than optimal comfort. In the case that comfort cannot be maximized, the liquid should be formulated such that the liquid is tolerable to the patient for topical ophthalmic use. Additionally, an ophthalmically acceptable liquid should either be packaged for single use, or contain a preservative to prevent contamination over multiple uses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="1185">In accordance with the present invention, the emulsions can be further stabilized using a polyelectrolyte, or polyelectrolytes if more than one, from the family of cross-linked polyacrylates, such as carbomers and Pemulen®.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="1186">Pemulen® is a registered trademark of B. F. Goodrich for polymeric emulsifiers and commercially available from B. F. Goodrich Company, Specialty Polymers &amp; Chemicals Division, Cleveland, Ohio. Pemulens are Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Cross-Polymers. They are high molecular weight co-polymers of acrylic acid and a long chain alkyl methacrylate cross-linked with allyl ethers of pentaerythritol. They contain not less than 52.0 percent and not more than 62.0 percent of carboxylic acid groups. The viscosity of a neutralized 1.0 percent aqueous dispersion is between 9,500 and 26,500 centipoises.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="1187">In addition, the tonicity of the emulsions can be further adjusted using glycerine, mannitol, or sorbitol if desired. The pH of the emulsions can be adjusted in a conventional manner using sodium hydroxide to a near physiological pH level and while buffering agents are not required, suitable buffers may include phosphates, citrates, acetates and borates.</div>
