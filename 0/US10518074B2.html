<heading id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention provides articles of manufacture comprising biocompatible nanostructures comprising nanotubes and nanopores for, e.g., organ, tissue and/or cell growth, e.g., for bone, tooth, kidney or liver growth, and uses thereof, e.g., for in vitro testing of drugs, chemicals or toxins, or as in vivo implants, including their use in making and using artificial tissues and organs, and related diagnostic, screening, research and development and therapeutic uses.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known that the nano-scaled materials exhibit extraordinary electrical, optical, magnetic, chemical and biological properties, which cannot be achieved by micro-scaled or bulk counterparts. The development of nano-scaled materials has been intensively pursued in order to utilize such properties for various technical applications including biomedical and nano-bio applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Ti and Ti alloys are corrosion resistant, light, yet sufficiently strong for load-bearing, and are machinable. They are one of the few biocompatible metals which osseo-integrate (direct chemical or physical bonding with adjacent bone surface without forming a fibrous tissue interface layer). For these reasons, they have been used successfully as orthopaedic (orthopedic) and dental implants. See Handbook of biomaterial properties, ed. J. Black and G. Hasting, London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1998; Ratner et al., Biomaterials Science, San Diego, Calif., Academic press, 1996.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The bioactivity of Ti, such as the relatively easy formation of hydroxyapatite type bone mineral on Ti is primarily caused by the occurrence of Ti oxide on the surface of Ti and its alloys. Among the various crystal structures of Ti oxide, the anatase phase is known to be better than the rutile and other phases. See, e.g., Uchida (2003) J. Biomedical Materials Res. 64:164-170. Surface treatments such as roughening by sand blasting, formation of anatase phase TiO.sub.2, hydroxyapatite coating, or other chemical treatment have been utilized to further improve the bioactivity of Ti surface and enhance bone growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">While the fabrication of vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes on Ti substrate was demonstrated by anodization process, an investigation of such titanium oxide nanotubes for bone growth or other bio application has not been attempted. An investigation of such titanium oxide nanotubes for bone growth type bio application has only recently been reported, showing a significantly enhanced bone growth on TiO.sub.2 nanotube array structure. See, e.g., Oh (2005) “Growth of Nano-scale Hydroxyapatite Using Chemically Treated Titanium Oxide Nanotubes”, Biomaterials 26:4938-4943. Patients who go through Ti implant operations for repair of hip joints, broken bones, or dental implants often have to wait for many months of slow bone growth recovery before they are cured enough to get off the confinement on a bed or crutches and have a normal life. Accelerated bone growth would thus be very beneficial for such patients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The structure of the anodized TiO.sub.2 nanotube array, such as the diameter, spacing and height of nanotubes, is not always easy to control during the electrochemical anodization process of pore formation. For example, the largest reported diameter of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes is less than approximately (about) 100 to 150 nm. While a portion of filopodia, the thin branches of growing cells, can get into such a small pores and enhance cell adhesion-growth, the approximately 100 nm regime of dimension is too small to accommodate the main part of typical osteoblast and many other cells as these have a much larger dimension of micrometers. In addition, the desired insertion of biological agents such as biomolecular growth factors, cytokines, collagens, antibiotics, antibodies, drug molecules, small molecules, inorganic nanoparticles, etc. within the pores for further accelerated cell/bone growth or for medical therapeutics can be facilitated if the inner diameter of the pores are made somewhat larger. Therefore, an ability to artificially design and construct a biocompatible nanostructure, e.g., with a specific desired nanotube diameter, nanopore dimension and spacing, is desirable for further controlled and accelerated growth of bones and cells. For orthopaedic and dental applications, a dual structure of larger dimension pores, which in one aspect can be of re-entrant shape, in combination of nanostructured surface would be desirable to have both accelerated cell/bone growth and physically locked-in bone configuration in the re-entrant large pores for improved mechanical durability on tensile or shear strain. Furthermore, if such a biocompatible nanostructure can be made to easily accommodate biological agent storage in the nano/micro pores to enhance multifunctional roles to additionally accelerate bone and cell growth, its practical usefulness can be much enhanced for various biomedical applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Coating of bioactive materials such as hydroxyapatite and calcium phosphate on Ti surface is a commonly used technique to make the Ti surface more bioactive for bone growth purposes. See, e.g., Shirkhanzadeh (1991) J. Materials Science Letters volume 10; de Groot (1987) J. Biomedical Materials Res. 21:1375-1381; Cotell (1992) J. of Applied Biomaterials 8:87-92. However, the fatal drawback of these currently available coating techniques is that such a flat and continuous coatings tend to fail by fracture or de-lamination at the interface between the implant and the coating as an adhesion failure, or at the interface between the coating and the bone, or at both boundary interfaces. Thick film coatings tends to introduce more interface stresses at the substrate-coating interface, especially in view of the lack of strong chemical bonding or the absence of common elements shared by the substrate (e.g., Ti implant) and the coating material. See, e.g., Yang (1997) J. Biomedical Materials Res. 36:39-48. It would thus be desirable if the interface is bonded with an improved and integrated structure, for example, with a locked-in configuration with a much increased adhesion area, and as a discrete, less continuous layer to minimize interface stress and de-lamination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">An additional, worthy consideration of bone growth/repair implants is the ability of the implants to withstand a tensile or shear stress, which tends to break off the interface bonding between the implant and the bone that is allowed to grow on the implant surface. It would thus be desirable if the surface geometry of the implant is improved so that not only nanoscale interfacial adhesions occur, but microscale and macroscale lock-in structure is provided to guard against slippage of the implant on tensile stress or breakage of the bond on shear stress.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Accelerated cell growth is also desirable not only for bones but also for a variety of cells including liver cells, kidney cells, blood vessel cells, skin cells, periodontal cells, stem cells, and so forth. Liver in human body is the largest gland and a dynamic organ which serves several important functions, working closely with many fundamental biological systems and bio-processes in the body. The liver is like the main chemical factory and food storehouse in human body, as it helps the body digest food and help purify the blood of the poisons and wastes. The complex functions associated with the liver include; (a) The regulation of blood glucose level, lipids and amino acids, (b) The production and secretion of bile, red blood cells, blood proteins (such as albumin, globulin, fibrinogen), cholesterol, and glucose, (c) The purification of blood by removing toxins, wastes, unnecessary hormones, and hemoglobin molecules, (d) The storage of blood, vitamins and minerals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The parenchymal cells known as hepatocytes are the major cells populated in the liver. In additions, several other cells such as endothelial cells, adipocytes, fibroblastic cells and Kupffer cells are also included in the liver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">A significant portion of the human population (e.g., about one in ten people) has been afflicted with liver diseases such as hepatitis, liver cancer, and acute or chronic liver failure. Although liver transplantation is an optional treatment method, there is a very limited supply of donor organs, and the medical and associated costs for the transplant procedure and post-operation immunosuppressive drug therapy are considerable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Many research investigations related to liver cell culture in vitro have been conducted to figure out the problem often caused by long-term culture of liver cells. Cultured liver cells can be useful for hepatocytes transplantation, implantable constructs and bioreactor production. The primary cultures of rat hepatocytes have been extensively used to research the effects of potential toxins on enzyme leakage, metabolism, and cellular membranes. See, e.g., Grisham (1979) International Review of Experimental Pathology 20:123-210; Acosta (1981) Biochemical Pharmacology 30:3225-3230. However, there are a number of known drawbacks about long-term liver cell culture as some loss of liver function is frequently observed. So far, there has been no successful means of proliferating healthy liver parenchymal cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In vitro culture of adult hepatocytes does not show prolonged ability to produce albumin and display cytochrome P-450 enzyme activity. In suspension culture, the viability of hepatocytes and their cytochrome P-450 enzyme activity declines gradually as a function of incubation time. In addition, cell division usually is limited to the first 24-48 hr of culture after which the cell division is no longer significant. See, e.g., Sirica (1980) Pharmacology Review 31:205-228; Clayton (1983) Molecular and Cellular Biology 3:1552-1561; Chapman (1973) J. Cell Biology 59:735-747. In a two-dimensional culture system, the viability of adult hepatocytes adhered to the culture plate show somewhat longer activity periods than other culture systems, but the functionality of hepatocytes decreased rapidly. See, e.g., Deschenes (1980) In Vitro 16:722-730.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">To improve hepatocyte growth and prolong liver-specific functions in vitro, various kinds of matrices have been studied, such as type I and IV collagen substrates, homogenized liver biomatrix (see, e.g., Reid (1980) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 349:70-76), sandwich-shaped collagen substrate composed of two layers of type I collagen, and fibronectin coated plates. See, e.g., Michalopoulos (1975) Experimental Cell Res. 94:70-78, Bissell (1987) J. Clinical Investigation 79:801-812; Dunn (1989) FASEB J. 3:174-177; Deschenes (1980) In Vitro 16:722-730. Even though many of these experimental approaches have demonstrated an extended viability of hepatocyte and the stability of liver specific function under in vivo environment, they are still not satisfactory enough for practical applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">An alternative way, which allows liver cells to possess some long-term viability and liver-specific functionality, utilized co-culturing liver parenchymal cells with a diversity of structurally supportive, non-parenchymal stromal cells or non-hepatic stromal cells. See, e.g., Allen (2005) Toxicological Sciences 84:110-119; Bhatia (1998) Biotechnology Progress 14:378-387. Adult hepatocytes co-cultured with endothelial cells of the same species showed good maintenance of liver-specific functions for several weeks in vitro, even though they did not show significant expansion in cell population. See articles by Guguen-Guilluozo (1983) Experimental Cell Res. 143:47-54; Begue (1983) Biochemical Pharmacology 32:1643-1646. In addition, rat hepatocytes which were co-cultured with human fibroblasts and endothelial cells were reported to exhibit stable cytochrome P-450 activity for more than 10 days. See, e.g., Kuri-Harcuch and Mendoza-Figueroa (1989) Differentiation 41:148-157; Begue (1983) Biochemical Pharmacology 32:1643-1646. Therefore, mixed hepatocyte co-culture systems with non-liver derived cells may provide microbiological environments similar to those in vivo by optimizing cell-cell interactions. However, there are still problems about the nature of non-liver derived cells. The viability and functional activities of co-cultured hepatic primary cell can be prolonged in vitro, but primary cell proliferation is limited or absent in these system, which is a critical flaw. Even though several reports indicate that non-parenchymal liver cells may express functions similar to hepatocytes, the nature of non-liver derived cells co-cultured with liver primary cells has not been established unequivocally. See, e.g., Grisham (1980) Annals of the NY Acad. Sci. 349:128-137. It is therefore highly desirable to develop culture methods and culture devices that can allow artificial in vitro (or in vivo) growth of healthy, fully functional and long-lasting liver cells that can be transplanted to the patients in need of liver cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">There is also a critical need for an artificial liver device that can remove toxins and improve immediate and long-term survival of patients suffering from liver disease. An artificial liver device can be useful as a temporary artificial liver for patients awaiting a liver transplant, and also provide support for post-transplantation patients until the grafted liver functions adequately to sustain the patient. One of the major roadblocks to the development of an effective artificial liver device is the lack of a satisfactory liver cell line that can provide the functions of a liver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Yet another benefit of being able to culture healthy liver cells is to meet the demands for supply of the cells for toxicity testing of enormous numbers of new or experimental drugs, chemicals, and therapeutics being developed in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry. With the unique toxin-filtering capability of liver cells, any toxicity of a new drug can be manifested first by the reaction of the liver cells. An array of liver cells can thus be utilized as a fast testing/screening vehicle to basically simultaneously evaluate the potential toxicity of many new drugs and compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Two-dimensional and three-dimensionally cultured cells are useful not only for liver cell related applications, but for producing a number of other cells in a healthy and accelerated manner. There are needs to supply or implant various types of cells including bone cells, liver cells, kidney cells, blood vessel cells, skin cells, periodontal cells, stem cells, and other human or animal organ cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">A fast growth and supply of cells especially rare cells, such as stem cell enrichment, can be crucial for many potential therapeutic applications as well as for enhancing the speed of advances in stem cell science and technology. In addition, fast detection and diagnosis of disease cells or possible bio-terror cells (such as epidemic diseases, anthrax or SARS) from a very small or trace quantity of available cells can be accomplished if the cell growth speed can be accelerated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0003" num="0000">I. Multifunctional Biocompatible Implant and Accelerated Cell Growth Devices</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The invention provides compositions comprising multifunctional biocompatible implants and devices that accelerate cell growth comprising (or consisting of) biocompatible aligned nanotubule structures and methods for fabricating such devices, and methods for making and using them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">The invention provides compositions comprising vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotube arrays adherent on titanium surfaces, see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2 and 3</figref>. Such nanotube arrays are capable of inducing strong cell adhesion and inducing rapid proliferation of cells, such as those involved in bone formation. The configuration of nano-gaps between the aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes is such that nutrients can pass between the bottom as well as the top surface in order to feed the proliferating adherent cells. Adherent cells are generally healthy and fast growing, while the non-adherent cells often exhibit reduced or minimal growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Biocompatible implants consisting of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes are provided that have use in osteogenic and dental applications. Also provided are multifunctional TiO.sub.2 nanotubes devices capable of storing pharmaceutical compositions and biological agents. Examples include drugs, growth factors, hormones, proteins, enzymes, antibiotics, antibodies, DNA, nanoparticles, vitamins and minerals. The biocompatible TiO.sub.2 nanotubes as described herein, are useful in a variety of applications including accelerating bone growth for orthopedic and dental repair; in vivo and in vitro accelerated growth of cells including functional cells (such as liver cells, kidney cells, nerve cells, myocytes, stem cells) or supportive tissues (soft tissues such as muscles, tendons, fibrous tissues, periodontal tissues, fat, blood vessels, or hard tissues such as bone and teeth), proliferation and/or harvesting of cells to be supplied for therapeutics and laboratory experiments, particularly rare cell types such as stem cells or disease cells; therapeutic applications for local sustained drug release; and rapid diagnosis of cell-based conditions, toxicities and/or diseases involved in, for example, infections, epidemics and/or biological warfare agent or toxin exposures.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">EXAMPLES</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">Bone- and Cell-Growth Promoting Nanostructures</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">An example of an exemplary bone- and cell-growth promoting nanostructure of the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. These exemplary structures of the invention are vertically aligned, biocompatible TiO.sub.2 with a typical dimension of the hollow nanotubes as shown as being approximately (about) 100 nm outer diameter and approximately 70 nm inner diameter, with approximately 15 nm in wall thickness, and approximately 250 nm in height.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The exemplary TiO.sub.2 nanotube array structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> was fabricated by an exemplary anodization technique using a Ti sheet (0.25 mm thick, 99.5% purity) which is electrochemically processed in a 0.5% HF solution at 20 V for 30 min at room temperature. A platinum electrode (thickness: 0.1 mm, purity: 99.99%) was used as the cathode. To crystallize the deposited amorphous-structured TiO.sub.2 nanotubes into the desired anatase phase, the specimens were heat-treated at 500.degree. C. for 2 hrs. In one aspect, the amorphous TiO.sub.2 nanotubes are crystallized to anatase phase by heat treatment, because an amorphous TiO.sub.2 phase tends to be more susceptible to breakage by external stresses as compared to a crystalline phase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">For evaluation of bone growth on bioactive surface in terms of hydroxyapatite (HAp) formation, the TiO.sub.2 nanotube specimens of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> were soaked for 1, 2, 3 and 5 days, in 20 mL of a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution at 36.5.degree. C., which contained ion concentrations nearly equal to those of human blood plasma with respect to Na.sup.+, K.sup.+, Ca.sup.2+, Mg.sup.2+, Cl.sup.−, HCO.sub.3.sup.−, HPO.sub.4.sup.2−, and SO.sub.4.sup.2− concentrations. After a predetermined soaking time, the specimens were removed from the SBF solution, gently rinsed with distilled water, and then dried at 60.degree. C. for 24 hrs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Another important factor for healthy cell growth is a continuous supply of nutrients (e.g. proteins, mineral ions, fluid, etc.) to the cell through the flow of body fluid. The gap (i.e. spacing) between adjacent TiO.sub.2 nanotubules in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> serves such a function by allowing the body fluid to continuously pass through and thereby supply nutrients to the bottom side of the growing cells. The desired gap between the nanotubules is in the range of about 2-100 nm, or about 5-30 nm. Too small a gap reduces the effectiveness of nutrient body fluid flow while too large a gap can pose a danger of reduced mechanical stability in the event of vertical or lateral stress or pressure. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) photograph shown for an exemplary TiO.sub.2 nanotubule array structure, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, gives an average of approximately 15 nm spacing between the nanotubes. The SEM micrograph in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the accelerated growth of hydroxyapatite on the aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes which occurred, at least about 2-4 times faster than on flat Ti surface.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Example 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">Nanofiber-Like or Nanoribbon-Like Structures</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">On exposure of the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes to a 5 mole NaOH solution at approximately 60.degree. C. for 60 minutes, it has been found that an additional, extremely fine, and predominantly nanofiber-like or nanoribbon-like structure of sodium titanate compound is introduced on the very top of the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. In this example, preferential occurrence of nanofibers at the top of nanotubes is presumably because of the nanotube contact with NaOH solution above and also possibly due to the surface-tension-related difficulty of NaOH solution getting into nanopores within and in-between TiO.sub.2 nanotubes, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Compositional analysis by EDXA (energy dispersive x-ray analysis) in SEM confirms the presence of Na, Ti and O after the exposure of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes to NaOH. The sodium titanate so introduced exhibits an extremely fine-scale nanofiber configuration with a dimension of approximately 8 nm in average diameter and approximately 50-100 nm long.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">The growth of even finer scale structure from a given nanostructure as demonstrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be of significant interest for basic materials development for nanotechnology, since such a concept can be utilized as one of the novel and efficient ways of creating extremely fine nanostructures in many different materials. It is believed that the nanofiber-shaped sodium titanate phase is formed in such a fine scale because of the physically confined geometry of the host structure, TiO.sub.2 nanotubes. Since the nucleation and growth of the sodium titanate phase occurs on TiO.sub.2 which has the ring-shaped end material facing outward with the tube wall thickness of only approximately 15 nm, the sodium titanate phase growing from the host surface is likely to be on the order of or less than this dimension, as is actually observed. The process of forming a “Nano-inspired Nanostructure” can also be viewed as a hierarchical construction of nanostructure, which can be important for nanostructural engineering, for example, for creation of catalyst structures with ultra-large surface area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">The formation of bone-growth related material such as the calcium phosphate mineral, hydroxyapatite (Ca.sub.10(PO.sub.4).sub.6(OH).sub.2), is an important issue for orthopedic and dental implants. Bone is a calcium phosphate based mineral which contains approximately 70% hydroxyapatite-like material with the remainder consisting mostly of collagen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The “Nano-inspired Nanostructure” formation as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> has been found to have a profound effect on hydroxyapatite formation. When the TiO.sub.2 nanotube surface covered with “Nano-inspired Nanostructure” of sodium titanate is subjected to the SBF (simulated body fluid) solution for formation of hydroxyapatite, it is seen that it takes less than one day soaking in SBF to have a complete coverage of the sample surface with hydroxyapatite. The formation of hydroxyapatite in the TiO.sub.2 nanotube surface containing sodium titanate nanofibers is significantly accelerated as compared with the same TiO.sub.2 nanotube surface but without the sodium titanate nanofibers. In the latter case, it took approximately 7 days for formation of detectable amount of hydroxyapatite, as compared with just one day for the sample covered with sodium titanate nanofibers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">As is evident from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the hydroxyapatite formed is by itself nanostructured with a nanofiber morphology resembling that of the sodium titanate. The nanofiber feature size of the hydroxyapatite phase formed is approximately 25 nm average diameter. It appears that the nanofiber hydroxyapatite nucleated and grew from the nanofiber sodium titanate precursor. The approximately 25 nm average diameter of the nanofiber hydroxyapatite is somewhat coarser than its precursor sodium titanate (approximately 8 nm) as might be anticipated for the extended (1 day) exposure to SBF. The nanofiber hydroxyapatite of such a dimension is, to the best of our knowledge, the smallest feature hydroxyapatite reported so far.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">Osteoblast Cell Growth on Nanotubes of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">In order to estimate the effect of having an extremely fine nanostructure such as the vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes on cell growth behavior, an osteoblast cell growth on TiO.sub.2 nanotubes was performed. The results demonstrate (indicate) that the introduction of nanostructure significantly improves bioactivity of implant and enhances osteoblast adhesion and growth. An adhesion of anchorage-dependent cells such as osteoblasts is a necessary prerequisite to subsequent cell functions such as synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, and formation of mineral deposits. In general, many types of cells beside the osteoblast cells remain healthy and grow fast if they are well-adhered onto a substrate surface, particularly a nanostructure surface of this invention, while the cells not adhering to the surface tend to stop growing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">All the experimental specimens (0.5.times.0.5 cm.sup.2) used for cell adhesion assays were sterilized by autoclaving. A pure Ti sheet polished by emery paper (#600 grit size) and chemically cleaned was used as a control group sample. For cell adhesion studies, MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells (rat cells of the type CRL-2593, sub-clone 4. ATCC, Rockville, Md.) were used. Each 1 mL of cells was mixed with 10 ml of alpha minimum essential medium (.alpha.-MEM) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cell suspension was plated in a cell culture dish and incubated under 37.degree. C., 5% CO.sub.2 environment. When the concentration of the MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells reached approximately 3.times.10.sup.5 cells/ml, they were seeded onto the experimental substrate of interest (Ti O.sub.2 or Ti) which were then placed on a 12-well polystyrene plate, and stored in a CO.sub.2 incubator for 2, 12, 24 or 48 hrs to observe cell morphology and count viable attached cells as a function of incubation time. The concentration of the cells seeded onto the specimen substrate was approximately 5.times.10.sup.4 cells/ml.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">After the selected incubation period, the samples were washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and distilled water, respectively, and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS for 1 hr. After fixing, they were rinsed three times with 0.1 M PBS for 10 min. For microscopic examination of cell structures and morphologies, the samples were dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol (50%, 75%, 90% and 100%) for 10 min and subsequently dried by supercritical point CO.sub.2. The dehydrated samples were sputter-coated with approximately 2 nm thick gold for SEM examination. The morphology of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes as well as that of the adhered cells was observed using SEM and TEM. In the quantitative assay, the adhered cells on sample surface were counted from back-scattered SEM images.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A-B</figref> are comparative SEM micrographs of the MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on pure Ti vs TiO.sub.2 nanotubes. After approximately 2 hours of incubation, the osteoblast cells cultured on Ti surface, still remained in their original round shape, whereas the cells cultured on TiO.sub.2 nanotubes attached onto the surface and started to spread by filopodia. It is well known that pure Ti has a few nm thick, native TiO.sub.2 passivation layer which eventually causes the adhesion of osteoblastic cells, albeit at a much slower speed than the nanotube surface investigated in this work. It took approximately 12 hrs for a noticeable adhesion and propagation of the osteoblast cells to take place on Ti as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. The growths of cells and propagation of filopodia are compared for the Ti sample (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) versus the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) after 12 hrs and 2 hrs of incubation, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">As discussed earlier, micrometer-sized bioactive materials (such as a hydroxyapatite layer coated on Ti implant surface) tend to exhibit interfacial failures, due to the much higher interfacial stress build-up between the dissimilar materials and also due too the lack of strong chemical bonding or the absence of sharing of common element species between the implant and the coating. The vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotube coating as described herein has the following structural advantages for reduced interfacial failure. [0081]i. The exemplary vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotube coating is fabricated to be thin, e.g., less than about 800 nm, or less than about 400 nm. [0082] ii. The coating has a strong chemical bonding on the Ti substrate as the TiO.sub.2 nanotube coating was prepared via chemical process, and since a common element of Ti is shared by the substrate and the coating. [0083] iii. The TiO.sub.2 nanotube structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> is made to be not continuous but is discrete, with a gap between adjacent nanotubes of approximately 15 nm. The desired lateral gap dimension is in the range of about 2-100 nm, or about 5-30 nm. Such a lateral sub-division of a nanotube array structure is important for minimizing the interfacial stresses between two dissimilar materials joined together, with the two materials involved often having substantially different crystal structure, lattice parameter, and coefficient of thermal expansion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">It has experimentally been confirmed that the vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes are strongly adherent to the Ti metal base, as it was very difficult to remove the nanotubes from the Ti surface by attempting to delaminate or scrape off or by bending of the Ti substrate. Such a strongly bonded and stable bone-promoting coating is important, especially in consideration of possible interference by fibroblast cells during bone growth near the Ti implants. It is well known that fibroblast cells are prone to attach on smooth surface layer in contrast to the osteoblastic cells which can attach well on rough surface. (see e.g. Salata, Jour. of Nanobiotechnology (2): 3 (2004)). Once an opportunity and time is given for the fibrous tissues to form at the boundary interface between the implant and the growing bone, these tissues keep osteoblasts from adhering onto the surface of Ti implant, causing the undesirable loosening of the Ti implant. A rapid and strong adhesion of osteoblasts on implant surface is therefore an essential factor for successful bone growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">In addition to the advantages in mechanical properties, the gaps present between adjacent TiO.sub.2 nanotubes may also be useful as a pathway for continuous supply of the body fluid with ions, nutrients, proteins, etc. This is likely to contribute positively to the health of the growing cells. In the absence of such pathways, the proliferating cells will eventually completely cover the bioactive implant material surface, and the bottom surface of the growing osteoblast cells would then have very limited access to body fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A-B</figref> are SEM micrographs showing the growth and adhesion of the osteoblast cells (after 2 hrs) on vertically nanoporous TiO.sub.2 nanotubes. The micrographs clearly indicate that the filopodia of propagating osteoblast cells actually go into the vertical nanopores of the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes. The observed rapid adherence and spread of osteoblastic cells cultured on TiO.sub.2 nanotubes could be caused by three reasons. First, vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes exhibit enormously larger surface areas than the flat Ti surface. Second, the pronounced vertical topology contributes to the locked-in cell configuration. Thirdly, the pathway in-between TiO.sub.2 nanotube arrays can allow the passage of body fluid and act as the supply/storage route of nutrient, which is an essential biological element for cell growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A-C</figref> represents the comparative back-scattered SEM micrographs of the cells cultured on <b>8</b>A pure Ti, <b>8</b>B amorphous TiO.sub.2 nanotubes, and <b>8</b>C anatase TiO.sub.2 nanotubes after 48 hrs of incubation. It is evident that adhesion and growth of the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells is significantly accelerated on TiO.sub.2 nanotubes, and more so on anatase TiO.sub.2 nanotubes, as compared to the amorphous TiO.sub.2 nanotubes. The plot of the number of adhered cells as a function of culture period, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, clearly confirms this trend, with the speed of cell adhesion and growth on anatase TiO.sub.2 nanotubes being significantly higher after 48 hr culture, by as much as approximately 400% as compared to the Ti surface. It is noted that at the early stage, (e.g., after 2 hrs. incubation) there was no significant statistical difference in the data among the three surfaces investigated. However, the number of attached cells on the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes dramatically increases as the culture time is extended to 12, 24 and 48 hrs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">The accelerated cell growth on vertical TiO.sub.2 nanotube array is not restricted to the osteoblast cells. A similar behavior is seen with other cells, for example, it has been found that stem cell growth is substantially accelerated on identical TiO.sub.2 nanotube array. This is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A-B</figref> as comparative back scattered electron SEM images. The cells used were bone marrow-derived, adult rat mesenchymal stem cells grown on plain flat Ti for 12 hr incubation, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, and on anatase TiO.sub.2 nanotubes for identical incubation period. As is evident from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the stem cells adhere and grow much faster on the vertically aligned and laterally separated TiO.sub.2 nanotubes than on the plain flat Ti.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">In stem cell research and applications for curing of diseases, the enrichment of stem cells is a very critical issue. The stem cells are often rare and the available quantity is not always sufficient for many research and therapeutic uses. The discovery that the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes can significantly accelerate the kinetics of stem cell proliferation is therefore important from a practical point of view. This exemplary vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotube array can also be utilized for such accelerated proliferation of many other types of cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The vertically aligned and laterally separated TiO.sub.2 nanotube arrays as described herein have many useful applications some of which are listed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">1. Orthopedic and Dental Implants with Accelerated Bone Formation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">The invention provides orthopaedic (orthopedic) and dental implants capable of accelerated bone formation. In one aspect, fast recovery of Ti implant patients is an important benefit of using a TiO.sub.2 nanotube array of the invention. Ti or Ti alloy implants (for example, hip implants, knee implants, elbow implants, Ti rods for broken legs or arms, etc., of the invention) with the surface modified to have a layer of the exemplary adherent TiO.sub.2 nanotube array can be placed in human or animal body as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A-11C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">2. Multi-Functional Implants</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">The invention provides multi-functional implants comprising vertical pores of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes. The vertical pores of the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes of the invention can be utilized as a reservoir of various biologically active agents such as therapeutic drugs, growth factors, proteins, enzymes, hormones, DNA, genes, antibiotics, antibodies, magnetic nanoparticles, and so forth. The nanosize pores of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes of the invention, as compared to microsized pores, have an advantage of being able to keep the stored biological agents much longer and allow slower release over a longer period of time. Multifunctional orthopedic or dental Ti implants of the invention can also continuously supply biological agents like a growth factor or bone morphogenic protein (BMP) that can be slowly released from the TiO.sub.2 nanotube surface layer can be much more efficient than a simple implant material. In one aspect, slow release of antibiotics (such as penicillin, streptomycin, vancomycin) can prevent infections near the implant. Since both Ti and TiO.sub.2 are biocompatible, the implant (not necessarily bone-related implants, but including other implants of the invention) can be pre-filled with one or more types of drugs can be used as a source of slow drug release within a human body, for example for treatment of cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">3. Externally Controllable Drug Release Devices of the cells is relatively small. Each of the detection elements in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, which contains a multiplicity of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes on which various types of cells to be analyzed, are placed and allowed to rapidly proliferate to a sufficient number for easy detection.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">A number of embodiments of the invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the materials involved do not have to be Ti oxide nanotubes on Ti-based metals, as the nanotubes and the substrate that the nanotubes are adhered to can be other biocompatible materials or non-biocompatible materials coated with biocompatible and bioactive surface layer such as Ti, or coated with biocompatible but bio-inert surface layer such as novel metal or polymer layer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">The invention provides enhanced culturing of two-dimensionally and three-dimensionally configured cells/organs/bones using template devices comprising artificially engineered nanotube and nanopore structure covered with biocompatible material such as TiO.sub.2. This exemplary structure induces a strong cell adhesion and significantly enhances the formation kinetics of cells. In these exemplary designed, fabricated and aligned nanotubes of the invention, the practical limit of anodization-based processing (which produce a rather limited TiO.sub.2 nanotube diameter, about 100 nm regime) can be overcome. In these exemplary designed nanotubes of the invention, a desired diameter can be greater than about 100 nm, and in one aspect the cell growth can be accelerated and optimized. In one aspect, the three-dimensionally placed nano-gaps between the nanotubes can allow a continuous supply of various nutrients to the growing cells. The nanotube and nanopore structure of the invention can be either retractable from the cultured cells or can be permanently kept in the grown cells. One exemplary cell and tissue culture device of the invention comprises stored biological agents within the nanotube reservoirs, can improve growth of configured and healthy cells, including for example, liver cells, bone cells, kidney cells, nerve cells, blood vessel cells, skin cells, periodontal cells, stem cells. Such cultured cells can be useful for rapid supply of needed cells for R&amp;D or therapeutics, for preparation of partial or full implant organs, for externally controllable drug release and therapeutic treatments, for efficient toxicity testing of drugs and chemicals, and for diagnosis/detection of disease or forensic cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">In one aspect, nanotubes of the invention are fabricated in such a way that they have a controlled, pre-determined diameter, and/or an inter-nanotube gap spacing, and/or a predetermined height (as compared with the typical anodized TiO.sub.2). In one aspect, the surface of the nanotube array, or in one aspect—at least the top surface, or all the surfaces, are coated with a biocompatible layer, such as Ti or TiO.sub.2, or other biocompatible metallic, ceramic, polymer, or biomolecule coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">In one aspect, the nanotube alignment comprises a vertical alignment with a open top pore, which in some applications may be crucial for bio implant and related applications, as disclosed herein. In one aspect, the open top of the nanotubes allows the penetration of the cells into the nanopore cavity for good adhesion. In one aspect, the open top of the nanotubes also allows easy supply of the biological agents stored in the nanopores. In one aspect, the cells that adhere well to a surface generally stay healthy and grow fast, while the cells that do not adhere exhibit reduced or minimal growth. In one aspect, the desired angle of vertical alignment is within than about 10, 20 or 30 degrees off the perpendicular axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">In one aspect, the nanoscale Ti oxide structures of the invention comprise Ti and Ti alloys that are corrosion resistant, light, yet sufficiently strong for load-bearing, and are machinable. They are one of the few biocompatible metals which osseo-integrate (direct chemical or physical bonding with adjacent bone surface without forming a fibrous tissue interface layer); thus, the nanoscale Ti oxide structures of the invention can directly bond, by e.g., chemical and/or physical bonding, with adjacent bone surface without forming a fibrous tissue interface layer. Thus, the nanoscale Ti oxide structures of the invention can be used as orthopaedic (orthopedic) and dental implants, e.g., with the devices described in the Handbook of Biomaterial Properties, edited by J. Black and G. Hasting, London; Chapman &amp; Hall, 1998; or, Ratner et al., Biomaterials Science, San Diego, Calif.: Academic press; 1996.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">While the invention is not limited by any particular mechanism of action, the bioactivity of Ti, such as the relatively easy formation of hydroxyapatite type bone mineral on Ti, is primarily caused by the occurrence of Ti oxide on the surface of Ti and its alloys. Various crystal structures of Ti oxide can be used in making the compositions of the invention, e.g., the anatase phase, which is known to be better than the rutile and other phases (however, the rutile and other phases can also be used), as described, e.g., by Uchida et al. Journal of Biomedical Materials Research (2003) 64:164-170.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">Surface treatments such as roughening by sand blasting, formation of anatase phase TiO.sub.2, hydroxyapatite coating, or other chemical treatment can also be utilized to further improve the bioactivity of Ti surfaces of the invention, and, in various aspects, to enhance cell, tissue and/or bone growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">TiO.sub.2 phase can be prepared by various techniques such as sol-gel method, electrophoretic deposition and anodization. See, e.g., Lakshmi, et al., Chemistry of Materials, Vol. 9, page 2544-2550 (1997), Miao, et al., Nano Letters, Vol. 2, No. 7, page 717-720 (2002); Gong, et al., Journal of Materials Research, Vol 16, No 12, page 3331-3334 (2001). In one aspect, a TiO.sub.2 phase can be prepared by various techniques such as sol-gel method (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,014,961); photolithographic patterning of a photoresist layer by pattern-wise exposure to short-wavelength ultraviolet light through a pattern-bearing photomass, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,593,034; electrophoretic deposition and anodization. See, e.g., Lakshmi, et al. (1997) Chemistry of Materials, 9:2544-2550; Miao, et al. (2002) Nano Letters 2:717-720; Gong, et al. (2001) J. Materials Res. 16:3331-3334; Macak (2005) Chem. Int. Ed., 44:7463-7465.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">In one aspect, fabrication of vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes on Ti substrate can be done by anodization process, and the invention includes use of titanium oxide nanotubes for cell, tissue and/or bone growth or other bio application. Patients who go through Ti implant operations for repair of hip joints, broken bones, or dental implants often have to wait for many months of slow bone growth recovery before they are cured enough to get off the confinement on a bed or crutches and have a normal life. Accelerated bone growth would thus be very beneficial for such patients. Therefore, the biocompatible nanostructures in desirable configuration for enhanced bone growth and other cell growth is useful for a variety of bio applications. Furthermore, biocompatible nanostructures of the invention can be made to serve multifunctional roles to additionally accelerate tissue and/or cell growth (e.g., bone). In one aspect, they are used in orthopaedic and/or dental applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">In one aspect, coating of bioactive materials such as hydroxyapatite and calcium phosphate on Ti surface is used to make the Ti surface more bioactive. See, e.g., Shirkhanzadeh et al, Journal of Materials Science Letters, Vol. 10, page (1991), de Groot et al., Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, Vol. 21, page 1375-1381 (1987), and Cotell et al., Journal of Applied Biomaterials, Vol. 8, page 87-92 (1992). The coating techniques of the invention, and the resultant structures of the invention, in contrast to flat and continuous coatings, fail less by fracture or delamination at the interface between the implant and the coating as an adhesion failure, or at the interface between the coating and the bone, or at both boundary interfaces. The coating techniques of the invention, and the resultant structures of the invention, in contrast to thick film coatings, introduce fewer interface stresses at the substrate-coating interface; see, e.g., Yang, et al., Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, Vol. 36, page 39-48 (1997). In one aspect, the interface is bonded with an improved and integrated structure, for example, with a locked-in configuration having a much increased adhesion area, and as a discrete, less continuous layer to minimize interface stress and de-lamination. In one aspect, accelerated hydroxyapatite and bone growth is accomplished on a mechanically adherent TiO.sub.2 nanotube surface of the invention on a Ti substrate; see, e.g., Oh (2005) Biomaterials 26:4938-4943.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">The invention provides compositions and methods for the fast growth and supply of cells and tissues, such as liver cells, kidney cells, blood vessel cells, and stem cells; and this can be crucial for many potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Liver cells can be cultured for partial or fall liver implantation or for hepatic support of patients prior to liver transplant operation, as described, e.g., in US Patent Application Pub. No. US 2002/0072116 A1 by Bhatia et al.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">The invention provides compositions and methods for the fast detection and diagnosis of diseased or abnormal cells, or cells exposed to or modified by a biological warfare agent, for example, compositions and methods of the invention can be used in fast detection and diagnosis biological or chemical warfare agents (e.g., gases, such as Sarin, mustard gas, etc., toxins), epidemic diseases, anthrax, influenza (e.g., the so-called “bird flu), or SARS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">In one aspect, the compositions and methods use a very small or trace quantity of available cells; this can be accomplished if the cell growth speed can be accelerated. In one aspect, an accelerated bone and cell growth using vertically aligned and laterally separated TiO.sub.2 nanotube arrays are used, with the emphasis on two-dimensional cell growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Because desired cell growths for implant and other applications may require three-dimensionally configured cells, the invention provides methods and devices for producing such three-dimensionally cultured cells. In one aspect, the invention provides methods and devices for fast growth and supply of functional cells, such as liver or kidney cells, without a deterioration of their function(s), which can be critical for many organ (e.g., kidney or liver) therapeutic applications. In one aspect, the invention provides a bio-artificial liver or bio-artificial kidney support device. In one aspect, nanotubule structures of the invention are useful as substrates for efficient organ cell (e.g., kidney or liver cell) culture devices if the cells (e.g., liver cells) can be grown quickly in vitro without a major loss of their capability for complex functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">In one aspect, the invention provides structures that are self-assembled in a simple anodization process, which in one aspect provides a viable, three dimensionally configured surface for enhanced cell growth and/or culture in vitro, in situ, ex vivo and in vivo. In controlling the specifics of nanotube diameter, spacing and height (the invention provides compositions having alternative nanotube diameters, spacing and heights), the compositions of the invention also can be used in various processing steps, different organ systems, varying combination of cells, and the like, as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">This invention provides 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cell culture devices comprising artificially patterned and shaped nanotube array(s) with a biocompatible coating, such as Ti or TiO.sub.2. These structures of the invention enable accelerated growth of functional organ cells such as liver or kidney cells as well as other structural cells such as blood vessel cells, enzyme secretion vessels, periodontal, bone, teeth, or other hard tissue cells growth. The availability of such cultured cells can be useful for a variety of applications including i) organ-related therapeutic medical treatment including liver or kidney disease treatment, ii) orthopaedic, dental or periodontal processes, iii) supply of cells for various research or therapeutic purposes, and iv) disease diagnostic or toxicity testing of new drugs or chemicals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">Referring to the drawings, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> schematically illustrates exemplary devices comprising exemplary artificially configured nanotube array. The nanotubes are fabricated in such a way that they have controlled, pre-determined diameter, inter-nanotube gap spacing, and height. The surface of the nanotube array, at least the top surface, or in one aspect on several or all the surfaces, are coated with a biocompatible layer such as Ti or TiO.sub.2, or other metallic, ceramic, polymer, or biomolecule coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">The nanotubes for the invention's devices can have any desired dimension, e.g., between about 10 to 1000 nm in diameter, or between about 30 to 300 nm, or anywhere in the nanoscale dimension of between about 60 to 200 nm in diameter. The desired heights of the tubules can be determined in part by the desired aspect ratio, as relatively short height with an aspect ratio of less than 10, or less than 5, in this aspect is preferred for ease of storing and eventual dispensing of drugs or biological agents intentionally placed within the tubule cavity. This nanotubule arrangement and size can maintain the function of the cells being cultured, e.g., kidney, liver or other cells, thus help the proliferation of these cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">Exemplary heights of nanotubes can be between about 40 to 1000 nm, or between about 100 to 400 nm. In one aspect, a vertical alignment with open top pore is crucial for bio-implant or related applications, e.g., as in one aspect an open top a the nanowire allows the penetration of the cells into a nanopore cavity for good adhesion, as illustrated in the exemplary <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>; this also allows easy supply of the biological agents stored in the nanopores.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">Because it is well known that the cells that adhere well to a surface generally stay healthy and grow fast, while the cells that do not adhere exhibit reduced or minimal growth, in one aspect the desired angle of vertical alignment is within about 10, 20, 30 or 40 or more degrees off the perpendicular axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">Exemplary micro-structural features and advantages of nanotube array structure are described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, for the exemplary anodized, self-assembled TiO.sub.2 structures of the invention. These scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show exemplary micro-structural features comprising vertically aligned, biocompatible TiO.sub.2 with a typical dimension of the hollow nanotubes in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> being approximately 100 nm outer diameter and approximately 70 nm inner diameter with approximately 15 nm in wall thickness, and approximately 250 nm in height.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">Exemplary nanotube array structures of the invention provide for healthy cell growth by providing a continuous supply of nutrients, including proteins, mineral ions, fluid, etc. to the cell through the flow of body fluid. The gap (spacing) between adjacent exemplary nanotubules in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> serves such a function of allowing the body fluid to continuously pass through and supply nutrients to the bottom side of the growing cells. The desired gap between the nanotubules in the exemplary structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is in the range of between about 2 to 100 nm, or between about 5-30 nm. In some aspects, too small a gap reduces the effectiveness of nutrient body fluid flow while too large a gap can pose a danger of reduced mechanical stability in the event of vertical or lateral stress or pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">Accelerated Cell Growth on TiO.sub.2 Nanotube Array</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">The invention provides nanotube structures that substantially improve cell adhesion and growth kinetics, an example of such an adhesion depicted in the exemplary structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. An adhesion of anchorage-dependent cells such as osteoblasts is a crucial prerequisite to subsequent cell functions such as synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, and formation of mineral deposits. In general, many types of cells beside the osteoblast cells remain healthy and grow fast if they are well-adhered onto a substrate surface, while the cells not adhering to the surface tends to stop growing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">In one aspect, nanotube structures (e.g., on orthopaedic or dental prostheses) can also comprise use of bone growth enhancing coatings comprising micrometer-sized bioactive materials, such as a hydroxyapatite layer coated on Ti implant surface; noting that the micrometer-sized materials alone may exhibit interfacial failures due to the much higher interfacial stress build-up between the dissimilar materials. Micrometer-sized materials alone also may fail due too the lack of strong chemical bonding or the absence of sharing of common element species between the implant and the coating. However, these disadvantages are mitigated by incorporation of the nanotube structures of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">Exemplary vertically or parallel-aligned nanotube arrays can have the following structural advantages for reduced interfacial failure: (i) vertically or parallel-aligned nanotube arrays fabricated to be thin, e.g., less than 1000 nm, or less than 400 nm (ii) nanotube arrays made as the same material as the base substrate material to ensure for strong bonding and mechanical stability of the nanotube array; and/or (iii) nanotube structures of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> made to be not continuous but as discrete structures, e.g., with a gap between adjacent nanotubes of approximately 15 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">In one aspect, lateral gap dimensions are in the range of between about 2 to 100 nm, or between about 5 to 30 nm. In one aspect, this exemplary lateral sub-division of a nanotube array structures is important for minimizing the interfacial stresses between two dissimilar materials joined together, with the two materials involved often having substantially different crystal structure, lattice parameter, and coefficient of thermal expansion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">In one aspect, in addition to the advantages in mechanical properties, the gaps present between adjacent nanotubes may also be useful as a pathway for continuous supply of the body fluid with ions, nutrients, proteins, etc. This may contribute positively to the health of the growing cells. In one aspect, in the absence of such pathways, the proliferating cells may completely cover the bioactive implant material surface and the bottom surface of the growing osteoblast cells would then have very limited access to body fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">Presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are SEM micrographs showing the growth and adhesion of the osteoblast cells (after 2 hrs) on exemplary vertically or parallel-configured nanotube arrays, as an example of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes. The micrographs clearly indicate that the filopodia of propagating osteoblast cells actually go into the vertical nanopores of the exemplary TiO.sub.2 nanotubes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">Noting the invention is not limited by any particular mechanism of action, the observed rapid adherence and spread of osteoblastic cells cultured on TiO.sub.2 nanotubes could be caused by three reasons. First, vertically aligned nanotubes exhibit enormously larger surface areas than the flat Ti surface. Second, the pronounced vertical topology contributes to the locked-in cell configuration. Thirdly, the pathway in-between nanotube arrays can allow the passage of body fluid and act as the supply/storage route of nutrient, which is an essential biological element for cell growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">Schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> are exemplary processing steps for guided anodization of Ti using pre-fabricated nano spot array for controlled TiO.sub.2 nanotube geometry. Various lithography techniques such as optical lithography (including laser lithography), electron beam lithography, ion beam lithography, self-assemble nanoparticle lithography, nano-imprint lithography, can be utilized to introduce an array of small etched cavity or indented cavity on the surface of Ti or Ti alloys. In one aspect, these pre-patterned spot locations serve as a nucleation spots during the subsequent anodization process. Such a guided anodization process creates more uniformly spaced, pre-controlled diameter and location of TiO.sub.2 nanotube array.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">In one aspect, a patterned TiO.sub.2 nanotubule array is fabricated by an anodization process, for example, using the electrochemical processing in a 0.5% HF solution at 20 V for 30 min at room temperature (RT). An inert electrode such as a platinum electrode can be used as the cathode. To crystallize the as-deposited, amorphous-structured TiO.sub.2 nanotubes into the desired anatase phase, the as-made nanotubes can be heat-treated at approximately 400.degree. C. to 600.degree. C. for anywhere between about 0.1 to 10 hrs. In one aspect, the amorphous TiO.sub.2 nanotubes is crystallized to anatase phase by heat treatment, because an amorphous TiO.sub.2 phase tends to be more susceptible to breakage by external stresses as compared to a crystalline phase. The use of the amorphous TiO.sub.2 phase nanotube array for special applications is not excluded, however.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is an exemplary lithographical fabrication of gapped nanotube array followed by coating with a biocompatible layer such as Ti or TiO.sub.2, or various noble metal, ceramic, polymer or biomolecule layer. Well known lithography materials and processes, such as the use of photoresist materials like PMMA, lithography beam exposure, selective etching (chemical or reactive-ion-etching), washing and drying can be utilized for fabrication of such a gapped nanotube array structure. For deposition of the biocompatible layer, physical vapor deposition techniques such as evaporation, sputtering, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition, or chemical processes can be used. A slightly oblique incident sputter or evaporation deposition can optionally be utilized to make the coating of the nanotube inside wall easier. If desired, the side and the back surfaces of the nanotube-containing substrate can also be coated with the similar biocompatible layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> describes an alternative exemplary method of the invention for creating biocompatible nanotube array comprising steps of lithographical fabrication of nanocavity, inside wall deposition of nanotube material such as Au, Pd, Pt, carbon, Ti or TiO.sub.2, for example, by oblique incident sputtering. The matrix material can be then selectively etched away to leave only the nanotube array. For Al or Al-oxide matrix, NaOH solution can be used for etching. For Si matrix, known Si etching solution including KOH can be used. In one aspect, the nanotube array so fabricated is then coated with a biocompatible layer such as Ti or TiO.sub.2, or various noble metal, ceramic, polymer or biomolecule layer, for example, using DC or RF sputtering, or chemical processes. If the nanotube array material itself is Ti or TiO.sub.2, the last coating step can of course be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> schematically illustrates an exemplary process of preparing a channeled array of parallel-aligned nano-cavities comprising a surface coating of biocompatible layers such as Ti or TiO.sub.2. Here the structure is less complicated than the nanotube array structure in that only patterned and diameter-controlled nano-cavity array is present. In one aspect, a channel structure is provided between the nano-cavities so that the biological fluid and nutrients are continuously supplied to the growing cells for healthy and accelerated cell culture. This structure also can be coated with a biocompatible layer such as Ti or TiO.sub.2, or various noble metal, ceramic, polymer or biomolecule layer, for example, using DC or RF sputtering or chemical processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">For these embodiments, the matrix material can be selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, and their oxides, or alloys of these metals and oxides. Other materials such as Si. Si oxide, Al, Al oxide, carbon, diamond, noble metals (such as Au, Ag, Pt and their alloys), polymer or plastic materials, or composite metals, ceramics or polymers can also be utilized to produce and use similar desired artificially generated nanotube or nanopore patterns. In one aspect, the surface of the nanotubes or nanopores are coated with biocompatible materials comprising Ti and/or Ti oxide, or Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta. Mo, W and/or their alloys or oxides of these metals and/or alloys, with a thickness of at least 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 or more nm and in one aspect the coating coverage of at least about at least 20%6, 30%, 40%, 50%, 606, 70%, 80% or more of the nanotube or nanopore surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">Three-Dimensional Cell Growth</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">The invention also provides compositions and methods for 3-dimensional cell, tissue and organ growth and maintenance, e.g., for organ or hard tissue replacements. In one aspect, a three-dimensional (3-D) growth of cells with a substantial volume, rather than a thin, two-dimensional (2-D) surface coverage of cells, is desirable. The invention provides a 3-D cell culture technique using the nanotube arrays with a biocompatible surface in a 3-D configuration. Referring to the drawings, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> schematically illustrates an exemplary novel approach of the invention. In one aspect, the growth base is made of subdivided and three-dimensionally positioned Ti ribbons, plates, wires, rods as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, which is in this example is made to be retractable so that the final cultured 3-D cells or organs do not contain the Ti metal any more as might be desired for some applications, although Ti and TiO.sub.2 are well known to be biocompatible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">In one aspect, to obtain relatively large surface area for cell growth, the desired titanium metal ribbon thickness in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> is in the range of between about 10.mu.m to 50,000.mu.m, or between about 25 to 2,500.mu.m. In one aspect, the desired volume fraction of the metal for the given targeted cell volume at the end of the planned cell culture period is at least 5%, 10%, 20% or 30% in volume. Each of the ribbon surface can be made to contain an aligned nanotube array with a desired dimension of nanotubes, as described above, e.g., a desired diameter of between about 10-1000 nm, between about 30-300 nm, or between about 60 to 200 nm in diameter; and the desired height can be in the range of between about 40 to 1000 nm, or between about 100 to 400 nm; and the desired angle can be vertical with an allowance of 10, 20, 30, 40 or more degree variation off the perpendicular axis; and the desired gap dimension between adjacent nanotubes can be in the range of between about 2 to 100 nm, or 5 to 30 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">In one aspect, the shape of these nanotubed ribbons is straight so that the metal arrays can be pulled out after desired volume of the cells are cultured, as illustrated in the exemplary <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23B and 23C</figref>. The cultured growth can continue after the metal wire or ribbon array template structure is pulled out, and any minor surface damage or the thin empty gap created by the vacated template can be repaired/filled as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23D</figref>. This exemplary three-dimensionally cultured cell volume in an accelerated and nutrient-supplied manner can be useful for a variety of applications, including making a partially artificial or a fully artificial tissue or organ, e.g., liver, kidney, bone, periodontal tissue, blood vessel cells, skin cells, stem cells, and other human or animal organ cells etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">The 3-D cultured cells can be in any orientation, i.e., horizontal, vertical or upside down depending on specific needs, especially in ex vivo or in vivo culture environment(s), for example, in the case of organ implants in human, animal, or xenotransplantation of human organs which are temporarily cultured in animals prior to human implantation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">Growth of Tube-Shaped Cells/Organs</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">An alternative embodiment of the invention comprises culturing 3-dimensional, tube-shaped cells, such as blood vessel cells or fluid, enzyme and/or hormone secretion tubes, intestine tubes, nerve “tubes” (e.g., Schwann cells), and the like, using nanotube-comprising compositions and methods of the invention. For example, in one aspect, using artificially engineered nanotube array surfaces of this invention, the cells are cultured into a tube configuration; and in one aspect, the after the cells are cultured into a tube configuration the rods are pulled out, leaving a ready made tubular cell structure (e.g., multi-cellular structure) or a tubular cell shape. Such a tube-shaped cells or cell structure can be used for repairing tissues or organs, e.g., repairing damaged blood vessels, nerves, fluid, enzyme and/or hormone secretion tubes, fluid, intestine tubes, to name just a few exemplary structures that can be built de novo, or used for the repair or reconstruction of tissues or organs, using the compositions and methods of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">Co-Culturing</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">Another embodiment of the invention comprises a 3-dimensional cell growth process of culturing at least two types of cells together. Human or animal organs often contain more than one type of cells. Because it has been recognized that a co-culture during growth of cells, such as bone, kidney or liver cells, is beneficial in obtaining a higher quality cells (see, e.g., Begue (1983) Experimental Cell Res. 143:47-54; Angius (1988) J. Biochem. 252:23-28); US Patent application pub. No. US 2001/0023073, Bhatia et al.), or a better functional organization of cells-leading to a functional tissue or organ system, the invention provides compositions and methods comprising use of at least two types of cells together. The invention also provides methods for co-culture of different cells using the compositions of the invention. e.g., for making artificial organs or tissues, or for repairing or reconstructing organs or tissues in vivo, ex vivo or in situ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">For example, in one aspect cells are co-cultured using artificially engineered nanotube array surfaces of the invention, and in one aspect at least two different types of cells are co-cultured. For example, in the case of liver cell cultures (e.g., for making artificial liver organs or tissues, or for repairing or reconstructing damaged or diseased liver), parenchymal liver cells (hepatocytes) are cultured together with at least one of the following cells: fibroblast cells, blood vessel cells, Kupffer cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, skin cells (keratinocytes), hematopoietic cells, bone marrow cells, etc. Similarly, a culture of other organ cells (e.g., eyes, kidneys, bone, blood vessels, heart) using this exemplary approach can be carried out using an appropriate combination of cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">Permanent or Semi-Permanent 3-D Cell/Organ Implants</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">The invention provides permanent or semi-permanent 2-D and/or 3-D cell/tissue/organ implants, e.g., for cell, tissue and/or organ growth or reconstruction, or for a medical treatment, e.g., to supplement or replace a diseased or injured organ or tissue, e.g., a kidney, liver, pancreas, nerve cell(s) (e.g., spinal cord) and the like. An exemplary artificially engineered nanotube array of the invention comprises a base structure of wire/rod/ribbon/sheet, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>, which can be removed, or alternatively, the base structure can be optionally left in to be a component of inorganic-organic composite structure. The base structure can be made of Ti wires, ribbons, networks or sponges or any other biocompatible or bio-inert material such as a noble metal, silicon, polymer, etc., optionally coated with biocompatible or bioinert layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">In some aspects, for such permanently retained metal structures, a locally bent or curved configuration of the base structure is preferred so as to provide a mechanical locking and more stable structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">Nanopore-Reservoired Template for Multifunctional 3-D Cell/Organ Growth</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">The invention provides a nano-reservoir-comprising (e.g., a nanopore-reservoired) template for multifunctional 2-D or 3-D cell, tissue and/or organ growth or reconstruction. In one aspect, a benefit of this exemplary artificially engineered nanotube array structure is that the vertical pores within nanotubes are utilized as a reservoir (e.g., depository) of various biologically active agents to provide multi-functional capability, as illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, or to aid in the growth of, or guide a directional growth of cells, and/or in the maintenance of the cell, tissue and/or organ. In alternative aspects, therapeutic or test drugs, growth factors, proteins, collagens, enzymes, hormones, nucleic acids (e.g., siRNAs, antisense agents), DNA's, genes, antibiotics, antibodies, magnetic nanoparticles, small molecules, lipids, carbohydrates and so forth are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">The filling of the nanotubes pores (and, in one aspect, also in-between the nanotubes) can be effected by a number of different methods. For example, in one aspect, ultrasonic agitation of the nanotube structure in a solution containing one or more of the biologically active agents is used. In one aspect, nano-sized pores of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes are used. As compared to micro-sized pores, artificially engineered nanotube array structure of the invention have an advantage of being able to keep the stored biological agents much longer and allow slower release over a longer period of time; however, arrays and structures of the invention can comprise a mixture of micro-sized pores and/or tubes and nano-sized pores and tubes, depending on the desired reagent release effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">In one aspect, 2-D and/or 3-D orthopaedic (artificial joint), eye, organ (e.g., liver, kidney), nerve (spinal cord), dental (e.g., odontogenic structures), skin and/or periodontal (e.g., tooth supporting structures) or any other cell implants of the invention comprise artificially engineered nanotube array structures comprising these nano-reservoir-comprising (e.g., a nanopore-reservoired) templates. In one aspect, an advantage of building in these nano-reservoirs is that a continuous supply, a defined duration supply, or an intermittent supply of biological or chemical agents can be designed in to the composition of the invention to effect a desired growth, differentiation, cell interaction or direction cell growth, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">For example, a growth factor can be slowly released from the nanotubes, e.g., a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) type or collagen type growth factor can be placed into a nano-reservoir (or a micro-reservoir, which is an alternative option in some aspects). Another example is insertion of infection-preventing antibiotics (such as penicillin, streptomycin, vancomycin, and the like), which can be slowly released from the nanotubes; can be slowly released from the nano-reservoirs. Thus, compositions of the invention can be designed such that much more efficient and healthier cell or bone growth can be accomplished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">Other examples include 3-D bone growth, 3-D culturing liver or kidney or other organs, 3-D spinal cord, tooth or periodontal tissue re-growth, or re-growth or repair of other cells cells/tissues/organs, which can be further enhanced by using slowly released biological agents from the nanotube reservoirs. Another example is incorporation of therapeutic agents, e.g., drugs, biological agents or natural products, such as anti-cancer drugs, in the nanotube pores, e.g., where the cultured 3-D cells/organs are to be implanted into a body of a patient whose cancerous organs have been partially or fully removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">In addition to the in vitro type cell culture aspects of the invention, the 3-D base structure of the invention can comprise use of artificially engineered nanotube array structures pre-filled with one or more types of drugs and biological agents, where the structures are left permanently or semi-permanently in vivo implanted as a source of slow drug release within an individual, e.g., a human body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">Externally Controllable Drug Release in 3-D Growing Cells/Organs</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">The invention provides devices, arrays, templates and other structures of the invention comprising nanotubes and/or nanopores or nano-reservoirs and controlled release compositions, e.g., an externally controllable drug release composition, e.g., in a 2-D or 3-D growing cells/tissue/organ of the invention. In one aspect, a device, array, template of the invention comprises multi-functional implants to implant or store remote-controllable media, such as magnetic nanoparticles, biodegradable agents, a colloidal liquid and the like. A biological or chemical agent, such as a cancer drug, can be placed together with (or within) a magnetic nanoparticle in the nanopore or nano-reservoir (or micro-reservoir, which is an alternative option in some aspects), for example, as in the exemplary nanotubes of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">The nanopore- or nano-reservoir-implanted composition can be designed for release, for example, by ultrasonic or magnetic agitation of a colloidal liquid containing a mixture of the drug solution and the particles. Exemplary magnetic nanoparticles for such use include biocompatible iron-oxide particles of magnetite (Fe.sub.3O.sub.4) or maghemite (.gamma.-Fe.sub.2O.sub.3), e.g., in the particle size regime of between about 5 to 50 nm in average diameter. External stimulation of the magnetic nanoparticles by orientation-changing magnetic field or alternating current (AC) magnetic field can help release a biological reagent, a dye, an isotope (e.g., a radioactive agent), a drug or chemical, e.g., a cancer drug, by mechanical agitation/movement of the magnetic particles or by heating of the drug-particle mixture due to the AC magnetic field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0222">Magnetic-nanoparticle-containing nanotube structures of the invention can also be useful for treatment of a disease, injury or condition (e.g., a cancer) via a combination of externally controllable drug release and magnetic hyperthermia treatments, for example, as an implant in bone cancer area or other cancer regions in general. Because there has been much progress in the general magnetic hyperthermia treatment of cancer using high frequency alternating current (AC) magnetic field, these treatments can be incorporated when practicing this invention, see, e.g., Jordan (1999) J. of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 194:185-196. The magnetic particles can be confined within the nanotubes, nanopores and/or nano-reservoirs, thus minimizing any complications that may arise from the nanoparticles in human body, yet induce local temperature rise for the magnetic hyperthermia treatment of cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0223">3-D Cell Proliferation and Supply Device</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0224">The invention provides artificially engineered nanotube array structures that can accelerate cell growth, e.g., in a 2-D or a 3-D cell growth pattern. For example, the increased number of cells generated by this exemplary device in a 3-D configuration can be useful for accelerated supply of various types of cells, such as bone cells, liver cells, kidney cells, nerve or blood vessel cells, skin cells, periodontal cells, stem cells, and other human or animal organ cells, and other human or animal cells for various R&amp;D or therapeutic uses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0225">In one aspect, the cells are cultured in a biocompatible environment with needed nutrient media. In one aspect, the cells are proliferated on vertically or parallel-aligned nanotube arrays of the invention, and then can be harvested and supplied for various uses. One exemplary method of harvesting the grown 3-D cells off a nanotube arrayed substrate comprises use of linearly retractable, base structures; and then in one aspect, physically or mechanically removing the cells, e.g., as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>. Vacuum suction is one of the possible processes for the mechanical removal of the cells from the retractable substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0226">Another exemplary method is to use a process known as “trypsinization”. Once cells are grown completely on whole surface of cell culture flask, the media fluid is removed by suction. After rinsing of the cells twice with PBS (phosphate buffer solution), trypsin is added to detach the cell from the surface. A combination of the template retracting (mechanical removal) and trypsinization can also be utilized. The retrieved cells are then washed, stored and supplied to the people who want to purchase them. For trypsinization, generally approximately 2-3 ml of trypsin can be used for detaching cells grown on 10 cm.sup.2 cell culture dish. After approximately 2 minutes, most of the cells are detached from the nanotube surface. After adding approximately 10 ml of new medium, this fluid containing the detached stem cells can be poured into a centrifuge tube. After centrifugation at appropriate rotation speed and time, all of the cells can be separated. The medium can be removed by suction, and 1 ml of new media can be added for storage of the harvested cells or for additional culture. To estimate the number of proliferated cells, trypan blue assay can be employed in conjunction with hematocytometrv.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0227">The 2-D or 3-D cultured cells prepared using the artificially engineered nanotube array structures of the invention can be useful for a variety of applications, e.g., in vivo implanting of cells or organs. For example, a patient can be supplied with cultured and implanted, three-dimensional functional cells such as liver, kidney, or blood vessel cells or organs, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. Three-dimensionally cultured bones or tissues can also be utilized as dental, periodontal or orthopaedic body implants as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0228">Analytical Diagnostic Biochip</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0229">In one aspect, the invention provides analytical diagnostic arrays, or biochips, comprising structures of the invention. For example, rapid growth of cells—such as growth facilitated by a large surface area—can be effected by use of a composition of the invention. For example, 2-D or 3-D cell culturing can be useful for carrying out fast diagnosis and detection of certain types of cells, such as diseases, toxins, poisons or biological or chemical warfare agents (e.g., <i>bacillus </i>spores, e.g., anthrax). In one aspect, the invention provides an X-Y matrix subdivided array, e.g., an artificially engineered nanotube array structure produced as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0230">For diagnosis of diseases (especially epidemic diseases, e.g., SARS or influenza, e.g., the so-called “bird flu”) or biological warfare agents (e.g., bio-terror germs, spores, e.g., anthrax, bacteria or viruses), as well as identifying cells to produce forensic evidence, the invention provides a rapid detection device, even when the available quantity of cells is relatively small. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates the detection elements comprising a multiplicity of parallel-configured and laterally gapped nanotubes of the invention upon which various types of cells are placed and allowed to rapidly proliferate. In this aspect, as a sufficient number of cells are rapidly grown in a shorter period of time, an easier and faster detection device and method is generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0231">For analysis of cell types, various exemplary techniques, e.g., as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, can be used, including, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> optical detection of morphology and size (using a microscope, fluorescent microscope, or CCD camera sensing of fluorescent or quantum dot tagged cells), <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> chemical or biological detection (e.g., based on signature reactions), <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> magnetic sensor detection (e.g., by using magnetically targeted antibody and its conjugation with certain types of antigens).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">Liver Cell Array Device for Drug/Chemical Toxicity Testing</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0233">Another important application of the compositions of the invention. e.g., the exemplary bio-chip apparatus illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, comprises their use as a base structure to culture liver cells for testing of new drugs, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">A variation of this embodiments includes having a rod or plate shape base structure in a vertically (or near vertically) arranged configuration; within one aspect, each rod or plate base comprises a parallel—yet a laterally spaced-apart, nanotube array; this can make the 2-D or 3-D culture more effective. Because the 2-D or 3-D structured, nanotube array of the invention enables a rapid and healthy culture of liver cells in a desirable 2-D or 3-D configuration, the apparatus can be utilized for the important task of testing drug toxicity or chemical toxicity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">In one aspect, for toxicity testing, the 2-D or 3-D structured TiO.sub.2-nanotubes are important for creating a stable “culture”, e.g., an artificial organ, comprising an array of two- or three-dimensionally configured liver cells. These devices of the invention are important because when a drug is toxic to human or animal body under an in vivo situation, the liver is one of the first organs to sense it and try to isolate the toxic materials. Thus, these devices, e.g., bio-chips, of the invention can comprise an array of healthy, 2-D or three-dimensionally cultured liver cells, e.g., 10.times.10 (10.sup.2), 10.sup.3, 100.times.100, 10.sup.5, or 1000.times.1000 cells as sensing elements, thus allowing simultaneous evaluation of many drugs for a much accelerated screening and development of biologically acceptable drugs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236">Likewise, many chemicals, biological agents, gases, polymers, injection fluids, and composites and the like that may be useful for in vivo applications, or may be encountered in in vivo conditions (e.g., toxins, poisons) can be rapidly tested for toxicity, e.g., using the exemplary device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0237">In one aspect, for analysis of the response of liver cells, various exemplary detection/analysis mechanisms, such as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> can be utilized, for example: <b>18</b>A optical or microscopic sensing, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>chemical or biological detection, and <b>18</b>C magnetic sensor detection.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">The invention provides three-dimensionally cultured cells and tissues grown by using three-dimensionally configured templates comprising aligned nanotubule structure. The invention provides three-dimensionally cultured cells/organs, template devices composed of TiO.sub.2 nanotubule structure which allows a growth of 3-dimensionally configured cells such as bone cells, liver cells, kidney cells, blood vessel cells, skin cells, periodontal cells, stem cells, and methods for applying such cell growth techniques. The invention provides vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotube arrays adherent on three-dimensionally configured arrays of Ti surfaces; these arrays can induce a strong cell adhesion and significantly enhance the formation kinetics of cells. In one aspect, three-dimensionally placed nano-gaps between aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes allow a continuous supply of various nutrients to the growing cells. The TiO.sub.2 nanotube array can be fabricated on the surface of a three dimensional array of wire or ribbon shaped Ti, which can be retractable from or permanently kept in the 3-D grown cells. In one aspect, a 3-dimensional cell and tissue culture device, with optionally stored biological agents within the nanotube reservoirs, improves growth of healthy liver cells and other cells, and maintains the functionality of the cells. Such cultured cells can be useful for rapid supply of needed cells for R&amp;D or therapeutics, for preparation of partial or full implant organs, for externally controllable drug release and therapeutic treatments, for efficient toxicity testing of drugs and chemicals, and for diagnosis/detection of disease or forensic cells.</div>

See, e.g., Shirkhanzadeh et al, Journal of Materials Science Letters, Vol. 10, page (1991), de Groot et al., Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, Vol. 21, page 1375-1381 (1987), and Cotell et al., Journal of Applied Biomaterials, Vol. 8, page 87-92 (1992). In one aspect, the interface is bonded with an integrated structure of the invention comprising a locked-in configuration with a much increased adhesion area; e.g., a discrete, less continuous layer to minimize interface stress and delamination. In one aspect, accelerated hydroxyapatite and bone growth is accomplished on a mechanically adherent TiO.sub.2 nanotube surface on Ti substrate, as described by, e.g., Oh (2005) Biomaterials 26:4938-4943.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">The invention provides implants comprising three-dimensionally configured cells, and methods and devices for producing these three-dimensionally cultured cells. The invention provides nanotubule structures useful as a substrate for efficient liver cell culture devices; and in one aspect, the liver cells are grown quickly in vitro without a major loss of their capability for complex functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">The TiO.sub.2 nanotubule structures of the invention can comprise three dimensional surfaces for cell culture devices in vitro as well as in vivo, and bio-artificial liver support devices. This invention provides 2-D and 3-dimensional cell culture devices comprising TiO.sub.2 nanotubule structures; which in one aspect enable accelerated growth of cells, e.g., bone cells, kidney cells, blood vessel cells, skin cells, liver cells, liver parenchymal cells, endothelial cells, adipocytes, fibroblastic cells, Kupffer cells, kidney cells, blood vessel cells, periodontal cells, odontoblasts, dentinoblasts, cementoblasts, enameloblasts, odontogenic ectomesenchymal tissue, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, and other cells and tissues involved in odontogenesis or bone formation, stem cells or a combination thereof; including organized mixed cell groups, including functional organ cell groups, such as mixed and organized liver or kidney cells: as well as other structural cells such as blood vessel cells, enzyme secretion vessels, periodontal, bone, teeth, or other hard tissue cells. These cultured cells can be useful for a variety of applications including i) organ-related therapeutic medical treatment including liver or kidney disease treatment, ii) orthopaedic, dental or periodontal processes, iii) supply of cells for various research or therapeutic purposes, and iv) disease diagnostic or toxicity testing of new drugs or chemicals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">Referring to the drawings, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A-1B</figref> schematically illustrates exemplary devices comprising self-organized TiO.sub.2 nanotube arrays grown on titanium metal or alloy substrate to accelerate cell proliferation according to the invention. In alternative aspects, the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes or any other biocompatible nanotubes desirable for the exemplary devices have typical desired dimension of about 10-1000 nm in diameter, or about 30-300 nm, or about 60-200 nm in diameter. In alternative aspects, the desired heights of the tubules are determined in part by the desired aspect ratio as relatively short height with an aspect ratio of less than about 10, or in one aspect less than 5 is preferred for ease of storing and eventual dispensing of drugs or biological agents intentionally placed within the tubule cavity, which can maintain the function of the cells being cultured such as liver cells, thus help the proliferation of the cells. In alternative aspects, desired height is about 40-1000 nm, or about 100-400 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">In alternative aspects, the vertical alignment with open top pore is crucial for bio implant and related applications being described in this disclosure, as the open top of the nanowire allows the penetration of the cells into the nanopore cavity for good adhesion as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and also allows easy supply of the biological agents stored in the nanopores. In alternative aspects, the desired angle of vertical alignment is within than 5, 10, 20, 30 or 40 degrees off the perpendicular axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">In alternative aspects, the base material for the 2D or 3D cell growth structure can be pure Ti or can be an alloy based on Ti such as Ti—V—Al alloys or other solid solution hardened or precipitation hardened alloys with increased mechanical strength and durability onto which an oxide nanotubes are formed. In alternative aspects, similar metals such as Zr, Hf, Ce and their oxide nanotubes are also used. Microstructural analysis of the exemplary cell-growth promoting nanostructure was carried out using by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. These exemplary structures comprise vertically aligned, biocompatible TiO.sub.2 with a typical dimension of the hollow nanotubes in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> being approximately 100 nm outer diameter and approximately 70 nm inner diameter with approximately 15 nm in wall thickness, and approximately 250 nm in height.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">The exemplary TiO.sub.2 nanotubule array structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> was fabricated by anodization technique using a Ti sheet (0.25 mm thick, 99.5% purity) which is electrochemically processed in a 0.5% HF solution at 20 V for 30 min at room temperature. A platinum electrode (thickness: 0.1 mm, purity: 99.99%) was used as the cathode. To crystallize the as-deposited, amorphous-structured TiO.sub.2 nanotubes into the desired anatase phase, the specimens were heat-treated at 500.degree. C, for 2 hrs. In alternative aspects, it is preferred that the amorphous TiO.sub.2 nanotubes is crystallized to anatase phase by heat treatment, because an amorphous TiO.sub.2 phase tends to be more susceptible to breakage by external stresses as compared to a crystalline phase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">In alternative aspects, an important factor for healthy cell growth is a continuous supply of nutrients including proteins, mineral ions, fluid, etc. to the cell through the flow of body fluid. The gap (spacing) between adjacent exemplary TiO.sub.2 nanotubules in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> serves such a function of allowing the body fluid to continuously pass through and supply nutrients to the bottom side of the growing cells. In alternative aspects, the desired gap between the nanotubules is in the range of about 2-100 nm, or about 5-30 nm. In some aspects, too small a gap reduces the effectiveness of nutrient body fluid flow while too large a gap can pose a danger of reduced mechanical stability in the event of vertical or lateral stress or pressure. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) photograph shown for an exemplary inventive TiO.sub.2 nanotube array structure, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, gives an average of approximately 15 nm spacing between the nanotubes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0267">Accelerated Cell Growth on TiO.Sub.2 Nanotube Array</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">In order to estimate the effect of having an extremely fine nanostructure such as the vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes on cell growth behavior, an osteoblast cell growth on TiO.sub.2 nanotubes was carried out as an example. The results indicate that the introduction of nanostructure significantly improves bioactivity of implant and enhances osteoblast adhesion and growth. In alternative aspects, an adhesion of anchorage-dependent cells such as osteoblasts is a crucial prerequisite to subsequent cell functions such as synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, and formation of mineral deposits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">All the experimental specimens (0.5.times.0.5 cm.sup.2) used for cell adhesion assays were sterilized by autoclaving. A pure Ti sheet polished by emery paper (#600 grit size) and chemically cleaned was used as a control group sample. For cell adhesion studies, MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells (rat cells of the type CRL-2593, sub-clone 4, ATCC. Rockville, Md.) were used. Each 1 mL of cells was mixed with 10 mL of alpha minimum essential medium (.alpha.-MEM) in the presence of 10/% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cell suspension was plated in a cell culture dish and incubated under 37.degree. C., 5% CO.sub.2 environment. When the concentration of the MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells reached approximately 3.times.10.sup.5 cells/mL, they were seeded onto the experimental substrate of interest (TiO.sub.2 or Ti) which were then placed on a 12-well polystyrene plate, and stored in a CO.sub.2 incubator for 2, 12, 24 or 48 hrs to observe cell morphology and count viable attached cells as a function of incubation time. The concentration of the cells seeded onto the specimen substrate was approximately 5.times.10.sup.4 cells/mL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0270">After the selected incubation period, the samples were washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and distilled water, respectively, and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS for 1 hr. After fixing, they were rinsed three times with 0.1 M PBS for 10 min. For microscopic examination of cell structures and morphologies, the samples were dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol (50%, 75%, 90% and 100%) for 10 min and subsequently dried by supercritical point CO.sub.2. The dehydrated samples were sputter-coated with approximately 2 nm thick gold for SEM examination. The morphology of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes as well as that of the adhered cells were observed using SEM and TEM. In the quantitative assay, the adhered cells on sample surface were counted from back-scattered SEM images.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0271">In alternative aspects, the invention provides vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotube coatings comprising one or more of the following structures, which can provide structural advantages for reduced interfacial failure:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0272">i) a vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotube coating fabricated to be thin, typically less than 1000 nm, preferably less than 400 nm;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0273">ii) a coating having a strong chemical bonding on the Ti substrate as the TiO.sub.2 nanotube coating was prepared via chemical process, and since a common element of Ti is shared by the substrate and the coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0274">iii) a TiO.sub.2 nanotube structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> is made to be not continuous but is discrete, with a gap between adjacent nanotubes of approximately 15 nm. The desired lateral gap dimension is in the range of about 2-100 nm, or about 5-30 nm. Such a lateral sub-division of a nanotube array structure can be important for minimizing the interfacial stresses between two dissimilar materials joined together, with the two materials involved often having substantially different crystal structure, lattice parameter, and coefficient of thermal expansion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">It has experimentally been confirmed that the vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes of the invention are strongly adherent to the Ti metal base, as it was very difficult to remove the nanotubes from the Ti surface by attempting to delaminate or scrape off or by bending of the Ti substrate. Such a strongly bonded and stable bone-promoting coating is important, especially in consideration of possible interference by fibroblast cells during bone growth near the Ti implants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0276">The invention also accommodates the fact that fibroblast cells are prone to attach on smooth surface layers, in contrast to the osteoblastic cells which can attach well on rough surface (see, e.g., Salata (2004) J. Nanobiotechnology 2:3 (2004), and provides such smooth surface layers interspersed with vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes of the invention. In one aspect, in making a cell-comprising device of the invention, an opportunity and time is given for the fibrous tissues to form at the boundary interface between the implant and the growing bone. These tissues can keep osteoblasts from adhering onto the surface of a Ti implant; however, they can also cause an undesirable loosening of the Ti implant. Thus, in another aspect, a rapid and strong adhesion of osteoblasts on implant surfaces is provided for to effect successful bone growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0278" num="0277">In addition to the advantages in mechanical properties, the gaps present between adjacent TiO.sub.2 nanotubes of the devices of the invention also may be useful as a pathway for continuous supply of the body fluid with ions, nutrients, proteins, etc. This may contribute positively to the health of the growing cells. In some aspects, in the absence of such pathways the proliferating cells may completely cover the bioactive implant material surface and the bottom surface of the growing osteoblast cells would then have very limited access to body fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0279" num="0278">Presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A-7B</figref> are SEM micrographs showing the growth and adhesion of the osteoblast cells (after 2 hrs) on vertically nanoporous TiO.sub.2 nanotubes. The micrographs clearly indicate that the filopodia of propagating osteoblast cells actually go into the vertical nanopores of the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes. The observed rapid adherence and spread of osteoblastic cells cultured on TiO.sub.2 nanotubes could be caused by three reasons. First, vertically aligned TiO.sub.2 nanotubes exhibit enormously larger surface areas than the flat Ti surface. Second, the pronounced vertical topology contributes to the locked-in cell configuration. Thirdly, the pathway in-between TiO.sub.2 nanotube arrays can allow the passage of body fluid and act as the supply/storage route of nutrient, which is an essential biological element for cell growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0279"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A-8C</figref> represents the comparative back-scattered SEM micrographs of the cells cultured on <b>8</b>A pure Ti, <b>8</b>B amorphous TiO.sub.2 nanotubes, and <b>8</b>C anatase TiO.sub.2 nanotubes after 48 hrs of incubation. It is evident that the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell's adhesion and growth is significantly accelerated on TiO.sub.2 nanotubes, and more so on anatase TiO.sub.2 nanotubes as compared to the amorphous TiO.sub.2 nanotubes. The plot of the number of adhered cells as a function of culture period, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, clearly confirms this trend, with the speed of cell adhesion and growth on anatase TiO.sub.2 nanotubes being significantly higher after 48 hr culture, by as much as approximately 400% as compared to the Ti surface. It is noted that at the early stage, e.g., after 2 hr incubation, there was no significant statistical difference in the data among the three surfaces investigated However, the number of attached cells on the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes dramatically increases as the culture time is extended to 12, 24 and 48 hrs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0280">The accelerated cell growth on vertical TiO.sub.2 nanotube array is not restricted to the osteoblast cells. A similar behavior is seen with other cells, for example, it has been found that liver cell growth is substantially accelerated on TiO.sub.2 nanotube array. This is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> as comparative back scattered electron SEM images of the liver cells (rat hepatocyte #AML-12) cultured for 48 hrs on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref> prior art, sand blasted and roughened Ti using #60 grit sand blasting medium, B inventive TiO.sub.2 nanotube array surface. As is evident from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>, the liver cells adhere and grow much faster on the vertically aligned and laterally separated TiO.sub.2 nanotubes than on the prior-art sand blast roughened Ti of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>. In fact, not much of the liver cell growth was seen on the sand-blasted Ti, as mostly the dark-colored surface roughness defects covers the SEM image of the sample surface.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0282">The invention provides compositions (e.g., devices, such as artificial organ systems) for use as organ or hard tissue replacements.

In one aspect, the invention provides a culture method and culture device that can meet the demands for supply of the cells for toxicity testing of enormous numbers of new or experimental drugs, chemicals, and therapeutics being developed in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry. With the unique toxin-filtering capability of liver cells, any toxicity of a new drug can be manifested first by the reaction of the liver cells. In one aspect, the invention provides a culture method and culture device comprising an array of liver cells that can be utilized as a fast testing/screening vehicle to simultaneously evaluate the potential toxicity of many new drugs and compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0287">Referring to the drawings, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> schematically illustrates an exemplary approach: the growth base is made of subdivided and three-dimensionally positioned Ti wires, ribbons, or rods, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, which is in this particular case made to be retractable so that the final cultured 3-D cells or organs do not contain the Ti metal any more as might be desired for some applications, although Ti and TiO.sub.2 are well known to be biocompatible.</div>

In one aspect, in the case of bone growth, it is the mineral that grows—not a living cell, so the desired spacing between the neighboring branches can be much larger, with a desired spacing being at most 100 times the thickness of osteoblast cell, or alternatively, at most 50 times.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0303">In one aspect of making the 3-dimensional cell growth devices of the invention, e.g., the artificial human or animal organs of the invention, a 3-D configured array of Ti wires, rods and ribbons is used. In one aspect, 3-D configured array of Ti wires, rods and ribbons may be beneficial because the vertical pores of the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes on the surface of Ti can be utilized as a reservoir of various biologically active agents to provide multi-functional capabilities, e.g., as illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. For example, the nanopores and/or nanotubes of the structures of the invention can be filled, or “loaded” with therapeutic drugs, growth factors, proteins, collagens, enzymes, hormones, nucleic acids (e.g., RNA, DNA, vectors, siRNA, genes), antibiotics, antibodies, magnetic nanoparticles, radioisotopes and so forth. The filling of the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes pores (and also in-between the nanotubes) can be effected by a number of different methods, for example, using ultrasonic agitation of the TiO.sub.2 nanotube coated Ti in a solution containing one or more of the biologically active agents. The nanosize pores of TiO.sub.2 nanotubes, as compared to microsized pores, can have an advantage of being able to keep the stored biological agents much longer and allow slower release over a longer period of time. However, the 3-dimensional cell growth devices of the invention can also comprise a mix of nanosized pores and micro-sized pores.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0304">In one aspect, 2-D or 3-D organ (e.g., liver, kidney, spinal cord, pancreas), orthopedic (e.g., artificial joints), dental or periodontal cell implants comprising the TiO.sub.2 nanotube coated Ti structure have the advantage of a continuous supply of biological agents, small molecules or other chemicals desired to be used in the cell growth, differentiation or maintenance process. For example, bone morphogenic protein (BMP) type or collagen type growth factor, or infection-preventing antibiotics (such as penicillin, streptomycin, vancomycin), or nucleic acids such as vectors, can be slowly released from the TiO.sub.2 nanotube. An efficient and healthier cell or bone growth can be designed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0306" num="0305">Similarly as in the case of 3-D bone growth, the invention provides for 3-D culturing of other cells or cell systems, such as liver or kidney cells/organs, spinal cord systems, pancreas, and the like, by using the slowly releasing biological agents, small molecules or other chemicals from the TiO.sub.2 nanotube reservoir. Drugs such as anti-cancer drugs can be incorporated in the nanotube pores, e.g., when the cultured 3-D cells/organ is to be implanted into a body of a patient, e.g., whose cancerous organs have been partially or fully removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0307" num="0306">In addition to the in vitro type cell culture, the 3-D base structure of TiO.sub.2 nanotube coated Ti (which can be pre-filled with one or more types of drugs and biological agents, small molecules or other chemicals) can also be left permanently or semi-permanently as an in vivo implanted 3-D cells/organ as a source of slow drug release within an individual, e.g., a test or production animal, or a human body, because both Ti and TiO.sub.2 are known to be biocompatible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0308" num="0307">Externally Controllable Drug Release in 3-D Growing Cells/Organs</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0309" num="0308">The invention provides multi-functional implants comprising remote-controllable media, e.g., magnetic nanoparticles. An agent to be delivered, e.g., a biological agent, such as a cancer drug, or other reagent, drug, isotope and the like, can be placed, together with magnetic nanoparticles, in the nanopores of the TiO.sub.2 nanotubes, e.g., as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The controllable media, e.g., magnetic nanoparticle, can be stimulated/activated to release the substance (e.g., drug, etc.) contained therein, for example, by ultrasonic or magnetic agitation of a colloidal liquid containing a mixture of the substance (e.g., drug solution) and the controllable media, e.g., particles. Exemplary magnetic nanoparticles for such use include biocompatible iron-oxide particles of magnetite (Fe.sub.3O.sub.4) or maghemite (.gamma.-Fe.sub.2O.sub.3) in the particle size regime of about 2 to 100 nm, or 5 to 50 nm, in average diameter. External stimulation of the magnetic nanoparticles by orientation-changing magnetic field or alternating current (AC) magnetic field can help release the agent to be delivered. e.g., a biological agent, such as a cancer drug, by mechanical agitation/movement of the magnetic particles or by heating of the agent-particle (e.g., drug-particle) mixture due to the AC magnetic field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0310" num="0309">In one aspect, magnetic-nanoparticle-comprising TiO.sub.2 nanotube structures of the invention are useful for treatment of cancer via a combination of externally controllable drug release and magnetic hyperthermia treatment, for example, as an implant in bone cancer area or other cancer regions in general. The methods and compositions of the invention can incorporate magnetic hyperthermia treatments of cancer, e.g., using high frequency alternating current (AC) magnetic fields, e.g., as described by Jordan (1999) J. Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 194:185-196. The magnetic particles can be confined within the nanopores, thus minimizing any complications that may arise from the nanoparticles in human body, yet induce local temperature rise for the magnetic hyperthermia treatment of cancer.</div>

Another method is to use a process known as “trypsinization”, discussed above. A combination of the template retracting and trypsinization can also be utilized; for example, the 3-D cultured cells on an array vertically arranged Ti wires, rods or ribbons (having TiO.sub.2 nanotube covered surfaces) can be physically removed (e.g., by low-power vacuum suction) along the vertical direction after appropriate trypsinization treatment. The retrieved cells are then washed and stored.</div>

By virtue of the re-entrant nature of the pores, bones grown (and cells cultured) are mechanically better locked, and a tensile stress would not cause the bones or cells partially or fully in the pores would not slip out easily. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref> shows exemplary re-entrant oval or circular pores, which can be fabricated by patterned coverage, e.g., by lithographically patterned PMMA (polymethylmecarthrylate) or other patternable polymer, followed by isotropic chemical etching of Ti with acids. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref> represents rectangular cavities with corrugating walls, which is fabricated by alternating isotropic vs anisotropic chemical etching or reactive ion etching. Such isotropic vs anisotropic etching techniques are well known in silicon and MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) fabrication. As an example embodiment, a Ti implant can be isotropic vs anisotropic alternatively etched to obtain a structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>, which can be oxidized (chemically or by oxygen atmosphere treatment) to exhibit TiO.sub.2 surface. As another example embodiment, a Si wafer can be isotropic vs anisotropic alternatively etched, to obtain a structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>, and the surface can be coated by biocompatible Ti or TiO.sub.2 by sputtering or evaporation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31C</figref> shows re-entrant triangular cross-sectioned pores, which can be fabricated, for example, by anisotropic etching using gradually altered electric field in the case of electrochemical etching, or gradually increasing concentration of etchant during the process of pore formation. Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31D</figref> are nanotubes such as TiO.sub.2 with corrugating walls which can be fabricated by using alternating larger and smaller electric field during anodization of Ti and its alloys, for example, by alternating between 15 and 20 volts of potential during anodization in hydrofluidic acid or ammonium fluoride etchant or by alternating the pH value during the anodization electrochemical etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0349" num="0348">Substrate materials for the exemplary <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> structures can be Ti or Ti oxide as well as alloys containing Ti or Ti oxide by at least 50% weight %.

Other materials such as Si, Si oxide, carbon, diamond, noble metals (such as Au, Ag, Pt and their alloys), polymer or plastic materials, or composite metals, ceramics or polymers can also be utilized to produce and use similar desired surface configurations, e.g., for bio implant and cell growth applications; which in one aspect, these materials can be used as long as a coating of Ti and Ti oxide, Zr, Hf.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0349"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A-32B</figref> illustrates titanium nanotubes formed by electrolytic anodization, showing the anodization voltage dependence of TiO.sub.2 nanotube diameter. It is seen that anodization of Ti is generally difficult to provide a large diameter pores or nanotubes with a limited range of fabricated TiO.sub.2 nanotube diameter to less than approximately 100-150 nm (inside diameter). In some aspects, this dimension of approximately 100-150 nm is often not large enough to incorporate biological agents and biomolecules, and is also not large enough for a substantial portion of cells (typically many micrometers in size) to go into the pore and form a locked-in structure, although a portion of the filopodia branches can get into the pore and improve cell adhesion and cell growth kinetics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0351" num="0350">In some aspects, to obtain a larger pore or nanotube diameter (or a larger average pore entrance dimension), a patterned and guided pore formation, e.g., various lithographical means, is desirable as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. A proper combination of isotropic and anisotropic etching process can be incorporated to form such structures. In some aspects, the process can create a “micro-nano dual pore structure” of e.g., in the desired range of about 0.5-1,000.mu.m in average diameter, or about 1-100.mu.m diameter range, using the guided patterning, the pore surface of which is again covered by e.g., very fine approximately 100 nm diameter regime TiO.sub.2 nanotubes through additional processing of anodization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0352" num="0351">The dual structure, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35A-C</figref> as higher magnification illustrations of the exemplary <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> structures show the details of the titanium oxide nanotubes formed on the top and pore surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0353" num="0352">In some aspects, such a dual structure is desirable for three purposes of: i) allowing an increased portion of cells into the pores, or for propagating cells micrometers in size to go into the pores, resulting in enhanced adhesion and accelerated cell growth, ii) enhanced mechanical stability of grown bone lock-in against tensile or shear stress, and/or, iii) easier insertion/storage of biological agents and biomolecules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0354" num="0353">The biological agents that can be stored/trapped in exemplary nanostructures include growth factors, collagens, various proteins/biomolecules, genes, DNAs, antibiotics, drugs such as cancer drugs or diabetes drugs, functional particles like magnetic, metallic, ceramic, polymer particles for hyperthermia or magnetic hyperthermia treatment of tumors, with the particles optionally conjugated with other molecules for drug delivery, accelerated cell/bone growth, therapeutic treatments, etc. Cell growth inhibiting drugs can also be inserted in nanopores or nanotubes of the invention, for example, on the surface of stents to minimize restenosis or on the surface of other implants (e.g., drug delivery modules) to prevent/minimize scar tissue formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0355" num="0354">In some aspects, making the dual structured nanopore structure of the exemplary <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 to 35</figref>, comprises a guided synthesis of “enlarged-diameter nanotubes and nanopores” with essentially vertically aligned configuration of between about 30, 35, 40 or 45 degrees to about 90 degrees angle relative to the surface. Aligned nanopores or nanotubes with a diameter (or equivalent size) of greater than approximately 150 nm or more is difficult to fabricate with currently known methods. In some aspects, such desired “enlarged-diameter nanotubes and nanopores” can be fabricated by pre-patterning with an array of small craters, e.g., on the order of the diameter of the intended final pore/nanotube diameter first formed on the implant or bio-substrate surface, e.g., by lithography and other approaches as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0356" num="0355">The lithographic patterning of craters can be carried out by photolithography (including UV, deep UV and extreme UV lithography, laser interference lithography, etc.), e-beam or ion beam lithography, nano imprint lithography, and various other known techniques (see also discussion, above). In some aspects, once the pre-patterned craters are formed with a desirable size, location and periodicity, the implant or bio-substrate can be subjected to the chemical, electrochemical or ion etching to form desired larger-diameter aligned pores or nanotubes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0357" num="0356">Exemplary structures of the enlarged-diameter nanotubes and nanopores are schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. The desired range of average diameter for the enlarged and guided nanopores and nanotubes is at least approximately 150 nm, or about at least 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 or 500 or more nm. In some aspects, for the sake of desired large surface area for accelerated cell and bio reactions, the desired diameter of the enlarged nanopores and nanotubes is kept below 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.mu.m; unless, in one aspect, a dual micro-nano structure of the invention is introduced to make all exposed surfaces of the enlarged pores or nanotubes covered with yet finer TiO.sub.2 nano nanotubes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0358" num="0357">Described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 to 40</figref> are various exemplary techniques for obtaining enlarged-diameter nanotube and nanopore structures. Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is an exemplary lithographic patterning approach for crater array fabrication, while <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A-37C</figref> schematically illustrates an exemplary process of using nano imprinting to pre-pattern craters on Ti or TiO.sub.2 surface for guided synthesis of larger diameter TiO.sub.2 nanotubes and nanopores. Such nano imprint lithography technique is convenient for mass production of a large number of implants or bio substrates as simple stamping operation can accomplish the pre-patterning of craters without resorting to complicated and often costly photolithography or e-beam lithography patterning of each part. In some aspects, another major advantage is the ability to use elastomeric stamp with compliance, which allows reliable stamping on large-area, nominally-flat surfaces of Ti or other biocompatible substrates and implants in which the flatness is not always guaranteed to ensure reliable stamping over a large sample area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0358">In some aspects, the bio implant parts are more often than not in a non-flat surface geometry. Therefore it is desirable to have a convenient and effective means of fabricating the pre-patterned craters for guided introduction of enlarged-diameter nanopores or nanotubes, e.g., on the surface of Ti implants. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A-38B</figref> illustrates exemplary processes of guided etch nano patterning of identical patterns on non-flat surfaces using <b>38</b>A conformable or stretchable elastomeric mask sheet, <b>38</b>B elastomeric roll stamping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0360" num="0359">In some aspects, a technique of forming such a desired uniform nanopore or nanotube array on non-flat surface comprises introducing guided etching using a vertically two-phase decomposable coating as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A-39F</figref>. Here, a non-flat substrate or implant (e.g., bent Ti wire) is coated with a material which is then decomposed into a vertically aligned two-phase structure (e.g., decomposable diblock copolymer layer heated to decompose into two phases, a spinodal alloy coating heated to decompose into two phases, etc.) as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A-B</figref>. The two phase structure is then differentially etched, e.g., by chemical etching or ion etching to exhibit a nanopored structure as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39C</figref>. The base non-flat substrate or implant material is etched through the nanopores in the coating layer to create an array of craters (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39D</figref>). The coating layer material is then etched away (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39E</figref>) and the substrate is subjected to anodization or chemical etch to introduce deeper nanopores or nanotubes on the implant surface (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39F</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0361" num="0360">In some aspects, diblock copolymers are made up of two chemically different polymer chains or blocks while they are joined by a covalent bond. Because of this connectivity constraint yet chemical incompatibility with each other, the diblock copolymers tend to phase separate and self-assemble into an ordered (often with a hexagonal geometry), nanoscale, mixed-phase composites. Depending on the chemistry and decomposition conditions, they can form an ordered array with one of the polymer components taking a nano-cylinder shape embedded in the other polymer component. Examples of diblock copolymers include a mixture of polystyrene-polybutadiene and that of polystyrene-polyisoprene. The diblock copolymers are diluted with a solvent such as toluene, and can be dip coated, brush coated or spray coated on a substrate. When the heat is applied and drying proceeds and the copolymer concentration and temperature reaches a critical point, the phase decomposition of the diblock copolymer into an ordered structure takes place. The desired temperature rise to nucleate and grow the ordered decomposed diblock copolymer structure is typically in the range of between about 50.degree. C. to 35.degree. C., or between about 100.degree. C. to 250.degree. C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0362" num="0361">In some aspects, the spinodal alloys can be spontaneously decomposed into a uniform two phase structure by heating to a high temperature within the spinodal range. Fe—Cr—Co, Al—Ni—Co—Fe, Cu—Ni—Fe, Cu—Ni—Co, and Al—Si alloys are well known examples of spinodal alloys. Due to the difference in chemical etchability between the two decomposed phases, a nanoporous structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39C</figref> can be obtained.</div>

The size-controlled, uniform nanopore or nanotube array can be formed on various exemplary surfaces by guided etching, i.e., on a flat surface (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref>), on a coarse-patterned surface (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40B</figref>), on parallel Ti sheet or wire array (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40C</figref>) which can be useful for three-dimensional cell or organ structure, on wire mesh, wire bundle or scaffold type highly porous metal foam (e.g., made of Ti or its alloy) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40D</figref>), and on re-entrant cavity surface (e.g., pre-shaped Ti or Ti-coated Si) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40E</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0364" num="0363">In some aspects, the 3-D cultured cells are prepared using parallel Ti sheet, wire array or foam arrays with nanopore or nanotube array surface structure, e.g., see the exemplary structures in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40C</figref> and D, these can be useful for a variety of applications including in vivo implanting of cells or organs. A patient can be supplied with in vitro cultured and in vivo implanted, three-dimensional functional cells such as liver, kidney, or blood vessel cells or organs. Three-dimensionally cultured bones or tissues can also be utilized as dental, periodontal or orthopaedic body implants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0365" num="0364">In some aspects, to obtain relatively large surface area for cell growth, the desired thickness of the titanium metal ribbon, or the desired diameter of the metal wire or foam in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40C</figref> or (d) is in the range of about 10.mu.m-50,000.mu.m, or about 25 to 2,500.mu.m. In some aspects, the desired volume fraction of the metal for the given targeted cell volume at the end of the planned cell culture period is at least 10% in volume, or at least 30% in volume. In some aspects, each of the ribbon surfaces is made to contain an aligned nanopore or nanotube array; in some aspects, with a diameter being in the range of about 10-1000 nm, or about 30-300 nm, or about 60 to 200 nm in diameter; in some aspects, the desired height being in the range of about 40 to 2000 nm, or about 100-400 nm; in some aspects, the desired angle is vertical with an allowance of about 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 degrees variation off the perpendicular axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0366" num="0365">In some aspects, the shape of these nanostructure-surface ribbons is straight so that the metal arrays can be optionally pulled out after desired volume of the cells are cultured. In some aspects, the cultured growth will continue after the metal wire or ribbon array template structure is pulled out, and any minor surface damage or the thin empty gap created by the vacated template will be repaired/filled by growing cells. In some aspects, such a three-dimensionally cultured cell volume in an accelerated manner can be useful for a variety of applications including creation of a partial or full artificial organs of e.g., liver, kidney, bone, periodontal tissue, blood vessel cells, skin cells, stem cells, and other human or animal organ cells etc. In some aspects, the 3-D cultured cells, according to the invention, can be in any orientation, i.e., horizontal, vertical or upside down depending on specific needs especially in the in vivo culture environment, for example, in the case of organ implants in human, animal, or xenotransplantation of human organs which are temporarily cultured in animals prior to human implantation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0367" num="0366">In some aspects, biological agents or functional nanoparticles can additionally be stored in the surface nanopores or nanotubes on these various shaped substrates or implants. The functional nanoparticles include magnetic particles, novel metal or SPR (surface plasmon resonance) based photoluminescent particles, quantum dots, fluorescence particles, bio-conjugated particles, which are added for the purpose of accelerated cell/bone growth, protein harvest (as a result of accelerated cell growth, proliferation, and secretion), delivery of drugs, genes, chemicals, therapeutics, etc.</div>

In some aspects, nanopore or nanotube structures described in relation to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A to 43D</figref> can be utilized for these biomedical device applications. Examples shown include orthopaedic and dental implants, cell or organ implants, drug delivery devices such as controlled release of insulin by magnetic actuation, artificial liver devices, drug-protected stents (e.g., to prevent/minimize restenosis) or other tubules inserted into blood vessels and in various other body parts, and therapeutic devices such as magnetic field induced local heating for cancer treatment.

Remote magnetic field such as approximately 100 KHz AC magnetic field can be utilized to activate the drug release by preferential heating of the magnetic nanoparticles stored in the nanopores of implants, thus allowing temperature-gradient-induced drug movement from the nanopores into the human body. Suitable magnetic nanoparticles for such use include biocompatible iron-oxide particles of magnetite (Fe.sub.3O.sub.4) or maghemite (.gamma.-Fe.sub.2O.sub.3) in the particle size regime of about 5 to 50 m in average diameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0374" num="0373">In some aspects, a mechanical agitation and induced movement of the magnetic particles themselves in the pores containing the stored drugs can be utilized as an alternative mechanism of drug release. In this case, a rather lower frequency AC magnetic field actuation with a gradient magnetic field is preferred in order to allow movement of magnetic particles against the viscosity of the fluid in the nanopores. In some aspects, a desired frequency range is approximately 1-10,000 Hz, or between about 10-1,000 Hz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0375" num="0374">In these exemplary approaches, the drugs are released any time of the day only when desired, and can be turned off completely when it is no longer needed, so the side effects of drugs are minimized. In some aspects, similar magnetic particle and external field combination can also be utilized for cancer treatment, for example, through an implant devices containing the nanoporous structure (e.g., entrance-diameter-reduced nanopores or nanotubes) placed in the vicinity of cancerous regions, for example, in the liver containing inoperable distribution of recurring/growing cancer cells. In some aspects, repeated hyperthermia treatments, e.g., over many months, are used, e.g., by on-off type continual activation of external magnetic field can gradually kill the cancer cells near the cancerous regions.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0377" num="0376">One method of harvesting the grown cells off the biomaterial substrate is to use a process known as “trypsinization”. Once cells are grown completely on whole surface of cell culture flask, the media fluid is removed by suction. After rinsing of the cells twice with PBS (phosphate buffer solution), trypsin is added to detach the cell from the surface. In general, approximately 2-3 ml of trypsin is used for detaching cells grown on 10 cm.sup.2 cell culture dish. After a few minutes, most of the cells are detached from the surface, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>. After adding approximately 10 ml of new medium, this fluid containing the detached stem cells is poured into a centrifuge tube. After centrifugation at appropriate rotation speed and time, all of the cells are separated. The medium is removed by suction, and approximately 1 ml of new media is added for storage of the harvested cells or for additional culture. To estimate the number of proliferated cells, trypan blue assay are employed in conjunction with hematocytometry. The cells can also be in situ proliferated on the implant surfaces as the TiO.sub.2 as well as Ti substrate are biocompatible.</div>

In one aspect, nanotube or nanopore structures of the invention comprise vertically or parallel-aligned nanostructure arrays; and they can have structural advantages for reduced interfacial failure. In one aspect, a vertically or parallel-aligned nanopore or nanotube array is fabricated to be thin, e.g., less than 3000 nm, 2000 nm, 1500 nm, 1000 nm, 500 nm, 400 nm, 300 nm, 200 nm, or less than 100 nm.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0413" num="0412">Referring to the drawings, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A-46E</figref> schematically illustrates exemplary configurations of a size-randomized nanopore structure of biocompatible materials such as Ti or TiO.sub.2, with the size and shape of the entrance of the pores having a distribution of dimensions as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46C-E</figref>, as compared to the uniform sized nanopores <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A and 46B</figref>. Such a distribution in size and shape of the nanopores or nanotubes can help achieving enhanced adhesion and accelerated growth of various size and shape cells simultaneously, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46E</figref>. Such size-randomized nanopore or nanotube biomaterial (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46C-E</figref>) can be fabricated, according to the invention, by using various mask-guided chemical etching fabrication or thin film deposition approaches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0414" num="0413">In one aspect, the pre-patterned, e.g., random patterned, masks (to generate pre-patterned, e.g., random patterned, pores or nanoreservoirs) are prepared by lithographic patterning of craters, e.g., by photolithography (see. e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,030,266; 5,759,744; 6,946,390), UV or deep UV and extreme UV lithography (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,014,961), laser interference lithography (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,726,524), e-beam lithography (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,956,333), imprint lithography (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,027,156; 6,842,229), particle multibeam lithography (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,989,546) or ion beam lithography (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,949,756; 6,414,307; 6,303,932 6,924,493), nano imprint lithography, and various other known techniques, or by coated-layer decomposition approach as will be described later in this specification. The random patterned masks also can be prepared by techniques such as sol-gel method (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,014,961): photolithographic patterning of a photoresist layer by pattern-wise exposure to short-wavelength ultraviolet light through a pattern-bearing photomass, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,593,034; electrophoretic deposition and anodization. See, e.g., Lakshmi, et al. (1997) Chemistry of Materials, 9:2544-2550; Miao, et al. (2002) Nano Letters 2:717-720; Gong. et al. (2001) J. Materials Res. 16:3331-3334; Macak (2005) Chem. Int. Ed., 44:7463-7465.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0415" num="0414">Once the pre-patterned (including “random patterned”) craters are formed with a desirable size, location and distribution, the implant or bio-substrate can be subjected to the chemical, electrochemical or ion etching to form desired size-randomized nanotube, nanopore or nano-reservoir structures, e.g., with aligned nanopores, nano-reservoirs or nanotubes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0416" num="0415">Titanium nanotubes, nano-reservoirs or nanopores of the invention also can be formed by electrolytic anodization, for example using 5% hydrofluoric acid and applying approximately 10 to 20 volts of potential, and allowing several minutes to a few hours depending on the temperature and other electrochemical process parameters. It is known that the resultant TiO.sub.2 nanotube diameter is dependent on the anodization voltage. The dimension of approximately 100 to 150 nm is often not large enough to incorporate biological agents and biomolecules, and is also not large enough for a substantial portion of cells (typically many micrometers in size) to go into the pore and form a locked-in structure, although a portion of the filopodia branches can get into the pore and improve cell adhesion and cell growth kinetics; thus, in one aspect, the structures of the invention include pores or tubes larger than 100 to 150 nm. From this point of view, in one aspect, the size-randomized nanopore or nanotube structures of the invention offer an advantage in that a substantial portion of the pores can be made larger than approximately 150 nm, as many of the processes of the invention, including lithographically defined masks, semi-wettable balled-up island masks or nanoparticle masks, mask-island-guided or mask-hole-guided etching or anodization, can generate compositions having all or a portion of their nanostructures (e.g., nanopores, nano-reservoirs or nanotubes) larger than 150 nm. In alternative aspects, larger-diameter-containing nano-reservoir-, nanotube- or nanopore-comprising structures have diameters greater than approximately 150 nm, 175 nm, 200 nm, 250 nm or 300 nm or more, in at least 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% more of the total surface area fraction, or up to at least 90% or more of the total surface area fraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0417" num="0416">Exemplary material that can be processed into desired size-randomized or size-designed nano-reservoir-, nanotube- or nanopore-comprising structures include alloys containing Ti with at least 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% more weight %. TiO.sub.2 can also be utilized. Other related materials such as Zr, Hf. Nb, Ta, Mo, W, and their oxides, or alloys of these metals and oxides by at least about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% or more weight % can be used. Other materials such as Si, Si oxide, carbon, diamond, noble metals (such as Au, Ag, Pt and their alloys), polymer or plastic materials, or composite metals, ceramics or polymers can also be utilized to produce and use similar desired surface configurations, e.g., for the bio implant and cell growth applications of this invention; where in one aspect, these materials are used as long as a coating of Ti and Ti oxide, Zr, Hf. Nb, Ta, Mo, W and their oxides, as well as their alloys, with a thickness of at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 or more nm and the coating coverage of at least 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 60%, 70% or 80% more of the total surfaces is provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0418" num="0417">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47A</figref> is an exemplary method of fabricating size-randomized nanopores or nanotubes on non-flat surface such as Ti wire, mesh, or foam, or on a flat surface such as on a Ti plate or sheet, by using semi-wettable or island-forming coating as a local mask. The coating illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47B</figref> can be either a polymer-based material, metal or alloy based material, or a salt based material. A thin coating of polymer can be deposited by a number of well known techniques such as dip coating, spray coating, brush coating, evaporation, chemical vapor deposition, or spin coating (if the object has flat surfaces). The polymer coated object can be either dried to remove the solvent or water or heated to alter the wetting characteristics in such a way that the continuous coating is broken up into islands, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47C</figref>. The metal or alloy based material can be deposited by sputtering, electroplating, evaporation, chemical vapor deposition, or plasma spray. For a non-flat object, rotation of the object during physical vapor deposition id desired to make sure that most of the surfaces are covered by the deposited material. The metal coated object is then heated to a relatively high temperature of e.g., 300-900 degree. C. to make the metal ball up into islands to reduce the overall free energy. The metal or alloy coating material should be selected in such a way that the degree of alloying with the base metal is minimal so that extensive wetting does not occur. The salt based material can be either a aqueous solution or solvent solution, optionally mixed with viscosity enhancer such as polyvinyl alcohol, can be applied by dip coating or spray coating, brush painting, and heated to form island masks. The salt based coating material can also be applied by evaporation or sputtering, followed by heating to decompose the salt and form mask islands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0419" num="0418">The desired thickness of the coating applied depends on the desired size of the islands (masks) since a thinner coating results in smaller diameter islands. The degree of wettability of the coating material on the object also determines the resultant size of the islands. The desired thickness of the coating is typically in the range of anywhere between about 2-2000 nm, or about 5-200 nm.</div>

However, this exemplary chemical or electrochemical etching is carried out through the TiO.sub.2 except the island-covered regions to form craters, which is then followed by chemical etching or anodization to form size-randomized nanopores or nanotubes as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B-D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0421" num="0420">Alternatively, a polymer-containing or an aqueous solution containing nano particles of coating material (polymer, metal or salt) can be applied on the object by dip coating or spray coating, and then heated to decompose and form islands of masks as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49A-C</figref>. Either chemical etching or anodization through mask islands, or formation of Ti-oxide coating except the mask islands followed by chemical etching or anodization can be utilized to obtain the desired nanopore or nanotube array structure as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49D</figref>.</div>

One exemplary method of harvesting the grown cells off the biomaterial substrate is to use a process known as “trypsinization”. Once cells are grown completely on whole surface of cell culture flask, the media fluid is removed by suction. After rinsing of the cells twice with PBS (phosphate buffer solution), trypsin is added to detach the cell from the surface. In general, approximately 2-3 ml of trypsin is used for detaching cells grown on 10 cm.sup.2 cell culture dish.
