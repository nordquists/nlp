<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node (e.g., a transmission station) and a wireless device (e.g., a mobile device). Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) in a downlink (DL) transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) in an uplink (UL) transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standard (e.g., 802.16e, 802.16m), which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access), and the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In 3GPP radio access network (RAN) LTE systems, the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) Node Bs (also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs, enhanced Node Bs, eNodeBs, or eNBs) and Radio Network Controllers (RNCs), which communicates with the wireless device, known as a user equipment (UE). The downlink (DL) transmission can be a communication from the node (e.g., eNodeB) to the wireless device (e.g., UE), and the uplink (UL) transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The wireless device can be used receive multimedia delivery of Internet video using various protocols, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) streaming. A protocol to provide HTTP-based delivery of video streaming can include dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0005" num="0000">Example Embodiments</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The growth of multimedia services, including streaming and conversational services, is one of the drivers of the evolution to new mobile broadband technologies and standards. With a high consumer demand for multimedia services coupled with developments in media compression and wireless network infrastructures, enhancing the multimedia service capabilities of cellular and mobile broadband systems is desirable, where the multimedia service capabilities can be used to deliver a high quality of experience (QoE) to the consumers ensuring ubiquitous access to video content and services from any location, at any time, with any device and technology. Supporting various mobile devices and providing media handling procedures and session management protocols optimized for various device classes and capabilities can be used to enable delivery of multimedia content with high QoE in a ubiquitous fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">With the introduction of orientation sensors in mobile devices used in real-time video communication, the display content can be rotated to be aligned with the device orientation. In example, the orientation sensor can detect the device orientation by measuring the gravity field. Other types of orientation sensors may also be used. The device orientation can then be used in applications to adjust device functions according to orientation. For instance, the device can rotate the user interface or video orientation to either a portrait or landscape mode based on device orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Because some client devices contain an orientation sensor, the content or service provider may provide different encoded versions of the content optimized for different device orientations or the content/service provider may capture or transcode the content during content capture (e.g., on-the-fly) in order to deliver an optimized experience. Signaling from the user equipment (UE) to the network of the orientation sensor capabilities and/or the current device orientation can provide opportunities to adapt the content on the network side to deliver a high quality client experience. Multimedia adaptation based device and/or video orientation adaptation can apply to both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) video applications. For a 2D video example, portrait or landscape video views and/or different viewing angles may be adapted based on device orientation. For a 3D video example, the different viewing angles and depth information may be adapted based on device orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Capability exchange signaling can be an important functionality in third generation partnership project's (3GPP's) packet switched streaming service (PSS) (as described in 3GPP technical specification (TS) 26.234 V11.1.0 (2012-09)), dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) (as described in 3GPP technical specification (TS) 26.247 V11.0.0 (2012-09)), and integrated multimedia subsystem (IMS) based PSS and multimedia broadcast and multicast service (MBMS) (abbreviated as IMS_PSS_MBMS, as described in 3GPP technical specification (TS) 26.237 V11.0.0 (2012-06)). Capability exchange enables PSS, DASH, and IMS_PSS_MBMS servers to provide a wide range of devices with content suitable for the particular device in question. To facilitate server-side content negotiation for streaming, the PSS or IMS_PSS_MBMS server may have access to a description of the specific capabilities of the mobile terminal (MT) via a device capability description. The device capability description can contain a number of attributes. For DASH, the attributes of device capability signaling can include the following parameters: A pre-decoder buffer size, an initial buffering period, a decoder capability, display properties (e.g., screen size, resolution, or bit depth), a streaming method (e.g., real-time streaming protocol (RTSP) or HTTP) adaptation support, QoE support, extended real-time transport protocol (RTP) control protocol (RTCP) reporting support, and fast content switching support, as well as supported RTP profiles and session description protocol (SDP) attributes. During the set-up of a streaming session, a server can use the description to provide the mobile terminal with a correct type of multimedia content. The servers can use information about the capabilities of the mobile terminal to determine which stream to provision to the connecting terminal. For instance, the server can compare the requirements on the mobile terminal for multiple available variants of a stream with the actual capabilities of the connecting terminal to determine a best-suited stream for that particular mobile terminal. Capability exchange also allows for delivery an optimized session description protocol (SDP) file to a client terminal (e.g., mobile terminal) for a PSS or IMS_PSS_MBMS session or an optimized media presentation description (MPD) metadata file to the client terminal for a DASH session.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates can example of how capability exchange can be performed for PSS services. In a simplest illustration, the mobile terminal <b>110</b> (or client device or client terminal) can informs the PSS server <b>130</b> about the MT's identity so that the PSS server can retrieve a device capability profile from a device profile server <b>120</b>, which can store the device capability profile <b>122</b> for the mobile terminal. The MT can send a HTTP and/or RTSP request to the PSS server <b>170</b>. The HTTP and/or RTSP request can include a uniform resource locator (URL) descriptor (URLdesc) and/or a profile difference (profileDiff) header. The PSS server can send a HTTP request to the device profile server for a device capability profile for the MT <b>160</b>. The device profile server can send a HTTP response to the PSS server with device capability profile for the MT <b>162</b>. The PSS server can match or copy the device capability profile <b>132</b>. The PSS server can send HTTP and/or RTSP replies <b>172</b> and multimedia content <b>174</b> to the MT based on the device capability profile for the MT. In an example, a terminal manufacturer or a software vendor can maintain a device profile server to provide device capability profiles for the manufacturer or vendor's products. In another example, an operator can manage a device profile server for the operator's subscribers, which can allow the subscriber to make user specific updates to the subscribers profiles. The device profile server can provide device capability profiles to the PSS server on request. In certain scenarios, the mobile terminal may supplement the identity signaling with extra attributes or overrides for attributes already defined in the MT's device capability profile, which can be referred to as Profdiff (ProfDiff or profileDiff). The Profdiff can temporarily allow for adjusting the attributes of the device capability profile. In an example, such a temporary adjustment may be triggered by user preferences (e.g., if the user for a particular session likes to receive mono sound even though the mobile terminal is capable of stereo).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">A user agent profile (UAProf) specification can provide protocols for capturing capability and preference information for wireless devices. This capability and preference information can be used by content providers to produce content in an appropriate format for the specific device. The UAProf can be related to the composite capabilities/preference profiles (CC/PP) specification created by the World Wide Web (WWW) consortium. A device capability profile can be a resource description framework (RDF) document that follows the structure of an CC/PP framework and an CC/PP application UAProf Attributes can be used to specify device capabilities and preferences. A set of attribute names, permissible values, and semantics can constitute a CC/PP vocabulary, which can be defined by an RDF schema. For PSS and IMS_PSS_MBMS services, the UAProf vocabulary can be reused and an additional service-specific vocabulary can be defined. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides an example device capability profile for the PSS and IMS_PSS_MBMS services, which can define various CC/PP components (ccpp:component), such as TerminalHardware, PSSCommon, Streaming, ThreeGPFileFormat (3GP), or PssSmil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The technology (e.g., servers, client devices or terminal, mobile terminals, methods, computer circuitry, and systems) as described herein can provide multimedia adaptation based on the device capability exchange signaling of orientation sensor capabilities of the mobile terminal or client device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In an example, at least two-step of a process can be performed. For instance, the client device can signal to the server about whether the client device has an orientation sensor and what video orientation (e.g., page orientation) states the client device supports (e.g., portrait, landscape, or seascape) (see <b>280</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>). Video orientation can be a new set of device capability attributes for the PSS vocabulary, which can be applicable to IMS_PSS_MBMS and DASH sessions. The device capability attributes on the device orientation capabilities of the client device (e.g., UE) can include a list of device orientation positions that provides an indication of video display device orientation modes, video capture device orientation modes, video display device orientation angles, video capture device orientation angles, a boolean-valued indicator having values indicating whether the UE is responsive to changes in orientation, default device orientation for rendering and display, default device orientation for capture, number of equally-spaced angular granularity levels in a 90 degree interval at which the orientation sensor is configured to detect orientation changes during both video capture and display, number of cameras associated with the UE, or horizontal mirroring support. In addition, the client device may also signal the current device orientation via ProfDiff signaling by temporarily overriding the default device orientation attribute, which can be another attribute added to the device capability exchange signaling vocabulary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In another step, the server can consider the orientation sensor support signal from the client device and provide different encoded versions of the content in formats best suited for the different possible device orientations (see <b>284</b> and <b>286</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>; or <b>294</b> and <b>286</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). At the session management level, access to the device orientation information and/or orientation capabilities of the client can also allow the server to deliver an optimized session description protocol (SDP) for RTSP/RTP streaming in a PSS or IMS_PSS_MBMS session or an optimized media presentation description (MPD) for dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) in a DASH session. Moreover, if the server also controls the capture processes for the content production and/or preparation, the server can instruct a camera unit (e.g., another client device) to capture and compress multiple copies of the same content best suited for the different possible device orientations (see <b>282</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>). The server may also dynamically perform transcoding and/or format conversions on-the-fly in order to best match the content to the orientation capabilities of the client device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The technology described herein can be applied for both 2D and 3D video applications. Different streaming paradigms (e.g., PSS, DASH, and IMS_PSS_MBMS), can use different multimedia adaptation methods and processes, which is explained in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">A service can use a pull-based streaming process or a push-based streaming process. DASH provides an example of pull-based streaming. For a DASH session, a HTTP server <b>230</b> provides the content optimized for different device orientations to a DASH client <b>220</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The HTTP server may use the device capability exchange signaling from the DASH client describing the various supported device orientation states <b>240</b>. The device capability signaling from the DASH client may also include a default device orientation attribute, indicating the device orientation in the absence of any further signaling from the DASH client. The set of device orientations and corresponding content information can be signaled to the DASH client in the media presentation description (MPD) metadata file <b>242</b> with different encoded content for different device orientations, which server-client interaction is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The DASH client player can then track the current device orientation and request the corresponding versions of the content optimized for the current device orientation. Moreover, when retrieving an MPD with HTTP, the DASH client may include device orientation information in a GET request, including any temporary adjustments to the device orientation based on ProfDiff (e.g., current device orientation may be different from the default device orientation). Using this DASH device capability exchange signaling process, the HTTP server can deliver an optimized MPD to the DASH client (e.g., UE).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The PSS services based on the real-time streaming protocol (RTSP) and the IMS_PSS_MBMS service based on the session initiation protocol (SIP) provide examples of push-based streaming. For the PSS or IMS_PSS_MBMS service, the server <b>232</b> can receive the current device orientation information <b>244</b> from the client <b>222</b> and adapt the content based on device orientation, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For instance, the server can select a most suited content version among stored content versions or dynamically transcodes the content based on the current device orientation and stream the content to the client <b>246</b>, which server-client interaction is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The session-related metadata carried in the session description protocol (SDP) may carry the device orientation information for the streamed content.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In the PSS service, the client can send the device orientation information in a RTSP DESCRIBE message to the server. The RTSP DESCRIBE message may also include a default device orientation attribute, indicating the device orientation in the absence of any further signaling from the client. If the current device orientation is different from the default device orientation, this difference may be signaled as a temporary adjustment based on ProfDiff signaling. In an example, PSS content servers supporting capability exchange can also receive device orientation information from the client in the HTTP and RTSP requests.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In the IMS_PSS_MBMS service, the client (e.g., UE <b>250</b>) can send device orientation information in a SIP SUBSCRIBE message <b>260</b> to an Internet protocol (IP) multimedia (IM) core network (CN) subsystem (IM CN subsystem) <b>252</b> during service discovery, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which can then forward the SIP SUBSCRIBE message <b>262</b> to a service discovery function (SDF) <b>254</b>. The SIP SUBSCRIBE message can also include a default device orientation attribute, indicating the device orientation in the absence of any further signaling from the client. The SDF can determine proper service discovery information (e.g., according to the UE capabilities or the user's profile (e.g., personalized service discovery)). The SDF can acknowledge the SIP SUBSCRIBE message to the IM CN subsystem via a SIP 200 OK message <b>264</b>, and the IM CN subsystem can forward the SIP 200 OK message <b>266</b> to the UE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The SDF <b>254</b> can generate and/or provide the service attachment information and/or provide personalized service discovery. The IM CN subsystem <b>252</b> can support, user registration and authentication, mobility and roaming, control of multimedia sessions, quality of service (QoS) control, policy control, charging, and interworking with circuit switched systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The SDF <b>254</b> can send a SIP NOTIFY message <b>268</b> to the UE <b>250</b> with service discovery information to the IM CN subsystem <b>252</b>, which relays the SIP NOTIFY message <b>270</b> back to the UE. The UE can acknowledge the SIP NOTIFY message to the IM CN subsystem via a SIP 200 OK message <b>272</b>, and the IM CN subsystem can forward the SIP 200 OK message <b>274</b> to the SDF. In an example, using the SDF and IM CN subsystem framework can enable optimized service discovery utilizing the device orientation information in PSS and MBMS user services. Later in an IMS session, the UE may also use SIP signaling to indicate updates including any temporary adjustments to the device orientation based on ProfDiff (e.g., if the current device orientation is different from the default device orientation), which can be performed by refreshing a subscription through further SIP SUBSCRIBE messages. The SIP SUBSCRIBE messages can include information on the updates to the device orientation information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">New attributes can be added in PSS vocabulary device capability exchange signaling. For instance, attributes “Orientation” and “DefaultOrientation” (or attributes with similar functionality) can be included in the PSSCommon component of the PSS base vocabulary in TS 26.234. The attributes can have a name, definitions, an associated component, a type, legal values (or valid options), and a resolution rule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In an example, a context for “Orientation” and “DefaultOrientation” can be define as follows:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The technology described provides streaming or download of content with oriented video components. Device orientation-aware multimedia adaptations provide streaming or download of previously captured and uploaded content with oriented video components. For example, as part of a PSS download or MBMS download application, the server may push captured content with oriented video components to the client in a non-real time fashion for later playback. Or as part of a DASH-based streaming service, an HTTP server may deliver user-generated content (UGC) to DASH clients that may contain oriented video components. For a RTP-based streaming of UGC content may be delivered from PSS servers. In these contexts, the server may receive information on the video orientation capabilities supported by the client device and determine an optimal delivery strategy (e.g., select the most suited content version among various stored content versions and/or dynamically transcode the content) based on the video orientation capabilities of the terminal and deliver the optimally chosen content to the client.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, if the server determines that the content was captured by an orientation-aware terminal (e.g., through the inspection of the 3GP-based content file), while the receiving client device is not orientation-aware (e.g., known based on PSS device capability signaling mechanisms), the server may process (e.g., apply transcoding to) the content to correct and avoid misalignment problems during later rendering and display. If the receiving client device is orientation-aware, then the server may not have to correct the misalignment, but instead can choose to send the content “as is” along with video orientation information embedded in the content (e.g., in an RTP extension header for RTP streaming or inside a 3GP file for HTTP streaming and DASH) so that the receiving client device can correct the misalignment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example server-client interaction realizing orientation-aware media delivery based on reception of content with embedded video orientation information. For example, a capturing client <b>224</b> can capture video orientation information with the capture and upload the content (e.g., 3GP file) with embedded video orientation information <b>282</b> to the server <b>232</b>. In another example, a rendering client <b>226</b> can signal a device profile to the server with video orientation capability information <b>280</b>. The server can perform orientation-processing to correct potential misalignment at the rendering client <b>284</b>, as previously described. The server can then deliver adapted content to the rendering client as part of a streaming or download service <b>286</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The technology described herein can also embed video orientation information into the captured content, such as a 3GP file. Embedding video orientation information in a 3GP file (as described in 3GPP technical specification (TS) 26.244 V11.1.0 (2012-09); e.g., mp4 file <b>314</b> in a moving picture experts group-4 (MPEG-4) file format <b>312</b>) as an instantiation of an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Base Media File Format (BMFF) <b>310</b> for later use by servers as part of streaming and download applications can be beneficial, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The inclusion of such video orientation information in the 3GP file can better enable the server to perform orientation-aware multimedia adaptation for optimizing content delivery to devices (e.g., correcting the video to avoid misalignment problems prior to sending to an orientation-unaware device). The embedded video orientation information can be provided in device orientation capability attributes in the PSS vocabulary and device capability signaling framework. The content file (e.g., mp4 file <b>314</b>) can include an initialization segment, such as a “moov” box <b>316</b>, and media data (mdat <b>318</b>). The moov box can include initial object descriptor (IOD) <b>320</b>, a Binary Format for Scene (BIFS) trak <b>322</b>, an object descriptor (OD) trak, a video trak <b>326</b>, and an audio trak <b>328</b>. The embedded video orientation information <b>330</b> can be included in the video trak (or track). The mdat can include Interleaved, time-ordered, BIFS, OD, video, and audio access units (AC).</div>

For example, a capturing client <b>224</b> can capture video orientation information with the capture and upload the content (e.g., 3GP file) with embedded video orientation information <b>282</b> to the server <b>232</b>. In another example, a rendering client <b>226</b> can signal a device profile to the server with video orientation capability information <b>280</b>. Server performs orientation-aware content adaptation, selection, transcoding and/or format conversations to correct potential misalignment and optimize content delivery with respect to (w.r.t.) the orientation capabilities of the rendering client <b>294</b>, as previously described. The server can then deliver adapted content to the rendering client as part of a streaming or download service <b>286</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Accordingly, in an example, the inclusion of video orientation information can be logged within a 3GP file format as a continuous recording of a series of orientation values of the images captured. A box can be defined in the ISO base media file format (ISO-BMFF) or the 3GPP file format for timed video orientation information. For instance, the video track or the RTP hint track of the 3GPP file format (3GP) may be used to embed the orientation information. For content formatted based on DASH, the video orientation information may be carried within a file-level ISO-BMFF box, such as in initialization segment (e.g., in a “moov” box for ISO-BMFF) or in media segments (e.g., in a ‘moof’ box for ISO-BMFF), as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In another example, the timed metadata track of the ISO-BMFF may be chosen as the track to contain the video orientation information. For instance, a new box can be created specifically for video orientation that extends MetaDataSampleEntry with a description of the video orientation parameters. Other boxes within the sample description box <b>350</b> in the ISO file format box structure hierarchy, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, may also be used to contain the video orientation information, which can include MP4VisualSampleEntry, AVCSampleEntry, or HintSampleEntry. The ISO file format box structure hierarchy can include a movie box <b>340</b>, a track box <b>342</b>, a media box <b>344</b>, a media information box <b>346</b>, a sample table box <b>348</b>, and the sample description box, where higher order boxes are listed first.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In another configuration, the video orientation information may support 90 degrees granularity, the flip-bit (e.g., for horizontal flip) as also supported by GSM (global system for communications, originally groupe special mobile) association's (GSMA's) rich communication services (RCS) 5.1 profile, and the camera-bit (to signal front-versus-back-facing camera) as in RCS 5.1. For example, the video orientation information (e.g., set of orientations of the captured images) may be carried as a byte formatted as follows (consistent with the adopted format in 3GPP technical specification (TS) 26.114 V11.5.0 (2012-09)):</div>
