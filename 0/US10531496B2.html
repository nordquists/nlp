<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a wireless communication system. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to an apparatus and method for transmitting and receiving system information.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of fourth generation (4G) communication systems, efforts have been made to develop an improved fifth generation (5G) or pre-5G communication system. Therefore, the 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a ‘Beyond 4G Network’ or a ‘Post long term evolution (LTE) System’. The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency (mmWave) bands, e.g., 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, the beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), full dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, an analog beam forming, large scale antenna techniques are discussed in 5G communication systems. In addition, in 5G communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud radio access networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving network, cooperative communication, coordinated multi-points (CoMP), reception-end interference cancellation and the like. In the 5G system, hybrid frequency shift key (FSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) as an advanced coding modulation (ACM), and filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) as an advanced access technology have been developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The Internet, which is a human centered connectivity network where humans generate and consume information, is now evolving to the Internet of things (IoT) where distributed entities, such as things, exchange and process information without human intervention. The Internet of everything (IoE), which is a combination of the IoT technology and the Big Data processing technology through connection with a cloud server, has emerged. As technology elements, such as “sensing technology”, “wired/wireless communication and network infrastructure”, “service interface technology”, and “Security technology” have been demanded for IoT implementation, a sensor network, a machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, machine type communication (MTC), and so forth have been recently researched. Such an IoT environment may provide intelligent Internet technology services that create a new value to human life by collecting and analyzing data generated among connected things. IoT may be applied to a variety of fields including smart home, smart building, smart city, smart car or connected cars, smart grid, health care, smart appliances and advanced medical services through convergence and combination between existing information technology (IT) and various industrial applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In line with this, various attempts have been made to apply 5G communication systems to IoT networks. For example, technologies such as a sensor network, MTC, and M2M communication may be implemented by beamforming, MIMO, and array antennas. Application of a cloud RAN as the above-described Big Data processing technology may also be considered to be as an example of convergence between the 5G technology and the IoT technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In the recent years, several broadband wireless technologies have been developed to meet the growing number of broadband subscribers and to provide more and better applications and services. The second generation wireless communication system has been developed to provide voice services while ensuring the mobility of users. Third generation wireless communication system supports not only the voice service but also data service.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, the fourth wireless communication system has been developed to provide high-speed data service. However, currently, the fourth generation wireless communication system suffers from lack of resources to meet the growing demand for high speed data services. So fifth generation wireless communication system is being developed to meet the growing demand for high speed data services, support ultra-reliability and low latency applications and support massive machine type communication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In the fourth generation wireless communication system, enhanced node B (eNB) or base station (BS) in cell broadcast system information. System information is structured into master information block (MIB) and a set of system information blocks (SIBs). MIB consists of system frame number (SFN), downlink system bandwidth and physical hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ) feedback indicator channel (PHICH) configuration. An MIB is transmitted every 40 ms. It is repeated every 10 ms wherein the first transmission occurs in subframe #0 when SFM mod 4 equals zero. MIB is transmitted on physical broadcast channel. SIB Type 1 carries cell indemnity, tracking area code, cell barring information, value tag (common for all scheduling units), and scheduling information of other SIBs. SIB 1 is transmitted every 80 ms in subframe #5 when SFN mod 8 equals zero. SIB 1 is repeated in subframe #5 when SFN mod 2 equals zero. SIB 1 is transmitted on Physical downlink shared channel. Other SIBs (SIB 2 to SIB 19) are transmitted in system information (SI) message wherein scheduling info of these SIBs are indicated in SIB 1. SIBs having same periodicity can be transmitted in one SI message. SI message is broadcasted on Physical downlink shared channel. Various SIBs, their usage and typical size is indicated in Table 1 below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">User equipment (UE) acquires the system information at cell selection, cell reselection, after handover completion, after entering evolved UMTS terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) from another radio access technology (RAT), upon re-entering service area, upon receiving a notification (paging), and upon exceeding the maximum validity duration (3 hour).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In radio resource control (RRC) idle state, UE needs to acquire MIB, SIB 1, SIB 2 to SIB 5, SIB 6 to SIB 8 (depending on RAT supported), SIB 17 (if LTE-wireless local area network (WLAN) interworking (IWK) is supported), and SIB 18 to SIB 19 (if D2D is supported). In RRC connected state, UE needs to acquire MIB, SIB 1, SIB 2, SIB 8 (depending on RAT supported), SIB 17 (if LTE-WLAN IWK is supported), and SIB 18 to SIB 19 (if D2D is supported).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">System information can be changed and is notified as follows: Change is notified through paging message (in RRC_IDLE or RRC_CONNECTED) with cause systemInfoModification to let UE know that some SI is changing in the next modification period. Modification period boundaries are in terms of SFN such that SFN mod modificationPeriod=0. Change of SI occurs at specific radio frames. Notification of changes in modification period N will be reflected in N+1. SIB 1 also carries value tag to indicate change in SI.

<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<heading id="h-0005">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">One of the issues in current method of transmitting system information using the master information block (MIB)/system information blocks (SIBs) is that MIB/SIBs are periodically broadcasted irrespective of whether a user equipment (UE) is there in cell or not; whether any UE in cell needs that information. In case of small cell deployment, broadcasting all these SIBs periodically is unnecessary and leads to significant wastage of resources and increased energy consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Next Generation communication system is considering carrier frequency ranges up to 100 GHz. At higher frequencies, beamforming is essential to compensate for path loss. One transmission beam cannot provide the full cell coverage. Multiple transmission beams are needed. In order to broadcast the system information, system information needs to be transmitted using multiple transmission beams by switching a transmission (TX) beam across multiple time slots. Overhead (time/frequency resources) of transmission of system information using beamforming is N times more than transmission of system information without beamforming where ‘N’ is the number of transmission beams. The transmission resources remaining after resources consumed for transmission of system information may be used for data scheduling for a user in the direction of the downlink (DL) transmission beam. Therefore, if more time/frequency resources are consumed for transmission system information then user data scheduling becomes restrictive and inflexible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Additionally UE has to reacquire the system information when it moves from one cell to another cell. This leads to increased power consumption for mobile UEs. So an enhanced method of signaling system information is needed.</div>

System information (SI) is categorized into two categories: The first category (also referred as minimum SI or essential SI) comprises of one or more system information which are broadcasted periodically by the cell and/or transport, routing, and packaging (TRP) information. The second category (also referred as Other SI) comprises of one or more system information which are provided on demand or can be broadcasted periodically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The first category comprises of essential system information such as information required for initial access to a cell, information required for acquiring the system information in second category. The first category of system information includes at least system frame number (SFN), list of public land mobile network (PLMN) identifications (IDs), Cell ID, cell camping parameters, etc. The second category of system information includes the system information not included in first category. The first category (also referred as minimum SI or essential SI) of system information is periodically broadcasted by the cell and/or TRP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In operation <b>110</b>, UE acquires first category (also referred as minimum SI or essential SI) from broadcasted information. Network signals in first category of system information i.e. in Minimum SI or essential SI whether the system information in the second category is periodically broadcasted or provided on demand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, in case of heterogeneous network comprises of macro cell and small cells, macro cell may indicate that system information is broadcasted whereas small cells may indicate that system information is not broadcasted. In another example, if there are several requests for system information provided on demand then network may start to broadcast the system information instead of providing on demand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Minimum SI or essential SI may include an indication which indicates that all SIs of second category of system information are periodically broadcasted or are provided on demand. Alternately, minimum SI or essential SI may include a separate indication for each SI (e.g. system information block (SIB)) or set of SIs (i.e. SIBs) wherein each indication indicates whether the associated SI or set of SIs are periodically broadcasted or are provided on demand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Alternately, minimum SI or essential SI may include a separate indication for each SI message wherein each SI message carries one or more SIs (i.e. SIBs). The indication associated with an SI message indicates whether SIs associated with that SI message are broadcasted or provided on demand. Mapping of SI message to SIBs in included in minimum SI or essential SI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In order to acquire a SI of second category, UE first determines whether that SI is periodically broadcasted or provided on demand. UE determines this based on indication included in first category (also referred as minimum SI or essential SI) of system information. If first category (also referred as minimum SI or essential SI) of system information indicates that SI which UE wants to acquire is periodically broadcasted (or not provided on demand) then UE acquires the SI from the periodic broadcast using the scheduling information included in first category (also referred as minimum SI or essential SI), in operation S<b>110</b>. If first category (also referred as minimum SI or essential SI) of system information indicates that SI which UE wants to acquire is not periodically broadcasted (or provided on demand) then UE sends request to base station (BS) to receive that SI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In order to receive one or more system information provided on demand, in operation S<b>120</b>, UE transmits random access preamble (PRACH). In an embodiment, PRACH preambles or PRACH opportunities (i.e. time/frequency resources) for requesting system information can be different from the PRACH preambles or PRACH opportunities for other purposes. This can minimize impact to random access load because of SI requests. PRACH preambles or PRACH opportunities (i.e. time/frequency resources) for obtaining system information can be predefined or signaled by network in first category (also referred as minimum SI or essential SI) of system information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">On receiving the random access preamble, in operation S<b>130</b>, BS transmits a random access response (RAR) and the RAR includes an uplink (UL) grant for transmitting the SI request message. The RAR may also include timing advance and/or back off indicator and or preamble identifier (identifies the PRACH preamble).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">UE validates that the RAR corresponds to PRACH transmitted by it. If the validation is successful, in operation S<b>140</b>, the UE transmits an SI request message in the UL grant. The SI request message indicates one or more system information (e.g. SIBs) which UE needs or indicates one or more sets of system information which the UE needs or indicates service (e.g. enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), mobile telecommunications company (MTC), ultra-reliable and low-latency (URLL), etc.) for which UE needs system information or UE type. UE may transmit its UE ID (i.e. SAE-temporary mobile subscriber identity (S-TMSI), cell-radio network temporary identifier (C-RNTI), random access-radio network temporary identifier (RA-RNTI), etc.) along with the SI request message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In response to the SI request, in operation S<b>150</b>, BS transmits SI-response wherein the SI-response includes the requested system information. SI response can be broadcasted or provided in unicast manner. Scheduling control information indicating the SI-response can be masked with UE's ID (e.g. C-RNTI, RA-RNTI) or a pre-defined ID (e.g. system information-radio network temporary identifier (SI-RNTI)). Pre-defined ID can be different for different system information or system information set or service or UE type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">One or more SIs (i.e. SIBs) requested by UE are provided within some time window (i.e. SI Response Window) after sending the SI request. After sending the SI request the UE listens to new radio-physical downlink control channel (NR-PDCCH) in SI Response Window for receiving the requested SIBs. If UE does not receive the requested SIBs within the SI Response Window then UE may retransmit the SI request. The length of SI response window is provided in minimum SI or essential SI. Alternately, after sending the SI request, for receiving the requested SIB, UE monitors the SI window of requested SIB in one or more SI periods of that SIB. The scheduling information for other SI including SIB type, validity information, periodicity, SI-window information can be provided in minimum SI irrespective of whether Other SI is periodically broadcasted or provided on demand. In one embodiment, UE first checks for SI response in SI response window and if not received it monitors the SI window for receiving the requested SIs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, evolved node B (eNB) may provide the requested system information for one or more cells and/or TRPs. ENB may indicate the cells and/or TRPs for which system information provided in SI response is applicable. As a result the UE does not need to request for system information when the UE changes cell and/or TRP. After the cell and/or TRP change, if the UE does not have system information for the new cell and/or TRP then UE request for system information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In another embodiment of the present disclosure, BS can indicate supported SI(s) in essential system information. UE can then request one or more of the supported SIs which are provided on demand using the method (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) explained earlier. In an embodiment, a default configuration for system information can be defined which the UE uses until it obtains them from the cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In another embodiment, a cell may broadcast some of the SIs in the first category of system information. The remaining SIs in the first category of system information of a cell can be broadcasted or provided on demand by another cell. In the request, UE may include information (e.g. cell ID, frequency, cell index, etc.) about the cell for which it is requesting SI.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0242">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, in an alternate embodiment, system information area concept can be defined. System information area refers to an area covering one or more cells or transmits point or transmit/receive point wherein the system information used is same. System information area can be identified by a system information area identifier. Cell or transmit point or transmit/receive point broadcasts the system info area identifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">When a UE moves from one cell to another, it checks the SI Area ID. If there is change in SI Area ID then UE reacquires the system information. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, if UE moves from cell 1 to cell 3, it does not need to reacquire the system information. If UE moves from cell 1 to cell 8 then it needs to reacquire the system information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">In an embodiment of the present disclosure system information area (or SI Area ID) can be different for different SIs (or SIBs). In an embodiment of the present disclosure system information area (or SI area ID) can be different for different sets of SIs (SIBs). In an embodiment of the present disclosure one system information area (or SI Area ID) can be there for SIs (or SIBs). In an embodiment of the present disclosure some SIs are cell specific and SI area ID is not associated with them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">In an embodiment of the present disclosure within an SI area, different versions of associated SI can be used. Each of these versions is identified by an index or value tag. Let's say SI areas for SIB X are as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 use a configuration of SIBx. Cell 1, Cell 2 and Cell 3 broadcasts that for SIBx, SI area ID is 1 and index/value tag is P. If cell 1, cell 2 and cell 3 wants to use a different configuration for SIBx, then they broadcast that for SIBx, SI area ID is 1 and index/value tag is Q. Within the same SI area if there is change in index or value tag, and UE does not have a valid SI configuration corresponding to the new index/valuetag of that SI area, UE reacquires the corresponding SI. The SI configuration identified by index/valuetag is valid in SI area in which it is obtained. It is not valid in another SI area. The scope of validity of index/valuetag is within the SI area. For example, the configuration of SIBx identified by index/value tag P in SI area ID 1 is not same as configuration of SIBx identified by index/value tag P in SI area ID 2 or SI area ID 3. It is to be noted that in prior art the scope of valueTag is one cell. In this method of the present disclosure scope of valueTag is SI area i.e. multiple cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a method for indexing system information parameters according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, BS may support multiple configuration sets of values for system information parameters. For example, let's say SI comprises of parameters P, Q and R. Let's says parameter P can have values P0, P1. Parameter Q can have values Q0, Q1, Q2. Parameter R can have values R0, R1. There can be 2*3*2=12 possible configurations for these parameters wherein each configuration has at least one parameter's value different from other configuration. Each of these configurations is given an index. Instead of signaling (either in broadcast or dedicated signaling) the parameters and there values, index can be signaled. For example configuration 0: P→P0, Q→Q0, R→R0; Configuration 1: P→P0, Q→Q1, R→R0; and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">For SI having parameters A, B and C possible configuration sets are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. In the example, Parameter A can have two possible values A0 and A1. Parameter B can have two possible values B0 and B1. Parameter C can have two possible values C0 and C1. Note that each parameter can have different number of values. Each Path from top to bottom in tree (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) is one valid configuration. These configurations can be sequentially numbered as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. 8 possible configurations are as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">Idx0: {A0, B0, C0}; Idx1: {A0, B0, C1}; Idx2: {A0, B1, C0}; Idx3: {A0, B1, C1}; Idx4: {A1, B0, C0}; Idx5: {A1, B0, C1}; Idx6: {A1, B1, C0}; Idx7: {A1, B1, C1}; idx={index of value of parameter A*(number of values of B*number of values of C)}+{index of value of parameter B*(number of values of C)}+index of value of parameter C. In order to allow skipping of a parameter in a configuration, skipping can be considered as additional value. For example, if parameter A can be skipped then Parameter A can have three values A0, A1, skip. A0 value has index 0, A1 value has index 1 and skip value has index 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">If a possible value of each SI parameter is known, and then given the index, configuration can be known corresponding to that index. SI can be categorized into various parts/groups etc. wherein each part or group has his own configuration indexes. Each SI part or SI group can have several configurations and each configuration can be indicated using index as illustrated above. For example, let's say there are two SI parts, SI part 1 and SI part 2. SI part 1 has three parameters A, B, C. SI part has two parameters P, Q. SI part 1 configuration and SI part 2 configuration can be indicated independently using their own configuration indexes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">Configuration index can be broadcasted or signaled using dedicated signaling. If SI is requested on demand then configuration index can be signaled instead of full configuration in response. Alternately, configuration index for SI can be broadcasted. If UE cannot know configuration based on broadcasted index then it can request BS/eNB/TRP to provide configuration corresponding to index by sending the index in SI request. UE may not know configuration based on index if it does not know the values of parameters which are supported in Cell/BS/eNB/TRP. For example, parameter A can have values A0, A1, A2, and A3. But values A0, A1 may be supported in cell 1 whereas values A2, A3, A1 may be supported in another cell 2. If UE cannot know configuration based on broadcasted index then it can request BS/eNB/TRP to provide values of parameters of SI supported in Cell/BS/eNB/TRP in SI request. Once the values of parameters of SI supported in Cell/BS/eNB/TRP are known, UE can determine the configuration corresponding to broadcast index. SI request/response can be signaled using method 1 to 9 explained earlier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">The supported values of parameters of SI can be same throughout the network or can be specific to cell/TRP. The supported values of parameters of SI part/group can be same throughout the network and for other SI part/group it can be specific to cell/TRP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">In another embodiment, instead of indexing as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, network or cell/TRP/eNB can maintain several configurations for SI or SI part or SI group and assign a distinct index/identifier to each configuration. Network indicates the index/identifier in broadcast signaling for each SI or SI part/group. UE first receives the broadcast signaling and gets the index/identifier for a SI or SI part/group. If UE does not have configuration corresponding to index/identifier UE request the configuration corresponding to index/identifier using on demand signaling explained earlier. Index/identifier can be included in request. If UE has valid configuration corresponding to index/identifier then UE uses it and does not need to request. Note that in one embodiment, this index/identifier can be valid across cells or TRPs or eNBs for an SI or SI part of SI group. In another embodiment, this index/identifier can be valid across TRPs of same cell for an SI or SI part of SI group. Whether the index/identifier for an SI or SI part or SI group is valid across cells or TRPs or eNBs etc. can be pre-defined or indicated in broadcast signaling. UE can store the configuration corresponding to an index/identifier for a defined life time.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, when a UE moves from one cell to another cell, if there is change in index for a SIB and it does not have the configuration corresponding to index used in that cell, UE reacquires the SI otherwise not. Let's say for SIB X network uses three configurations identified by index X, Y, Z as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. If UE moves from cell 1 to cell 3, it does not needs to reacquire SIBx, as both cells uses same configuration. If UE moves from cell 1 to cell 2, it has to reacquire SIBx if it does not have a stored configuration corresponding to index x. Unlike the previous method, scope of index is entire network instead of SI area. The index can also be named as valueTag wherein the scope of valueTag is entire network instead of one cell.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">UE request updated system information set or service specific system information if the update indication is received using the methods explained earlier (i.e. broadcast or on demand). If the system information set changed is part of broadcasted information then UE obtains updated system information from broadcast. If the system information set changed is part of on demand system information then UE obtains updated system information using on demand signaling.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">In an embodiment, ValueTag/identifier/configuration index may indicate that system information set/group/part is changed. In another embodiment, ValueTag/identifier/configuration index may identify a particular configuration of system information set/group/part. When a network signals a system information set/group/part identifier and UE does not have configuration corresponding to this identifier then UE updates the system information. In one embodiment, each of this SI Set/part/group may contain same parameters but may be valid in different area.</div>
