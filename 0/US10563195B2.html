<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Expression of the genetic information coded by a sequence of nucleotides in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) requires a biosynthesis of a complementary messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). This transcription event, which takes place in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, is followed by translocation of the mRNA into the cytoplasm, where it is loaded into ribosomes by a complex and highly regulated process. Here the nucleotide sequence, presented as a series of three-nucleotide codons is translated into a corresponding sequence of amino acids ultimately producing the protein corresponding to the original genetic code.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Exogenous mRNA introduced to the cytoplasm can be in principle accepted by the ribosomal machinery (see, e.g., Warren et al., Highly Efficient Reprogramming to Pluripotency and Directed Differentiation of Human Cells with Synthetic Modified mRNA, Cell Stem Cell (2010)). If the mRNA codes for an excreted protein, the modified or exogenous mRNA can direct the body's cellular machinery to produce a protein of interest, from native proteins to antibodies and other entirely novel protein constructs that can have therapeutic activity inside and outside of cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">There are difficulties with prior methodologies for effecting protein expression. There is a need in the art for biological modalities to address the modulation of intracellular translation of polynucleotides.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The present disclosure provides novel mRNA cap analogs, synthetic methods for making these cap analogs, and uses thereof. The present disclosure also provides new RNA molecules (e.g., mRNAs) incorporating the cap analogs disclosed herein which impart properties that are advantageous to therapeutic development.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The mRNA consists of an open reading frame (ORF) flanked by the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region (5′UTR, 3′UTR), a poly-adenosine monophosphate tail (polyA) and an inverted N7-methylguanosine containing cap structure. It is both chemically and enzymatically less stable than the corresponding DNA, hence the protein production subsequent to the ribosomal recruitment of the mRNA is temporary. In addition, the mRNA must be present in a so-called “closed loop” conformation for production of the target protein. While part of the active closed-loop conformation, the mRNA makes contact with the ribosomal machinery through the cap that binds to the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and the polyA tail attached through the polyA-binding protein (PABP). The eIF4E and PABP are connected through a skeletal protein eIF4G closing the active loop. Disruption of the mRNA circularized form leads to cessation of protein production and eventually enzymatic degradation of the mRNA itself chiefly by action of the de-capping enzyme system DCP1/2 and or through a poly-A ribonuclease (PARN) mediated de-adenylation. See, e.g., Richard J. Jackson et al., “The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation and principles of its regulation”, <i>Molecular Cell Biology, vol. </i>110, 113-127, 2010.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The cap-structure is a crucial feature of all eukaryotic mRNAs. It is recognized by the ribosomal complex through the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). mRNAs lacking the 5′-cap terminus are not recognized by the translational machinery and are incapable of producing the target protein (see, e.g., Colin Echeverria Aitken, Jon R Lorsch: “A mechanistic overview of translation initiation in eukaryotes”, <i>Nature Structural and Molecular Biology</i>, vol. 16, no. 6, 568-576, 2012.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The crude messenger RNA produced during the transcription process (“primary transcript”) is terminated by a 5′-triphosphate, which is converted to the respective 5′-diphosphate by the action of the enzyme RNA-triphosphatase. Then a guanylyl-transferase attaches the terminal inverted guanosine monophosphate to the 5′-terminus, and an N7MTase-mediated N7-methylation of the terminal, inverted guanosine, completes the capping process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The 5′-cap structure is vulnerable to enzymatic degradation, which is part of the regulation mechanism controlling protein expression. According to this the enzymatic system DCP1/2 performs a pyrophosphate hydrolysis between the second and the third phosphate groups of the cap structure, removing the N7-methylated guanosine diphosphate moiety leaving behind an mRNA terminated in a 5′-monophosphate group. This in turn is quite vulnerable to exonuclease cleavage and will lead to rapid decay of the remaining oligomer. See, e.g., R. Parker, H. Song: “The Enzymes and Control of Eukaryotic Turnover”, <i>Nature Structural </i>&amp; <i>Molecular Biology</i>, vol. 11, 121-127, 2004.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">High resolution X-ray crystallographic data of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) co-crystallized with P1-N7-methylguanosine-P3-adenosine-5′,5′-triphosphate (N7GpppA) suggests a close molecular interaction between the terminal purine and the triphosphate moiety on one hand and the receptor surface on the other. See, e.g., Koji Tomoo, et al., “Crystal structures of 7-methylguanosine 5′-triphosphate (m(7)GTP)- and P(1)-7-methylguanosine-P(3)-adenosine-5′,5′-triphosphate (m(7)GpppA)-bound human full-length eukaryotic initiation factor 4E: biological importance of the C-terminal flexible region.”, <i>Biochem. J. </i>362(Pt 3): 539-544, 2002. The terminal guanine is sandwiched between two aromatic side chains of TRP56 and TRP102 and this π-stacking interaction is further stabilized by two hydrogen bonds between the N7-guanine NH hydrogens and GLU103. The first two phosphate groups are interacting with basic residues of ARG112 and ARG157 as well as LYS162 either directly or through water mediated hydrogen bonds. The third phosphate group forms a hydrogen bond with the basic residue of ARG112. In short, the high resolution x-ray crystallographic data suggests that the both the guanine and the triphosphate make direct contact with the protein and contribute to the binding efficiency of capped mRNAs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The triphosphate moiety of the eukaryotic cap structure plays an important role in binding to the eIF4E as well as the stability of the mRNA. See, e.g., Anna Niedzwiecka et al., “Biophysical Studies of eIF4E Cap-binding Protein: Recognition of mRNA 50 Cap Structure and Synthetic Fragments of eIF4G and 4E-BP1 Proteins.”, <i>Journal of Molecular Biology, </i>319, 615-635, 2002. In addition, a DCP1/2-mediated hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate bond is the chief de-capping mechanism. See, e.g., Ewa Grudzien et al., “RNA: Structure, Metabolism, and Catalysis: Differential Inhibition of mRNA Degradation Pathways by Novel Cap Analogs.”, <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry, </i>281:1857-1867, 2006. Accordingly, the present disclosure is based, at least in part, on the assumption that replacement of the central phosphate with hydrophilic groups will be capable of maintaining the affinity to the binding pocket. Without wishing to be bound by theory, replacement of this phosphate with non-phosphate bridges could decrease the overall electrophilicity of the pyrophosphate grouping present in triphosphates, and since de-capping requires a nucleophilic attack of an enzyme-guided water molecule on the γ-phosphate, this in turn will result in cap structures resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis. The internucleoside distance can be tuned by the choice of appropriately sized moiety replacing the central triphosphate, such as glycols (e.g., diethylene- or triethylene-glycols). In addition to the distance, the overall special orientation of the two nucleosides can be altered by inclusion of cyclic structures such as cyclohexane-1,3-diol. Presence of hydrophilic groups such as that of a sulfoxide (SO), sulfone (SO<sub>2</sub>) or even a phosphate can facilitate interaction with the polar groups lining the eIF4E binding pocket, while maintaining chemical and enzymatic stability. These chemical modifications will have an impact on cap's binding affinity to the eIF4E. In addition to altered binding behavior, these chemical modifications will affect the affinity of these caps towards the DCP1/2 enzyme system, and potentially improve stability of the respective mRNA. This will allow for development of novel distinct SAR for these new cap structures for eIF4E-cap protein and lead to messenger RNA caps with improved eIF4E binding, and enhanced resistance to degradation, which in turn can result in increased rate of translation, extended stability of the “closed-loop” conformation and enhanced production of target proteins of therapeutic value.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">As used herein, the term “nucleobase” refers to a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic moiety, which is the parts of the nucleic acids that are involved in the hydrogen-bonding that binds one nucleic acid strand to another complementary strand in a sequence specific manner. The most common naturally-occurring nucleobases are: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">The term “modified nucleobase” refers to a moiety that can replace a nucleobase. The modified nucleobase mimics the spatial arrangement, electronic properties, or some other physicochemical property of the nucleobase and retains the property of hydrogen-bonding that binds one nucleic acid strand to another in a sequence specific manner. A modified nucleobase can pair with at least one of the five naturally occurring bases (uracil, thymine, adenine, cytosine, or guanine) without substantially affecting the melting behavior, recognition by intracellular enzymes, or activity of the oligonucleotide duplex. The term “modified nucleoside” or “modified nucleotide” refers to a nucleoside or nucleotide that contains a modified nucleobase and/or other chemical modification disclosed herein, such as modified sugar, modified phosphorus atom bridges or modified internucleoside linkage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236">Non-limiting examples of suitable nucleobases include, but are not limited to, uracil, thymine, adenine, cytosine, and guanine optionally having their respective amino groups protected by, e.g., acyl protecting groups, 5-propynyl-uracil, 2-thio-5-propynyl-uracil, 5-methylcytosine, 2-fluorouracil, 2-fluorocytosine, 5-bromouracil, 5-iodouracil, 2,6-diaminopurine, azacytosine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine, 2-aminopurine, N9-(2-amino-6-chloropurine), N9-(2,6-diaminopurine), hypoxanthine, N9-(7-deaza-guanine), N9-(7-deaza-8-aza-guanine), N8-(8-aza-7-deazaadenine), pyrimidine analogs such as pseudoisocytosine and pseudouracil and other modified nucleobases such as 8-substituted purines, xanthine, or hypoxanthine (the latter two being the natural degradation products). Exemplary modified nucleobases are disclosed in Chiu and Rana, R N A, 2003, 9, 1034-1048, Limbach et al. Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, 22, 2183-2196 and Revankar and Rao, Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry, vol. 7, 313.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">The term “modified sugar” or “sugar analog” refers to a moiety that can replace a sugar. The modified sugar mimics the spatial arrangement, electronic properties, or some other physicochemical property of a sugar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">As used herein, the terms “polynucleotide”, “oligonucleotide” and “nucleic acid” are used interchangeably and refer to single stranded and double stranded polymers or oligomers of nucleotide monomers, including ribonucleotides (RNA) and 2′-deoxyribonucleotides (DNA) linked by internucleotide phosphodiester bond linkages. A polynucleotide may be composed entirely of deoxyribonucleotides, entirely of ribonucleotides or chimeric mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">As used herein, the term “messenger RNA” (mRNA) refers to any polynucleotide which encodes at least one peptide or polypeptide of interest and which is capable of being translated to produce the encoded peptide polypeptide of interest in vitro, in vivo, in situ or ex vivo. An mRNA has been transcribed from a DNA sequence by an RNA polymerase enzyme, and interacts with a ribosome to synthesize genetic information encoded by DNA. Generally, mRNA are classified into two sub-classes: pre-mRNA and mature mRNA. Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) is mRNA that has been transcribed by RNA polymerase but has not undergone any post-transcriptional processing (e.g., 5′capping, splicing, editing, and polyadenylation). Mature mRNA has been modified via post-transcriptional processing (e.g., spliced to remove introns and polyadenylated) and is capable of interacting with ribosomes to perform protein synthesis. mRNA can be isolated from tissues or cells by a variety of methods. For example, a total RNA extraction can be performed on cells or a cell lysate and the resulting extracted total RNA can be purified (e.g., on a column comprising oligo-dT beads) to obtain extracted mRNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">Alternatively, mRNA can be synthesized in a cell-free environment, for example by in vitro transcription (IVT). An “in vitro transcription template” as used herein, refers to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) suitable for use in an IVT reaction for the production of messenger RNA (mRNA). In some embodiments, an IVT template encodes a 5′ untranslated region, contains an open reading frame, and encodes a 3′ untranslated region and a polyA tail. The particular nucleotide sequence composition and length of an IVT template will depend on the mRNA of interest encoded by the template.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">A “5′ untranslated region (UTR)” refers to a region of an mRNA that is directly upstream (i.e., 5′) from the start codon (i.e., the first codon of an mRNA transcript translated by a ribosome) that does not encode a protein or peptide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">A “3′ untranslated region (UTR)” refers to a region of an mRNA that is directly downstream (i.e., 3′) from the stop codon (i.e., the codon of an mRNA transcript that signals a termination of translation) that does not encode a protein or peptide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">An “open reading frame” is a continuous stretch of DNA beginning with a start codon (e.g., methionine (ATG)), and ending with a stop codon (e.g., TAA, TAG or TGA) and encodes a protein or peptide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">A “polyA tail” is a region of mRNA that is downstream, e.g., directly downstream (i.e., 3′), from the 3′ UTR that contains multiple, consecutive adenosine monophosphates. A polyA tail may contain 10 to 300 adenosine monophosphates. For example, a polyA tail may contain 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290 or 300 adenosine monophosphates. In some embodiments, a polyA tail contains 50 to 250 adenosine monophosphates. In a relevant biological setting (e.g., in cells, in vivo, etc.) the poly(A) tail functions to protect mRNA from enzymatic degradation, e.g., in the cytoplasm, and aids in transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">Thus, the polynucleotide may in some embodiments comprise (a) a first region of linked nucleosides encoding a polypeptide of interest; (b) a first terminal region located 5′ relative to said first region comprising a 5′ untranslated region (UTR); (c) a second terminal region located 3′ relative to said first region; and (d) a tailing region. The terms polynucleotide and nucleic acid are used interchangeably herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">In some embodiments, the polynucleotide includes from about 200 to about 3,000 nucleotides (e.g., from 200 to 500, from 200 to 1,000, from 200 to 1,500, from 200 to 3,000, from 500 to 1,000, from 500 to 1,500, from 500 to 2,000, from 500 to 3,000, from 1,000 to 1,500, from 1,000 to 2,000, from 1,000 to 3,000, from 1,500 to 3,000, or from 2,000 to 3,000 nucleotides).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">IVT mRNA disclosed herein may function as mRNA but are distinguished from wild-type mRNA in their functional and/or structural design features which serve to overcome existing problems of effective polypeptide production using nucleic-acid based therapeutics. For example, IVT mRNA may be structurally modified or chemically modified. As used herein, a “structural” modification is one in which two or more linked nucleosides are inserted, deleted, duplicated, inverted or randomized in a polynucleotide without significant chemical modification to the nucleotides themselves. Because chemical bonds will necessarily be broken and reformed to effect a structural modification, structural modifications are of a chemical nature and hence are chemical modifications. However, structural modifications will result in a different sequence of nucleotides. For example, the polynucleotide “ATCG” may be chemically modified to “AT-5meC-G”. The same polynucleotide may be structurally modified from “ATCG” to “ATCCCG”. Here, the dinucleotide “CC” has been inserted, resulting in a structural modification to the polynucleotide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">cDNA encoding the polynucleotides described herein may be transcribed using an in vitro transcription (IVT) system. The system typically comprises a transcription buffer, nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs), an RNase inhibitor and a polymerase. The NTPs may be manufactured in house, may be selected from a supplier, or may be synthesized as described herein. The NTPs may be selected from, but are not limited to, those described herein including natural and unnatural (modified) NTPs. The polymerase may be selected from, but is not limited to, T<sub>7 </sub>RNA polymerase, T<sub>3 </sub>RNA polymerase and mutant polymerases such as, but not limited to, polymerases able to incorporate polynucleotides (e.g., modified nucleic acids). TP as used herein stands for triphosphate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">In embodiments, polynucleotides of the disclosure may include at least one chemical modification. The polynucleotides described herein can include various substitutions and/or insertions from native or naturally occurring polynucleotides, e.g., in addition to the modification on the 5′ terminal mRNA cap moieties disclosed herein. As used herein, when referring to a polynucleotide, the terms “chemical modification” or, as appropriate, “chemically modified” refer to modification with respect to adenosine (A), guanosine (G), uridine (U), thymidine (T) or cytidine (C) ribo- or deoxyribnucleosides and the internucleoside linkages in one or more of their position, pattern, percent or population. Generally, herein, these terms are not intended to refer to the ribonucleotide modifications in naturally occurring 5′-terminal mRNA cap moieties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">The modifications may be various distinct modifications. In some embodiments, the regions may contain one, two, or more (optionally different) nucleoside or nucleotide modifications. In some embodiments, a modified polynucleotide introduced to a cell may exhibit reduced degradation in the cell as compared to an unmodified polynucleotide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">Modifications of the polynucleotides of the disclosure include, but are not limited to those listed in detail below.

One or more atoms of a pyrimidine or purine nucleobase may be replaced or substituted with optionally substituted amino, optionally substituted thiol, optionally substituted alkyl (e.g., methyl or ethyl), or halo (e.g., chloro or fluoro).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">In certain embodiments, modifications (e.g., one or more modifications) are present in each of the sugar and the internucleoside linkage. Modifications according to the present disclosure may be modifications of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) to deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs), threose nucleic acids (TNAs), glycol nucleic acids (GNAs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), locked nucleic acids (LNAs) or hybrids thereof). Additional modifications are described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">Non-natural modified nucleotides may be introduced to polynucleotides during synthesis or post-synthesis of the chains to achieve desired functions or properties. The modifications may be on internucleotide lineage, the purine or pyrimidine bases, or sugar. The modification may be introduced at the terminal of a chain or anywhere else in the chain; with chemical synthesis or with a polymerase enzyme. Any of the regions of the polynucleotides may be chemically modified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">The present disclosure provides for polynucleotides comprised of unmodified or modified nucleosides and nucleotides and combinations thereof. As described herein “nucleoside” is defined as a compound containing a sugar molecule (e.g., a pentose or ribose) or a derivative thereof in combination with an organic base (e.g., a purine or pyrimidine) or a derivative thereof (also referred to herein as “nucleobase”). As described herein, “nucleotide” is defined as a nucleoside including a phosphate group. The modified nucleotides may by synthesized by any useful method, as described herein (e.g., chemically, enzymatically, or recombinantly to include one or more modified or non-natural nucleosides). The polynucleotides may comprise a region or regions of linked nucleosides. Such regions may have variable backbone linkages. The linkages may be standard phosphodiester linkages, in which case the polynucleotides would comprise regions of nucleotides. Any combination of base/sugar or linker may be incorporated into the polynucleotides of the disclosure.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0328">“Geometric isomer” means the diastereomers that owe their existence to hindered rotation about double bonds or a cycloalkyl linker (e.g., 1,3-cylcobutyl). These configurations are differentiated in their names by the prefixes cis and trans, or Z and E, which indicate that the groups are on the same or opposite side of the double bond in the molecule according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0330" num="0329">It is to be understood that the compounds of the present disclosure may be depicted as different chiral isomers or geometric isomers. It should also be understood that when compounds have chiral isomeric or geometric isomeric forms, all isomeric forms are intended to be included in the scope of the present disclosure, and the naming of the compounds does not exclude any isomeric forms, it being understood that not all isomers may have the same level of activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0331" num="0330">Furthermore, the structures and other compounds discussed in this disclosure include all atropic isomers thereof, it being understood that not all atropic isomers may have the same level of activity. “Atropic isomers” are a type of stereoisomer in which the atoms of two isomers are arranged differently in space. Atropic isomers owe their existence to a restricted rotation caused by hindrance of rotation of large groups about a central bond. Such atropic isomers typically exist as a mixture, however as a result of recent advances in chromatography techniques, it has been possible to separate mixtures of two atropic isomers in select cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0332" num="0331">“Tautomer” is one of two or more structural isomers that exist in equilibrium and is readily converted from one isomeric form to another. This conversion results in the formal migration of a hydrogen atom accompanied by a switch of adjacent conjugated double bonds. Tautomers exist as a mixture of a tautomeric set in solution. In solutions where tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent and pH. The concept of tautomers that are interconvertable by tautomerizations is called tautomerism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0333" num="0332">Of the various types of tautomerism that are possible, two are commonly observed. In keto-enol tautomerism a simultaneous shift of electrons and a hydrogen atom occurs. Ring-chain tautomerism arises as a result of the aldehyde group (—CHO) in a sugar chain molecule reacting with one of the hydroxy groups (—OH) in the same molecule to give it a cyclic (ring-shaped) form as exhibited by glucose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0334" num="0333">Common tautomeric pairs are: ketone-enol, amide-nitrile, lactam-lactim, amide-imidic acid tautomerism in heterocyclic rings (e.g., in nucleobases such as guanine, thymine and cytosine), imine-enamine and enamine-enamine. Examples of lactam-lactim tautomerism are as shown below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0336" num="0335">It is to be understood that the compounds of the present disclosure may be depicted as different tautomers. It should also be understood that when compounds have tautomeric forms, all tautomeric forms are intended to be included in the scope of the present disclosure, and the naming of the compounds does not exclude any tautomer form. It will be understood that certain tautomers may have a higher level of activity than others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0337" num="0336">The term “crystal polymorphs”, “polymorphs” or “crystal forms” means crystal structures in which a compound (or a salt or solvate thereof) can crystallize in different crystal packing arrangements, all of which have the same elemental composition. Different crystal forms usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectral, melting points, density hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. Crystal polymorphs of the compounds can be prepared by crystallization under different conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0338" num="0337">The compounds of any formula described herein include the compounds themselves, as well as their salts, and their solvates, if applicable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0339" num="0338">A salt, for example, can be formed between an anion and a positively charged group (e.g., amino) on a compound or a polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) disclosed herein. Suitable anions include chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, bisulfate, sulfamate, nitrate, phosphate, citrate, methanesulfonate, trifluoroacetate, glutamate, glucuronate, glutarate, malate, maleate, succinate, fumarate, tartrate, tosylate, salicylate, lactate, naphthalenesulfonate, and acetate (e.g., trifluoroacetate). Suitable anions include pharmaceutically acceptable anions. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable anion” refers to an anion suitable for forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Likewise, a salt can also be formed between a cation and a negatively charged group (e.g., carboxylate) on a compound or a polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) disclosed herein. Suitable cations include sodium ion, potassium ion, magnesium ion, calcium ion, and an ammonium cation such as tetramethylammonium ion. The compounds and polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) disclosed herein may also include those salts containing quaternary nitrogen atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0340" num="0339">Additionally, the compounds of the present disclosure, for example, the salts of the compounds, can exist in either hydrated or unhydrated (the anhydrous) form or as solvates with other solvent molecules. Nonlimiting examples of hydrates include monohydrates, dihydrates, etc. Nonlimiting examples of solvates include ethanol solvates, acetone solvates, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0341" num="0340">“Solvate” means solvent addition forms that contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate; and if the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one molecule of the substance in which the water retains its molecular state as H<sub>2</sub>O.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0342" num="0341">As used herein, the term “analog” refers to a chemical compound that is structurally similar to another but differs slightly in composition (as in the replacement of one atom by an atom of a different element or in the presence of a particular functional group, or the replacement of one functional group by another functional group). Thus, an analog is a compound that is similar or comparable in function and appearance, but not in structure or origin to the reference compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0343" num="0342">As defined herein, the term “derivative” refers to compounds that have a common core structure, and are substituted with various groups as described herein. For example, all of the compounds represented by formula (I) are modified mRNA caps with the ribose group replaced with a 6-membered cyclic structure, and have formula (I) as a common core.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0344" num="0343">The term “bioisostere” refers to a compound resulting from the exchange of an atom or of a group of atoms with another, broadly similar, atom or group of atoms. The objective of a bioisosteric replacement is to create a new compound with similar biological properties to the parent compound. The bioisosteric replacement may be physicochemically or topologically based. Examples of carboxylic acid bioisosteres include, but are not limited to, acyl sulfonimides, tetrazoles, sulfonates and phosphonates. See, e.g., Patani and LaVoie, <i>Chem. Rev. </i>96, 3147-3176, 1996.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0345" num="0344">The present disclosure is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium, and isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14. For example, when a certain variable (e.g., any of R<sub>20</sub>-R<sub>23</sub>) in formula (I) is H or hydrogen, it can be either hydrogen or deuterium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0346" num="0345">The use of the articles “a”, “an”, and “the” in both the following description and claims are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context. The terms “comprising”, “having”, “being of” as in “being of a chemical formula”, “including”, and “containing” are to be construed as open terms (i.e., meaning “including but not limited to”) unless otherwise noted. Additionally whenever “comprising” or another open-ended term is used in an embodiment, it is to be understood that the same embodiment can be more narrowly claimed using the intermediate term “consisting essentially of” or the closed term “consisting of.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0347" num="0346">As used herein, the expressions “one or more of A, B, or C,” “one or more A, B, or C,” “one or more of A, B, and C,” “one or more A, B, and C” and the like are used interchangeably and all refer to a selection from a group consisting of A, B, and/or C, i.e., one or more As, one or more Bs, one or more Cs, or any combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0348" num="0347">The present disclosure provides methods for the synthesis of the compounds of any of the formulae described herein. The present disclosure also provides detailed methods for the synthesis of various disclosed compounds according to the following schemes as shown in the Examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0349" num="0348">Throughout the description, where compositions are described as having, including, or comprising specific components, it is contemplated that compositions also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited components. Similarly, where methods or processes are described as having, including, or comprising specific process steps, the processes also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited processing steps. Further, it should be understood that the order of steps or order for performing certain actions is immaterial so long as the invention remains operable. Moreover, two or more steps or actions can be conducted simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0349">The synthetic processes of the disclosure can tolerate a wide variety of functional groups, therefore various substituted starting materials can be used. The processes generally provide the desired final compound at or near the end of the overall process, although it may be desirable in certain instances to further convert the compound to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0351" num="0350">Compounds of the present disclosure can be prepared in a variety of ways using commercially available starting materials, compounds known in the literature, or from readily prepared intermediates, by employing standard synthetic methods and procedures either known to those skilled in the art, or which will be apparent to the skilled artisan in light of the teachings herein. Standard synthetic methods and procedures for the preparation of organic molecules and functional group transformations and manipulations can be obtained from the relevant scientific literature or from standard textbooks in the field.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0353" num="0352">One of ordinary skill in the art will note that, during the reaction sequences and synthetic schemes described herein, the order of certain steps may be changed, such as the introduction and removal of protecting groups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0354" num="0353">One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that certain groups may require protection from the reaction conditions via the use of protecting groups. Protecting groups may also be used to differentiate similar functional groups in molecules. A list of protecting groups and how to introduce and remove these groups can be found in Greene, T.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0365" num="0364">As illustrated in Scheme 1 above, commercially available phosphoramidite (a) is condensed under acidic conditions with the appropriate diol HO—Y<sub>2</sub>—OH (e.g., ethylene glycol). The initial ratio of phosphoramidite-to-diol is equimolar, and the formation of the mono-substituted P(III) ester is monitored by LCMS. As the addition is found to be complete, additional 1 molar equivalent of phosphoramidite (a) is added. The resulting bis-P(III)-phosphodiester is oxidized with tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Treatment with base, such as diethylamine, induces a β-elimination of the cyanoethyl groups to yield the bis-phosphate ester (b). Treatment with a nucleophilic base, such as methylamine, induces removal of the amide protecting groups to yield (c) and this is followed by fluoride-mediated 2′-O-de-silylation. Acid treatment (TFA) completes the global deprotection and the final bis-N-7-methylation afforded the final compound (d).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0369" num="0368">Scheme 3 above illustrates an approach to synthesizing the compounds described herein. Phosphoramidite (aaa) and bis(2-cyanoethyl) phosphate (bbb) are coupled to form (bis(2-cyanoethoxy)phosphoryl)oxy)-hydroxypropyl(cyanoethyl)phosphate (ccc), which is then coupled with another 1 molar equivalent of phosphoramidite (aaa) to yield the primary adduct (ddd).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0370" num="0369">A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that in the above schemes the order of certain steps may be interchangeable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0371" num="0370">Cap analogs described herein are used for the synthesis of 5′ capped RNA molecules in in vitro transcription reactions. Substitution of cap analog for a portion of the GTP in a transcription reaction results in the incorporation of the cap structure into a corresponding fraction of the transcripts. Capped mRNAs are generally translated more efficiently in reticulocyte lysate and wheat germ in vitro translation systems. It is important that in vitro transcripts be capped for microinjection experiments because uncapped mRNAs are rapidly degraded. Cap analogs are also used as a highly specific inhibitor of the initiation step of protein synthesis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0372" num="0371">Accordingly, in another aspect, the present disclosure provides methods of synthesizing an RNA molecule in vitro. The method can include reacting unmodified or modified ATP, unmodified or modified CTP, unmodified or modified UTP, unmodified or modified GTP, a compound of formula (I) or a stereoisomer, tautomer or salt thereof, and a polynucleotide template; in the presence an RNA polymerase; under a condition conducive to transcription by the RNA polymerase of the polynucleotide template into one or more RNA copies; whereby at least some of the RNA copies incorporate the compound of formula (I) or a stereoisomer, tautomer or salt thereof to make an RNA molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0373" num="0372">Also provided herein is a kit for capping an RNA transcript. The kit includes a compound of formula (I) and an RNA polymerase.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0422" num="0421">The alternative nucleotides can include the wholesale replacement of an unaltered phosphate moiety with another internucleoside linkage as described herein. Examples of alternative phosphate groups include, but are not limited to, phosphorothioate, phosphoroselenates, boranophosphates, boranophosphate esters, hydrogen phosphonates, phosphoramidates, phosphorodiamidates, alkyl or aryl phosphonates, and phosphotriesters. Phosphorodithioates have both non-linking oxygens replaced by sulfur.

An IRES may act as the sole ribosome binding site, or may serve as one of multiple ribosome binding sites of an mRNA. A polynucleotide containing more than one functional ribosome binding site may encode several peptides or polypeptides that are translated independently by the ribosomes (e.g., multicistronic mRNA). When polynucleotides are provided with an IRES, further optionally provided is a second translatable region.

The polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) may then be administered to cells, tissue or organisms and outcomes such as protein level, localization, and/or half-life may be measured to evaluate the beneficial effects the heterologous 5′-UTR may have on the alternative polynucleotides (mRNA). Variants of the 5′-UTRs may be utilized wherein one or more nucleotides are added or removed to the termini, including A, T, C or G. 5′-UTRs may also be codon-optimized, or altered in any manner described herein.</div>

The polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) with at least one TEE in the 5′-UTR may include a cap at the 5′-UTR. Further, at least one TEE may be located in the 5′-UTR of polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) undergoing cap-dependent or cap-independent translation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0431" num="0430">In one aspect, TEEs are conserved elements in the UTR which can promote translational activity of a polynucleotide such as, but not limited to, cap-dependent or cap-independent translation.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0468" num="0467">In some instances, the poly-A region may be 80 nucleotides, 120 nucleotides, 160 nucleotides in length on an alternative polynucleotide molecule described herein.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0470" num="0469">In some cases, the poly-A region is designed relative to the length of the overall alternative polynucleotide. This design may be based on the length of the coding region of the alternative polynucleotide, the length of a particular feature or region of the alternative polynucleotide (such as mRNA), or based on the length of the ultimate product expressed from the alternative polynucleotide. When relative to any feature of the alternative polynucleotide (e.g., other than the mRNA portion which includes the poly-A region) the poly-A region may be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% greater in length than the additional feature. The poly-A region may also be designed as a fraction of the alternative polynucleotide to which it belongs. In this context, the poly-A region may be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90% or more of the total length of the construct or the total length of the construct minus the poly-A region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0471" num="0470">In certain cases, engineered binding sites and/or the conjugation of polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) for poly-A binding protein may be used to enhance expression. The engineered binding sites may be sensor sequences which can operate as binding sites for ligands of the local microenvironment of the polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA). As a non-limiting example, the polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) may include at least one engineered binding site to alter the binding affinity of poly-A binding protein (PABP) and analogs thereof. The incorporation of at least one engineered binding site may increase the binding affinity of the PABP and analogs thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0472" num="0471">Additionally, multiple distinct polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) may be linked together to the PABP (poly-A binding protein) through the 3′-end using alternative nucleotides at the 3′-terminus of the poly-A region. Transfection experiments can be conducted in relevant cell lines at and protein production can be assayed by ELISA at 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and day 7 post-transfection. As a non-limiting example, the transfection experiments may be used to evaluate the effect on PABP or analogs thereof binding affinity as a result of the addition of at least one engineered binding site.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0473" num="0472">In certain cases, a poly-A region may be used to modulate translation initiation.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0482" num="0481">The RNAs and multimeric nucleic acid complexes described herein can be used as therapeutic agents or are therapeutic mRNAs. As used herein, the term “therapeutic mRNA” refers to an mRNA that encodes a therapeutic protein. Therapeutic proteins mediate a variety of effects in a host cell or a subject in order to treat a disease or ameliorate the signs and symptoms of a disease. For example, an RNA or a multimeric structure described herein can be administered to an animal or human subject, wherein the RNA is translated in vivo to produce a therapeutic peptide in the subject in need thereof. Accordingly, provided herein are compositions, methods, kits, and reagents for treatment or prevention of disease or conditions in humans and other mammals. The active therapeutic agents of the present disclosure include RNAs (e.g., mRNAs) disclosed herein, cells containing the mRNAs or polypeptides translated from the mRNAs, polypeptides translated from mRNAs, cells contacted with cells containing mRNAs or polypeptides translated therefrom, tissues containing cells containing the mRNAs described herein and organs containing tissues containing cells containing the mRNAs described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0483" num="0482">In another aspect, the disclosure provides methods and compositions useful for protecting RNAs disclosed herein (e.g., RNA transcripts) from degradation (e.g., exonuclease mediated degradation), such as methods and compositions described in US20150050738A1 and WO2015023975A1, the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0484" num="0483">In some embodiments, the protected RNAs are present outside of cells. In some embodiments, the protected RNAs are present in cells. In some embodiments, methods and compositions are provided that are useful for post-transcriptionally altering protein and/or RNA levels in a targeted manner. In some embodiments, methods disclosed herein involve reducing or preventing degradation or processing of targeted RNAs thereby elevating steady state levels of the targeted RNAs. In some embodiments, methods disclosed herein may also or alternatively involve increasing translation or increasing transcription of targeted RNAs, thereby elevating levels of RNA and/or protein levels in a targeted manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0485" num="0484">It is recognized that certain RNA degradation is mediated by exonucleases. In some embodiments, exonucleases may destroy RNA from its 3′ end and/or 5′ end. Without wishing to be bound by theory, in some embodiments, it is believed that one or both ends of RNA can be protected from exonuclease enzyme activity by contacting the RNA with oligonucleotides (oligos) that hybridize with the RNA at or near one or both ends, thereby increasing stability and/or levels of the RNA. The ability to increase stability and/or levels of a RNA by targeting the RNA at or near one or both ends, as disclosed herein, is surprising in part because of the presence of endonucleases (e.g., in cells) capable of destroying the RNA through internal cleavage. Moreover, in some embodiments, it is surprising that a 5′ targeting oligonucleotide is effective alone (e.g., not in combination with a 3′ targeting oligonucleotide or in the context of a pseudocircularization oligonucleotide) at stabilizing RNAs or increasing RNA levels because in cells, for example, 3′ end processing exonucleases may be dominant (e.g., compared with 5′ end processing exonucleases). However, in some embodiments, 3′ targeting oligonucleotides are used in combination with 5′ targeting oligonucleotides, or alone, to stabilize a target RNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0486" num="0485">In some embodiments, methods provided herein involve use of oligonucleotides that stabilize an RNA by hybridizing at a 5′ and/or 3′ region of the RNA. In some embodiments, oligonucleotides that prevent or inhibit degradation of an RNA by hybridizing with the RNA may be referred to herein as “stabilizing oligonucleotides.” In some examples, such oligonucleotides hybridize with an RNA and prevent or inhibit exonuclease mediated degradation. Inhibition of exonuclease mediated degradation includes, but is not limited to, reducing the extent of degradation of a particular RNA by exonucleases. For example, an exonuclease that processes only single stranded RNA may cleave a portion of the RNA up to a region where an oligonucleotide is hybridized with the RNA because the exonuclease cannot effectively process (e.g., pass through) the duplex region. Thus, in some embodiments, using an oligonucleotide that targets a particular region of an RNA makes it possible to control the extent of degradation of the RNA by exonucleases up to that region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0487" num="0486">For example, use of an oligonucleotide (oligo) that hybridizes at an end of an RNA may reduce or eliminate degradation by an exonuclease that processes only single stranded RNAs from that end. For example, use of an oligonucleotide that hybridizes at the 5′ end of an RNA may reduce or eliminate degradation by an exonuclease that processes single stranded RNAs in a 5′ to 3′ direction. Similarly, use of an oligonucleotide that hybridizes at the 3′ end of an RNA may reduce or eliminate degradation by an exonuclease that processes single stranded RNAs in a 3′ to 5′ direction. In some embodiments, lower concentrations of an oligo may be used when the oligo hybridizes at both the 5′ and 3′ regions of the RNA. In some embodiments, an oligo that hybridizes at both the 5′ and 3′ regions of the RNA protects the 5′ and 3′ regions of the RNA from degradation (e.g., by an exonuclease). In some embodiments, an oligo that hybridizes at both the 5′ and 3′ regions of the RNA creates a pseudo-circular RNA (e.g., a circularized RNA with a region of the polyA tail that protrudes from the circle). In some embodiments, a pseudo-circular RNA is translated at a higher efficiency than a non-pseudo-circular RNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0488" num="0487">In some aspects, methods are provided for stabilizing a synthetic RNA disclosed herein (e.g., a synthetic RNA that is to be delivered to a cell). In some embodiments, the methods involve contacting a synthetic RNA with one or more oligonucleotides that bind to a 5′ region of the synthetic RNA and a 3′ region of the synthetic RNA and that when bound to the synthetic RNA form a circularized product with the synthetic RNA. In some embodiments, the synthetic RNA is contacted with the one or more oligonucleotides outside of a cell. In some embodiments, the methods further involve delivering the circularized product to a cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0489" num="0488">In some aspects of the invention, methods are provided for increasing expression of a protein in a cell that involve delivering to a cell a circularized synthetic RNA that encodes the protein, in which synthesis of the protein in the cell is increased following delivery of the circularized RNA to the cell. In some embodiments, the circularized synthetic RNA comprises one or more modified nucleotides. In some embodiments, methods are provided that involve delivering to a cell a circularized synthetic RNA that encodes a protein, in which synthesis of the protein in the cell is increased following delivery of the circularized synthetic RNA to the cell. In some embodiments, a circularized synthetic RNA is a single-stranded covalently closed circular RNA. In some embodiments, a single-stranded covalently closed circular RNA comprises one or more modified nucleotides. In some embodiments, the circularized synthetic RNA is formed by synthesizing an RNA that has a 5′ end and a 3′ and ligating together the 5′ and 3′ ends. In some embodiments, the circularized synthetic RNA is formed by producing a synthetic RNA (e.g., through in vitro transcription or artificial (non-natural) chemical synthesis) and contacting the synthetic RNA with one or more oligonucleotides that bind to a 5′ region of the synthetic RNA and a 3′ region of the synthetic RNA, and that when bound to the synthetic RNA form a circularized product with the synthetic RNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0490" num="0489">In some aspects of the invention, an oligonucleotide is provided that comprises a region of complementarity that is complementary with at least 5 contiguous nucleotides of an RNA transcript, in which the nucleotide at the 3′-end of the region of complementary is complementary with a nucleotide within 10 nucleotides of the transcription start site of the RNA transcript. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises nucleotides linked by at least one modified internucleoside linkage or at least one bridged nucleotide. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide is 8 to 80, 8 to 50, 9 to 50, 10 to 50, 8 to 30, 9 to 30, 10 to 30, 15 to 30, 9 to 20, 8 to 20, 8 to 15, or 9 to 15 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide is 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80 or more nucleotides in length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0491" num="0490">In some aspects of the invention, an oligonucleotide is provided that comprises two regions of complementarity each of which is complementary with at least 5 contiguous nucleotides of an RNA transcript, in which the nucleotide at the 3′-end of the first region of complementary is complementary with a nucleotide within 100 nucleotides of the transcription start site of the RNA transcript and in which the second region of complementarity is complementary with a region of the RNA transcript that ends within 300 nucleotides of the 3′-end of the RNA transcript.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0492" num="0491">Several exemplary oligonucleotide design schemes are contemplated herein for increasing stability of the RNA (e.g., mRNA) molecules disclosed herein. With regard to oligonucleotides targeting the 3′ end of an RNA, at least two exemplary design schemes are contemplated. As a first scheme, an oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to the 3′ end of an RNA, before the polyA tail. As a second scheme, an oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to the 3′ end of RNA and the oligonucleotide has a 5′ poly-T region that hybridizes to the polyA tail of the RNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0493" num="0492">With regard to oligonucleotides targeting the 5′ end of an RNA, at least three exemplary design schemes are contemplated. For scheme one, an oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to the 5′ end of RNA. For scheme two, an oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to the 5′ end of RNA and has a 3 ‘overhang to create a RNA-oligo duplex with a recessed end. In this scheme, the overhang is one or more C nucleotides, e.g., two Cs, which can potentially interact with a 5’ methylguanosine cap and stabilize the cap further. The overhang could also potentially be another type of nucleotide, and is not limited to C. For scheme three, an oligonucleotide is designed to include a loop region to stabilize a 5′ RNA cap. The example shows oligos with loops to stabilize a 5′ RNA cap or oligos. In yet another embodiment, an oligonucleotide is designed to bind to both 5′ and 3′ ends of an RNA to create a pseudo-circularized RNA. For example, an LNA mixmer oligo binding to the 5′ and 3′ regions of an RNA can achieve an oligo-mediated RNA pseudo circularization.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0495" num="0494">Provided are methods of inducing translation of a synthetic polynucleotide (e.g., a modified mRNA as disclosed herein) to produce a polypeptide in a cell population using the mRNAs described herein. Such translation can be in vivo, ex vivo, in culture, or in vitro. The cell population is contacted with an effective amount of a composition containing a polynucleotide that incorporates the cap analog of the disclosure, and a translatable region encoding the polypeptide. The population is contacted under conditions such that the polynucleotide is localized into one or more cells of the cell population and the polypeptide is translated in the cell from the polynucleotide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0496" num="0495">An effective amount of the composition of a polynucleotide disclosed herein is provided based, at least in part, on the target tissue, target cell type, means of administration, physical characteristics of the polynucleotide (e.g., size, and extent of modified nucleosides), and other determinants. In general, an effective amount of the composition provides efficient protein production in the cell, preferably more efficient than a composition containing a corresponding natural polynucleotide. Increased efficiency may be demonstrated by increased cell transfection (i.e., the percentage of cells transfected with the polynucleotide), increased protein translation from the polynucleotide, decreased polynucleotide degradation (as demonstrated, e.g., by increased duration of protein translation from an RNA molecule), or reduced innate immune response of the host cell or improve therapeutic utility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0497" num="0496">Aspects of the present disclosure are directed to methods of inducing in vivo translation of a polypeptide in a mammalian subject in need thereof. Therein, an effective amount of a composition containing a polynucleotide of the disclosure that has the cap analog of the disclosure and a translatable region encoding the polypeptide is administered to the subject using the delivery methods described herein. The polynucleotide may also contain at least one modified nucleoside. The polynucleotide is provided in an amount and under other conditions such that the polynucleotide is localized into a cell or cells of the subject and the polypeptide of interest is translated in the cell from the polynucleotide. The cell in which the polynucleotide is localized, or the tissue in which the cell is present, may be targeted with one or more than one rounds of polynucleotide administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0498" num="0497">Other aspects of the present disclosure relate to transplantation of cells containing RNA molecules of the disclosure to a mammalian subject. Administration of cells to mammalian subjects is known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as local implantation (e.g., topical or subcutaneous administration), organ delivery or systemic injection (e.g., intravenous injection or inhalation), as is the formulation of cells in pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Compositions containing RNA molecules of the disclosure are formulated for administration intramuscularly, transarterially, intraperitoneally, intravenously, intranasally, subcutaneously, endoscopically, transdermally, or intrathecally. In some embodiments, the composition is formulated for extended release.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0499" num="0498">The subject to whom the therapeutic agent is administered suffers from or is at risk of developing a disease, disorder, or deleterious condition. Provided are methods of identifying, diagnosing, and classifying subjects on these bases, which may include clinical diagnosis, biomarker levels, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other methods known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0500" num="0499">In certain embodiments, the administered RNA molecule of the disclosure directs production of one or more polypeptides that provide a functional activity which is substantially absent in the cell in which the polypeptide is translated. For example, the missing functional activity may be enzymatic, structural, or gene regulatory in nature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0501" num="0500">In other embodiments, the administered RNA molecule of the disclosure directs production of one or more polypeptides that replace a polypeptide (or multiple polypeptides) that is substantially absent in the cell in which the one or more polypeptides are translated. Such absence may be due to genetic mutation of the encoding gene or regulatory pathway thereof. In other embodiments, the administered RNA molecule of the disclosure directs production of one or more polypeptides to supplement the amount of polypeptide (or multiple polypeptides) that is present in the cell in which the one or more polypeptides are translated. Alternatively, the translated polypeptide functions to antagonize the activity of an endogenous protein present in, on the surface of, or secreted from the cell. Usually, the activity of the endogenous protein is deleterious to the subject, for example, due to mutation of the endogenous protein resulting in altered activity or localization. Additionally, the translated polypeptide antagonizes, directly or indirectly, the activity of a biological moiety present in, on the surface of, or secreted from the cell. Examples of antagonized biological moieties include lipids (e.g., cholesterol), a lipoprotein (e.g., low density lipoprotein), a polynucleotide, a carbohydrate, or a small molecule toxin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0502" num="0501">The translated proteins described herein are engineered for localization within the cell, potentially within a specific compartment such as the nucleus, or are engineered for secretion from the cell or translocation to the plasma membrane of the cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0503" num="0502">As described herein, a useful feature of the RNA molecules of the disclosure of the present disclosure is the capacity to reduce, evade, avoid or eliminate the innate immune response of a cell to an exogenous RNA. Provided are methods for performing the titration, reduction or elimination of the immune response in a cell or a population of cells. In some embodiments, the cell is contacted with a first composition that contains a first dose of a first exogenous RNA including a translatable region, the cap analog of the disclosure, and optionally at least one modified nucleoside, and the level of the innate immune response of the cell to the first exogenous polynucleotide is determined. Subsequently, the cell is contacted with a second composition, which includes a second dose of the first exogenous polynucleotide, the second dose containing a lesser amount of the first exogenous polynucleotide as compared to the first dose. Alternatively, the cell is contacted with a first dose of a second exogenous polynucleotide. The second exogenous polynucleotide may contain the cap analog of the disclosure, which may be the same or different from the first exogenous polynucleotide or, alternatively, the second exogenous polynucleotide may not contain the cap analog of the disclosure. The steps of contacting the cell with the first composition and/or the second composition may be repeated one or more times. Additionally, efficiency of protein production (e.g., protein translation) in the cell is optionally determined, and the cell may be re-transfected with the first and/or second composition repeatedly until a target protein production efficiency is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0504" num="0503">Also provided herein are methods for treating or preventing a symptom of diseases characterized by missing or aberrant protein activity, by replacing the missing protein activity or overcoming the aberrant protein activity. Because of the rapid initiation of protein production following introduction of unnatural mRNAs, as compared to viral DNA vectors, the compounds and RNAs of the present disclosure are particularly advantageous in treating acute diseases such as sepsis, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Moreover, the lack of transcriptional regulation of the unnatural mRNAs of the present disclosure is advantageous in that accurate titration of protein production is achievable. Multiple diseases are characterized by missing (or substantially diminished such that proper protein function does not occur) protein activity. Such proteins may not be present, are present in very low quantities or are essentially non-functional. The present disclosure provides a method for treating such conditions or diseases in a subject by introducing polynucleotide or cell-based therapeutics containing the RNA molecules of the disclosure provided herein, wherein the RNA molecules of the disclosure encode for a protein that replaces the protein activity missing from the target cells of the subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0505" num="0504">Diseases characterized by dysfunctional or aberrant protein activity include, but not limited to, cancer and proliferative diseases, genetic diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis), autoimmune diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic diseases. The present disclosure provides a method for treating such conditions or diseases in a subject by introducing the RNA molecules of the disclosure or cell-based therapeutics containing the RNA molecules provided herein, wherein the RNA molecules of the disclosure encode for a protein that antagonizes or otherwise overcomes the aberrant protein activity present in the cell of the subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0506" num="0505">Specific examples of a dysfunctional protein are the missense or nonsense mutation variants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which produce a dysfunctional or nonfunctional, respectively, protein variant of CFTR protein, which causes cystic fibrosis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0507" num="0506">Thus, provided are methods of treating cystic fibrosis in a mammalian subject by contacting a cell of the subject with an RNA molecule of the disclosure having a translatable region that encodes a functional CFTR polypeptide, under conditions such that an effective amount of the CTFR polypeptide is present in the cell. Preferred target cells are epithelial cells, such as the lung, and methods of administration are determined in view of the target tissue; i.e., for lung delivery, the RNA molecules are formulated for administration by inhalation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0508" num="0507">In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for treating hyperlipidemia in a subject, by introducing into a cell population of the subject with an unnatural mRNA molecule encoding Sortilin, a protein recently characterized by genomic studies, thereby ameliorating the hyperlipidemia in a subject. The SORT1 gene encodes a trans-Golgi network (TGN) transmembrane protein called Sortilin. Genetic studies have shown that one of five individuals has a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs12740374, in the 1p13 locus of the SORT1 gene that predisposes them to having low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Each copy of the minor allele, present in about 30% of people, alters LDL cholesterol by 8 mg/dL, while two copies of the minor allele, present in about 5% of the population, lowers LDL cholesterol 16 mg/dL. Carriers of the minor allele have also been shown to have a 40% decreased risk of myocardial infarction. Functional in vivo studies in mice describes that overexpression of SORT1 in mouse liver tissue led to significantly lower LDL-cholesterol levels, as much as 80% lower, and that silencing SORT1 increased LDL cholesterol approximately 200% (Musunuru K et al. From noncoding variant to phenotype via SORT1 at the 1p13 cholesterol locus. Nature 2010; 466: 714-721).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0509" num="0508">Methods of the present disclosure may enhance polynucleotide delivery into a cell population, in vivo, ex vivo, or in culture. For example, a cell culture containing a plurality of host cells (e.g., eukaryotic cells such as yeast or mammalian cells) is contacted with a composition that contains an RNA molecule disclosed herein. The composition also generally contains a transfection reagent or other compound that increases the efficiency of RNA uptake into the host cells. The RNAs of the disclosure may exhibit enhanced retention in the cell population, relative to a corresponding natural polynucleotide. For example, the retention of the RNA of the disclosure is greater than the retention of the corresponding polynucleotide. In some embodiments, it is at least about 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 100%, 150%, 200% or more than 200% greater than the retention of the natural polynucleotide.

<heading id="h-0017">ADDITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE EXAMPLES OF FORMULATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0564" num="0563">Nanoparticle compositions may include a lipid component and one or more additional components, such as a therapeutic agent. A nanoparticle composition may be designed for one or more specific applications or targets. The elements of a nanoparticle composition may be selected based on a particular application or target, and/or based on the efficacy, toxicity, expense, ease of use, availability, or other feature of one or more elements. Similarly, the particular formulation of a nanoparticle composition may be selected for a particular application or target according to, for example, the efficacy and toxicity of particular combinations of elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0565" num="0564">The lipid component of a nanoparticle composition of the disclosure may include, for example, a lipid according to formula (I), a phospholipid (such as an unsaturated lipid, e.g., DOPE or DSPC), a PEG lipid, and a structural lipid. The elements of the lipid component may be provided in specific fractions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0566" num="0565">In some embodiments, the lipid component of a nanoparticle composition includes a lipid according to formula (I), a phospholipid, a PEG lipid, and a structural lipid. In certain embodiments, the lipid component of the nanoparticle composition includes about 30 mol % to about 60 mol % compound of formula (I), about 0 mol % to about 30 mol % phospholipid, about 18.5 mol % to about 48.5 mol % structural lipid, and about 0 mol % to about 10 mol % of PEG lipid, provided that the total mol % does not exceed 100%. In some embodiments, the lipid component of the nanoparticle composition includes about 35 mol % to about 55 mol % compound of formula (I), about 5 mol % to about 25 mol % phospholipid, about 30 mol % to about 40 mol % structural lipid, and about 0 mol % to about 10 mol % of PEG lipid.

In another particular embodiment, the lipid component includes about 40 mol % said compound, about 20 mol % phospholipid, about 38.5 mol % structural lipid, and about 1.5 mol % of PEG lipid. In some embodiments, the phospholipid may be DOPE or DSPC. In other embodiments, the PEG lipid may be PEG-DMG and/or the structural lipid may be cholesterol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0567" num="0566">Nanoparticle compositions may be designed for one or more specific applications or targets. For example, a nanoparticle composition may be designed to deliver a therapeutic agent such as an RNA to a particular cell, tissue, organ, or system or group thereof in a mammal's body. Physiochemical properties of nanoparticle compositions may be altered in order to increase selectivity for particular bodily targets. For instance, particle sizes may be adjusted based on the fenestration sizes of different organs. The therapeutic agent included in a nanoparticle composition may also be selected based on the desired delivery target or targets. For example, a therapeutic agent may be selected for a particular indication, condition, disease, or disorder and/or for delivery to a particular cell, tissue, organ, or system or group thereof (e.g., localized or specific delivery). In certain embodiments, a nanoparticle composition may include an mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest capable of being translated within a cell to produce the polypeptide of interest. Such a composition may be designed to be specifically delivered to a particular organ. In particular embodiments, a composition may be designed to be specifically delivered to a mammalian liver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0568" num="0567">The amount of a therapeutic agent in a nanoparticle composition may depend on the size, composition, desired target and/or application, or other properties of the nanoparticle composition as well as on the properties of the therapeutic agent. For example, the amount of an RNA useful in a nanoparticle composition may depend on the size, sequence, and other characteristics of the RNA. The relative amounts of a therapeutic agent and other elements (e.g., lipids) in a nanoparticle composition may also vary. In some embodiments, the wt/wt ratio of the lipid component to a therapeutic agent in a nanoparticle composition may be from about 5:1 to about 60:1, such as 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 11:1, 12:1, 13:1, 14:1, 15:1, 16:1, 17:1, 18:1, 19:1, 20:1, 25:1, 30:1, 35:1, 40:1, 45:1, 50:1, and 60:1. For example, the wt/wt ratio of the lipid component to a therapeutic agent may be from about 10:1 to about 40:1. In preferred embodiments, the wt/wt ratio is about 20:1. The amount of a therapeutic agent in a nanoparticle composition may, for example, be measured using absorption spectroscopy (e.g., ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0569" num="0568">In some embodiments, a nanoparticle composition includes one or more RNAs, and the one or more RNAs, lipids, and amounts thereof may be selected to provide a specific N:P ratio. The N:P ratio of the composition refers to the molar ratio of nitrogen atoms in one or more lipids to the number of phosphate groups in an RNA. In general, a lower N:P ratio is preferred. The one or more RNA, lipids, and amounts thereof may be selected to provide an N:P ratio from about 2:1 to about 30:1, such as 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 12:1, 14:1, 16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1, 24:1, 26:1, 28:1, or 30:1. In certain embodiments, the N:P ratio may be from about 2:1 to about 8:1. In other embodiments, the N:P ratio is from about 5:1 to about 8:1. For example, the N:P ratio may be about 5.0:1, about 5.5:1, about 5.67:1, about 6.0:1, about 6.5:1, or about 7.0:1. For example, the N:P ratio may be about 5.67:1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0018" num="0000">Physical Properties</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0570" num="0569">The characteristics of a nanoparticle composition may depend on the components thereof. For example, a nanoparticle composition including cholesterol as a structural lipid may have different characteristics than a nanoparticle composition that includes a different structural lipid. Similarly, the characteristics of a nanoparticle composition may depend on the absolute or relative amounts of its components. For instance, a nanoparticle composition including a higher molar fraction of a phospholipid may have different characteristics than a nanoparticle composition including a lower molar fraction of a phospholipid. Characteristics may also vary depending on the method and conditions of preparation of the nanoparticle composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0571" num="0570">Nanoparticle compositions may be characterized by a variety of methods. For example, microscopy (e.g., transmission electron microscopy or scanning electron microscopy) may be used to examine the morphology and size distribution of a nanoparticle composition. Dynamic light scattering or potentiometry (e.g., potentiometric titrations) may be used to measure zeta potentials. Dynamic light scattering may also be utilized to determine particle sizes. Instruments such as the Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) may also be used to measure multiple characteristics of a nanoparticle composition, such as particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0572" num="0571">The mean size of a nanoparticle composition of the disclosure may be between 10s of nm and 100s of nm.

In other embodiments, the mean size may be about 100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0573" num="0572">A nanoparticle composition of the disclosure may be relatively homogenous. A polydispersity index may be used to indicate the homogeneity of a nanoparticle composition, e.g., the particle size distribution of the nanoparticle compositions. A small (e.g., less than 0.3) polydispersity index generally indicates a narrow particle size distribution. A nanoparticle composition of the disclosure may have a polydispersity index from about 0 to about 0.25, such as 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, 0.20, 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, or 0.25. In some embodiments, the polydispersity index of a nanoparticle composition may be from about 0.10 to about 0.20.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0574" num="0573">The zeta potential of a nanoparticle composition may be used to indicate the electrokinetic potential of the composition. For example, the zeta potential may describe the surface charge of a nanoparticle composition. Nanoparticle compositions with relatively low charges, positive or negative, are generally desirable, as more highly charged species may interact undesirably with cells, tissues, and other elements in the body. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of a nanoparticle composition of the disclosure may be from about −10 mV to about +20 mV, from about −10 mV to about +15 mV, from about −10 mV to about +10 mV, from about −10 mV to about +5 mV, from about −10 mV to about 0 mV, from about −10 mV to about −5 mV, from about −5 mV to about +20 mV, from about −5 mV to about +15 mV, from about −5 mV to about +10 mV, from about −5 mV to about +5 mV, from about −5 mV to about 0 mV, from about 0 mV to about +20 mV, from about 0 mV to about +15 mV, from about 0 mV to about +10 mV, from about 0 mV to about +5 mV, from about +5 mV to about +20 mV, from about +5 mV to about +15 mV, or from about +5 mV to about +10 mV.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0575" num="0574">The efficiency of encapsulation of a therapeutic agent describes the amount of therapeutic agent that is encapsulated or otherwise associated with a nanoparticle composition after preparation, relative to the initial amount provided. The encapsulation efficiency is desirably high (e.g., close to 100%). The encapsulation efficiency may be measured, for example, by comparing the amount of therapeutic agent in a solution containing the nanoparticle composition before and after breaking up the nanoparticle composition with one or more organic solvents or detergents. Fluorescence may be used to measure the amount of free therapeutic agent (e.g., RNA) in a solution. For the nanoparticle compositions of the disclosure, the encapsulation efficiency of a therapeutic agent may be at least 50%, for example 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%. In some embodiments, the encapsulation efficiency may be at least 80%. In certain embodiments, the encapsulation efficiency may be at least 90%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0576" num="0575">A nanoparticle composition disclosed herein may optionally comprise one or more coatings. For example, a nanoparticle composition may be formulated in a capsule, film, or tablet having a coating. A capsule, film, or tablet including a composition of the disclosure may have any useful size, tensile strength, hardness, or density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0577" num="0576">As used herein, “treating” or “treat” describes the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating a disease, condition, or disorder and includes the administration of an active ingredient of the present disclosure to alleviate the symptoms or complications of a disease, condition or disorder, or to eliminate the disease, condition or disorder. The term “treat” can also include treatment of a cell in vitro or an animal model.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0578" num="0577">An active ingredient of the present disclosure, can or may also be used to prevent a relevant disease, condition or disorder, or used to identify suitable candidates for such purposes. As used herein, “preventing,” “prevent,” or “protecting against” describes reducing or eliminating the onset of the symptoms or complications of such disease, condition or disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0579" num="0578">As used herein, “combination therapy” or “co-therapy” includes the administration of an active ingredient of the present disclosure, and at least a second agent as part of a specific treatment regimen intended to provide the beneficial effect from the co-action of these therapeutic agents. The beneficial effect of the combination includes, but is not limited to, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic co-action resulting from the combination of therapeutic agents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0580" num="0579">A “pharmaceutical composition” is a formulation containing the active ingredient of the present disclosure in a form suitable for administration to a subject. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in bulk or in unit dosage form. The unit dosage form is any of a variety of forms, including, for example, a capsule, an IV bag, a tablet, a single pump on an aerosol inhaler or a vial. The quantity of active ingredient (e.g., a formulation of the disclosed compound or salt, hydrate, solvate or isomer thereof) in a unit dose of composition is an effective amount and is varied according to the particular treatment involved. One skilled in the art will appreciate that it is sometimes necessary to make routine variations to the dosage depending on the age and condition of the patient. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration. A variety of routes are contemplated, including oral, pulmonary, rectal, parenteral, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, inhalational, buccal, sublingual, intrapleural, intrathecal, intranasal, and the like. Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of an active ingredient of the disclosure include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. In one embodiment, the active compound is mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants that are required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0581" num="0580">As used herein, the phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to those compounds, anions, cations, materials, compositions, carriers, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0582" num="0581">“Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” means an excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such excipient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0583" num="0582">A pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), and transmucosal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfate; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates, and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0584" num="0583">An active ingredient of the present disclosure can be administered to a subject in many of the well-known methods currently used for chemotherapeutic treatment. For example, for treatment of cancers, an active ingredient of the present disclosure may be injected directly into tumors, injected into the blood stream or body cavities or taken orally or applied through the skin with patches. The dose chosen should be sufficient to constitute effective treatment but not so high as to cause unacceptable side effects. The state of the disease condition (e.g., cancer, precancer, and the like) and the health of the patient should preferably be closely monitored during and for a reasonable period after treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0585" num="0584">An “effective amount” of the polynucleotides (e.g., RNA or mRNA) or multimeric structures disclosed herein is based, at least in part, on the target tissue, target cell type, means of administration, physical characteristics of the polynucleotide (e.g., size, and extent of modified nucleosides) and other components of the multimeric structures, and other determinants. In general, an effective amount of RNA or the multimeric structure provides an induced or boosted peptide production in the cell, preferably more efficient than a composition containing a corresponding unmodified polynucleotide encoding the same peptide or about the same or more efficient than separate mRNAs that are not part of a multimeric structure. Increased peptide production may be demonstrated by increased cell transfection (i.e., the percentage of cells transfected with the multimeric structures), increased protein translation from the polynucleotide, decreased nucleic acid degradation (as demonstrated, e.g., by increased duration of protein translation from a modified polynucleotide), or altered peptide production in the host cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0586" num="0585">The mRNA of the present disclosure may be designed to encode polypeptides of interest selected from any of several target categories including, but not limited to, biologics, antibodies, vaccines, therapeutic proteins or peptides, cell penetrating peptides, secreted proteins, plasma membrane proteins, cytoplasmic or cytoskeletal proteins, intracellular membrane bound proteins, nuclear proteins, proteins associated with human disease, targeting moieties or those proteins encoded by the human genome for which no therapeutic indication has been identified but which nonetheless have utility in areas of research and discovery. “Therapeutic protein” refers to a protein that, when administered to a cell has a therapeutic, diagnostic, and/or prophylactic effect and/or elicits a desired biological and/or pharmacological effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0587" num="0586">The term “therapeutically effective amount”, as used herein, refers to an amount of a pharmaceutical agent to treat, ameliorate, or prevent an identified disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or inhibitory effect. The effect can be detected by any assay method known in the art. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject's body weight, size, and health; the nature and extent of the condition; and the therapeutic or combination of therapeutics selected for administration. Therapeutically effective amounts for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation that is within the skill and judgment of the clinician. In a preferred aspect, the disease or condition to be treated is cancer. In another aspect, the disease or condition to be treated is a cell proliferative disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0588" num="0587">For any compound, the therapeutically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays, e.g., of neoplastic cells, or in animal models, usually rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans. Therapeutic/prophylactic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED<sub>50 </sub>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD<sub>50 </sub>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, LD<sub>50</sub>/ED<sub>50</sub>. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0589" num="0588">Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active agent(s) or to maintain the desired effect. Factors which may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, general health of the subject, age, weight, and gender of the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and tolerance/response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or once every two weeks depending on half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0590" num="0589">In certain embodiments, compositions in accordance with the present disclosure may be administered at dosage levels sufficient to deliver from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 0.05 mg/kg, from about 0.005 mg/kg to about 0.05 mg/kg, from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 0.005 mg/kg, from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg, from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, or from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic, or imaging. The desired dosage may be delivered three times a day, two times a day, once a day, every other day, every third day, every week, every two weeks, every three weeks, or every four weeks. In certain embodiments, the desired dosage may be delivered using multiple administrations (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, or more administrations). When multiple administrations are employed, split dosing regimens such as those described herein may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0591" num="0590">The pharmaceutical compositions containing active ingredient of the present disclosure may be manufactured in a manner that is generally known, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and/or auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically. Of course, the appropriate formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0592" num="0591">Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, and sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0593" num="0592">Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0594" num="0593">Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0595" num="0594">For administration by inhalation, the active ingredient of the present disclosure is delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser, which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0596" num="0595">Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0597" num="0596">More examples of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, dosage forms, kits, routes of administration, and methods of treatment can be found in WO 2015051173 and WO 2015051169, the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0650" num="0656">A sensor chip (SAD5001 or SA) was docked into a Biacore 3000 instrument, washed with 50 mM NaOH, 1M NaCl. Protein eIF4E was diluted in running buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM TCEP) to ˜1 μM. The diluted protein solution was injected for 300-600 seconds. Typical capture levels were 5000-6000 RU.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0651" num="0657">Test compounds were solubilized in ddH<sub>2</sub>O or DMSO to 10 mM. 100 μM stocks were prepared by 100-fold dilution in running buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Assay was run with or without 1% DMSO.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0652" num="0658">Data were analyzed in GeneData. Curve fit was accepted or rejected by looking at the resulting sensorgrams and steady state fits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0653" num="0659">Assay Validation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0654" num="0660">eIF4E protein was captured according to the above procedure and a set of 7-methyl (m7) guanosine phosphate compounds (m7GMP, m7GDP, m7GTP) as well as a compound with an extra guanosine residue after the tri phosphate chain (m7GTPG) were injected in dose response. Assay has been validated using running buffer with and without DMSO. It was found that surface activity and K<sub>d </sub>for m7GTP is not affected by DMSO. It was also found that the surface is extremely stable (continuous use for &gt;6 weeks resulted in 5-10% loss of surface activity). Further, newly captured protein stabilizes slowly, leading to negative responses during the dissociation phase for compounds injected over newly captured protein.</div>

<heading id="h-0046">Example 4: Kinetic Cell Free In Vitro Translation Assay and Cap Competition Assay</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0657" num="0663">The in vitro translation assay was conducted with the HeLa 1-step coupled IVT kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) according to the manufacturer's instructions to assess performance of new cap analogs as free compounds or as an integral part of capped mRNA. Cap analogs with affinity to eIF4E protein may reduce protein synthesis rate in cell-free translation. Further, RNAs containing such cap analogs (“Cap-modRNA”) show different potency of protein synthesis in cell-free translation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0658" num="0664">The modified RNAs (“modRNAs”) of eGFP and mCitrine-degron, harboring chemical modifications on either the CAP structures, selected ribose units and/or the bases, were diluted in sterile nuclease-free water to a final amount of 500 ng in 5 uL. This volume was added to 20 uL of freshly prepared HeLa Lysate. The in vitro translation reaction was done in a standard 96-well round bottom plate (Corning, Corning, N.Y.), covered with an self-adhesive fluorescence-compatible seal (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.) at 30° C. inside the plate reader Cytation 3 (BioTek, Winooski, Vt.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0659" num="0665">The fluorescent signal per reaction increased over time and is considered proportional to the occurring protein synthesis. Each cell-free translation reaction was monitored for 120-180 min with the following settings: eGFP protein—ex. 485 nm, em. 515 nm, gain 80; mCitrine-degron protein—ex. 515, em. 545, gain 70 or 80. The height of the reading head was set to 1 mm above the plate and a reading speed of one per sample every 17 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0660" num="0666">For competition assays, the total volume of the cell-free translation reaction was increased to 27.8 uL by addition of either water or diluted free CAP analogs in water. The stock concentration of the free CAP analogs was 1 mM. With two-fold dilutions in water, the concentration was reduced sequentially. After cell-free translation reaction, modRNA (e.g., an m7GpppG(2′-Om) capped mRNA (i.e., a Cap1-tipped mRNA) coding for eGFP) and diluted CAP analogs were combined, the titration curve had a final concentration of 100 uM, 50 uM, 25 uM, 12.5 uM, 6.25 uM, 3.12 uM and 0 uM of free CAP analogs. The CAP analogs used in this study were either commercial products serving as reference material (TriLink, San Diego, Calif.) or compounds disclosed herein. It is hypothesized that the small molecule cap analogs interfere with the assembly of the “closed loop” in a K<sub>d</sub>-dependent fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0661" num="0667">After the fluorescent signal in cell-free translation reaction reached a stable plateau, absolute values thereof were transferred to a statistical analysis program (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Calif.) and curve fitting or IC<sub>50 </sub>calculations were derived with settings according to the instructions of the manufacturer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0662" num="0668">The results from the cap competition assay are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this study, the modRNA used comprises 1-methyl-pseudouridine, which replaces each uridine in the RNA sequence and 5-methyl cytidine, which replaces each cytidine in the RNA sequence. Further, Table 4 below includes the IC<sub>50 </sub>values of certain compounds of the disclosure.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0673" num="0713">mRNAs encoding hEPO are synthesized according to the method described in Example 2 above, co-transcriptionally incorporating cap analogs of the disclosure. As in the study of Example 5, each of the mRNAs carrying various caps (e.g., Cap1, ARCA, or cap analogs disclosed herein) also comprises 5-methoxy uridine, which replaces each uridine in the RNA sequence. A MC3-based lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation of the synthesized mRNA is produced, and is intravenously administered to CD-1 mice (n=3) at a bolus dose of 0.05 mg/kg. The level of hEPO was tested at 6 h, 24 h, or 48 h after injection. Table 7 shows the normalized hEPO levels measured at 6 h after injection, in which, mRNA carrying Compound 7 is unmethylated at 2′-OH of the penultimate guanosine (Cap0-like) while all other caps are Cap1-like, i.e., containing the structure of pppG(2′-Om).</div>
