<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 62/397,823, filed on Sep. 21, 2016, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to the field of robotic surgery and more specifically to user console system</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Computer-assisted and robotic surgery systems allow healthcare practitioners to achieve greater accuracy, automation and/or less-invasive approaches while performing a variety of diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures. Such technologies are broadly applicable to a variety of medical specialties, ranging from ophthalmology and anesthesiology, to orthopedics and interventional radiology. Some computer-assisted systems provide image-guided navigation to improve the accuracy of invasive procedures, while other systems incorporate sophisticated robotics and visualization technology for performing minimally invasive surgeries that can lead to reduced scarring and shorter recovery times. One example of a minimally invasive surgery is a laparoscopic procedure, which typically involves creating a number of small incisions in the patient (e.g., in the abdomen), and introducing one or more tools and at least one camera through the incisions into the patient. The surgical procedure is then performed by using the introduced tools, with the visualization aid provided by the camera. In robotic or robotic-assisted surgery, at least some of the introduced instruments may be attached to one or more robotic arms operated remotely (e.g., in tele-operation) by a user (e.g., surgeon). Thus, it is desirable to have a user console system through which a user may control the introduced tools and/or camera used in robotic surgery.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, a user console for controlling a remote surgical robotic instrument may include an adjustable ergonomic seat assembly comprising a seat pan, a display configured to receive real time surgical information, and one or more controls for remotely controlling the robotic instrument. The display may include, for example, an open display (e.g., a monitor mounted on stand) and/or an immersive display. The display or the one or more controls may have multiple positions, and change position automatically according to a seating profile associated with at least one user. For example, the display or the one or more controls may position automatically according to any of a plurality of seating profiles associated with a plurality of users. In some variations, the display and/or the one or more controls may additionally or alternatively change position automatically according to a surgical procedure type, and/or their positions may be manually adjustable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In some variations, the user console may have multiple configurations, such as a seated configuration, an elevated configuration, and a reclined configuration. Various aspects of the display, the seat assembly (e.g., seat pan, seat back, headrest coupled to the seat back), and/or the one or more controls may be positioned differently for different configurations. For example, the display and/or the one or more controls may be in a higher position when the seat assembly is in the elevated configuration than when the seat assembly is in the seated configuration. As another example, the seat pan may have a higher anteverted position in the elevated configuration than in the seated configuration. The seat back may have multiple angular positions relative to the seat pan, and in some variations a posterior end of the seat pan may be more posterior than a lower end of the seat back when the seat assembly is in the elevated configuration than when the seat assembly is in the seated configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The one or more controls for remotely controlling the robotic instrument may include, for example, a handheld user interface device. In some variations, the user console may include a docking station configured to releasably hold the handheld user interface. As another example, the one or more controls for remotely controlling the robotic instrument may include a foot-operated control, such as a foot pedal assembly. In some variations, the foot pedal assembly may be configured to adjustably tilt posteriorly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In some variations, the user console may include a base, where the foot pedal assembly and the seat assembly are mounted on the base and may be adjusted relative to the base. For example, the foot pedal assembly and/or the seat assembly may be configured to translate along the base.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The user console may, in some variations, include one or more armrests coupled to the seat assembly. The armrest may have multiple positions and change position automatically according to the seating profile associated with at least one user. For example, the armrest may have a more superior position relative to the seat pan when the seat assembly is in the elevated configuration than when the seat assembly is in the seated configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">A control panel may be provided on or near the one or more armrests, or in any suitable location on or near the user console. The control panel may receive user information. User information from the control panel or another suitable interface may, for example, be used to identify the user in the user console and obtain user console settings from a seating profile associated with the user. As another example, the user may enter user characteristics, such as anthropometric data, through the control panel (or other suitable interface, such that a seating profile for the user may be generated automatically based at least in part on the entered anthropometric data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In some variations, the user console may include a console controller configured to detect the presence or absence of a user in the user console. For example, the console controller may detect the presence or absence of a user based on an eye-tracking algorithm, and/or based on at least one sensor (e.g., pressure sensor) in the user console. The information relating to the presence or absence of a user in the user console may, in some variations, be used a safety interlock, such that the one or more controls is disabled in response to the console controller detecting the absence of a user.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Non-limiting examples of various aspects and variations of the invention are described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">Robotic-Assisted Surgical System Overview</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Generally, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a user console <b>100</b> may be part of a robotic-assisted surgical system for interfacing with a robotic system <b>112</b>. The robotic system <b>112</b> may include one or more robotic arms <b>114</b> located at a surgical platform (e.g., table, bed, etc.), where end effectors or surgical tools are attached to the distal ends of the robotic arms <b>114</b> for executing a surgical procedure. A user (such as a surgeon or other operator) may use the user console <b>100</b> to remotely manipulate the robotic arms <b>114</b> and/or end effectors (e.g., tele-operation). The user console <b>100</b> may be located in the same procedure room as the robotic system <b>112</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. In other embodiments, the user console <b>100</b> may be located in an adjacent or nearby room, or tele-operated from a remote location in a different building, city, or country. The communication between the user console <b>100</b> and the robotic system <b>112</b> may be wired and/or wireless, and may be proprietary and/or performed using any of a variety of data communication protocols.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In one example, the user console <b>100</b> comprises an adjustable ergonomic seat <b>102</b>, a pedal assembly <b>104</b>, one or more user interface devices <b>106</b>, and a user display <b>108</b> configured to display a view of the surgical site inside a patient. A user located in the seat <b>102</b> and viewing the user display <b>108</b> may manipulate the pedal assembly <b>104</b> and/or user interface devices <b>106</b> to remotely control the robotic arms <b>114</b> and/or end effectors. At least one armrest <b>116</b> may be provided and supported by the display mount <b>118</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and/or coupled to the seat <b>102</b>, as shown in other variations herein. One or more secondary displays <b>120</b>, which may, for example, display similar content as the user display <b>108</b>, may also be provided so that an anesthesia provider <b>122</b> and/or other staff members <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> can monitor the surgical procedure, provide assistance or respond to any issues, etc. A monitor <b>128</b> which can display vital signs may be switchable to the same view as provided on the secondary display <b>120</b> and/or include a picture-in-picture of video feed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The pedal assembly <b>104</b> and/or user interface devices <b>106</b> may also be used to control other aspects of the user console <b>100</b> or robotic system <b>112</b>, including adjusting or configuring the seat <b>102</b>, the pedal assembly <b>104</b>, the user interface device <b>106</b>, and/or the user display <b>108</b>, for example.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">As further described below with reference to additional examples, the seat assembly may comprise one or more adjustable features, including but not limited to seat rotation, seat height, seat tilt, seat back tilt, headrest height, headrest tilt. The armrest may be configured with adjustable armrest height, anterior/posterior position, and/or medial/lateral rotation, and where separate left/right armrests are provided, each armrest may be independently configurable. The armrest in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is coupled to the display mount <b>118</b>, but in other examples may be coupled to the seat assembly. The adjustable seat features may be manually adjustable by the user and/or motorized, may be computer-controlled, with the configuration or profile configured to be stored and recalled via a seat controller, or some combination of both. Access to the seat controller may be performed through the user display <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">During an exemplary procedure or surgery, the patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion, and anesthesia is achieved. Initial access to the surgical site may be performed manually with the robotic system <b>112</b> in a stowed configuration or withdrawn configuration to facilitate access to the surgical site. Once access is completed, initial positioning and/or preparation of the robot system may be performed. During the surgical procedure, a surgeon or other user in the user console <b>100</b> may utilize the pedal assembly <b>104</b> and/or user interface devices <b>106</b> to manipulate various tools and/or imaging systems to perform the procedure. Manual assistance may also be provided at the procedure table by sterile-gowned personnel <b>124</b>, who may perform tasks including but not limited to retracting organs, or performing manual repositioning or tool exchange involving one or more robot arms <b>114</b>. Non-sterile personnel <b>126</b> may also be present to assist the surgeon <b>110</b> at the user console <b>100</b>. When the procedure or surgery is completed, the robotic system <b>112</b> and/or user console <b>100</b> may be configured or set in a state to facilitate one or more post-operative procedures, including but not limited to robotic system <b>112</b> cleaning and/or sterilization, and/or healthcare record entry or printout, whether electronic or hard copy, such as via the user console <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the robotic arms <b>114</b> are shown with a table-mounted system, but in other embodiments, the robotic arms may be mounted in a cart, ceiling or sidewall. The communication between the robot system <b>112</b>, the user console <b>100</b> and other displays <b>120</b>, <b>128</b> may be via wired and/or wireless connection(s). Any wired connections may be optionally built into the floor and/or walls or ceiling. In still other variations, the user console <b>100</b> does not include an integrated display <b>108</b>, but provides a video output that can be connected to one or more generic displays, including remote displays accessible via the internet or other network. The video output or feed may also be encrypted to ensure privacy and all or portions of the video output may be saved to a server or electronic healthcare record system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In the example depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the user console <b>100</b> utilizes a chair or seat assembly <b>102</b>, which has a separate base <b>132</b> from the pedal assembly <b>104</b> or the display mount <b>118</b>. In other examples, such as the user console <b>150</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a seat assembly <b>152</b> may be integrated on a common base <b>154</b> with a pedal assembly <b>156</b> and display mount <b>158</b>, armrest <b>160</b> and display <b>162</b>, or otherwise be in communication with these components. The communication may be wired and/or wireless. Other variations of a user console <b>100</b> are described in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In other examples, additional user consoles <b>100</b> may be provided, to control additional surgical tools, and/or to take control of one or more tools at the primary user console. This will permit, for example, a surgeon to take over or illustrate a technique during a surgical procedure with medical students and physicians-in-training, or to assist during complex surgeries requiring multiple surgeons acting simultaneously or in a coordinated manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">User Console</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">As described herein, a user console for controlling a remote surgical robotic instrument may provide a highly ergonomic, adjustable system from which a user may comfortably control a remote surgical robotic instrument. For example, the user console may be adjustable (e.g., automatically and/or manually) according to a seating profile associated with the user, surgical procedure type, and/or other parameters or settings. Additionally, the user console may facilitate easy, fast entry and/or exit by the user into the user console. For example, upon an indicated desire for entry/exit into the user console, the user console may automatically adjust to a configuration (e.g., to an elevated configuration, as described below) that a user can easily step into or step out of. Furthermore, the user console may be suitable for sterile use (e.g., use in the operating room).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Generally, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a user console <b>300</b> for controlling a remote surgical robotic instrument includes an adjustable ergonomic seat assembly <b>310</b>, a display <b>350</b> configured to receive real time surgical information, and one or more controls <b>340</b> for remotely controlling the robotic instrument. As described further below, the seat assembly <b>310</b> may be selectively configurable in a plurality of user console configurations (e.g., seated, reclined, elevated). In some variations, other components of the user console (e.g., display, controls, etc.) may similarly have multiple positions or configurations corresponding to the user console configurations, where the other components automatically adjust their positions or configurations in response to a selected seat assembly configuration. Furthermore, one or more of the components of the user console may automatically adjust their relative positions and/or orientations according to a seating profile associated with at least one user, as further described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2G</figref>, a user console <b>200</b> for controlling a remote surgical robotic instrument may include a base <b>202</b>, a seat assembly <b>204</b> coupled to a posterior region of the base <b>202</b>, and a display <b>208</b> coupled to an anterior region of the base <b>202</b>. These and other components and their variations are further described below. In one variation, the base <b>202</b> may be omitted such that the user console includes <b>200</b> includes a seat assembly <b>204</b> separate and modular from the display <b>208</b>. In another variation, the display <b>208</b> as described herein may be optional, as the seat assembly <b>204</b> may be combined with a generic display or may be provided separately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Since robotic instruments and equipment are typically sensitive to magnetic fields that may interfere with functionality, at least some of the user console may be made of plastic, foam, and other non-conductive materials. The user console may additionally include extra sensors to detect disruptions in the magnetic field in the room, so that personnel may take remedial steps to reduce interference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">Base</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The base in the user console may function to provide support for adjustable relative positioning of the seat assembly and/or display, and/or other components. The base may be adjustable in at least one dimension (e.g., length and/or width). For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 29B</figref>, the base <b>2802</b> may be expandable/extendible and retractable/collapsible along an anterior-posterior direction. For example, in an expanded/extended configuration (e.g., while the user console is occupied or otherwise being used by a user) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>, the base <b>2802</b> may include an anterior base portion <b>2809</b> that extends out of a posterior base portion <b>2807</b>. In a retractable/collapsible configuration (e.g., for storage and/or transport) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>, the anterior base portion <b>2809</b> may retract or collapse into the posterior base portion <b>2807</b> (or vice versa), which brings display assembly <b>2808</b> closer to the seat assembly <b>2804</b> and reduces the overall footprint of the user console. For example, anterior base portion <b>2809</b> may slide into an internal cavity or recess of the posterior base portion <b>2807</b> via a guiderail or other suitable track system. The extendibility and/or collapsibility of the base <b>2802</b> may be manually actuated (e.g., by a user pulling the two base portions apart, or pushing the two base portions together) and/or actuated with a leadscrew mechanism or other suitable actuator assembly. In some variations, the overall length of the base in its collapsed configuration (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>) may be between about 50% and about 100%, or between about 65% and about 85%, of the overall length of the base in its extended configuration (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In some variations, the base <b>2802</b> may include one or more transport wheels <b>2847</b> for contacting a ground surface. The wheels may, for example, help improve overall mobility of the cart. In some variations, at least some of the wheels may be selectively deployable relative to the base <b>2802</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>, when the user console is in use and the base is in an extended configuration, wheels <b>2847</b> may be retracted or otherwise disposed within the base <b>2802</b> and not in contact with a ground surface. In this configuration, static feet <b>2822</b> (e.g., pegs, etc.) coupled to and extending from an underside of the base <b>2802</b> may be in contact with the ground surface to support the user console (alternatively, the static feet <b>2822</b> may be omitted such that the underside of the base <b>2802</b> may contact the ground surface). Additional anterior wheels <b>2848</b> coupled to the anterior base portion <b>2809</b> may still contact the ground to facilitate base length adjustment in an anterior-posterior direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">When the user console is to be transported or moved, the wheels <b>2847</b> may be deployed to raise the base <b>2802</b> above the ground surface. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A and 29B</figref>, the wheels may be deployed (and base may be raised) such that the wheels <b>2847</b> extends beyond the static feet <b>2822</b> and/or leading wheels <b>2848</b>, and the entire user console is supported by the wheels <b>2846</b> and <b>2847</b>. With the user console supported by the wheels, the base <b>2802</b> may more easily be moved for storage and/or transport, etc. In this configuration shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>, the wheels <b>2848</b> and anterior base portion <b>2809</b> are raised off the ground, such that the anterior portion of the base may more easily navigate over obstacles, thereby enabling the user console to more easily overcome obstacles on the ground (e.g., cables, debris, steps, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">To restore the user console for an expanded “use” configuration, the wheels <b>2847</b> may be returned to a retracted position within the base. Locks and/or brakes may be engaged to help maintain the user console in the desired base configuration and/or location on the ground. In some variations, the wheels may be deployed and/or retracted via a hydraulic actuator system, or any suitable actuator system (e.g., gear train, handcrank or foot pedal system, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Additionally, when the base is adjusted to its collapsed configuration, the seat assembly and/or the display may further be adjusted such that the overall user console occupies a smaller volume. For example, the seat assembly and the display may be moved to lower positions. Generally, collapsibility may be useful for situations such as, for example, transportation between different locations (e.g., to and from the operating room, within an operating room, between hospitals, etc.) and for compact storage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In another exemplary variation shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C-2G</figref>, the base <b>202</b> may include a posterior portion <b>206</b> and an anterior portion <b>210</b>. The base may be relatively flat or level along its length, at least on a bottom surface to interface with the ground. Like the base <b>2802</b> described above, the base <b>202</b> may be adjustable in at least one dimension (e.g., length and/or width), such as with extendibility and collapsibility between an anterior base portion <b>209</b> and a posterior base portion <b>207</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> illustrates a collapsed configuration, with the anterior base portion <b>209</b> retracted into the posterior base portion <b>207</b>. Furthermore, other portions of the user console may collapse or fold to take up less volume, to reduce likelihood of damage during storage or transport, etc. For example, the support arm for the immersive display and/or an armrest (represented by volumes <b>221</b> and <b>222</b>, respectively) may fold into more compact configurations, when the base is collapsed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> or whenever not in use. When being prepared for use during a surgical procedure, the base may expand into an extended configuration, similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C-F</figref>. Similar to that described above, the base may include wheels <b>246</b> and/or <b>247</b> and may include locks or brakes that may be engaged to help keep the user console in a stationary location.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">However, in some variations the base may be omitted (e.g., the seat pan, seat back, and/or other seat assembly components described below may be coupled to one another directly).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">Seat Assembly</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The seat assembly in the user console is preferably ergonomic and adjustable. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2G</figref>, a seat assembly <b>204</b> may comprise a seat support <b>214</b> attached to the base <b>202</b>, with a seat shell <b>216</b> which is movably coupled to the seat support <b>214</b>. A seat pan <b>218</b> (or seat bottom) and seat back <b>220</b> (or backrest) are coupled to the seat shell <b>216</b>, but in other examples, the seat pan or seat back may be coupled to each other and/or to the seat support <b>214</b>, without utilizing a seat shell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The seat support <b>214</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2G</figref> comprises a single pillar, but in other examples, the seat support may comprise two or more pillars. The seat support <b>214</b> has a longitudinal axis <b>242</b>, depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, that is angled posteriorly, but in other variations, may be angled vertically straight upward or tilted anteriorly. In some variations, the pillar angle, as measured between the pillar and the base plane anterior to the pillar, is in the range of about 80 degrees to about 160 degrees (e.g., about 150 degrees such that the angle between the pillar and the base plane posterior to the pillar is about 30 degrees), but in other examples may be in the range of about 90 degrees to about 135 degrees, or about 95 degrees to about 120 degrees. In the example depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2F</figref>, the seat support <b>214</b> has a fixed orientation relative to the base <b>202</b>, but in other variations, the seat support may be configured to change its angle relative to the base, and/or to translate in the anterior-posterior directions and/or in the lateral directions. In some further variations, the seat support <b>214</b> may be configured to telescope or otherwise extend or retract longitudinally or generally vertically. In some examples, a posteriorly angled or tilted seat support may be beneficial to accommodate taller persons by not only providing vertical separation of the seat pan or back from the base, but also providing posterior separation of the seat pan or back from the pedal assembly or display assembly. In some variations, the position of the seat assembly <b>204</b> along the seat support <b>214</b> may be controlled by an actuator assembly (e.g., leadscrew coupled to one or more actuators, pulley assembly, other suitable gear assembly, hand-crank mechanism, etc.), and/or may be manually moved along the seat support <b>214</b> (e.g., by a user lifting or pushing the seat assembly <b>204</b>). The position of the seat assembly <b>204</b> along the seat support <b>214</b> may be selectively locked with a brake mechanism, latch (e.g., pin), etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In some variations, a seat swivel position (e.g., rotational position around a vertical plane) may be adjusted by rotating the seat support <b>214</b> position relative to the base <b>202</b> of the user console. For example, a seat swivel position may be locked with a suitable locking mechanism, such as a brake, a latch (e.g., pin) or other suitable device. A lever, button, or other clutch mechanism may disengage the locking mechanism to enable a user to adjust the swivel position of the seat assembly <b>204</b> (e.g., manually or by shifting his or her weight while sitting in the seat). The base and/or seat support <b>214</b> may include one or more detents that enable secure positioning of the seat assembly <b>204</b> in one of a plurality of discrete swivel positions (e.g., left, center, right). Additionally or alternatively, the interaction of the base and/or seat support <b>214</b> may include a mechanism for enabling a continuous range of swivel positions, such as a friction-damped joint that requires application of at least a threshold amount of force to swivel the seat assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">In another exemplary variation, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, a user console <b>900</b> is similar to user console <b>200</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2F</figref>, except as described below. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the seat back <b>920</b> defines a longitudinal cavity or slot <b>915</b> that receives seat support <b>914</b>, which extends through seat shell <b>916</b> from the base <b>902</b>. The longitudinal cavity may provide clearance for the seat support <b>914</b> as the seat assembly adjusts to different heights and angles. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9E</figref>, when the seat assembly is in a seated configuration, the seat shell <b>916</b> may be at a moderate height such that a moderate (e.g., about half) length of the longitudinal cavity <b>915</b> is engaged with the seat support <b>914</b>. As the seat assembly is generally lowered (e.g., in a reclined configuration), the seat shell <b>916</b> may be a lower height and more of the longitudinal cavity <b>915</b> may be engaged with the seat support <b>914</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10E</figref>. In contrast, as the seat assembly is generally raised (e.g., in an elevated configuration), the seat shell <b>916</b> may be at a higher height and less of the longitudinal cavity <b>915</b> may be engaged with the seat support <b>914</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11E</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In some variations, the seat assembly may include at least one armrest. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the seat assembly <b>204</b> may further include an armrest <b>222</b> that is coupled to the seat shell <b>216</b>, seat pan <b>218</b> or seat back <b>220</b>. As previously described, the at least one armrest may also be coupled to the display mount, or other suitable location on the assembly. As another example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the seat assembly may include two or more armrest assemblies <b>1222</b>, including a left armrest assembly and a right armrest assembly. The armrest assemblies <b>1222</b> may be coupled to respective left and right sides of the seat back <b>1220</b> in an adjustable manner (e.g., hinge joint to provide vertical pivoting, screw joint, cylindrical joint, etc.). For instance, the armrest assemblies <b>1222</b> may be vertically translatable in a prismatic joint to enable armrest height adjustment relative to the seat back <b>1220</b> by moving along slots <b>1223</b>. In other variations, the proximal end of the armrest assembly may be mounted to a seat pan, seat back, and/or other suitable portion of the seat assembly. The armrest may additionally include straps, bars, or other supporting structures passing over the arm of the user, which may help secure the user's arms in place.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The armrest may be collapsible (e.g., on or against the sides of the seat assembly) and extendible (e.g., along the front of the seat assembly) to allow user access to the seat assembly and to secure the user in the seat assembly, respectively. For example, the armrest <b>222</b> may collapse against the side of a seat shell <b>216</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, and extend anteriorly across the seat assembly as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C-2F</figref>. Furthermore, one or more armrests may swing laterally outward, with or without collapsing, to allow user access to the seat assembly. The armrest may be curved (e.g., with a concavity facing inward toward the seat) or otherwise shaped to facilitate lateral outward motion, which may allow a user to force the armrest to swing laterally outward by pushing with a forearm, stomach, etc. (e.g., to maintain sterility of the user's hands).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The armrest may include a plurality of links connected by joints. The joints of the armrest may comprise any of a variety of joints, including pin joints, fork joints, and planar or sliding pin-in-slot joints, ball-in-socket joints, and the like. One or more joints may be controlled by one or more motors, brakes, and/or clutches, so that the desired armrest configuration may be saved and/or automatically set. Force sensors may be provided to sense and reduce impingement by a motor driven joint on the user. Each joint may also include position sensors or encoders to determine the position of one more joints of the armrest. The joint information may be used to determine, or confirm of the armrest, and/or to set or change the configuration or state of the user console or robotic system, e.g. in pause state, user entry state, user exit state, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">For instance, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B and 12C</figref>, each armrest assembly <b>1222</b> may include a set of multiple articulated links (e.g., <b>1222</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1222</b> <i>b</i>, <b>1222</b> <i>c</i>, etc.) that are serially and pivotally connected and configured to enable a folded configuration and an unfolded configuration or vary an effective extended length. Each armrest assembly <b>1222</b> may be mounted or coupled to a left or right side of the seat assembly or other suitable location. For example, the armrest assembly <b>1222</b> may be coupled to a side of the seat assembly via proximal support <b>1224</b> which is rotatably coupled to a link such as <b>1222</b> <i>a</i>, or fixedly mounted to a side of the seat assembly via a mounting plate with fasteners. In the folded configuration (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>), the armrest links <b>1222</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1222</b> <i>b</i>, <b>1222</b> <i>c </i>are collapsed and stacked on top of each other in a compact pose on their respective sides of the seat assembly. The relative lengths of the links may be designed to facilitate efficient folding. For example, the second link <b>1222</b> <i>b </i>may be shorter than first link <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>so as to permit the second link <b>1222</b> <i>b </i>to rotate completely over the first link <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>without encountering mechanical interference with the proximal support <b>1224</b>. When both left and right armrest assemblies are in the folded configuration, the seat assembly is open and more easily accessible by a user to sit down in the seat assembly. From the folded configuration, the armrest links may at least partially pivotally unfold as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, such as into the unfolded configuration. In the fully unfolded configuration, such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the distal ends of the armrest assemblies <b>1222</b> may point toward one another, so as to encircle a user that is seating in the seat assembly. Different amounts of arm rest extension may be appropriate as unfolded configurations for different user console configurations, different users (e.g., depending on girth or weight), etc. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B and 12C</figref> depict an armrest assembly <b>1222</b> with three arm links, in other variations, the armrest assembly may include three, four, or any suitable number of articulated links for enabling various desired armrest configurations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Movement between the folded and unfolded configurations may be controlled manually and/or with one or more actuators (e.g., stepper motors or servomotors) and may be controlled automatically. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12D and 12E</figref>, a pivot joint between two arm links <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1222</b> <i>b </i>may include an actuator <b>1230</b> with shaft <b>1232</b>. The two arm links <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1222</b> <i>b </i>may be coupled with a pin joint or other rotatable joint. For instance, the distal end of first link <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>may include a circular hub configured to rotatably engage with a circular recess in the proximal end of second link <b>1222</b> <i>b </i>(e.g., with a bearing, a tongue-and-groove fit or other key, etc.). Additionally, the circular hub on the distal end of first link <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>may house the body of actuator <b>1230</b> and the proximal end of link <b>1222</b> <i>b </i>may be coupled to the shaft <b>1232</b> (e.g., press-fit, pins, epoxy, etc.) directly or indirectly such as with gears, chains, cables, or other drive coupling mechanisms. When the actuator <b>1230</b> receives suitable commands for folding or unfolding, the actuator <b>1230</b> may cause link <b>1222</b> <i>b </i>to pivot relative to link <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>by a prescribed angle and/or rate. The armrest assembly <b>1222</b> may include an actuator for some or all of its articulated joints (e.g., link <b>1222</b> <i>c </i>may be similarly actuated to pivot relative to link <b>1222</b> <i>b</i>). Actuators may periodically or intermittently command the armrest assembly to move a prescribed amount (e.g., slightly with micromovements) to reduce fatigue in the user's arms over an extended period of time during a surgical procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The armrest assemblies may be locked or secured in the unfolded configuration (or a partially unfolded configuration) to help secure a seated user in the seat assembly (e.g., the armrest assemblies may resist at least up to certain amount of force, such as a user pushing the armrest assemblies outward before collapsing). For example, the actuator <b>1230</b> at an articulated joint between two arm links <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1222</b> <i>b </i>may be commanded in a “lock” position, such as backdriving when sensing a user force in a particular direction, and/or brakes (not pictured) may be engaged to hold the armrest assemblies in the unfolded configuration. As another example, the distal ends of left and right armrest assemblies may touch and/or lock mechanically to one another, and conversely be related (e.g., with a button, a latch mechanism) so as to secure the armrest assemblies in the unfolded configuration or release the armrest assemblies from the unfolded configuration. The joints may be moved and maintained or locked into a desired position, for example, using a mechanism such as friction fit joints, detents, or a joint with a releasable friction fit or mechanical interlock. However, the “lock” position or locking mechanism, if present, may be overcome by a user force exceeding a certain threshold value such that a user may urgently break out of the seat assembly in the case of emergency or if otherwise needed. Additionally or alternatively, the user console may include an emergency mode (engageable by button, clutch, voice command, etc.) that automatically disables all “lock” positions or locking mechanisms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In other variations, the seat assembly may include only one armrest assembly that is mounted on one side (e.g., left or right) of the seat assembly and is extendable to a length that spans at least most of the width of the seat assembly, or the seat assembly may include one or more armrests that are configured to extend or otherwise move in an overhead approach (e.g., over the back of the seat back). Other variations of collapsible and extendible arms are also contemplated. For instance, at least one arm link may additionally or alternatively translate relative to another link to facilitate collapsibility and extendibility, such as with telescoping links and/or sliding pin joints. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13D</figref>, for example, an armrest assembly <b>1322</b> may include a first link <b>1322</b> <i>a</i>, a second link <b>1322</b> <i>b</i>, and a third link <b>1333</b> <i>c</i>, which pivot relative to one another similar to armrest assembly <b>1222</b> described above. However, additionally, second link <b>1322</b> <i>b </i>or another link may translate relative to the first link <b>1322</b> <i>a </i>(e.g., via sliding pin joint) to provide an additional degree of freedom for more configuration flexibility in the armrest assembly. For instance, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> depicts the second link <b>1322</b> <i>b </i>in a longitudinally extended, slightly midline angled position and with the third link <b>1322</b> <i>c </i>in a medial transverse orientation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> depicts the second link <b>1322</b> <i>b </i>in a longitudinally aligned, extended position relative to the first link <b>1322</b> <i>a</i>, and the third link <b>1322</b> <i>c </i>also in a longitudinally aligned, extended position in a forward orientation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref> depicts the second link <b>1322</b> <i>b </i>in a longitudinally aligned, at least partially retracted position relative to the first link <b>1322</b> <i>a</i>, such that a portion of the third link <b>1322</b> <i>c </i>is overlying the first link <b>1322</b> <i>a</i>. Like the armrest assembly <b>1222</b>, one or more of the joints between arm links in the armrest assembly <b>1322</b> may be actuated with a respective actuator and be configured for automatic control. Other variations of armrest assemblies may incorporate different numbers of links, as well as other combinations of sliding pin joints and/or non-sliding pin joints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In an exemplary variation shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, an arm support linkage <b>1400</b> may be coupled to or adjacent a seat assembly. The arm support linkage <b>1400</b> may be movable between a folded configuration (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>) and at least one unfolded configuration (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>). For example, the folded configuration may be suitable for permitting a user to enter and exit the user console, or for purposes of storage and/or transport, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">One or more various unfolded configurations may correspond to a desired position of the arm support for a user, depending on a user characteristic (e.g., user size such as height, weight, or girth) and/or a surgical task characteristic (e.g., type of surgical procedure that the user is performing with the robotic surgical system). Generally, the unfolded arm support may be configured with adjustable arm support height, anterior/posterior position, and/or medial/lateral rotation, and where separate left/right arm supports are provided, each arm support may be independently configurable. The adjustable arm support features may be manually adjustable by the user and/or motorized, or may be automatically configurable and computer-controlled. Adjusted arm support configurations and settings may be stored in memory as part of a profile associated with a particular user and/or type of user, with the configuration(s) or profile configured to be stored and recalled via a seat controller. Access to the seat controller may be performed, for example, through a user display or touchscreen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">One or more of the unfolded configurations may furthermore help provide an enclosure in front of the user when the user is positioned in the seat assembly, thereby securing the user in the seat assembly. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> depict only one arm support linkage <b>1400</b> adjacent to the seat assembly, it should be understood that in some variations, at least two arm support linkages may be adjacent to the seat assembly. For example, the user system may include first and second arm support linkages coupled to or otherwise adjacent to opposite sides of the seat assembly. The first and second arm support linkages may be mirrored versions of each other (e.g., a left-side arm support linkage and a mirrored right-side arm support linkage which unfold generally toward the centerline of the seat assembly).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The arm support linkage <b>1400</b> in a user console may include a linkage assembly including a proximal segment <b>1410</b>, an intermediate segment <b>1420</b>, and a distal segment <b>1430</b>. The proximal segment <b>1410</b> may be attached to the seat assembly (e.g., on the side of the seat, with a wraparound fixture to a backset of the seat, or with a wraparound fixture to an underside of the seat, etc.), either directly or through an intervening base structure such as one or more additional proximal segments that attaches to the seat in a similar manner. In other examples, the arm support linkage <b>1400</b> may be coupled to the ground (e.g., coupled to a base resting on the ground), or to another portion of the user console. In some variations, the linkage assembly may include fewer or more segments. The segments may be connected by pivotable joints. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14C and 14D</figref>, the proximal segment <b>1410</b> and the intermediate segment <b>1420</b> may be coupled at joint <b>1412</b> such that the proximal and intermediate segments may move relative to one another at joint <b>1412</b>. Similarly, the intermediate segment <b>1420</b> and the distal segment <b>1430</b> may be coupled at joint <b>1422</b> such that the intermediate and distal segments move relative to one another at joint <b>1422</b>. Accordingly, articulation of the joints <b>1412</b> and <b>1422</b> may enable the arm support linkage to move between folded and unfolded configurations as desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In some variations, the arm support linkage may include a SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) linkage that is articulated along parallel axes, such as parallel axes passing through joints <b>1412</b> and <b>1422</b> (e.g., such that the arm support linkage is generally compliant in an X-Y direction via rotation around the parallel axes but substantially rigid in a Z-direction). For example, the intermediate segment <b>1220</b> may rotate relative to the proximal segment <b>1410</b> via joint <b>1412</b> in an X-Y direction, and the distal segment <b>1430</b> may rotate relative to the intermediate segment <b>1420</b> via joint <b>1222</b> in an X-Y direction. However, joints <b>1412</b> and <b>1422</b> are shown as pin joints collectively providing 2 degrees of freedom, such that joints <b>1412</b> and <b>1422</b> substantially prevent movement of the intermediate segment <b>1420</b> and the distal segment <b>1430</b> in a Z-direction. In other variations, the arm support linkage may include any suitable kind of linkage (e.g., providing three or more degrees of freedom, including telescoping linkage segments, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">In some variations, all of the segments of the arm support linkage may generally rotate within the same plane. In other variations, at least one segment of the arm support linkage may generally rotate in a separate respective plane (e.g., that is offset from other segments with spacers, etc.). For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, the proximal segment <b>1410</b> and the intermediate segment <b>1420</b> may generally be rotatable in the same plane, while the distal segment <b>1430</b> may generally be rotatable in a different plane than the proximal segment <b>1410</b> and the intermediate segment <b>1420</b>. In other words, the intermediate segment <b>1420</b> may rotatable within a first plane via the pin joint <b>1412</b>, and the distal segment <b>1430</b> is rotatable within a second plane via the pin joint <b>1422</b>, where the second plane is parallel and offset from the first plane. In other variations, the arm support linkage may include any suitable linkage (e.g., a linkage that is articulable in at least two orthogonal planes).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The seat assembly may further include a headrest. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2F</figref>, the seat assembly <b>204</b> may include a headrest <b>224</b> attached to a superior portion of the seat back <b>220</b>. Alternatively, the headrest may be coupled to the seat back with a hinge joint, one or more longitudinal members, extendible bellows or accordion arrangement, extendible telescoping arrangement, etc. In some variations, a headrest portion of the seat assembly <b>310</b> may be coupled to a seat back via a hinge joint or other suitable joint to facilitate adjustment in the angle of the headrest portion relative to the seat back. The headrest pad may be movably coupled (e.g., along at least one track or rail) to the headrest portion to adjust height of a resting location for the user's head. Accordingly, as illustrated in the schematic of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, height adjustment and angle adjustment for the headrest may be decoupled from one another, allowing for more combinations of headrest height and angles. As with other aspects of the user console, the height of the headrest may be adjusted manually or automatically, based on user configurations, profiles, and/or preferences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In some variations, the headrest (or a portion of the seat assembly near the headrest) may include audio equipment. For example, the headrest may include a microphone and/or speaker embedded in or coupled to the headrest, such as for enabling communication with personnel (e.g., assistants outside the room or otherwise located at a remote location) to direct commands, receive instructions, provide noise-cancelling functionality, etc. The audio equipment may additionally or alternatively be coupled with a wired or wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth protocol) to auxiliary devices, such as a telephone or the display assembly, such as for participating in telephone conversations, listening to music, etc. In another example, there may be provided a headset with a microphone and/or speaker that is wearable by the user and coupled to the headrest via a wired or wireless communication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">The surfaces of the seat pan, seat back, headrest and armrests, if any, may comprise a hard surface, and/or a soft surface, including a foam or gel cushion, cover or structure. The surface may be porous or closed, and the cushion or structure may be configured to be removably attachable to the rest of the seat pan, seat back, headrest and/or armrests. The attachment may be performed using hook and loop fasteners, buttons, snaps, zippers, laces, tongue-and-groove interlocks, and the like. Depending on the type of attachment, the user may select from a variety of cushion types, shapes and styles that can be used with the seat assembly, and may also be able to manually adjust the positioning of the cushion, e.g. with hook and loop fasteners. In other examples, one or more of these cushions may be circular, oval, or a polygonal shape. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> depict one example of a seat assembly <b>800</b> with a bottom seat shell <b>802</b>. Coupled to the seat shell <b>802</b> is a seat pan <b>804</b> with a bottom cushion <b>806</b>, a seat back <b>808</b> with a back cushion <b>810</b> and a headrest cushion <b>812</b>. The bottom cushion <b>806</b> and the headrest cushion <b>812</b> may comprise a rectangular shape, and back cushion <b>810</b> may have a tapered shape from bottom to top. In this variation, each of the cushions <b>806</b>, <b>810</b>, <b>812</b> comprises rounded corners and rounded edges, but in other examples they may have squared corners and/or edges. In some other examples, the back cushion and headrest cushion may be integrated, as can the bottom cushion and the back cushion, for example. Armrest cushions <b>814</b> may also be provided. These armrest cushions <b>814</b> can be located at the distal regions of a multi-link armrest <b>816</b>, with a proximal support <b>818</b> movably coupled to an intermediate support <b>820</b> and a distal support <b>822</b>. The armrest cushions <b>814</b> may have an arcuate or angled configuration, but in other examples, may comprise a straight or other shape, such as an oval or paddle shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-17E</figref> depict exemplary variations of seat assemblies. In these variations, the seat assemblies are similar in that each has a seat support <b>1714</b> that articulates along a posterior recess of a seat shell <b>1716</b>, and the seat pan and seat back <b>1704</b> are coupled to the seat shell <b>1716</b>, as well as a pair of armrests <b>1722</b>. Additionally, the seat assemblies include a headrest <b>1730</b>. However, the shapes and relative sizes of the various seat assembly components may vary. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, the seat back <b>1704</b> may have a wider inferior portion that generally linearly tapers to a narrower superior portion, and the headrest portion <b>1730</b> may include a cushion that extends laterally wider beyond either side of a superior portion of the seat back <b>1704</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the seat back <b>1704</b> may be approximately the same width along its length such that an inferior portion of the seat back <b>1704</b> is about the same width as a superior portion of the seat back <b>1704</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, the seat back <b>1704</b> may include a generally wider square or rectangular inferior portion, a linearly tapering intermediate portion, and a narrower superior portion by headrest <b>1730</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>, the seat support <b>1714</b> and seat back <b>1704</b> may have generally curvilinear profiles instead of linear, angular profiles. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref>, the seat back <b>1704</b> may be similar to the seat back of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> except that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17E</figref> depicts a slightly narrower seat back <b>1704</b>, with cushions for headrest <b>1730</b> and seat back <b>1704</b> both extending laterally wider beyond either side of the seat back <b>1704</b>. In other variations, different sizes and/or shapes of the components of the seat assembly may be combined in any suitable manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Various components of the seat assembly may be adjustable to provide ergonomic and other mechanical customizations for a particular user or user type. In addition to longitudinal or vertical movement of the seat assembly with respect to the seat support, other seat adjustment movements, including but not limited to seat shell rotation around its own vertical axis or around the seat support, seat shell forward/backward tilting relative to the seat support, seat pan forward/backward tilting, seat pan anterior/posterior translation, seat back forward/backward tilting, seat back vertical translation, seat back forward/backward tilting, seat back anterior/posterior translation, headrest vertical translation, headrest forward/backward tilting, headrest anterior/posterior translation, armrest proximal lateral rotation, armrest distal lateral rotation, armrest vertical translation, and/or other seat assembly adjustments may be provided. These and other movements are described in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to the exemplary embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2F</figref>, the adjustments to the seat assembly <b>204</b> may be performed manually by the user, and/or may be performed automatically by a controller via one or more actuators or drive motors. The controls may be provided by one or more physical buttons, sliders or switches on the seat assembly <b>204</b>, pedal assembly <b>212</b>, the display assembly <b>208</b>, and/or an auxiliary display or panel <b>234</b>. The controls may also be manipulated via the user interface devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">The actuators or drive motors, if any, for the adjustment mechanisms in the seat assembly may be located in the seat shell, pillar(s), base, seat pan, seat back, or other location in the seat assembly or the user console. Adjustment mechanisms may be directly driven by a motor, or may be mechanically connected by one or more gears, belts, chains, or linkages. The actuators may be any of variety of suitable motors, including DC motors with or without brushes, and/or synchronous or induction AC motors, solenoid actuators, and the actuators may be backdriveable or non-backdriveable, for example. In some examples, one motor may be configured for use with multiple adjustment mechanisms, using a clutch or transmission system. For example, a single motor provided in the seat support <b>214</b> may be used for longitudinal adjustment of the seat assembly <b>204</b>, but may also be used for adjustments of the pedal assembly <b>212</b> and/or the display assembly <b>208</b>, via belts, chains or other mechanical linkages. In other examples, however, the pedal assembly <b>212</b> and/or display assembly <b>208</b> may comprise additional motors for performing the adjustments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">The seat assembly may include sensors (e.g., position sensors, joint encoders) to monitor and/or confirm the mechanical adjustments being performed. These sensors may also be used in a calibration procedure and/or safety check. For example, one or more of the adjustments may be brought though its range of adjustment or a test range of motion to confirm or test proper function. In systems in which one or more motors are coupled to a cable, chain, gear, or other drive mechanism to transfer force to a location away from the motor shaft, one or more sensors may be located in a variety of locations through the drive mechanism, such as to identify any elasticity, laxity, slippage, creep, etc. in the drive mechanism. Upon detecting such characteristics in the drive mechanism, the system may provide compensatory forces to achieve the desired mechanical adjustment, and may provide an error or warning message if the expected mechanical adjustment is not detected. In some variations, the seat assembly may include one or more sensors (e.g., pressure sensors, position sensors detecting chair swivel) that indicates the presence or absence of a user in the seat assembly. Other mechanisms in the seat assembly, such as vibration motors, may be provided to provide haptic feedback to the user indicating status of various components of the user console, robotic instrument, etc. For example, the seat assembly may vibrate in the seat pan, seat back, headrest, armrest, etc. to indicate warnings such as when a user interface device (described below) is exceeding its trackable workspace.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">One or more of the adjustment mechanisms for the seat assembly <b>204</b> may include a locking mechanism to maintain the configuration of the adjustment mechanism once it is set by the user. In some examples, a non-backdriveable motor may be provided, and a locking mechanism may or may not be provided. The locking mechanism may be a friction brake or a releaseable mechanical interlock, such as a locking pin mechanism. A counter-weight or counter-balance mechanism for may also be provided to reduce the load on the motor or user during seat adjustment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">Controls</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">The user console may include one or more controls or user interface devices for remotely controlling a robotic instrument and/or controlling other aspects of the system. The controls may, for example, may be manipulated by a user to operate a robotic arm, operate an end effector attached to an end of a robotic arm, operate the user console for adjustments, operate or navigate a graphical user interface, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In one variation, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the user console <b>100</b> includes at least one hand-operated control or user interface device, such as one or more user interface devices (e.g., a pair including a left controller and a right controller), which are tracked in 3-dimensional space over time. Other hand-operated controls may include, for example, joysticks, graspers, pincers, etc. The user interface devices <b>106</b> may be wired or wireless, may include one or more accelerometers in one or more axes, and may be tracked via any of a variety of mechanisms, including but not limited electromagnetic tracking or optical tracking, using active and/or passive emitters. Transmitters for the hand-operated control may be located, for example, on the user console base, on the armrest or headrest or other portion of the seat assembly, and/or any other suitable portion of the user console. The controllers <b>106</b> may include haptic feedback mechanisms, as well as mechanical or touch actuators to facilitate further manipulation of the robotic system <b>112</b>, or various controls and adjustment settings of the user console <b>100</b> itself. For example, in some variations, the controllers <b>106</b> may be used to test or confirm spatial registration of surgical tools (robotic tools, manual tools, etc.) by providing short vibrational impulses, etc. as tactile feedback to the user. Additionally, the controllers <b>106</b> may be used to provide a form of user identification (e.g., gesture-based or biometric identification through fingerprints).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">In some variations, the one or more user interface devices may be permanently or releasably mounted to a docking station (e.g., on an armrest in front of the seated user, a secondary platform), to another suitable user interface device mount or receptacle (e.g., hooks, cups) and/or independently handheld by the user. For example, the armrest in the user console may include a mount portion for docking at least one user interface device. For example, a user interface device may be placed in the mount portion when the user (e.g., surgeon) desires to take a break from teleoperating the robotic surgical system with the user interface device (e.g., to rest or to switch between different operating techniques), and/or for storage or transportation purposes. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14C and 14D</figref>, an arm support linkage <b>1400</b> may include a mount portion <b>1624</b> coupled to the intermediate segment <b>1620</b>. The mount portion <b>1624</b> may include a cradle, tray, recess, hook, or other receptacle for receiving a user interface device <b>1428</b>. The mount portion <b>1624</b> may be integrally formed (e.g., through injection molding) with the intermediate segment <b>1620</b>, or may be formed separately and coupled to the intermediate segment <b>1620</b> via fasteners, threads, snap-fit, other suitable interference fit, or in any suitable manner. In other variations, the mount portion may be integrally formed with or coupled to any other suitable portion of the arm support linkage or user console. In some variations, the mount portion (or another portion proximate the mount portion) may include one or more sensors for detecting whether a user interface device is docked in the mount portion. For example, proximity sensors, electromagnetic sensors interacting with the user interface device, or any suitable sensor may be used to determine whether a user interface device is docked. In variations in which the user console includes mounting locations for more than one user interface device (e.g., more than one docking location on a single arm support linkage, or more than one arm support linkage each with a respective docking location), the one or more sensors may be used to detect which of the multiple user interface devices are docked and/or whether all of the multiple user interface devices are docked. The one or more sensors may additionally or alternatively determine whether a user interface device is properly docked (e.g., in a secure manner, or with a left-side user interface device docked on a left-side arm support linkage and a right-side user interface device docked on a right-side arm support linkage).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">The mount portion may be hidden (e.g., relatively inaccessible to the user) when the arm support linkage is in the folded configuration and exposed (e.g., relatively accessible to the user) when the arm support linkage is in the unfolded configuration. Since the user may be required to unfold the arm support linkage in order to expose the user interface device and enable the user to retrieve the docked user interface device, such a selectively hidden mount portion may, for example, encourage or remind the user to use the arm support linkage in its unfolded configuration when using the user interface device for control a robotic surgical system, thereby improving ergonomics, reducing user fatigue, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">As another example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14E and 14F</figref>, a docking station <b>1442</b> may be coupled to an armrest <b>1440</b>. The docking station <b>1442</b> may be tucked into a recess in the armrest <b>1440</b> or otherwise collapse when the user interface devices are not in use (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref>), and then slide out of the recess in the armrest <b>1440</b> or otherwise extend when the user interface devices are used during a procedure (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F</figref>). Additionally or alternatively, the user interface devices may be removable from the docking station. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14G</figref>, a user interface device <b>1450</b> may be lifted from a resting place (e.g., in a recess <b>1446</b> in the docking station <b>1442</b>) to be independently handheld by the user. Any wires connected to the user interface device <b>1450</b> may pass through channel <b>1444</b> in order to completely remove the user interface device <b>1450</b> from the docking station <b>1442</b>. When the user interface device is not in use (e.g., after the surgical procedure is complete or during a break in the procedure), the user interface device <b>1450</b> may be returned to its resting place. The docking station <b>1442</b> or other device holder may include sensors (e.g., pressure sensor, conductive sensor) to detect when the user has set down one or more controls, where the user console may use the readout of these sensors to change the operating state of the robotic system or user console. The docking station or other device holder may also include electrodes, an induction coil, or other power charging device for charging the user interface devices when placed on the holder, if needed. In other variations, the docking station or other mount may additionally or alternatively be used to hold other devices, such as user's cellphone or portable music player.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">As another example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, a docking station <b>1512</b> may be coupled to a display support <b>1516</b> (such as those described further below). The docking station <b>1512</b> may, for example, include a tray extending toward the seating assembly. Like the docking station <b>1442</b>, the docking station <b>1512</b> may include resting places for the user interface devices <b>1450</b>. The docking station <b>1512</b> may be adjustable, such as by being able to extend toward the seat assembly, rotate around the display support <b>1516</b>, tilt left and right laterally, tilt anteriorly-posteriorly, etc. Additionally, the docking station <b>1512</b> may fold up, such as for storage purposes or to increase workspace of a user manipulating the user interface devices in space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">In other variations, the controls may include one or more foot-operated controls for controlling the robotic surgical instrument and/or controlling the user console. For example, a foot-operated control may be used to control an end effector (e.g., pinching, grasping, cutting, etc.) on the end of a robotic arm. As another example, a foot-operated control may be used to control part of the user console, such as for adjusting the position and/or orientation of the seat assembly (e.g., transitioning between a seated configuration, a reclined configuration, an elevated configuration, and/or other seat configurations), armrests, headrests, display assembly, immersive display assembly, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">One variation of foot-operated controls includes a pedal assembly. The pedal assembly may be generally located in front of the seat assembly such that the foot-operated controls are accessible by the feet of the user when the user is seated in the seat assembly. The pedal assembly may have a variety of configurations, with any suitable foot-operated controls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a pedal assembly may include a pedal tray <b>1610</b> and one or more pedals <b>1620</b> coupled to the pedal tray <b>1610</b>. The number, style, and/or organization of pedals <b>1620</b> may be based on functional type (e.g., for controlling an end effector, for controlling or adjusting the user console, etc.). In other examples, the pedal assembly may additionally or alternatively include other foot-operated controls such as foot switches, touchpads, force plates, joysticks and/or other control mechanisms. Some of the foot-operated controls may include force feedback as a form of haptic feedback. Some of the foot-operated controls may be disabled for certain kinds of surgical procedures, depending on the need for certain kinds of controls. The pedal tray <b>1610</b> may be configured to be adjustable manually and/or automatically by motor in the anterior/posterior direction and/or vertically, and/or also to have an adjustable angle. For example, a pedal tray <b>1610</b> may include a pedal plate <b>1612</b> that is configured to move angularly relative to the bottom of the pedal tray.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">In other examples, the pedal assembly may comprise two or more separate adjustable pedal trays, one for each foot, or for each foot control mechanism. Alternatively, each foot control mechanism may be adjustable relative to its pedal tray. In addition to adjustment of the pedal location in the anterior/posterior direction and the pedal tilt angle, other adjustments that may be configured include pedal resistance(s) globally through an entire movement range or subrange of movement, and the radial orientation of the pedal tray or foot control mechanism. The adjustment of the radial orientation may reduce foot or leg fatigue in the user by accommodating any natural internal or external rotation of the user's leg, as well as any supination or pronation bias in the foot. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, the pedal assembly <b>252</b> may fold down (or recede into a recess in the base, etc.), so as to facilitate storage or transportation of the user console in a compact configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">The pedal assembly may be mounted to or otherwise coupled to other components of the user console, or may be separate and independent or otherwise modular from other components of the user console. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2F</figref>, the pedal assembly <b>212</b> may be mounted to an anterior portion of base <b>202</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">In other variations, the user console may additionally or alternatively include other controls for remotely controlling a robotic system or instrument and/or a user interface, such as one or more keyboards, mice, trackballs, voice control, headtracking, gesture tracking, eye tracking (e.g., with sensors located on or near a display monitor such as an open display and/or immersive display as described below, which are configured to track motions of the head, hands, eyes, etc.) and the like. Other mechanisms, such as actuated springs, vibration motors, etc. may additionally or alternatively be provided to provide haptic feedback to the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">Displays</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">The user console may further include one or more displays for providing and/or receiving information from a user. For example, at least one display may be configured to receive real time or near real time surgical information. For example, the display may receive and show video feed from a camera instrument inserted in a body cavity of the patient, where the camera instrument may provide a field of view of the surgical site, such as during a surgical procedure utilizing end effectors controlled via the user console. Additionally, the display may enable (e.g., via eye tracking, headtracking, gesture tracking, etc.) control of the robotic a robotic instrument and/or controlling other aspects of the system, such as for operating a robotic arm, operating an end effector attached to an end of a robotic arm, operating the user console for adjustments, operating or navigating a graphical user interface, etc. Furthermore, the display may be connectable to other auxiliary devices, such as a user's cellphone or portable music player, such that the user may interact with the auxiliary device through the display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In some variations, the one or more displays in the user console may be configured to display surgical and/or other medical information (e.g., patient vitals, medical records, real-time information such as endoscopic images, etc.), enable communication via other medical personnel in the room or remote third parties, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">Open Display</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">In some variations, the display includes an open display (e.g., monitor display or screen). For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2F</figref>, a display assembly <b>208</b> includes a display pillar or support <b>226</b>, a display mount <b>228</b>, and one or more open display panels <b>230</b> which may be attached directly to the display mount <b>228</b> or via a display shell or frame <b>232</b>. The display panels <b>230</b> may have any of a variety of resolutions (e.g. WXGA, SXGA, SXGA+, WXGA+, WUXGA, QWXGA, QXGA, QHD, QSXGA, QXGA+, 4K UHD, DCI 4K, HXGA, WHXGA, HSXGA, WHSXGA) and refresh rates (e.g., 24 Hz, 30 Hz, 50 Hz, 60 Hz, 120 Hz, 240 Hz), and may have a horizontal or vertical orientation. In the particular arrangement depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the display assembly <b>208</b> comprises a central horizontal display panel, and a vertical display panel to each side of the central display panel, which are mounted on display shell <b>232</b>. In some variations, one or more of the panels <b>230</b> may be configured for 3D viewing. 3D viewing may be configured for viewing using active shutter glasses or passive polarizing lens (e.g., to provide passive 3D views without the need for specialized glasses). In other variations, one or more panels may comprise an autostereoscopic lenticular technology that does not require use of eyewear. An open monitor display may be dual-faced in that a front side may face a user in the seat assembly, while a back side may face the rest of the room to enable other surgical personnel to observe a video feed simultaneously with the user feed on the front side of the display. In some examples comprising a pedal tray, such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, the display support may be a double pillar design with sufficient space between the pillars to accommodate the pedal tray being adjusted in translation, which may provide a larger movement range for the pedal tray in the anterior direction, and/or allow the user's legs to extend between the pillars (e.g., for a tall user, or when the seat assembly is in the reclined configuration as described in further details below).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-17E</figref> depict variations of a display <b>1708</b>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18E</figref> depict variations of a display support <b>1826</b>. These variations are similar in that the display <b>1708</b> may be a three-panel display (or more panels) including a main central panel and two side panels, where the display is supported by a display support <b>1826</b> with double pillars or members. The main panel may have a horizontal orientation and the two side panels may have a vertical orientation, but in other examples, each panel may be configured as a horizontal or vertical display, and/or each panel may be rotated as needed. The display <b>1708</b> may additionally or alternatively be configured to rotate or pivot with all three panels together (e.g., for reducing glare). However, the display <b>1708</b> may alternatively include any suitable number of panels (one, two, four, etc.). The shape of the display support <b>1826</b>, for example with respect to the display support pillars, may vary. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the display support <b>1826</b> may include a generally trapezoidal opening formed by a wider base, linearly tapering pillars, and a narrower superior portion. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, the display support <b>1826</b> may include a generally square or rectangular opening formed at least in part by a base and two vertical support pillars. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, the display support <b>1826</b> may include another generally polygonal opening formed at least in part by support pillars having a vertical portion and a linear tapering portion. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref>, the display support <b>1826</b> may be similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> in that they both define generally trapezoidal openings between the display pillar supports, except that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref> depicts an opening between support pillars that has a curvilinear, rounded convex upper perimeter. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref> depicts a display support <b>1826</b> similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, except that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref> the superior portion to which display <b>1708</b> mounts is narrower than that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">In yet other variations, the display may be independent of the user console. For example, the display may be wall-mounted or placed on a tabletop, surgical cart, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The display assembly <b>208</b> may be configured for one or more adjustments. For example, the display support <b>228</b> may be configured to be adjustable in the anterior/posterior direction, so that the user can set the desired viewing distance from the seat assembly <b>204</b>. To facilitate this movement, the display assembly <b>208</b> may have one or more wheels, low-friction sliders, or rollers <b>246</b> on its lower surface. The display assembly <b>208</b> may also be configured to vertical position adjustment along the longitudinal axis of the display support <b>228</b>, at the interface between the display support <b>226</b> and the display mount <b>228</b> or the display shell <b>232</b>. The display panels <b>230</b> or display shell <b>232</b> may also be configured to pivot laterally and/or tilt upward or downward. Like the seat assembly <b>204</b>, the display assembly <b>208</b> may be adjusted manually and/or by motorized control via dedicated control devices or via the open display <b>230</b>, secondary display <b>234</b> and/or immersive display <b>236</b> (described below). In some variations, the longitudinal movement path may not be a linear track. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the lower portion <b>248</b> of the display support <b>226</b> may be tilted toward the user, while the upper portion <b>250</b> is more vertical. This configuration tilts the display toward the user at lower display heights, while providing a neutral vertical display angle at upper display heights. This non-linear movement track may be provided in lieu of, or in addition to, any independent tilting mechanism provided between display mount <b>228</b> and the display support <b>226</b>. Adjustments of the display assembly may be independent of and/or correlated to adjustments of the seat assembly (e.g., the display assembly may automatically tilt to accommodate or track a tilting of the seat assembly).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">Immersive Display</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">In some variations, the user console may additionally or alternatively include an immersive display, such as a periscope or other head mounted display placed in contact with the user's face or head. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> for example, an immersive display <b>360</b> may be coupled to the seat assembly <b>310</b> via an immersive display support arm <b>362</b> that positions the immersive display <b>360</b> in front of the face of a user located in the seat assembly <b>310</b>, such that the user may directly view content in the immersive display <b>360</b> in an immersive manner (e.g., comfortably and ergonomically immerses the user into the display environment with reduced distractions from the user's peripheral field of view). The immersive display may display various information associated with the surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopic camera view of the surgical site, static images, GUIs, etc.) and/or robotic surgical system (e.g., status, system settings), and/or other suitable information in the form of 2D and 3D video, images, text, graphical interfaces, warnings, controls, indicator lights, etc. Unlike other immersive and virtual reality head-mounted devices, which rely entirely on motion of the head-mounted display to change the view of within the display and thus restrict the ability of head movements to control other instruments, the immersive display may enable the user to interact with displayed content using head gestures and other head/eye movements for control of the immersive display and operation of other instruments such as those in the robotic surgical system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The immersive display may be a virtual reality display or an augmented reality display (e.g., to show the operating room to the surgeon without requiring removal or disengagement from the immersive display, to show the surgeon with tracked icons where the surgical instruments have been at the surgical site), or capable of either configuration. The immersive display may be included in addition to a monitor, or either the monitor or the immersive display may be omitted from the user console. In variations in which both the open display/monitor and the immersive display are included in the user console, the immersive display may include an opening or transparent window that selectively permits “see-through” viewing of the open display (e.g., with a shutter that toggles between enabling view of the immersive display and view of the open display). Alternatively, the system may output any image or video signal to a generic display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Generally, in some variations, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, an immersive display <b>1900</b> may include a housing <b>1910</b> mounted to a support arm <b>1912</b> and configured to engage with a face of a user, at least one eyepiece (e.g., at least two eyepiece assemblies <b>1930</b> disposed in the housing and configured to provide a three-dimensional display), and at least one sensor (e.g., represented by sensor <b>1924</b> on a face frame <b>1922</b> configured to engage or be proximate to the face of the user). The sensor may, in some variations, enable operation of the robotic surgical system upon detection of a certain parameter (e.g., presence or absence of a user engaged with the immersive display <b>1900</b>, sufficient alignment of the user relative to the eyepiece assemblies <b>1930</b>, identification of the user as an authorized user of the robotic surgical system, etc.), etc. The support arm <b>1912</b> may be configured to bring the housing in position proximate to the user's face or head, and may be actuatable, such as for positioning, orienting, or otherwise moving the housing <b>1910</b> for ergonomic purposes. Additionally or alternatively, straps or similar attachment devices may be coupled to the immersive display to secure and/or align the housing <b>1910</b> to the user's face and/or head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">The one or more eyepieces can, for example, include a binocular view that may facilitate stereoscopic or 3D displays, etc., though in other examples an eyepiece may include a monocular view. The immersive display may include lenses to provide built-in vision correction for users who are near-sighted, far-sighted, astigmatic, etc. Sensors in the immersive display may provide eye-tracking for instrument controls, user identification, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">In some variations, the immersive display support arm may be mounted on a side of the seat back of the seat assembly and configured to approach the user from the side of the user console to facilitate user access to the immersive display. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2D</figref>, a proximal end of the immersive display support arm <b>240</b> may be coupled to a right side of the seat back, though alternatively the proximal end of the display support arm <b>240</b> may be coupled to a left side of the seat back (e.g., at about the height of the head rest <b>224</b>, though not necessarily). The proximal end of the immersive display support arm <b>240</b> may be configured to adjust vertically and/or rotationally, etc. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, the immersive display arm <b>240</b> may be configured to fold or collapse against the side of the seat assembly (or other mounting location of the arm <b>240</b>), so as to enable user access to the seat and/or facilitate storage or transport of the user console in a compact configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In other variations, a proximal end of the immersive display support arm may be fixedly coupled to a midline (or near midline) of the seat back and configured to approach the user from the side of the user console to facilitate user access to the immersive display. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, a proximal end of the immersive display support arm may be mounted (e.g., via fasteners, welded joint, mechanical locks, etc.) to a posterior surface of the seat back. As another example, a proximal end of the immersive display support arm may be adjustably coupled to a posterior surface of the seat back, such as with a prismatic or other joint that enables the immersive display support arm to adjust vertically, laterally and/or rotationally relative to the seat back. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A, 17B, and 17E</figref> depict a vertical sliding interface or prismatic joint between a recess <b>1750</b> of the seat back and a slider <b>1742</b> or other element on the proximal end of immersive display support arm <b>1740</b>. This sliding interface helps enable the immersive display support arm to adjust vertically. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17C and 17D</figref> depict a similar vertical sliding interface, except that the recess <b>1750</b> is narrower in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17C and 17D</figref> than in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A, 17B, and 17E</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">In yet other variations, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19B-19C</figref>, the immersive display may be coupled to the seat back with an overhead assembly including one or more support arms in a support frame <b>1930</b>. The support frame <b>1930</b> may be configured to approach the user from over the user's head as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19E</figref>, the support frame <b>1930</b> may swing overhead to behind the headrest or other portion of the seat back, and may fold down against the seat back (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19F</figref>) or collapse or recede into a cavity in the seat back, such as for storage purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The immersive display support arm may be articulated such that it is capable of moving with multiple degrees of freedom. For example, in one variation shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, an articulated immersive display support arm may include at least six degrees of freedom. In this paragraph, “horizontal” is meant in reference to being generally orthogonal to the seat back, while “vertical” is meant in reference to being generally parallel to the seat back. The support arm may include a proximal mount (e.g., similar to slider <b>1742</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>) coupled by a first rotational joint J<b>1</b>, such as a pin or fork joint, to a first link L<b>1</b>, where the first rotational joint J<b>1</b> is rotatable around a vertical joint axis to provide movement in a horizontal plane. The first link L<b>1</b> is coupled by a second rotational joint J<b>2</b> to a second link L<b>2</b>, and second link L<b>2</b> is coupled by a third rotational joint J<b>3</b> to a third link J<b>3</b>. The first, second and third rotational joints J<b>1</b>, J<b>2</b>, and J<b>3</b> are oriented along respective vertical rotation axes, and can permit adjustment of the immersive display without significant restriction at a desired location generally in a horizontal plane around the headrest region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Further configurational flexibility may be provided by the third link L<b>3</b> being coupled by a fourth rotational joint J<b>4</b> to a fourth link L<b>4</b>, where the fourth rotational joint J<b>4</b> is rotatable around a horizontal axis to provide movement in a vertical plane. The fourth link L<b>4</b> may be further coupled by a fifth rotational joint J<b>5</b> to a fifth link L<b>5</b>, where the fifth rotational joint J<b>5</b> is rotatable around a horizontal axis to provide movement in a vertical plane. Furthermore, fifth link L<b>5</b> may be coupled by a sixth rotational joint J<b>6</b> to a sixth link or bracket member L<b>6</b>, where the sixth rotational joint J<b>6</b> is rotatable around a vertical axis to provide movement in a horizontal plane. The fourth, fifth, and sixth rotational joints J<b>4</b>, J<b>5</b>, and J<b>7</b> may generally permit vertical height adjustment of the immersive display such that in combination with the first, second, and third rotational joints J<b>1</b>, J<b>2</b>, and J<b>3</b>, all six rotational joints may help enable adjustments in various combinations of angular position changes in three-dimensional space (e.g., translation in X-Y-Z, rotation in yaw, roll, and pitch directions). The immersive display arm <b>1920</b> may, as the result of multiple articulated joints having a suitable number of degrees of freedom may, for example, enable arm rotation, arm extension/retraction, arm forward/backward tilting, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, an immersive display housing <b>1910</b> may be mounted to bracket member L<b>6</b> by a seventh rotational joint J<b>7</b>, where the seventh rotational joint J<b>7</b> is rotatable around a horizontal axis so as to allow a seventh degree of freedom for pivotable adjustment in a vertical plane (e.g., angling up or down).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">Some or all of the joints, such as the fourth and fifth joints J<b>4</b> and J<b>5</b>, may include friction brakes, active brakes, clutch, and/or other actuatable locking mechanisms to help lock the immersive display support arm into a particular configuration. Locking the immersive display support arm in place may, for example, help counter gravitational effects that might cause the immersive display housing <b>1910</b> and/or the immersive display support arm <b>1920</b> to collapse downward (e.g., onto the user, if the seat assembly is in a reclined configuration). Additionally or alternatively, some or all of the joints may be counterbalanced in order to prevent downward collapse when unsupported externally by a user, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">Manipulations of the pose (i.e., position and orientation of the arm) may be manually controlled and/or controlled with an actuator, and may be automatically controlled as with other aspects of the user console described herein. Some movements of the arm may be automatic (e.g., collapse or extension) in response to a trigger, such as determination of a user present in the seat assembly based on a user login or sensing a threshold weight in the seat assembly. Manual adjustments of the arm may involve disengaging a clutch (e.g., with a touch sensor, button, handle, etc.) that is configured to resist movement of the arm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">In other variations, the immersive display support arm may be one substantially static member. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref>, the display support arm <b>2520</b> may act as a cantilever arm to suspend the immersive display <b>2510</b> generally in front of the seat assembly. In yet other variations, the display support arm may include a member that swings laterally toward and away from a user in the seat assembly. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref>, before a user sits in the seat assembly and while the user is in the seat assembly but not utilizing the immersive display <b>2610</b>, the display support arm <b>2620</b> may swing laterally outward in an “out” position to keep the immersive display <b>2610</b> away from the face and head of the user. When the user is ready to view through the immersive display <b>2610</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26C</figref>, the display support arm <b>2620</b> may then swing laterally inward in an “in” position to keep the immersive display <b>2610</b> proximate to the face and head of the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">In some variations, the eyepiece and/or immersive display support arm may include one or more sensors to aid in collision avoidance. For example, at least one proximity sensor (e.g., ultrasound, laser, etc.) may be located in at least a portion of the eyepiece and/or immersive display support arm in order to detect potential collisions with the seat assembly (e.g., seat back, armrest, headrest), display monitor, the user's face or other body part, etc. Upon the detection of a potential collision, the user console may emit a warning, such as an audio tone, visual signal, tactile feedback through the seat assembly or user interface devices, etc., and/or the user console may automatically actuate the immersive display support to remain in a “hold” position or move in an opposite direction so as to avoid collision between the immersive display support arm and another object. The proximity sensor or sensors may additionally or alternatively be used to provide a comfortable engagement with the user's face through a dampened or slowed “soft landing” effect as the eyepiece and the user's face approach each other for engagement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">Auxiliary Display</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The user console may further include a secondary or auxiliary open display. For example, a secondary open display <b>234</b> may be attached to the side of the seat shell <b>216</b> of the seat assembly <b>204</b> with a support arm <b>238</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2F</figref>, but in other examples, one or more secondary open display may be coupled to the seat pan, the seat back, the headrest, the armrest, the seat support, the base, and/or the display support, mounted on the midline or side of these components. In another example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, a secondary open display <b>1534</b> may be located on a user interface platform <b>1512</b>. The secondary open display may be a touch screen device. In some variations, the display assembly may include adjustable mechanisms similar to those described above, which may provide, for example, secondary display panel vertical translation, secondary display panel lateral rotation, secondary display panel forward/backward tilting, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The secondary open display <b>234</b> and the immersive display <b>236</b> may be configured to replicate one or more displays or controls on a main display panel <b>230</b>, and/or may include other controls or images not provided on a main display panel <b>230</b>, or each other. For example, the secondary open display may be configured to prompt a user for user identifier information (e.g., user ID, password, passcode, etc. Additionally or alternatively, the user console may include a microphone, camera, fingerprint sensor, etc. to facilitate receipt of other user identifiers, through processes such as voice recognition, face recognition, and other biometric recognition such as iris code or fingerprint.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">Illustrative Variations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">A user console may include any combination or subcombination of the above-described structures. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>, a user console <b>2000</b> may include a base <b>2002</b> having a lower section and a front wall, a seat assembly <b>2010</b>, a pedal assembly <b>2040</b> coupled to the lower section of the base, and a display <b>2050</b> coupled to the front wall of the base (instead of a separate display support mount, etc.), but no user interface devices or immersive display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref>, a user console <b>2100</b> may be similar to user console <b>2000</b> described above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>, except that the user console <b>2100</b> may include a base <b>2102</b> that has a lower section on which pedal assembly <b>2140</b> is located, a rear wall, and a side wraparound wall. The user console <b>2100</b> may, for example, facilitate a side entry based on the location of the wraparound wall. A display <b>2150</b> may be supported by the side wraparound wall portion of the base <b>2102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>, a user console <b>2200</b> is similar to user console <b>2100</b> described above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref>, except that the user console <b>2200</b> may include a base <b>2202</b> that has an overhang extending over the seat assembly, where a display <b>2250</b> is configured to suspend from the overhang.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In the variation shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref>, a user console <b>2300</b> is similar to the user console <b>2100</b> except that the front wall of the base <b>2302</b> also extends laterally to provide angled or curved wings around the display <b>2250</b>. This may, for example, help reduce glare on the display <b>2250</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref>, in some variations, one or more of the components may include wheels <b>2420</b>. Different modular components may include wheels to facilitate relative movement among the different components. For example, a display support may include wheels <b>2420</b> to enable translation and/or rotation relative to the seat assembly and/or base. As another example the seat assembly may include wheels <b>2420</b> <i>b </i>to enable translation and/or rotation relative to the display and/or base. Similarly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref>, the seat assembly may include one or more wheels <b>2520</b> <i>b </i>to enable the seat assembly to adjust its position and orientation relative to a user interface platform <b>2520</b> (e.g., having a keyboard or other controls). As yet another example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A-27B</figref>, the base <b>2702</b> may include wheels, so as to increase mobility (e.g., for moving the user console between different operating rooms, or repositioning the user console within a room). Additionally or alternatively, the pedal assembly, base, and/or other components of the user console may include one or more wheels. The wheels may include brakes (e.g., friction brakes) or other locking mechanisms to prevent movement or other subsequent unintentional repositioning of components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0017" num="0000">User Console Configurations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">To facilitate the adjustment and set-up of the user console for ergonomic and other adjustments, a configuration controller may be provided that can detect and save the specific configuration of one more components of the user console, including the seat assembly, display assembly, pedal assembly, and also control the motors of the adjustment mechanisms to restore the user console to a save specific configuration. Each configuration may be linked to one or more users, user characteristics, patient or patient characteristics (height, weight), operating teams, robot system configurations, seating preferences and/or one surgery types. The configuration controller may be separate from the robot controller of the robot system, with its own processor, memory, and input/output interface to the motors, interlocks, actuators and/or sensors, or may be part of the same system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">In use, the user console may be adjusted to a desired configuration, including ergonomic adjustments to the seat assembly, pedal assembly, and display assembly, but also customizations to the user interface and user interface devices, if available. The complete or a subset of the configuration may then be saved, and optionally linked to one identifiers or categories. The identifiers may be a user identifier, a non-user identifier category or characteristic, (e.g. surgery type, seating arrangement, etc.) and/or a biometric identifier (e.g., iris code, fingerprint, etc.). In subsequent usage, or more identifiers are entered, provided or selected simultaneously or serially, to narrow down to the saved configuration(s) for final selection or confirmation. The configuration controller then signals or controls the various motors to make any mechanical adjustments to the user console, and also reconfigures or sets the configuration of the user interface. This can occur while the user is seated in the user console or prior to seating, in order to reduce set-up time for a single user, or between multiple users who use the same user console in respective customized configurations during a single procedure, etc. Furthermore, in some variations, the user console may dynamically improve ergonomics by tracking motions of the user (e.g., body position, eye position, eye gaze, etc.) and, in response to the user's motions, automatically recommending or transitioning to an optimum configuration for the user's ergonomic, viewing, hardware, and/or other needs, such as for reducing fatigue or injury. For example, if configuration controller detects that the user in the seating assembly begins to strain upwards (as if trying to obtain a higher perspective of the operating table), the controller may automatically adjust the seating assembly to elevate the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">In addition to any customized configuration, the configuration controller may include some pre-configured settings, or may include an algorithm that sets a configuration based upon the height and/or weight of the user as entered into the configuration controller, or measured by one or more sensors built into the user console (e.g. weight sensors in the seat pan, base and/or pedal assembly, optical height or length detection). In one example, the configuration controller may instruct the user to sit in the seat assembly with his or her feet placed on the pedals. Weight sensors in the seat pan and base may then adjust the seat height, seat angle, and/or pedal displacement in order to achieve a 50/50 weight distribution (e.g., between left and right sides of the user), or other weight distribution. In another example, the seat pan may comprise a weight sensor located in the center of the seat pan, and one or more weight sensors located about the anterior edge of the seat pan. The seat height and/or seat angle is then adjusted to achieve a desired weight distribution between the center force and the anterior edge force, which may reduce force concentration that may reduce lower leg circulation. In still another example, an optical or image sensor located on the display assembly may be used to detect the eye level of the user and adjust the display panel height. The desired height may be set so that the top of the display panel it at eye level, or 0 to 5 cm below the detected eye level, or where eye level is at a height located in the upper half of the display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an exemplary set of parameters that may, in some variations, be adjustable to configure the user console. The open display may be adjustable in several degrees of freedom (“DOF”). For example, open display height may be adjusted via vertical translation (“ODV”) along a display support, anterior-posterior location of the open display may be adjusted via horizontal translation (“ODH”) relative to a base of the user console, and open display tilt (“ODT”) may be adjusted (e.g., relative to the display support).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Additionally or alternatively, the pedal tray may be adjustable in up to three or more DOF. For example, foot pedal tray tilt (“PT”) may be adjusted (e.g., relative to the base of the user console), anterior-posterior location of the foot pedal tray may be adjusted via horizontal translation (“PH”) relative to the base of the user console, and/or height of the foot pedal tray may be adjusted via vertical translation (not shown) such as with an adjustable riser coupled to the base of the user console.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">The seat assembly may furthermore be adjustable in a variety of DOFs. For example, chair rotational position may be adjusted via chair swivel (“CS”) around a vertical axis (e.g., by adjusting rotational swivel position of a seat support pillar as described herein), chair height (“CV”) may be adjusted via translation along the seat support pillar, chair recline (generally shown as chair recline (“CR”)) relative to a seat pan may be adjusted (e.g., as described in further detail herein), and seat pan tilt (“CBT”) may be adjusted (e.g., as described in further detail herein). Additionally, headrest height (“HV”) and/or headrest tilt (“HT”) may be adjusted (e.g., as further described herein). Furthermore, the armrest height (“AV”) and other arm rest configurations (e.g., lateral or planar motion, as described further herein) may be adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Furthermore, height of the base (“BV”) relative to the ground may be adjusted, for example, as the result of deployment of wheels (as further described below) to transport and other suitable purposes. Adjustment of many of these and other parameters are described in further detail elsewhere herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B-4D</figref> illustrate in more detail how the seat assembly may be configurable in one of a plurality of seating assembly configurations. A configuration may be based on a set of adjustable parameters (e.g., at least some or all of parameters A-F as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B-4D</figref>). For example, adjustable parameter A is the angle of the user's lower leg relative to the user's thigh when the user is in the seat assembly, as the result of the relative orientation of the seat pan and the pedal assembly. Adjustable parameter B is the angle of the backrest relative to horizontal. Adjustable parameter C is the angle of the pedal assembly relative to horizontal (e.g., seat assembly base or ground). Adjustable parameter D is the angle of the armrest relative to horizontal. Adjustable angle E is the angle of the headrest relative to the backrest. Adjustable parameter F is the location of a lower end of the backrest relative to the seat pan or seat pan. In some variations, the seat assembly may be configurable in at least any one, and preferably two or three, of a seated configuration (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>), a reclined configuration (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>), and an elevated configuration (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">In the exemplary seated configuration depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, the seat pan <b>218</b> is in a generally horizontal orientation and the vertical height of seat assembly <b>204</b> is set so that the user's heels are in contact with the base <b>202</b> and with the lower legs in a forward position and the heels in contact with the base with the feet in a neutral, slightly plantarflex position. The pedal assembly <b>212</b> is positioned with respect to the base <b>202</b> so that the user's forefeet, but not the heels, are over the pedal assembly <b>212</b>, with a forward angle <b>252</b> in the range of about 25 to 45 degrees. In other variations, the pedal assembly <b>212</b> may comprise a heel region or heel rest, and may be positioned under the forefoot and heel. The seat back <b>220</b> is in a vertical or slightly rearward angle, and the display assembly <b>208</b> is set such that the top edge of the display frame <b>232</b> is generally at eye level, and the display mount <b>228</b> is angled so that the display panels of the display frame <b>232</b> are orthogonal to the visual axis of the user, which is slightly below the horizontal of the eye level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">An exemplary elevated configuration is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>. An elevated configuration may be helpful, for example, when the user desires to have a direct view into the procedure room or procedure table. Additionally, the elevated configuration may, for example, be suitable for sterile use, easy and fast entry and/or exit by the user from the user console (e.g., such that the user may “step in” or “step out” of the seating assembly in the elevated configuration). In this configuration, the seat pan <b>218</b> is anteverted, with its front edge angled downward, and also translated or retracted posteriorly, so as to reduce the area of the seat pan available to support the user's thighs (i.e., reduce the depth of the seat pan anterior to the seat back, as measured in the anterior-posterior direction) and such that less than or none of the user's thighs are supported by the seat pan <b>218</b>, compared to the seated configuration in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, and allows the user's legs to be in a more vertical orientation. Additionally or alternatively, the area of seat support may be reduced in other manners, such as by translating the seat back anteriorly, at least partially folding and/or rolling up a posterior portion of the seat pan (e.g., in variations in which the seat pan is sectioned or flexible. It should be noted that such adjustments to the area of seat support may additionally or alternatively be used to accommodate and be customized to different user sizes. To further accommodate this relatively more vertical orientation, the pedal assembly <b>218</b> may be moved more posteriorly on the base <b>202</b> compared to the seated configuration, and the forward angle of the pedal assembly <b>218</b> may be flat or at least smaller than the forward angle in the seated configuration. The seat back <b>220</b> may be in the same or relatively more tilted forward orientation compared to the seated configuration. The display frame <b>232</b> may be raised to a higher position relative to the seated configuration. Also, with the particular posterior angled seat support <b>214</b> of this user console <b>200</b>, when the seat shell <b>216</b> is elevated, there is also a posterior displacement of the user's position, and the display assembly <b>208</b> may also be moved posteriorly in the elevated configuration to maintain or at least partially compensate for changes in the user's eye-to-display panel distance. To facilitate movement of the display assembly <b>208</b>, wheels <b>246</b> or low-friction sliding structures may be provided to facilitate the movements. In other variations, however, the display assembly <b>208</b> may be mounted in the base <b>202</b> and may not have exposed or visible wheels or sliders.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In a seated configuration such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the seat pan <b>506</b> may be at a height wherein the user's heels are in contact with or generally about the base while the seat pan and the user's thighs are generally aligned, and horizontal or angled in the range of about −5 degrees to +5 degrees, about −5 degrees to about +10 degrees, or about −10 degrees to about +15 degrees to the horizontal plane. The pedal assembly <b>504</b> is positioned at an anterior-posterior position wherein the user's forefoot is in contact with the pedals, and angled about perpendicularly to the user's lower leg. The amount of the seat pan <b>506</b> protruding anteriorly from the plane of the seat back <b>510</b> may be in the range of about 75% to 100%, 80 to 100%, or 90% to 100% of the maximum anterior displacement of seat pan <b>506</b>. Depending upon the user, the seat pan <b>506</b> may be customized to an extended position in the seated configuration to support at about 25% to 100% of the thigh distal to the user's gluteal fold, and in other examples, may be in the range of about 50% to about 95%, or about 70% to about 100%. The seat back <b>220</b> may be configured with an anterior angle in the range of about 80 degrees to about 110 degrees, about 90 degrees to about 105 degrees, about 90 degrees to about 100 degrees, or about 100 degrees to about 110 degrees. The pedal angle in the seated configuration may be in the range of about 15 to 45 degrees, about 20 to 40 degrees, or about 25 to about 35 degrees from the anterior horizontal plane <b>516</b>, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">In an elevated configuration such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the seat pan <b>506</b> is elevated relative to the position in the seated configuration, and may also be anteverted or angled anteriorly to an angle of at least −5 degrees, −7 degrees, −10 degrees or −15 degrees, for example. The seat pan <b>506</b> may also be retracted relative to the seat back <b>510</b> such that about 10% to 75%, about 25% to about 60%, about 40% to 55%, or at least 10 cm, 20 cm or 30 cm of the seat pan <b>506</b> is posterior to the plane of the seat back <b>510</b>. The seat back <b>510</b> may be configured with an anterior angle in the range of about 80 degrees to about 110 degrees, about 90 degrees to about 105 degrees, about 90 degrees to about 100 degrees, or about 100 degrees to about 110 degrees. The pedal angle <b>516</b> in the seated configuration may be in the range of about 0 to 30 degrees, about 0 to 15 degrees, or about 0 to about 7 degrees from the anterior horizontal plane. The height of the seat pan <b>506</b> may be set such that the heel of the user is in contact with the base, but in other variations may be configured such that the user's heels are above and not in contact with the base.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">The horizontal distance of the display panel or display assembly in the seated or elevated configuration to be in the range of about 50 cm to 150 cm, 50 cm to about 125 cm, or about 50 to about 100 cm. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, where the seat support (not shown) is angled backwards such as in the exemplary user console <b>200</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>, as the seat height is increased, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the seat pan <b>506</b>, and seat back <b>510</b> also are displaced posteriorly, and anteriorly when the seat assembly <b>518</b> is lowered. In this example, the display assembly <b>208</b> may be moved posteriorly or anteriorly by an equal distance of the horizontal displacement of the seat assembly <b>518</b>, but in other examples, the display panel <b>502</b> may not be moved, or may be moved by a different amount than the horizontal displacement of the seat assembly <b>516</b>. The height of the display panel(s) or display shell in the seated or elevated configuration may be set such that the top edge of the display panel(s) or display shell is at a relative height that is in the range of about +10 to −20 cm, +10 cm to −10 cm, about +5 cm to about −5 cm, about 0 cm to about −5 cm of the user's optical axis, depending on the size of the display. In other variations, the display height may be adjusted such that the user's optical axis is set to be aligned at about 125% to 50%, about 125% to about 75%, about 110% to about 90%, about 100% to about 90% relative to the bottom edge of the display (0%) and the top edge of the display (100%). The tilt angle of the display panel(s) or display shell may be adjusted in a linear or non-linear fashion to the tilt angle of the seat back <b>510</b>. In some examples, the display tilt angle may be in the relative range of about 0 degrees to about 15 degrees lower than the angle of the seat back <b>220</b>. In other examples, the display tilt angle from 90 degree axis may be offset by a proportion of the seat back tile angle deviation from a 105 degree axis, for example, from about 50% to about 100% of the angle change in the seat back <b>510</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">In a reclined configuration such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the seat pan <b>506</b> is in a retroverted orientation along with the display panel <b>502</b>. The degree of retroversion may be at least +5 degrees, +7 degrees, +10 degrees, +15 degrees, +20 degrees, +30 degrees, or +45 degrees for example, while the monitor may be tilted downward by +5 degrees, +7 degrees, +10 degrees, +15 degrees or +20 degrees, for example. The seat back <b>510</b> may be configured with an anterior angle in the range of about 100 degrees to about 130 degrees, about 110 degrees to about 125 degrees, about 110 degrees to about 120 degrees, or about 120 degrees to about 130 degrees. The pedal angle <b>516</b> in the reclined configuration may be in the range of about 10 to 40 degrees, about 10 to 25 degrees, or about 10 to about 20 degrees, from the anterior horizontal plane. In other examples, the pedal angle <b>516</b> may be unchanged from the seated configuration. In some variations, due to spatial limitations or adjustment limitations of the user console <b>500</b>, one or more changes in the seat configuration may also involve a translational motion. For example, the reclined configuration, to perform the retroversion of the seat pan <b>506</b>, the seat controller may be configured to perform a combination of translational and pivot motions of the display <b>502</b>, pedal assembly <b>504</b>, seat pan <b>506</b>, and seat back <b>510</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the seat assembly <b>518</b> may be moved lower, and then the front lip <b>520</b> of the seat pan <b>506</b> is pivotably raised to achieve the final retroversion of the seat pan <b>506</b>. The pedal assembly <b>504</b> may be moved anteriorly and raised upward. Because of the posterior displacement of the user as from the seat pan <b>506</b> retroversion and the backward angulation of the seat back <b>510</b>, the display <b>502</b> may be moved posteriorly and angled downward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">In some variations, the adjustments between the seated configuration and a reclined configuration may maintain the relative position and orientation of the display <b>502</b>, pedal assembly <b>503</b>, seat pan <b>506</b> and seat back <b>510</b>, and utilize a combination of translation and angle changes within the mechanical adjustability ranges of the user console <b>500</b> to achieve a net rotation of the relative configuration of these components in space or with respect to gravity. The virtual axis of rotation of the relative configuration may be fixed throughout the reclining range, or may shift in different subranges of reclining. For example, one part of the reclining range may include a virtual axis of rotation generally located at the intersection of the seat pan <b>506</b> and seat back <b>510</b>, while another part of the reclining range may have a virtual axis of rotation located at or about the pedal assembly, and/or at the base of the display assembly. In some variations, as the degree of reclining increases, the virtual or effective axis of rotation of the seat components may continuously shift from a posterior location to an anterior location, as a result of the limitations to the adjustability of the individual components. To control the degree of reclining, the user console <b>200</b> may have a single recline control, which coordinates the translational and angular movements of the display <b>502</b>, pedal assembly <b>503</b>, seat pan <b>506</b> and seat back <b>510</b> to achieve the desired recline level while maintaining the desired relative configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">In another example of a user console, depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A-27C</figref>, the user console comprises a curved base <b>2702</b> on which the display assembly <b>2750</b> and seat assembly <b>2710</b> are mounted, such as on rails. The display assembly <b>2750</b> and/or seat assembly <b>2710</b> may translate along the curved base <b>2702</b> to allow changes in the recline angle while simultaneously maintaining or altering the relative spacing and orientation of the display assembly <b>2750</b> and seat assembly <b>2710</b>, as well as any foot-operated control such as a pedal assembly (not shown) that is coupled to the curved base <b>2750</b>.</div>

The armrest <b>508</b> may have a horizontal adjustable range with a minimum horizontal distance <b>580</b>, from an anterior surface of the seat back <b>510</b> to the horizontal center of the armrest <b>508</b>, in the range of about 10 cm to 30 cm, about 15 cm to 25 cm, about 15 to 50 cm, or about 20 cm to 60 cm or more. The maximum horizontal distance <b>582</b> may be in the range of about 30 cm to 50 cm, about 40 cm to about 70 cm, about 35 cm to about 80 cm, for example. In further examples, the armrest <b>508</b> may also be configured to rotate or tilt in the anterior-posterior direction, with a maximum anterior or forward angle <b>584</b> of about 10 degrees to 20 degrees, about 15 degrees to 30 degrees, or about 15 degrees to 45 degrees. The maximum posterior or rearward angle may be zero, or in the range of about zero to 10 degrees, about zero 15 degrees, about 5 degrees to 30 degrees, or about 10 degrees to about 45 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the user console <b>500</b> has a width <b>586</b> that is in the range of about 90 cm to 100 cm, about 80 cm to about 120 cm, or about 90 cm to about 150 cm, or more. The length <b>588</b> may be in the range of about 150 cm to 200 cm, about 160 cm to about 250 cm, or about 160 cm to about 180 cm. The size of the user console may facilitate positioning of the user console <b>500</b> in a surgical or procedure suite, or through the door(s) of such a suite or room.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">The above-described settings for seated, reclined, and elevated configurations of the user console may be further illustrated with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>. The seat assembly of the user console <b>900</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9E</figref> is in a seated configuration. When the seat assembly is moved to an elevated configuration, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11E</figref>, the seat shell <b>916</b> moves superiorly and posteriorly up the posteriorly angled seat support. Where compensation for these adjustments is desired, the display monitor support <b>906</b> may, for example, move posteriorly relative to the base, and the display monitor <b>950</b> may move superiorly relative to the display support <b>906</b>. The pedal assembly <b>904</b> may also move posteriorly and may tilt downward to a more level/horizontal orientation, to better ergonomically orient to the user's near-vertical or elevated pose. The seat pan is retracted relative to the seat shell and the seat back, and may pivot to a more anteverted orientation. The headrest cushion may also move superiorly up the seat back, and the armrests are moved to a superior location relative to the seat assembly. The support arm of the immersive display may also be moved superiorly relative to the seat assembly, such as by actuated or manually-posed articulated adjustments of the linkages along the immersive display support arm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10E</figref> depict the user console <b>900</b> in the reclined configuration. Here, the seat shell <b>916</b> has been moved inferiorly and anteriorly down the posteriorly angled seat support <b>914</b>, with a substantial portion of the seat support above the opening of the seat shell <b>916</b>. The seat pan is in a retroverted position and the seat back has been tilted posteriorly with the seat back, such that the seat support is substantially residing in the seat back cavity. The headrest cushion may be moved inferiorly, toward the seat back cushion. The armrests have been tilted posteriorly with the seat back. Because of the retroversion of the seat pan, the user may be seated more deeply and lower in the seat shell and relative to the seat back, as compared to in the seated configuration of the seat assembly. In some variations, the support arm of the immersive display <b>960</b> may generally maintain an orientation parallel to the base of the user console (e.g., horizontal and parallel to the ground, if the base is horizontal). In some variations, the immersive display <b>960</b> may tilt downwards to, for example, maintain an orthogonal optical viewing axis for the user viewing the immersive display <b>960</b>. Alternatively, in some variations, the proximal portion of the support arm of the immersive display <b>960</b> (e.g., the portion coupled to the seat back) may be moved to a lower position such that the support arm tilts posteriorly similar to the arm rests. In this user console the display <b>940</b> may or may not be configured to tilt downward to maintain a more orthogonal viewing plane with the user's optical axis. The display support may be moved more posteriorly to maintain or other partially compensate for any change in distance along the user's optical axis resulting from the reclining angle of the seat back. In other examples, anterior displacement of the seat shell down the seat support, and posterior movement of the seat back, are not performed, such as if the anterior displacement of the seat shell down the seat support is sufficient to maintain the desired viewing distance. Where the display support is moved posteriorly, the display support may be configured with a central opening between the lateral support legs, to accommodate the pedal assembly. The pedal assembly may be tilted backward to accommodate the user's recline angle in the seat assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0018" num="0000">Safety Features</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">The user console may be further equipped with a “lock out” feature, in which the user console can automatically determine whether a user is in the user console and ready to perform a surgical procedure via the user console. In response to this determination the user console can automatically enable or disable the controls. The user console may include one or more sensors configured to detect the presence or absence of a user in the seat assembly. For example, such a sensor may be disposed in and/or around the seat assembly (e.g., in the seat pan, seat back, head rest, etc.) and include a pressure sensor configured to measure weight in the seat assembly, where a pressure measurement beyond a threshold value indicates presence of a user in the user console. As another example, an IR sensor may be configured to measure heat applied to the seat assembly, where a temperature measurement beyond a threshold value indicates presence a user in the user console. As another example, an optical sensor may be configured to detect an interruption or break in a light beam aimed across the user console, where interruption of the beam indicates presence of a user in the user console. Another example of such sensors is an optical sensor (e.g., in the display monitor, auxiliary display, immersive display, etc.) configured to apply an eye tracking algorithm to determine presence of a user ready to operate the controls of the user console. Furthermore, in some variations, presence of a user in the seating assembly may be determined by receiving a voice command (e.g., by an authorized user), performing voice or facial recognition, receiving approved user login identification, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">Certain user manipulations of the user console may also indicate the user's presence. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A-26C</figref>, the user console may have a side entry configuration, in which a user may approach an outward facing, swiveling seat assembly (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>) to enter the user console. The user may then swivel the seat assembly to a centered orientation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref>) facing the front of the user console. In this example, the seat assembly may be equipped with a switch or other sensor configured to detect when the seat assembly rotates and transitions to the centered orientation, whereupon the controls for remotely operating the surgical instrument may be enabled. Other deliberate user actions (e.g., grasping user interface devices, engaging the pedal assembly, pressing a start button, etc.) may also trigger enablement of the controls. Conversely, opposite actions (swiveling the seat assembly outward, putting down the user interface devices, etc.) may trigger disablement of the controls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">The user console may additionally or alternatively include one or more sensors configured to detect the competency of a user in the seat assembly, such as to check that the user operating the surgical instrument is sufficiently well-rested and/or sober. For example, an optical sensor for performing eye tracking as described above may be used to predict whether a user is sleep-deprived or fatigued (e.g., based on eye movement, blink rate, etc.). As another example, pressure sensors such as those described above may be used to detect sudden shifts or rapid changes in weight distribution in the seat assembly, which may indicate a medical emergency such as a user's seizure. Furthermore, a chemical sensor (e.g., breathalyzer) may be included to check for sobriety based on ethanol traces and the like. These kinds of events may, for example, trigger at least an audible/visible alarm or other warning, and/or a disablement of the controls in order to protect the patient undergoing a surgical procedure.</div>
