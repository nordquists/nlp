No. 15/605,087, filed May 25, 2017, and entitled “Multi-Shot Casting” (“the '087 Application”) which is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/651,926, filed Jun. 12, 2015, and entitled “Multi-Shot Casting” (“the '926 Application” now U.S. Pat.

<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to casting of aerospace components. More particularly, the disclosure relates to casting of single crystal or directionally solidified castings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A gas turbine engine typically includes a fan section, a compressor section, a combustor section and a turbine section. Air entering the compressor section is compressed and delivered into the combustor section where it is mixed with fuel and ignited to generate a high-speed exhaust gas flow. The high-speed exhaust gas flow expands through the turbine section to drive the compressor section and the fan section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In a two spool engine, the compressor section typically includes low and high pressure compressors, and the turbine section includes low and high pressure turbines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The high pressure turbine drives the high pressure compressor through an outer shaft to form a high spool, and the low pressure turbine drives the low pressure compressor through an inner shaft to form a low spool. The fan section may also be driven by the low inner shaft. A direct drive gas turbine engine includes a fan section driven by the low spool such that the low pressure compressor, low pressure turbine and fan section rotate at a common speed in a common direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A speed reduction device such as an epicyclical gear assembly may be utilized to drive the fan section such that the fan section may rotate at a speed different than the driving turbine section so as to increase the overall propulsive efficiency of the engine. In such engine architectures, a shaft driven by one of the turbine sections provides an input to the epicyclical gear assembly that drives the fan section at a reduced speed such that both the turbine section and the fan section can rotate at closer to optimal speeds.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The '530 application discloses multi-shot cast articles, alloys and alloy combinations for such articles, molds for casting such articles, and methods for casting such articles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The molds, methods, and apparatus herein may be used for casting articles which may include any or all such articles as disclosed in the '530 application. Similarly, the methods and apparatus herein, may be used with molds which may include any or all such molds as disclosed in the '530 application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a gas turbine engine <b>20</b>. The exemplary gas turbine engine <b>20</b> is a two-spool turbofan having a centerline (central longitudinal axis) <b>500</b>, a fan section <b>22</b>, a compressor section <b>24</b>, a combustor section <b>26</b> and a turbine section <b>28</b>. Alternative engines might include an augmentor section (not shown) among other systems or features. The fan section <b>22</b> drives air along a bypass flowpath <b>502</b> while the compressor section <b>24</b> drives air along a core flowpath <b>504</b> for compression and communication into the combustor section <b>26</b> then expansion through the turbine section <b>28</b>. Although depicted as a turbofan gas turbine engine in the disclosed non-limiting embodiment, it is to be understood that the concepts described herein are not limited to use with turbofan engines and the teachings can be applied to non-engine components or other types of turbomachines, including three-spool architectures and turbine engines that do not have a fan section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The engine <b>20</b> includes a first spool <b>30</b> and a second spool <b>32</b> mounted for rotation about the centerline <b>500</b> relative to an engine static structure <b>36</b> via several bearing systems <b>38</b>. It should be understood that various bearing systems <b>38</b> at various locations may alternatively or additionally be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The first spool <b>30</b> includes a first shaft <b>40</b> that interconnects a fan <b>42</b>, a first compressor <b>44</b> and a first turbine <b>46</b>. The first shaft <b>40</b> is connected to the fan <b>42</b> through a gear assembly of a fan drive gear system (transmission) <b>48</b> to drive the fan <b>42</b> at a lower speed than the first spool <b>30</b>. The second spool <b>32</b> includes a second shaft <b>50</b> that interconnects a second compressor <b>52</b> and second turbine <b>54</b>. The first spool <b>30</b> runs at a relatively lower pressure than the second spool <b>32</b>. It is to be understood that “low pressure” and “high pressure” or variations thereof as used herein are relative terms indicating that the high pressure is greater than the low pressure. A combustor <b>56</b> (e.g., an annular combustor) is between the second compressor <b>52</b> and the second turbine <b>54</b> along the core flowpath. The first shaft <b>40</b> and the second shaft <b>50</b> are concentric and rotate via bearing systems <b>38</b> about the centerline <b>500</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The core airflow is compressed by the first compressor <b>44</b> then the second compressor <b>52</b>, mixed and burned with fuel in the combustor <b>56</b>, then expanded over the second turbine <b>54</b> and first turbine <b>46</b>. The first turbine <b>46</b> and the second turbine <b>54</b> rotationally drive, respectively, the first spool <b>30</b> and the second spool <b>32</b> in response to the expansion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The engine <b>20</b> includes many components that are or can be fabricated of metallic materials, such as aluminum alloys and superalloys. As an example, the engine <b>20</b> includes rotatable blades <b>60</b> and static vanes <b>59</b> in the turbine section <b>28</b>. The blades <b>60</b> and vanes <b>59</b> can be fabricated of superalloy materials, such as cobalt- or nickel-based alloys. The blade <b>60</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) includes an airfoil <b>61</b> that projects outwardly from a platform <b>62</b>. A root portion <b>63</b> (e.g., having a “fir tree” profile) extends inwardly from the platform <b>62</b> and serves as an attachment for mounting the blade in a complementary slot on a disk <b>70</b> (shown schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The airfoil <b>61</b> extends streamwise from a leading edge <b>64</b> to a trailing edge <b>65</b> and has a pressure side <b>66</b> and a suction side <b>67</b>. The airfoil extends spanwise from an inboard end <b>68</b> at the outer diameter (OD) surface <b>71</b> of the platform <b>62</b> to a distal/outboard end/tip <b>69</b> (shown as a free tip rather than a shrouded tip in this example).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The root <b>63</b> extends from an outboard end at an underside <b>72</b> of the platform to an inboard end <b>74</b> and has a forward face <b>75</b> and an aft face <b>76</b> which align with corresponding faces of the disk when installed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The blade <b>60</b> has a body or substrate that has a hybrid composition and microstructure. For example, a “body” is a main or central foundational part, distinct from subordinate features, such as coatings or the like that are supported by the underlying body and depend primarily on the shape of the underlying body for their own shape. As can be appreciated however, although the examples and potential benefits may be described herein with respect to the blades <b>60</b>, the examples can also be extended to the vanes <b>59</b>, disk <b>70</b>, other rotatable metallic components of the engine <b>20</b>, non-rotatable metallic components of the engine <b>20</b>, or metallic non-engine components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The blade <b>60</b> has a tipward first section <b>80</b> fabricated of a first material and a rootward second section <b>82</b> fabricated of a second, different material. A boundary between the sections is shown as <b>540</b>. For example, the first and second materials differ in at least one of composition, microstructure and mechanical properties. In a further example, the first and second materials differ in at least density. In one example, the first material (near the tip of the blade <b>60</b>) has a relatively low density and the second material has a relatively higher density. The first and second materials can additionally or alternatively differ in other characteristics, such as corrosion resistance, strength, creep resistance, fatigue resistance, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In this example, the sections <b>80</b>/<b>82</b> each include portions of the airfoil <b>61</b>. Alternatively, or in addition to the sections <b>80</b>/<b>82</b>, the blade <b>60</b> can have other sections, such as the platform <b>62</b> and the root portion <b>63</b>, which may be independently fabricated of third or further materials that differ in at least one of composition, microstructure and mechanical properties from each other and, optionally, also differ from the sections <b>80</b>/<b>82</b> in at least one of composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In this example, the airfoil <b>61</b> extends over a span from 0% span at the platform <b>62</b> to a 100% span at the tip <b>69</b>. The section <b>82</b> extends from the 0% span to X % span (at boundary <b>540</b>) and the section <b>80</b> extends from the X % span to the 100% span. In one example, the X % span is, or is approximately, 70% such that the section <b>80</b> extends from 70% to 100% span. In other examples, the X % can be anywhere from 1%-99%. In a further example, the densities of the first and second materials differ by at least 3%. In a further example, the densities differ by at least 6%, and in one example differ by 6%-10%. As is discussed further below, the X % span location and boundary <b>540</b> may represent the center of a short transition region between sections of the two pure first and second materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The first and second materials of the respective sections <b>80</b>/<b>82</b> can be selected to locally tailor the performance of the blade <b>60</b>. For example, the first and second materials can be selected according to local conditions and requirements for corrosion resistance, strength, creep resistance, fatigue resistance or the like. Further, various benefits can be achieved by locally tailoring the materials. For instance, depending on a desired purpose or objective, the materials can be tailored to reduce cost, to enhance performance, to reduce weight or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In one example, the blade <b>60</b>, or other hybrid component, is fabricated using a casting process. For example, the casting process can be an investment casting process that is used to cast a single crystal microstructure, a directional (columnar) microstructure, or an equiaxed microstructure. In one example of fabricating the blade <b>60</b> by casting, the casting process introduces two, or more, alloys that correspond to the first and second (or more) materials. For example, the alloys are poured into an investment casting mold at different stages in the cooling cycle to form the sections <b>80</b>/<b>82</b> of the blade <b>60</b>. The following example is based on a directionally solidified, single crystal casting technique to fabricate a nickel-based blade, but can also be applied to other casting techniques, other material compositions, and other components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">At least two nickel-based alloys of different composition (and different density upon cooling) are poured into an investment casting mold at different stages of the withdrawal and solidification process of the casting. For instance, in a tip-upward casting example of the blade <b>60</b>, the alloy corresponding to the second material is poured into the mold to form the root <b>63</b>, the platform <b>62</b> and the airfoil portion of second section <b>82</b>. As the mold is withdrawn from the heating chamber, the alloy in the root <b>63</b> begins to solidify. With further withdrawal, a solidification front moves upwards (in this example) toward the platform <b>62</b> and airfoil portion of the second section <b>82</b>. Prior to complete solidification of the alloy at the top of the second section <b>82</b>, another alloy corresponding to the first material of the first section <b>80</b> is poured into the mold. The additional alloy mixes in a liquid state with the still liquid alloy at the top of the second section <b>82</b>. As the solidification front continues upwards, the two mixed alloys solidify in a boundary portion (zone) between the sections <b>80</b>/<b>82</b>. As additional alloy of the first material is poured into the mold, the boundary zone transitions to fully being alloy of the first material as the first section <b>80</b> solidifies. Thus, the boundary zone provides a strong metallurgical bond between the two alloys of the sections <b>80</b>/<b>82</b> from the mixing of the alloys in the liquid state, and thus does not have some of the drawbacks of solid-state bonds (e.g., solid state bonds providing locations for crack initiation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In single crystal investment castings, a seed of one alloy can be used to preferentially orient a compositionally different casting alloy. Furthermore, nickel-based alloy coatings strongly bond to nickel-based alloy substrates of different composition. The seeding and bonding suggests that the approach of multi-material casting with the metallurgical bond of the boundary zone is feasible to produce a strong bond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Additionally, lattice parameters and thermal expansion mismatches between different composition nickel-based alloys are relatively insignificant, which suggests that the boundary between the sections <b>80</b>/<b>82</b> is unlikely to be a detrimental structural anomaly. Also, for nickel-based alloys, unless such boundary zones are subjected to temperatures in excess of 2000° F. (1093° C.) for substantial periods of time, it is unlikely that the compositions and microstructural stability in the boundary zone will be significantly compromised. Alternatively, the alloys can be selected to reduce or mitigate any such effects to meet engineering requirements. As can be further appreciated, the same approach can be applied to conventionally cast components with equiaxed grain structure, as well directionally solidified castings with columnar grain structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">For a rotatable component, such as the blade <b>60</b> or disk <b>70</b>, the centrifugal pull at any location is proportional to the product of mass, radial distance from the center and square of the angular velocity (proportional to revolutions per minute). Thus, the mass at the tip has a greater pull than the mass near the attachment location. By the same token, the strength requirement near to the rotational axis is much higher than the strength requirement near the tip. Therefore, the blade <b>60</b> having the first section <b>80</b> fabricated of a relatively low density material (near the tip) can be beneficial, even if the selected material of the first section <b>80</b> does not have the same strength capability as the material selected for the second section <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Also, the radial pull is significantly higher than the pressure load experienced by the blade <b>60</b> along the engine central axis <b>500</b>. This suggests that the blade <b>60</b>, with a low density/low strength alloy at the tip, would be greatly beneficial to the engine <b>20</b> by either improving engine efficiency or by modifying blade geometry for a longer or broader blade or by reducing the pull on the disk <b>70</b> and reducing the engine weight, as well as shrinking the bore of the disk <b>70</b> axially, thereby improving the engine architecture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Similarly, in some embodiments, it can be beneficial to fabricate the root <b>63</b> of the blade <b>60</b> with a more corrosion resistant and stress corrosion resistant (SCC) alloy and to fabricate the airfoil <b>61</b> (or portions thereof) with a more creep resistant alloy. Given that not all engineering properties are required to the same extent at different locations in a component, the weight, cost, and performance of a component, such as the blade <b>60</b>, can be locally tailored to thereby improve the performance of the engine <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The examples herein may be used to achieve various purposes, such as but not limited to, (1) light weight components such as blades, vanes, seals etc., (2) blades with light weight tip and/or shroud, thereby reducing the pull on the blade root attachment and rotating disk, (3) longer or wider blades improving engine efficiency, rather than reducing the weight, (4) corrosion and SCC resistant roots with creep resistant airfoils, (5) root attachments with high tensile and low cycle fatigue strength and airfoils with high creep resistance, (6) reduced use of high cost elements such as Re in the root portion <b>63</b> or other locations, and (7) reduction in investment core and shell reactions with active elements in in one or more of the zones. An example of the last purpose involves a situation where more of a particular element is desired in one zone than in another zone. For example in a blade it may be desired to have more of certain reactive elements (e.g., that contribute to oxidation resistance) in the airfoil (or other tipward zone) than in the root (or other rootward zone). In a single-pour tip-downward casting, the alloy will have a greater time in the molten state as one progresses from tip to root. There will be more time for the reactive elements to react with core and shell near the root. Although this can yield acceptable amounts of those reactive elements in the blade, the reaction can degrade the interface between casting and core/shell. The reactions may alter local core/shell compositions so as to make it difficult to reach the core. Thus, the later pour (forming the root in this example) may be of an alloy having relatively low (or none) concentrations of the reactive elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Additionally, in some embodiments, the examples herein provide the ability to enhance performance without using costly ceramic matrix composite materials. The examples herein can also be used to change or expand the blade geometry, which is otherwise limited by the blade pull, disk strength and space availability. Furthermore, the examples expand the operating envelope of the geared architecture of the engine <b>20</b>, where higher rotational speeds of the hot, turbine section <b>20</b> are feasible since the rotational speed of the turbine section <b>28</b> is not necessarily constrained by the rotational speed of the fan <b>42</b> because the fan speed can be adjusted through the gear ratio of the gear assembly <b>48</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Typically a single crystal nickel-base superalloy component, such as a turbine blade may be cast as follows. A ceramic and/or a refractory metal core or assembly is made, which will ultimately define the internal hollow passages in the turbine blade. Using a die, wax is injected around the core to form a pattern which will eventually define the external shape of the blade. The solid wax with embedded core assembly (and optionally with other wax gating components or additional patterns attached) is then dipped in ceramic slurry to form the outer shell mold. Once the shell is dried, the wax is melted and drained out leaving behind a hollow cavity between the outer shell and the inner core. The assembly is then fired to harden the shell (mold).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Such a mold assembly (typically with a feed tube (e.g. a downsprue for bottom fill shells) and a pour cup) is then placed on a water-cooled chill plate inside an induction heated furnace, enclosed in a vacuum chamber. These features (tube, downsprue, pour cup) may be formed by shelling wax pattern elements either with or separately from the shelling of the blade patterns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">If the alloy is to be cast with the naturally favored &lt;100&gt; orientation along the long axis (the spanwise direction) of the blade the shell may include means such as a hollow helical passage joined to a hollow cavity at the bottom, to form a starter block (grain starter). Wax forming the helix and block may be molded as part of the pattern or secured thereto prior to shelling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">If it is desired to cast the alloy with controlled crystal orientation, then the hollow cavity below the helical passage may be filled with a block of solid single crystal of the desired orientation. This solid block is referred to as a seed. This seed need not be parallel to the axis of the blade. It may be tilted at a desired angle. That provides flexibility in selecting the starting seed and the desired orientation of the casting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">If the mold assembly were to be grown naturally with no seed, then a molten metal charge is melted in the melt cup or crucible and poured through the pour cup to fill the mold. The mold can be top fed or bottom fed. A filter may be used in the feed tube to capture any ceramic or solid inclusion in the liquid metal as shown. Once the mold is filled, the radiation from the susceptors heated by the induction coils keep the metal molten. Subsequently the mold is withdrawn from the furnace past/through the baffle which isolates the hot zone of the furnace from the cold zone below. Typically the withdrawal rate is 1-10 inches/hour (2.5 mm/hour to 0.25 m/hour), depending on the complexity and size of the part. The part of the mold that gets withdrawn below the baffle starts solidifying due to the rapid cooling from the chill plate. Since that solidification is largely due to heat transfer through the chill plate it is highly biased in the direction of withdrawal. That is why the process is called directional solidification. Due to directional solidification, the starter block forms columns of grain of crystal of which the helical passage allows only one to survive. This results in a single crystal casting with &lt;100&gt; crystallographic or cube direction parallel to the blade axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">If the mold is designed to be started with a seed, then it may be positioned in such a way that half of the seed is initially below the baffle. Now when the molten metal is poured, the half of the seed above the baffle melts and mixes with the new metal. Soon after this occurs, the mold is withdrawn as described above. In this case however, the metal cast in the mold becomes single crystal with the orientation defined by the seed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">According to the present disclosure, a compositional variation may be imposed along the blade. This may entail two or more zones with transitions in between.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">An exemplary two-zone blade involves a transition at a location <b>540</b> along the airfoil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">For example, an inboard region of the airfoil is under centrifugal load from the portion outboard thereof (e.g., including any shroud). Reducing density of the outboard portion reduces this loading and is possible because the outboard portion may be subject to lower loading (thus allowing the outboard portion to be made of an alloy weaker in creep). An exemplary transition location <b>540</b> may be between 30% and 80% span, more particularly 50-75% or 60-75% or an exemplary 70%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">To create such compositional zones, the mold cavity may be filled with a given alloy to a desired intermediate height determined by the design requirement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">In a tip-downward casting example, a low density first alloy may be poured just sufficient to fill the outboard portion, and withdrawal process begins. As the transition location in the cavity approaches the baffle, a second alloy with higher creep strength is poured to fill the rest of the mold. This may be achieved by adding ingot(s) of the second alloy in the melt crucible and pouring the molten second alloy into the pour cup.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Both the withdrawal process and the second pouring may be coordinated in such a way that minimal mixing of the alloys occurs so that large composition gradients between essentially pure bodies of the two alloys are brief (e.g., less than 10% span or less than 5% span).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">It is possible the first alloy may be completely solidified before adding the second alloy, but mixing may occur with just sufficient remaining initial alloy in the liquid state to provide a robust transition to the second alloy. Similarly, multiple pours of a given alloy are possible (e.g., splitting the pouring of the second alloy into two pours after the pour of the first alloy such that a first pour of the second alloy forms a transition region with remaining molten first alloy and is allowed to partially or fully solidify before a second pour of the second alloy is made).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Various modifications and optimizations may be made. If needed such a process may also benefit with the addition of deoxidizing elements like Ca, Mg, and similar active elements. However, an exemplary approach is to avoid that to provide clean practice and process control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">The procedure described above can be practiced with multiple alloys and any section of the casting desired. It is understood that where one wants the transition between two or more alloys to take place depends on the optimized design and desired performance of the particular components. This is controlled by yield strength, fatigue strength, creep strength, as well as desired oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance of the alloy candidate(s) chosen. The key physical basis to be recognized is that the epitaxial crystallographic relationship is maintained when casting alloys within the class of FCC solid solution hardened and precipitation hardened nickel base alloys used for blades and other gas turbine engine and industrial engine components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">It is understood that a lack of epitaxial relationship leading to formation of a grain boundary may be tolerable if such structurally weak interfaces are sufficiently strengthened by alloying additions and/or are acceptable for the specific structural design such as a long blade with less pull at the location.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">If the second nickel base alloy is a typical coating-type composition with high concentration of aluminum, having a mix of face centered cubic, and body centered cubic or simple cubic or B<b>2</b> structure, this approach will also work. Such a combination may be desirable in case one wants the latter alloy to be oxidation resistant or have a higher thermal conductivity. In such a situation, epitaxial relationship is not expected but interfacial bond may be acceptable as formed in liquid state or by inter-diffusion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">The foregoing discusses a method for making multi-alloy single-crystal castings. However, a similar method may provide a low cost columnar grain structure. In such case the casting may still be carried out by directional solidification but no helical passage is used to filter out only one grain. Instead, multiple columnar grains are allowed to run through the casting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> divides the blade <b>60</b>-<b>2</b> into three zones (a tipward Zone <b>1</b> numbered <b>80</b>-<b>2</b>; a rootward Zone <b>2</b> numbered <b>82</b>-<b>2</b>; and an intermediate Zone <b>3</b> numbered <b>81</b>) which may be of two or three different alloys (plus transitions). Desired relative alloy properties for each zone are:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Zone <b>1</b> Airfoil Tip: low density (desirable because this zone imposes centrifugal loads on the other zones) and high oxidation resistance. This may also include a tip shroud (not shown);</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">Zone <b>2</b> Root &amp; Fir Tree: high notched LCF strength, high stress corrosion cracking (SCC) resistance, low density (low density being desirable because these areas provide a large fraction of total mass);</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Zone <b>3</b> Lower Airfoil: high creep strength (due to supporting centrifugal loads with a small cross-section), high oxidation resistance (due to gaspath exposure and heating), higher thermal-mechanical fatigue (TMF) capability/life.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Exemplary Zone 1/3 transition <b>540</b> is at 50-80% airfoil span, more particularly 55-75% or 60-70% (e.g., measured at the center of the airfoil section or at half chord). Exemplary Zone 2/3 transition <b>540</b>-<b>2</b> is at about 0% span (e.g., −5% to 5% or −10% to 10%).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a wax pattern <b>200</b> for casting a multi-alloy blade. In the exemplary pattern, the blade is to be cast in a tip-downward (root-upward) orientation. Alternative orientations are possible. The exemplary pattern <b>200</b> includes portions shaped as the corresponding portions of the blade. In the exemplary pattern this includes a root <b>202</b>, an airfoil <b>204</b>, and a platform <b>206</b>. The root portion <b>202</b> has a first end <b>210</b> orientated upward in this illustration. The second end <b>212</b> falls along the underside <b>214</b> of the platform. The blade portion <b>204</b> extends from an end <b>216</b> at the platform outer diameter (OD) surface <b>218</b> toward a tip <b>220</b>. The airfoil has a pressure side, a suction side, a leading edge, and a trailing edge as does the blade airfoil. The root <b>202</b> has a fir tree profile as does the blade root. The pattern further includes a feed portion <b>222</b> extending from an upper end <b>224</b> to a lower end <b>226</b> at the root end <b>210</b>. The feed portion <b>222</b> provides a passageway in the ultimate shell/mold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The exemplary pattern further includes a grain starter portion <b>230</b> having a larger lower portion <b>232</b> and a helical portion <b>234</b> extending upward therefrom. The helical portion <b>234</b> extends to the lower end <b>236</b> of a gating portion <b>238</b>. The gating portion provides a transition between the grain starter and the part to be cast. As so far described, the pattern may be representative of any existing or future patterns. However, the exemplary pattern includes a section (portion) <b>250</b> for forming an overflow passageway and chamber in the shell/mold. The portion <b>250</b> includes an enlarged chamber-forming portion <b>252</b> and a passageway-forming portion <b>254</b>. The passageway-forming portion <b>254</b> has a first leg <b>256</b> extending upward from a junction <b>258</b> with the remainder of the pattern (e.g., near the blade tip). A second leg <b>260</b> extends between a junction <b>262</b> with the first leg and the chamber-forming portion <b>252</b>. As is discussed further below, a lower boundary <b>264</b> of the junction <b>262</b> defines a plane/height/level <b>550</b> associated with a boundary <b>540</b> between alloys to be cast.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a shell or mold <b>280</b> formed of ceramic material <b>282</b> formed over such a pattern <b>200</b> and having an interior space with portions corresponding to the portions of the pattern which has been removed in a de-wax process (e.g., autoclave). The exemplary shell also includes a pour cup (pour cone) <b>284</b> which may be assembled to a shell formed over the pattern <b>200</b> or may be formed simultaneously by adding a frustoconical wax body (not shown) atop the end <b>224</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The pour cone interior <b>286</b> extends downward from a rim <b>288</b> to a junction with a feed passageway <b>290</b> formed by the feed portion <b>222</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> further shows a part-forming cavity portion of the shell having a root portion <b>292</b>, a platform portion <b>294</b>, and an airfoil portion <b>296</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> further shows the grain starter portion <b>298</b> and the gating portion <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> further shows an enlarged reservoir portion <b>302</b> corresponding to the pattern's portion <b>252</b>. The passageway <b>303</b> connecting the part-forming cavity to the reservoir portion includes a first proximal leg <b>304</b> extending upward from a lower end at a port <b>306</b> along the part-forming cavity to a junction <b>308</b> with a second leg <b>310</b> of the passageway which joins the reservoir <b>302</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> further shows a portion <b>312</b> of the ceramic material <b>282</b> along the passageway defining the lower end <b>314</b> of the junction <b>308</b> as an apex of a lower surface extreme of the passageway. This apex falls along the plane <b>550</b> to define the part boundary <b>540</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The initial pour of alloy into the part-forming cavity needs to exactly reach the level <b>550</b> to ensure repeatability. Accordingly, the first pour will include at least enough alloy to fill: the grain starter <b>298</b>; the gating <b>300</b>; the first passageway leg or portion <b>304</b> up to the plane <b>550</b>; and airfoil portion <b>296</b> up to the plane <b>550</b>. It would be difficult to provide exactly that amount. Accordingly, an additional margin of pour is provided. This additional amount will overflow through the passageway portions <b>304</b> and <b>310</b> into the reservoir <b>302</b>. As long as this additional amount does not exceed the capacity of the reservoir <b>302</b> and the passageway second portion <b>310</b>, the initial pour will always terminate at the plane <b>550</b>. This allows precision repeatability of result.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">As is discussed further below, in the casting process, the mold is on a metal chill plate <b>320</b> in the furnace. This starts solidification of the casting from the bottom up. Additionally, the mold may be withdrawn downwardly through the furnace bringing the mold progressively into a cooling zone and further upwardly-shifting the solidification front. This becomes relevant because solidifying the material in the passageway (e.g., in a lower portion of leg <b>304</b>) will prevent the one or more subsequent pours from displacing the first pour further and thereby ensure the position of a boundary between the pours and their resulting solidified sections of the casting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-E</figref> show a sequence of instances in the pour process. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the shell or mold is schematically represented by the shape of its interior cavity and the pour cone is not illustrated. Initially, the mold is empty. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the initial pour or shot is fully made and is in a liquid state. There is an accumulation <b>330</b> of the liquid initial alloy in a lower portion of the reservoir with an empty headspace <b>332</b> thereabove extending all the way up the passageway second portion <b>310</b>. There is an accumulation <b>334</b> of the initial alloy in the passageway first portion <b>304</b> up to the apex <b>314</b> and plane <b>550</b>. Similarly, there is an accumulation <b>336</b> extending up from the grain starter into the part-forming cavity up to a surface <b>338</b> at the level <b>550</b>. As the mold is downwardly withdrawn from the furnace, the alloy solidifies from the bottom-up. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> shows a solidification front <b>552</b> leaving solidified alloy therebelow. In the particular instance of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the solidified alloy includes a portion in the lower region of the passageway first portion <b>334</b>. This blocks the passageway and prevents further introduction of alloy to the part-forming cavity from displacing more alloy into the reservoir.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">The pour of the next alloy <b>340</b> may occur after the initial alloy has fully solidified. However, it may alternatively occur while some of the first alloy remains liquid (i.e., while there is still some distance between the front <b>552</b> and the plane <b>550</b>). This small amount of molten material may facilitate a relatively short transition zone to the composition of the subsequent pour and thereby improve bonding between the layers/sections of the blade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Among other variations, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows, in broken line, the use of a central pour cone <b>350</b> (replacing individual pour cones <b>284</b>) to feed a manifold <b>352</b> which in turn feeds a plurality of passageways <b>354</b> each joining one of the associated feed passageway <b>290</b> of an associated individual mold in a cluster of molds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> schematically shows a shell/mold <b>356</b> a second reservoir <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> having a passageway <b>303</b>-<b>2</b> whose apex is at a level <b>550</b>-<b>2</b> above the level <b>550</b> but, may be otherwise similar to <b>303</b>. This allows for creation of the three-zone blade with the second shot/pour overflowing into the second reservoir <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> in a similar fashion to how the initial shot/pour overflowed into the reservoir <b>302</b> thereby ensuring a desired height of the second pour and associated transition location <b>540</b>-<b>2</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) with the third shot/pour. The third pour would follow to form the remainder of the blade (i.e., a portion along the root and optionally extending at least along a proximal portion of the airfoil in this tip-downward example).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> schematically shows a further shell mold <b>358</b> otherwise similar to <b>280</b> with a downsprue <b>360</b> extending from an upper end/inlet <b>362</b> to a lower end at a port <b>364</b> in the part-forming cavity. The initial pour may be through the downsprue (e.g., a bottom-fill process). The second (or other subsequent) pour may proceed down the feed passageway <b>290</b> as in the earlier embodiment. This may have several advantages. For example, in some embodiments this may avoid contamination of the second pour from residue of the first pour. In other embodiments, this allows crucibles associated with the two pours to be kept more remote from each other than if the same pour cone and/or passageway were used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> show yet another shell/mold system <b>398</b> wherein there is a telescoping downsprue <b>400</b> having a relatively larger diameter lower portion <b>402</b> and a relatively smaller diameter upper portion <b>404</b> telescopically inserted in through the upper end of the portion <b>402</b>. Upper portion <b>404</b> may be formed as a single piece along with the pour cone <b>406</b> and a holding feature (e.g., a flange <b>408</b>). As the mold descends through the furnace to provide the aforementioned progressive cooling, the flange <b>408</b> may be held by an upper portion of the furnace to maintain the position of the pour cone in close proximity to the crucible(s) for pouring the metal. This may minimize problems with splashing or other damage which might be associated with the pour cone retracting downward away from the crucible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> more schematically shows a relatively extended condition. In the exemplary embodiment, there are two feeder branches from the downsprue for each part-forming cavity in a cluster. A lower branch <b>420</b> extends from a junction/port <b>422</b> of the downsprue to a junction/port <b>424</b> relatively low in the part-forming cavity. The upper branch <b>426</b> extends from a junction/port <b>428</b> of the downsprue to a junction/port <b>430</b> relatively high along the part-forming cavity. In the initial portion of the extension, the upper portion or member <b>404</b> blocks the port <b>428</b>, but not the port <b>422</b>. Only after a sufficient extension (at which point, at least a portion of the metal in the branch <b>420</b> has solidified to block that branch) is communication through the upper branch <b>426</b> opened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Whereas the lower portion <b>402</b> may be formed by shelling the lateral outboard surface of the pattern element (e.g., in an assembled pattern cluster), the exemplary upper portion <b>404</b> may be formed by shelling an interior of a mold (whether sacrificial or not). For example, the mold may have a tubular portion and a frustoconical portion and the inner diameter (ID) of the mold may be shelled so that the resulting shell, upon removal, has a precise exterior outer diameter (OD) profile to telescopically be received in the interior of the lower portion <b>402</b>.</div>

A similarly structured mold cluster, wherein one of the two cones is not a pour cone but is rather used for ventilation/upflow of a single shot/pour, is found in U.S. Pat.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11I</figref> show a sequence of stages in the use of a furnace <b>800</b>. The exemplary furnace comprises two sources of two alloys. The respective sources are labeled <b>802</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>802</b>-<b>2</b>. Each source comprises an ingot loader <b>804</b> (e.g., conventional type) having an ingot isolation valve <b>806</b> separating the ingot in a waiting position from the interior of a tilt induction melter <b>808</b>. Each tilt induction melter has a ceramic crucible <b>810</b> with an interior for receiving and melting the associated ingot <b>811</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>811</b>-<b>2</b>. In the initial orientation, each crucible will have an open upper end and a closed lower end. The melter further comprises an induction coil <b>812</b> coupled to a power source (not shown) for melting the ingot. Each ingot may be deposited into the associated crucible <b>810</b> by opening the associated isolation valve <b>806</b> and loading the ingot (either manually or automatically) followed by closing the isolation valve. Each induction melter <b>808</b> includes an actuator (<b>809</b>) for pivoting the crucible (and coils) to pour melted material. Exemplary pivoting is about either a fixed axis <b>520</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>520</b>-<b>2</b> or a moving axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Below the sources, the exemplary furnace <b>800</b> includes a furnace section as an induction mold heater <b>820</b>. The exemplary induction mold heater has an induction coil <b>822</b> surrounding a cylindrical graphite susceptor <b>824</b> which surrounds an internal cavity (mold chamber) <b>826</b> for receiving the associated mold. The mold may rest atop the aforementioned chill plate <b>320</b>. The susceptor has an aperture in the top for allowing molten metals to be poured into the pour cone. The susceptor has an aperture <b>828</b> in the bottom allowing the mold to be progressively downwardly withdrawn. The withdrawal may be accomplished via an appropriate elevator system such as a water-cooled vertical ball screw system <b>840</b> supporting the chill plate. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> further shows a fixed water-cooled chill ring <b>842</b> supporting the susceptor via an annular graphite baffle plate <b>843</b> and a mold chamber vacuum isolation valve <b>844</b>. The valve <b>844</b> allows closing of the mold chamber when the chill plate and mold are fully retracted out of the mold chamber <b>826</b>. This may allow heating of the chamber with the valve closed and may allow maintenance of the chamber temperature while a retracted mold is removed and replaced with a fresh mold (e.g., the valve thereafter being opened and the elevator used to raise the new mold). The exemplary valve <b>844</b> comprises a hinged valve element (door) hinged about an upper horizontal axis with an open position shown and a closed position rotated 90° clockwise about the axis as viewed. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows the fresh mold raised up into the mold chamber with ingots in the loaders and empty induction melters.</div>

The ingot feeders are shown as ingot vacuum load chambers with vertical actuators for progressively lowering an ingot. The actuators maintain a lower end (tip portion) <b>910</b> of the ingot at a location accessible via an associated electron beam <b>920</b> generated by an associated electron beam gun <b>922</b> to melt the tip portion of the ingot and allow the molten material to fall into a vessel <b>930</b> such as a pivotal copper water-cooled hearth. As were the tilt melters, the hearth may be emptied by tilting by associated actuators (<b>932</b>). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> further shows a sliding valve <b>940</b> (direction of motion <b>526</b>) to isolate the upper chamber containing the sources from the main casting/mold chamber <b>826</b>. Such a valve may be applied to any of the other apparatus. Otherwise, operational sequences may be similar to those described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">In yet another alternative to the tilt melters of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, alternative melters may be formed as induction skull melters (e.g., segmented copper or steel sheaths with induction coils inside).</div>
