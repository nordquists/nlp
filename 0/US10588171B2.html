<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 62/505,473, entitled “TECHNIQUES FOR MULTI-STATE DRX IN NEW RADIO” and filed on May 12, 2017, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to techniques for multi-state discontinuous reception (DRX) (e.g., connected mode DRX or C-DRX) in wireless communications (e.g., 5th Generation New Radio or 5G NR).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various telecommunication services such as telephony, video, data, messaging, and broadcasts. Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. An example telecommunication standard is Long Term Evolution (LTE) or LTE-Advanced (LTE-A). However, although newer multiple access systems, such as an LTE or LTE-A system, deliver faster data throughput than older technologies, such increased downlink rates have triggered a greater demand for higher-bandwidth content, such as high-resolution graphics and video, for use on or with mobile devices. As such, demand for bandwidth, higher data rates, better transmission quality as well as better spectrum utilization, and lower latency on wireless communication systems continues to increase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The 5th Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) communications technology, used in a wide range of spectrum, is envisaged to expand and support diverse usage scenarios and applications with respect to current mobile network generations. In an aspect, 5G NR communications technology includes, for example: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) addressing human-centric use cases for access to multimedia content, services and data; ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) with strict requirements, especially in terms of latency and reliability; and massive machine type communications (mMTC) for a very large number of connected devices and typically transmitting a relatively low volume of non-delay-sensitive information. As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, there exists a need for further improvements in 5G communications technology and beyond. Preferably, these improvements should be applicable to other multi-access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, due to the requirements for increased data rates, higher capacity, and lower latency, new approaches may be desirable to improve the system reliability and energy efficiency by using enhanced DRX (e.g., multi-state C-DRX) schemes and techniques, in order to enhance medium access and/or scheduling, satisfy consumer demand, and improve user experience in wireless communications, e.g., 5G NR communications.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects.

For example, a computer-readable medium storing computer code executable by a processor for multi-state DRX in wireless communications is provided. The computer-readable medium may include code for identifying at least two states in connected mode, code for determining one or more triggers for transitioning between the at least two states, and code for transitioning from a first state of the at least two states to a second state of the at least two states in response to a determination of the one or more triggers.

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In a conventional wireless communications system (e.g., an LTE system), connected mode discontinuous reception (C-DRX) may support two states from a user equipment (UE) functionality perspective. In some examples, across time, a UE may be configured to operate in a sleep mode (e.g., a DRX state) or an active mode/state (e.g., a mode/state with either an ON duration or an inactivity timer being not expired). In an aspect, during the active mode/state, the UE may be configured to support full functionality of the UE. In some implementations, coarse granularity of states may lead to some simplicity in scheduler design at the expense of sacrificing some UE power. On the other hand, to allow better tradeoff between power consumption and latency, finer granularity of DRX states may be used or applied to improve UE power efficiency. As such, enhanced DRX schemes and techniques with finer granularity of DRX states may be desirable to improve the system reliability and/or to enhance system energy efficiency by using multi-state (e.g., two or more states) C-DRX in wireless communications (e.g., 5G NR).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In some aspects related to 5G NR communications, multiple DRX states are proposed to enhance the DRX operations and save power. For example, in an aspect, several states (e.g., a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) monitoring state) may be used for low percentage of data being scheduled for transmission or reception. In another aspect, data ready state may be used for high percentage of data being scheduled for transmission or reception. In an aspect, a wake-up signaling (WUS) pre-wake-up state may be used to allow skipping of the ON duration(s) of a DRX cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In some aspects related to intuition for efficiency gain, for example, in a relatively short DRX cycle, the inactivity timer may be short. Depending on the traffic pattern, significant percentage of the DRX cycle may be empty. A WUS pre-wake-up state may be used and reap most of the potential power saving. In a relatively long DRX cycle, the inactivity timer may be long. In this case, a PDCCH monitoring state and/or a WUS monitoring state may be used to allow potential grant monitoring at a lower power level, comparing with using a data ready state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In some aspects, a state may comprise a respective configuration for connected mode operation (e.g., C-DRX). In some examples, the configuration may be at least one of cross-slot scheduling, same-slot scheduling, an adaptive bandwidth for signal reception (e.g., using bandwidth parts), low power setting, or high power setting. In some cases, transitioning from one state to another state may comprise dynamically transitioning from one configuration to another configuration for C-DRX operations. The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, components, circuits, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as “elements”). These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware, computer software, or any combination thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">By way of example, an element, or any portion of an element, or any combination of elements may be implemented as a “processing system” that includes one or more processors. Examples of processors include microprocessors, microcontrollers, graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs), application processors, digital signal processors (DSPs), reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processors, systems on a chip (SoC), baseband processors, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), state machines, gated logic, discrete hardware circuits, and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. One or more processors in the processing system may execute software. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, instruction sets, code, code segments, program code, programs, subprograms, software components, applications, software applications, software packages, routines, subroutines, objects, executables, threads of execution, procedures, functions, etc., whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, in one or more example aspects, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or encoded as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes computer storage media. Storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise a random-access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage, other magnetic storage devices, combinations of the aforementioned types of computer-readable media, or any other medium that can be used to store computer executable code in the form of instructions or data structures that can be accessed by a computer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In a conventional wireless communication system (e.g., an LTE system), DRX (e.g., C-DRX) may support two states from UE functionality perspective. In some implementations, a UE may be in DRX (or a sleep mode) or Active (either ON duration or inactivity timer unexpired) state/mode. During the Active state, the UE may be required to support full functionality. For example, the UE may support PDCCH decoding, and upon decoding a downlink (DL) grant in a subframe (or a transmission time interval (TTI)), the UE may receive data in the same subframe. In an aspect, the UE may support transmission of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback(s). In an example, when there is no grant in a subframe, the UE may perform micro-sleep for the rest of the subframe. However, in an aspect, due to PDCCH decoding latency, the duration of micro-sleep may be short and extent of power saving may be limited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In an aspect, during the Active state, receiving bandwidth of the UE may be across the full or entire bandwidth of a component carrier (CC), e.g., a primary CC or a secondary CC, or a CC in carrier aggregation (CA). In some examples, the UE (e.g., a receiver at the UE) may need to be warmed up in terms of having accurate frequency and/or time tracking, and/or channel estimate(s) on or before the start of the Active state and be ready to receive data. In some current implementations, coarse granularity of DRX states may be used or configured which may lead to simplicity in base station (or network) scheduler design at the expense of sub-optimal UE power saving.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In some aspects of 5G NR communications related to present disclosure, the system or the UE may support and facilitate finer granularity of states for DRX (e.g., C-DRX). In some examples, cross-slot scheduling may be used or configured. For example, K<sub>0 </sub>(the difference in slot number between the slot in which a DL grant is transmitted by the base station and the slot in which the corresponding data is transmitted), may be equal or larger than one (1) (e.g., K<sub>0</sub>=1 or larger), while K<sub>0 </sub>in a conventional communication system (e.g., an LTE system) may be fixed to zero (0), which may indicate that the data is transmitted in the same slot (or the same subframe in LTE) as the grant. In some cases, K<sub>0 </sub>is configurable by the UE and/or the network. In some examples, adaptive bandwidth for receptions may be used or configured. For example, a UE may use part or a portion of the CC bandwidth for signal receptions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In some examples, WUS may be supported or configured. For example, a UE may wake up during the ON duration of an associated DRX cycle, however, if no data or signal is scheduled for the associated DRX cycle, the UE may waste power to perform a full-wake-up of the UE (e.g., full-wake-up of the modem at the UE) and get ready for data reception, and find out that there is no grant in the ON duration or the associated DRX cycle. In this case, the network may inform or indicate the UE in advance (e.g., one or more slots before the ON duration) if no data or grant (e.g., DL grant) is scheduled for the associated DRX cycle. In an example, the UE may skip the ON duration for the associated DRX cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">According to aspects of the present disclosure, multi-state DRX (e.g., C-DRX) schemes and operations for wireless communication are used, e.g., to save power at a UE or a network entity. In some aspects, finer granularity of DRX states may be used or configured, which may allow better tradeoff between power consumption and latency. In some examples, DRX (e.g., C-DRX) state transitions may be configured among multiple DRX states (e.g., three or more C-DRX states). For example, DRX transition(s) from a lower power state to a higher power state may be triggered by signaling, which may be explicit (e.g., via downlink control information (DCI)) or implicit (e.g., via a UL/DL grant). In another example, DRX transitions from a higher power state to a lower power state may be managed by one or more timers (e.g., whether a timer is expired), and explicit signaling may be supported.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In some aspects, the DRX states discussed herein may include several states that are optimized for low percentage of data scheduled, for example, a PDCCH monitoring state and/or a WUS monitoring state. In some implementations, when a UE is connected to a cell, the UE may monitor or detect a set of PDCCH candidates (e.g., a set of consecutive control channel elements (CCEs) on which a PDCCH may be mapped) in every subframe, slot, or TTI. In some examples, the UE may monitor or detect configured WUS resource at a configured periodicity. In some examples, comparing with PDCCH, WUS may carry fewer bits (e.g., 1-bit), narrower bandwidth, lower decoding complexity, lower sleep-wake transition overhead(s), fewer (or just one) search space(s), and may be with larger latency. On the other hand, a data ready state may be optimized for high percentage of data scheduled. In some examples, a WUS pre-wake-up state may be used or configured, and may allow the UE to skip of the ON duration of a DRX cycle (e.g., to save power).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In some aspects, transition(s) between DRX (e.g., C-DRX) states discussed herein may be based on UE capabilities or support for physical channels (e.g., “reception only” or “reception and transmission capable”, control channel (CCH) only, data only, CCH and data, and/or WUS only), latency target (e.g., cross-slot scheduling or same-slot scheduling), and/or bandwidth situation or requirement (e.g., narrow or wide). In some examples, the transition(s) between DRX (e.g., C-DRX) states discussed herein may be dynamic. For example, dynamic transition(s) may be configured or performed between cross-slot and same-slot scheduling, between narrow and wide bandwidth, between larger and smaller periodicity for PDCCH and/or WUS monitoring. In another aspect, small data reception during a PDCCH monitoring state may be used or configured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">According to aspects of the present disclosure, the DRX states discussed herein may enhance the efficiency gain. In an example, for a relatively short DRX cycle, inactivity timer may be short. Depending on the traffic pattern, significant percentage of the DRX cycle may be empty. In this case, a WUS pre-wake-up state may reap most of the potential saving. In another example, for a relatively long DRX cycle, inactivity timer may be long. Therefore, a PDCCH monitoring state and/or a WUS monitoring state may be used or configured to allow potential grant monitoring at a lower power level, compared with operating in a data ready state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">According to aspects of the present disclosure, the DRX states discussed herein may be configurable. For example, the number of DRX states and/or the DRX state transition scheme(s) discussed herein may be configured by a base station (e.g., a next generation Node B or a gNB). In an example, the DRX states and/or the transition scheme(s) may be configured according to UE support (e.g., whether the UE supports WUS reception), and/or according to a traffic pattern or traffic statistics. For example, if traffic is periodic and nearly deterministic (e.g., packet-switched voice, voice over LTE (VoLTE), or voice over NR (VoNR)), 2-state DRX scheme may be used and may be efficient. In another example, if a DRX cycle is short due to low latency bound, the effective inactivity timer may be short, and a WUS monitoring state may not be used or configured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In some aspects, short-slot (or mini-slot) and/or large subcarrier spacing (SCS) may lead to a short slot duration in 5G NR communications. In an example of millimeter wave (mmWave), a SCS with 120 kHz may lead to a slot duration with 125 μs. In an aspect, if a slot is too short in time, there may not be enough time for radio frequency (RF) retuning to perform bandwidth adaptation. In some cases, multiple slots may be aggregated together to make time for RF retuning, and PDCCH monitoring periodicity in the associated DRX state (e.g., PDCCH monitoring state) may be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In some aspect, the UE or the system may support both short and long DRX cycles. In some implementations, a short DRX cycle and/or a long DRX cycle may not introduce an additional DRX state, and a short or a long DRX cycle is a scheme to adapt the duration of a DRX cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In some aspects, implicit WUS may be used or configured based on tracking one or more reference signals (RSs). In some examples, the existence or non-existence of tracking one or more RSs before the ON duration may be indicated to the UE (e.g., via a “0” or “1”). For example, the existence of tracking one or more RSs before the ON duration may indicate that there will be data scheduled for the UE. In some cases, tracking RS may be UE-specific or group-specific. For example, in the case for group-specific, all UEs belonging to the group may be woken up if any one of the UEs would be scheduled. In some implementations, there may be net power saving if most of the time all of the UEs in the group are not “paged” or indicated. In some cases, the indication of whether tracking one or more RSs before the ON duration may be resource efficient, since tracking RS is intended for UE warm-up for ON duration. In some examples, even though WUS based on PDCCH signaling may be more robust, for implicit WUS based on tracking RS, the receiver at the UE may be designed to have a very low miss-detection rate at the expense of a higher false alarm rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in an aspect, a wireless communication system <b>100</b> (e.g., a 5G NR system) includes at least a UE <b>12</b> or a UE <b>14</b> in communication coverage of at least one network entity <b>20</b> (e.g., a base station or a gNB, or a cell thereof, in a 5G NR network). UE <b>12</b> and/or UE <b>14</b> may communicate with a network via the network entity <b>20</b>.

In an aspect, the network entity <b>20</b> may be a base station such a gNB in a 5G NR network, and/or an eNodeB/eNB in an LTE network.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in some implementations, a downlink scheduling scheme <b>200</b> may be used by a UE (e.g., the UE <b>12</b> or UE <b>14</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In an aspect, within a component carrier (CC), the UE may be configured to monitor a control channel (CCH) (e.g., PDCCH) within a control resource set or CORESET (e.g., a CORESET reception (Rx) bandwidth (BW) <b>206</b>), which may, for example, span only a portion of the CC bandwidth in frequency domain. In time domain, in each slot (e.g., Slot<sub>n</sub>, Slot<sub>n+1</sub>, and/or Slot<sub>n+2</sub>), the UE may be configured as “Reception (RX) RF active.” For example, during the time duration <b>202</b> in one of Slot<sub>n</sub>, Slot<sub>n+1</sub>, and Slot<sub>n+2</sub>, the UE may be configured to actively receive RF signals. In some cases, during the time duration <b>202</b>, the UE may be configured to monitor a CCH (e.g., PDCCH) for control information (e.g., resource allocation, same-slot scheduling, or grant).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In an aspect, for example, if no grant is detected or received in a CCH during the time duration <b>202</b> (e.g., as shown in Slot<sub>n+1 </sub>and Slot<sub>n+2</sub>), micro-sleep may be configured at the UE during a time duration <b>204</b>. In some examples, with same-slot scheduling or grant (e.g., K<sub>0</sub>=0, which indicates that a DL grant and the data may be transmitted in a same slot), the time duration <b>204</b> that is feasible for micro-sleep may be limited (e.g., to a reduced/shortened time duration, as shown in Slot<sub>n+1 </sub>and Slot<sub>n+2</sub>) due to CCH or PDCCH processing latency (e.g., on or after the time duration <b>202</b>). In some cases, the time duration limitation may reduce the depth of sleep and the extent of power saving at the UE. In some cases, PDCCH processing latency may be reduced to increase the time for micro-sleep (e.g., increase the time duration <b>204</b>), however, the reduction of PDCCH processing latency may cause a higher peak power during PDCCH processing and/or a larger chip area used for a PDCCH processor, compared to PDCCH processing without latency reduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in some implementations, a downlink scheduling scheme <b>250</b> may be used by a UE (e.g., the UE <b>12</b> or UE <b>14</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In an aspect, similar to downlink scheduling scheme <b>200</b>, the UE may be configured to monitor a CCH (e.g., PDCCH) within a control resource set or CORESET (e.g., the CORESET reception (Rx) bandwidth (BW) <b>206</b>), which may, for example, span only a portion of the CC bandwidth in frequency domain. In time domain, in each slot (e.g., Slot<sub>n</sub>, Slot<sub>n+1</sub>, and/or Slot<sub>n+2</sub>), the UE may be configured as “Rx RF active.” For example, during the time duration <b>202</b> in one of Slot<sub>n</sub>, Slot<sub>n+1</sub>, and Slot<sub>n+2</sub>, the UE may be configured to actively receive RF signals. In some cases, during the time duration <b>202</b>, the UE may be configured to monitor a CCH (e.g., PDCCH) for control information (e.g., resource allocation, same-slot scheduling, or grant).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In an aspect, for example, if no grant is detected or received in a CCH during the time duration <b>202</b> (e.g., as shown in Slot<sub>n </sub>and Slot<sub>n+1</sub>), micro-sleep may be configured at the UE during a time duration <b>252</b> in a consequent slot. In an example, if no grant is detected or received in a CCH during the time duration <b>202</b> in the Slot<sub>n+1</sub>, micro-sleep may be configured at the UE during a time duration <b>252</b> in the Slot<sub>n+2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In some examples, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, with cross-slot scheduling or grant (e.g., K<sub>0</sub>=1, which indicates that the data may be transmitted in the next slot of a slot in which a DL grant may be transmitted), the time duration <b>252</b> that is feasible for micro-sleep may be extended assuming PDCCH processing may be performed even during a micro-sleep state in a previous slot. For example, micro-sleep may be configured and extended from a time duration <b>204</b> to a time duration <b>252</b> at the UE during the Slot<sub>n+2</sub>, in response to a determination that the PDCCH processing in the Slot<sub>n+1 </sub>may be performed even during a micro-sleep state (e.g., a time duration <b>204</b> or <b>252</b> in Slot<sub>n+1</sub>). Typically, micro-sleep mainly involves disabling the RF (e.g., disabling signal reception), so PDCCH processing in the modem may still be performed during micro-sleep (e.g., a time duration <b>204</b> or <b>252</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In some examples, compared with same-slot scheduling or grant (e.g., the downlink scheduling scheme <b>200</b>), by using cross-slot scheduling or grant (e.g., the downlink scheduling scheme <b>250</b>), PDCCH processing timeline may become less critical as long as the PDCCH processing is able to finish before the next slot, which may allow greater PDCCH processor design flexibility and lower operating point for clock and voltage (compared with same-slot scheduling or grant), and to save power at the UE. In some aspects, cross-slot scheduling may suffer slightly from a “overlap” effect as for the same number of slots to be scheduled, the modem active timeline may be extended by K<sub>0 </sub>number of slots. In some examples, the additional power saving may overcome the cost for the “overlap” effect, especially if the percentage of CCH-only (e.g., grant-less or no grant) slots (e.g., Slot<sub>n</sub>, Slot<sub>n+1</sub>, and/or Slot<sub>n+2</sub>) is significant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, in an aspect, an adaptive reception scheme <b>300</b> may be used by a UE (e.g., the UE <b>12</b> or UE <b>14</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In an example of 5G NR, the CCH bandwidth (e.g., an Rx BW <b>314</b> for CCH) may be smaller than the potential data bandwidth (e.g., an Rx BW <b>316</b> for data and CCH). In an aspect, within a CC, the UE may be configured to monitor a CCH (e.g., PDCCH) within a CORESET (e.g., the Rx BW <b>314</b>), which may span only a portion of the CC bandwidth in frequency domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In some examples, the UE may be configured in a UE BW (e.g., the Rx BW <b>316</b>) which is inclusive of the CORESET (e.g., the Rx BW <b>314</b>) and potential DL data allocation (e.g., a DL data allocation <b>306</b>). In some cases, the UE BW may be smaller than the CC BW. For example, CC BW may be 100 MHz, but UE is running a packetized-voice application that may not need more than 20 MHz BW, so UE BW may be configured to 20 MHz. In some examples, when the UE uses the adaptive reception scheme <b>300</b>, an RF BW for UE reception (Rx BW) may adapt between the BW used for monitoring for CCH only (e.g., the Rx BW <b>314</b>) which is narrower, and the BW used for receiving data and CCH (e.g., the Rx BW <b>316</b>) which is wider.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In time domain, in each slot (e.g., Slot<sub>n</sub>, Slot<sub>n+1</sub>, Slot<sub>n+2</sub>, . . . , Slot<sub>n+x+2</sub>, Slot<sub>n+x+3</sub>, and/or Slot<sub>n+x+4</sub>), the UE may be configured in an Rx RF active mode <b>318</b> during one or more monitoring or reception time periods. For example, during a time duration <b>302</b> in a slot (e.g., Slot<sub>n</sub>, Slot<sub>n+1</sub>, Slot<sub>n+2</sub>, . . . , Slot<sub>n+x+2</sub>, Slot<sub>n+x+3</sub>, and/or Slot<sub>n+x+4</sub>), the UE may be configured to actively receive RF signals. In some examples, during the time duration <b>302</b>, the UE may be configured to monitor a CCH (e.g., PDCCH) for control information such as resource allocation, same-slot scheduling, or grant (e.g., DL grant or uplink (UL) grant). In some cases, the UE may be configured in the Rx RF active mode <b>318</b> to actively receive RF signals (e.g., a CCH, a PDCCH, and/or a DL data allocation <b>306</b>) during a time period <b>308</b> (e.g., a time period equals to a slot) or a time period <b>310</b> (e.g., a time period equals to the time period <b>302</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In some cases, BW adaptation may have transition latency. For example, within the same band, if the center frequency needs to be changed, the latency is in the order of 50 μs to 200 μs. In an aspect, triggering the transition dynamically based on grant may be desirable, while the CCH and UE BW (e.g., the union of data and CCH) may be semi-statically configured (e.g., using the Rx BW <b>316</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In some aspects, by using the adaptive reception scheme <b>300</b>, a cross-slot grant may provide a framework to accommodate BW transition latency (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). In some examples, the UE may be configured in an Rx RF BW transition mode <b>320</b> during one or more time periods to accommodate BW transition(s). In an example, “no-grant to grant” transition <b>304</b> (e.g., in Slot<sub>n+1</sub>) may trigger widening of BW, for example, transitioning from the Rx BW <b>314</b> to the Rx BW <b>316</b> to cover the union of data and CCH. In some cases, a number of consecutive no-grant triggers transition <b>312</b> (e.g., in Slot<sub>n+x+3</sub>) to narrow UE BW, for example, from the Rx BW <b>316</b> to the Rx BW <b>314</b> that covers CCH reception.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">In an aspect, for cross-slot scheduling, narrowing of BW may be conditioned on at least two back-to-back no-grants (e.g., the transition <b>312</b> after least two back-to-back no-grants in Slot<sub>n+x+2 </sub>and Slot<sub>n+x+3</sub>) to avoid excessive switching of BW. For example, during a BW transition such as BW narrowing, grant is decoded for the next slot and BW narrowing may be aborted. In some examples, switching to same-slot grant during a wide BW state (e.g., a state that is expecting data reception) may be performed (e.g., as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). In some cases, the gap at the end of a slot may be added or used to accommodate UL control block(s). For example, in some use cases of same-slot scheduling, each slot may have an opportunity for UL control transmission that has lowest latency (e.g., due to latency reduction from same-slot scheduling).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In an example, signaling explicit BW indication(s) to control the BW state may be used. For example, an explicit BW indication (e.g., via DCI) may indicate the UE to enter or exit a predetermined connected mode state. In some cases, the UE may use the explicit BW indication to identify or determine a configuration which may include at least one of cross-slot scheduling, same-slot scheduling, an adaptive bandwidth for signal reception (e.g., using bandwidth parts), low power setting, or high power setting at the UE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, in an aspect, an adaptive reception scheme <b>350</b> may be used by a UE (e.g., the UE <b>12</b> or UE <b>14</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In an example of 5G NR, cross-slot grant does not necessarily imply that all DL grant information is transmitted in the DCI in the previous slot. For example, at the minimum, the BW and/or resource allocation information may be transmitted in a previous slot (e.g., Part 1 of the grant or DCI in Slot<sub>n+1 </sub>or Slot<sub>n+x+4</sub>). In an aspect, a two-part DCI may be used or configured. For example, in addition to the BW and/or resource allocation information that is transmitted in the previous slot, the remaining control information (e.g. modulation and coding scheme (MCS), new data indicator (NDI), or redundancy version (RV)) may be transmitted in the same slot as the data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">In an example, in a first slot (e.g., Slot<sub>n+1</sub>), the UE may detect a Part 1 grant (e.g., having the first part of the DCI) from the CCH (in Slot<sub>n+1</sub>) during the time period <b>302</b>, and may be configured in an Rx RF BW transition mode <b>320</b> to accommodate BW transition. In this example, “no-grant to grant” transition <b>304</b> in Slot<sub>n+1 </sub>may trigger widening of BW, for example, transitioning from the Rx BW <b>314</b> to the Rx BW <b>316</b> to receive data and control information. In an aspect, in a second slot (e.g., a consecutive slot such as Slot<sub>n+2</sub>) may be a transition slot having a time period <b>308</b> with a cross-slot grant, and a two-part DCI may be used for the transition slot. For instance, a Part 1 grant (having the first part of the DCI) from the CCH in Slot<sub>n+1 </sub>and a Part 2 grant (having the second part of the DCI) from the CCH in Slot<sub>n+2 </sub>may form a two-part grant or two-part DCI used for DL data allocation <b>306</b> within the transition slot Slot<sub>n+2</sub>. In another example, the Part 1 grant and Part 2 grant may be repetition of a full or single-part DCI for robustness, with indication for whether the reception is cross-slot or same-slot. In some cases, the second part of the DCI may provide an opportunity for the UE to detect if the first part of the DCI was missed due to PDCCH decoding error, and rectify the issue for the following slot by switching to a wide BW state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In an aspect, once the UE transitions from a narrow BW state (e.g., a state that is for monitoring or receiving CCH, and/or has an Rx BW <b>314</b> for CCH reception) to a wide BW state (e.g., a state that is expecting data reception, and/or has an Rx BW <b>316</b> for data and CCH reception), same-slot scheduling or grant may be used. For example, after the transition slot (e.g., the second slot, Slot<sub>n+2</sub>, having a two-part grant and/or two-part DCI for DL data allocation), same-slot scheduling or grant may be used in a third (consecutive) slot (e.g., Slot<sub>n+3</sub>) for DL data allocation and signal reception.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">In some examples, using the adaptive reception scheme <b>350</b>, similar to the adaptive reception scheme <b>300</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the UE may be configured in an Rx RF active mode <b>318</b> during one or more monitoring or reception time periods (e.g., time periods <b>302</b>, <b>308</b>, and/or <b>322</b>) in one or more slots (e.g., Slot<sub>n</sub>, Slot<sub>n+1</sub>, Slot<sub>n+2</sub>, Slot<sub>n+3</sub>, . . . , Slot<sub>n+x+3</sub>, Slot<sub>n+x+4</sub>, and/or Slot<sub>n+x+5</sub>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In another aspect, a threshold number of consecutive “no grant” may trigger transition back to a narrow BW state (e.g., a state that is for monitoring or receiving CCH, and/or has an Rx BW <b>314</b> for CCH reception).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in an aspect, two examples of WUS schemes, a WUS scheme <b>400</b> and a WUS scheme <b>420</b>, may be used by a UE (e.g., the UE <b>12</b> or UE <b>14</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in a wireless communication system (e.g., 5G NR). In some examples, the y-axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represents the instantaneous power consumption level across the timeline in the x-axis. In some cases, power saving may be realized by opportunistic activation of the higher power consuming state. For example, if no data to be scheduled or no DL grant for a DRX cycle, the UE may not have to waste power to perform a full-wake-up of the modem and get ready for data reception, only to find out that there is no grant. In some cases, WUS may be optimized so that decoding on the UE can be lower complexity (and/or lower power), compared to decoding PDCCH with its associated overhead. Also, sleep-wake transition overhead may be smaller for a WUS reception.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In an example of using the WUS scheme <b>400</b>, if no data to be scheduled or no DL grant for a DRX cycle <b>418</b>, a “pre-wake-up” (PWU) duration <b>402</b> may be added before an ON duration <b>416</b>. For instance, one or more PWU durations <b>402</b> may be used for WUS monitoring. If WUS is not detected during a PWU duration <b>402</b>, the UE may skip an ON duration <b>416</b> for the associated DRX cycle <b>418</b>. In some cases, the UE may be configured in a deep sleep state <b>404</b> (e.g., State 0 as discussed below) if WUS is not detected during a PWU duration <b>402</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">In another example, in the WUS scheme <b>420</b>, a PWU offset <b>414</b> before the ON duration <b>416</b> may be used to support “warm-up” of the full modem operations in a DRX cycle. In some cases, the PWU offset <b>414</b> may be semi-statically configured. In this example, once the UE monitors or detects a grant (e.g., a DL grant or DCI) during a PWU duration <b>402</b> and a PWU offset <b>414</b> is configured, before the ON duration <b>416</b>, the UE may set to the deep sleep state <b>404</b>, and then “warm-up” by using a power ramp-up state <b>406</b>. During the ON duration <b>416</b>, the UE may be configured to receive DL control information on PDCCH with main modem in a PDCCH-only Rx state <b>408</b>, followed by a data and control channel processing state <b>410</b>. During an inactivity timer <b>422</b> (within a DRC cycle), the UE may be configured to continue receive DL control information on PDCCH with main modem in the PDCCH-only Rx state <b>408</b>. Once the inactivity timer <b>422</b> expires, the UE may be configured to a power ramp-down state <b>412</b>, and then back to the deep sleep state <b>404</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in an aspect, a small data reception scheme <b>500</b> for enhanced CCH monitoring may be used by a UE (e.g., the UE <b>12</b> or UE <b>14</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in a wireless communications system (e.g., 5G NR). In some examples, a PDCCH monitoring state (e.g., State 2 as discussed below) may be supported and enhanced by using small data reception within the BW for CCH monitoring. In an aspect, the enhancement may include explicitly signaling of “small data” grant, and may have no effect on state transition or timer. Regular grant may trigger transition to a “data ready” state (e.g., State 1 as discussed below).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In an aspect, the small data reception scheme <b>500</b> may be used by a UE (e.g., the UE <b>12</b> or UE <b>14</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that is configured to use cross-slot scheduling. In some cases, same-slot scheduling is also feasible at the expense of less effective micro-sleep. In some examples, when small data (e.g., small data <b>508</b>) is scheduled in the same slot as BW transition, only partial slot may be useable, and this partial slot utilization may be restricted to certain type of data, for example, MAC control elements (CEs), or other layer 1 (L1) control information embedded in data. In some examples, the small data reception scheme <b>500</b> may be used by the UE to avoid switching to “data ready” state for small data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">In an example of using the small data reception scheme <b>500</b>, the CCH bandwidth (e.g., an Rx BW <b>314</b> for CCH) may be smaller than the potential data bandwidth (e.g., an Rx BW <b>316</b> for data and CCH). In an aspect, the UE may be configured to monitor a CCH (e.g., PDCCH) within a CORESET (e.g., the Rx BW <b>314</b>), which may span only a portion of the CC BW in frequency domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">In some examples, the UE may be configured in a UE BW (e.g., the Rx BW <b>316</b>) which is inclusive of the CCH (e.g., the Rx BW <b>314</b>) and potential DL data allocation (e.g., a DL data allocation <b>514</b>) in one or more slots (e.g., Slot<sub>n+3</sub>). In some cases, when the UE detects a small data grant, the UE BW may be set to the Rx BW <b>314</b>. For example, once the UE detects a small data grant in Slot<sub>n</sub>, the UE may use a portion of Slot<sub>n+1 </sub>(e.g., a small data reception <b>504</b> having a time duration <b>506</b> and a BW equal or less than the Rx BW <b>314</b>) receive or process the small data. In some examples, when the UE uses the small data reception scheme <b>500</b>, an RF BW for UE reception (Rx BW) may adapt between the BW used for monitoring for CCH only (e.g., the Rx BW <b>314</b>) which is narrower, and the BW used for receiving data and CCH (e.g., the Rx BW <b>316</b>) which is wider.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">In time domain, in each slot (e.g., Slot<sub>n</sub>, Slot<sub>n+1</sub>, Slot<sub>n+2</sub>, and/or Slot<sub>n+3</sub>), the UE may be configured in an Rx RF active mode <b>520</b> during one or more monitoring or reception time periods. For example, during a time duration <b>502</b> in a slot (e.g., Slot<sub>n</sub>, Slot<sub>n+2</sub>, and/or Slot<sub>n+3</sub>), the UE may be configured to actively receive RF signals. In some examples, during the time duration <b>502</b>, the UE may be configured to monitor a CCH (e.g., PDCCH) for control information such as resource allocation, cross-slot or same-slot scheduling, or grant (e.g., DL grant or UL grant). In some cases, the UE may be configured in the Rx RF active mode <b>520</b> to actively receive RF signals (e.g., small data <b>504</b> or <b>508</b>) during a time period <b>506</b> or <b>510</b> (e.g., a time period less than a slot) or a time period <b>516</b> (e.g., a time period equals to a slot).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">In some examples, the UE may be configured in an Rx RF BW transition mode <b>518</b> during one or more time periods to accommodate BW transition(s). In an example, a BW transition <b>512</b> (e.g., in Slot<sub>n+2</sub>) may trigger widening of BW, for example, transitioning from the Rx BW <b>314</b> to the Rx BW <b>316</b> to cover a regular grant (e.g., a grant for a DL data allocation <b>514</b>) and CCH reception (e.g., in Slot<sub>n+3</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in an aspect, state diagrams for a 2-state scheme <b>600</b> (e.g., in an LTE system) and a 3-state scheme <b>650</b> may be used or configured by a UE (e.g., the UE <b>12</b> or UE <b>14</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in a wireless communications system (e.g., 5G NR). In some aspects, a multi-state C-DRX scheme (e.g., the 2-state scheme <b>600</b> or the 3-state scheme <b>650</b>) may use two or more states or configurations discussed herein. For example, a DRX or Sleep state <b>602</b> (State 0) may be used for the UE in deep sleep and is not expected to receive or monitor any signal. In an example, the UE may transition out of DRX or Sleep state <b>602</b> (e.g., to another state such as a Data Ready state <b>604</b> as discussed below) during the start of a next DRX cycle or before the PWU duration for the next DRX cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">In another aspect, a Data Ready state <b>604</b> (State 1) may be used for efficient reception of data. When the UE is in Data Ready state, same-slot scheduling may be used or configured (e.g., K<sub>0</sub>=0). In some examples, micro-sleep (e.g., discussed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) may not be effective, and the percentage of no grant time duration during Data Ready state may be as small as possible. In an aspect, a UE Rx BW in Data Ready state may cover potential data allocation and CCH (e.g., as discussed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), and the UE Rx BW may be semi-statically configured and may be UE-specific. In some examples, the US may enter Data Ready state when the UE knows or is indicated that data will be scheduled (e.g., when a cross-slot grant is decoded when the UE is in another state other than the Data Ready state <b>604</b>). In some cases, when Timer <b>1</b> expires, the UE may exit the Data Ready state <b>604</b> (e.g., to the DRX or Sleep state <b>602</b>). Timer <b>1</b> is a count-down timer and may reset with a pre-configured value whenever a grant is decoded, and Timer <b>1</b> may decrement when no grant is detected. In some examples, explicit dynamic Layer 1 (L1) signaling (e.g., via DCI) for the entrance and/or exit of the Data Ready state may be supported or used by the UE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">In some examples, C-DRX in LTE may use a 2-state design (e.g., having the DRX or Sleep state <b>602</b> (State 0) and the Data Ready state <b>604</b> (State 1)). In an example, a long DRX cycle and/or a short DRX cycle supported in LTE may affect the duration of a DRX cycle, and may not be considered as an introduction of one or more additional states. In an example, when the Data Ready state <b>604</b> (State 1) is initially entered, Timer <b>1</b> is set to an “ON duration” value. Whenever a grant is decoded, Timer <b>1</b> may be re-initialized to “inactivity timer duration” value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Regarding the 3-state scheme <b>650</b>, in an example, a PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b> (State 2) is added in between the DRX or Sleep state <b>602</b> (State 0) and the Data Ready state <b>604</b> (State 1) based on the 2-state scheme <b>600</b>. In an aspect, the correspondence to an LTE 2-state design may include one or more values for setting Timer <b>2</b> which may be similar to an “ON duration,” and a sum of the Timer <b>1</b> and the Timer <b>2</b> is equivalent or close to the “inactivity timer duration.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">In particular, the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b> (State 2) may be used for monitoring of CCH, and make the monitoring more efficient. For example, cross-slot scheduling may be used (e.g., K<sub>0</sub>=1), and micro-sleep operations are more effective due to significant percentage of slots having no grant expected in the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b>. In an aspect, the Rx BW may cover only the configured CORESET that the UE is monitoring or required to monitor/detect. In some examples, upon successful decoding of a grant (e.g., DL or UL grant), the UE may transition from the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b> to another state, for example, the Data Ready state <b>604</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">In some examples, the UE may transition from the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b> to the DRX or Sleep state <b>602</b> (or a WUS monitoring state (State 3), as discussed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) if a Timer <b>2</b> expires. In some cases, the Timer <b>2</b> is a count-down timer re-initialized with a pre-configured value whenever the UE enters the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b>, and the Timer <b>2</b> decrements when no grant is detected. In particular, for example, one or more asymmetric values may be used depending on the previous or originating state. In an example, different originating states (e.g., the DRX or Sleep state <b>602</b>, and the Data Ready state <b>604</b>) may trigger different initialization values. In some cases, explicit and dynamic L1 signaling (e.g., via DCI) for the entrance/exit of the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b> may be supported or used. In one implementation, the UE may be configured to use a larger periodicity of PDCCH and/or aggregated slots. For example, instead of monitoring PDCCH every slot, the UE may monitor at a larger periodicity (e.g., every 2 slots or more) which may be UE-specific. In another implementation, the UE may reduce the periodicity of PDCCH by aggregating two or more slots.</div>

In some cases, during the DRX cycle <b>768</b>, when the Timer <b>1</b> expires, the UE may exit the Data Ready state <b>604</b> (State 1) and enter the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b> (State 2), until the Timer <b>2</b> expires. In some cases, upon the Timer <b>2</b> expires (e.g., after 2 slots), the UE may re-enter the DRX or Sleep state <b>602</b> (State 0), until the end of the DRX cycle <b>768</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in an aspect, state diagrams for a 4-state scheme <b>800</b> (e.g., in an LTE system) and a 4-state scheme <b>850</b> may be used by a UE (e.g., the UE <b>12</b> or UE <b>14</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in a wireless communications system (e.g., 5G NR). In some examples, the 4-state scheme <b>800</b> may be a 4-state baseline based on a 3-state design (e.g., the 3-state scheme <b>650</b>), and may include four states or configurations discussed herein. In an aspect, in addition to the DRX or Sleep state <b>602</b> (State 0), the Data Ready state <b>604</b> (State 1), and the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b> (State 2), a WUS PWU state <b>808</b> (State 4) may be configured or added. For example, the WUS PWU state <b>808</b> (State 4) may be configured in between State 0 to State 2, and may be used for transitioning from State 0 to State 2, where the target is for the UE to return to State 0 quickly if WUS is not detected for the current DRX cycle (e.g., to save UE power).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In an aspect, the WUS PWU state (State 4) may be configured to allow UE to skip the entire ON duration for an upcoming DRX cycle, if a base station or gNB scheduler already decides that the base station or gNB may not schedule to the UE. In some examples, the UE at the WUS PWU state (State 4) may monitor configured WUS resource(s) at a PWU offset prior to the start of the upcoming DRX cycle. If WUS is detected, the UE may transition from the WUS PWU state <b>808</b> (State 4) to a state (e.g., the Data Ready state <b>604</b> (State 1) or the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b> (State 2)) that monitors for a potential grant. In some cases, in addition to a wake-up indication, the WUS may carry some other information. In an example, the WUS may occupy a small BW footprint, and decoding complexity may be low. In addition, the sleep-wake transition overhead may also be low. In some cases, the WUS channel structure for the WUS PWU state <b>808</b> (State 4) may or may not be identical to the WUS used in the WUS monitoring state (State 3) as discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">In an aspect, a 4-state scheme <b>850</b> may be a 4-state variant for the 4-state scheme <b>800</b>. In an example, when WUS is detected, the UE may directly transition from the WUS PWU state <b>808</b> (State 4) to the Data Ready state <b>604</b> (State 1) instead of the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b> (State 2), being more efficient if WUS is reliable and false detection rate of WUS is small, and the UE may be able to warm up fully before entering the Data Ready state <b>604</b> (State 1). Otherwise the 4-state scheme <b>850</b> is very similar to the 4-state baseline design (e.g., 4-state scheme <b>800</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Regarding the enhancement, WUS may carry an indication for which state to transition to (e.g., State 2 or State 1). Basically, dynamic selection may be performed between the baseline (e.g., the 4-state scheme <b>800</b>) and the variant scheme (e.g., the 4-state scheme <b>850</b>). In an implementation, the 4-state scheme <b>800</b> or the 4-state scheme <b>850</b> may be used for low latency traffic, and the UE may be configured to directly switch to the Data Ready state <b>604</b> (State 1). In another example, for more latency-tolerant traffic, stepping through the PDCCH monitoring state <b>606</b> (State 2) may be used.</div>
