<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The field of the invention relates to characterizing and modeling stratified terrains in the subsurface.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Erosion and tectonic activity through geological-time may transform an initially uniform stratified terrain composed of a continuous stack of depositional surfaces, called horizons, into a faulted and folded terrain fractured by faults forming discontinuities across the originally continuous horizons. Accordingly, to model the structures at their predicted or simulated original time of deposition from data collected from the current subsurface structures (e.g., to “reverse time”), the model may simulate a reversal of such erosion and tectonic activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A particle of sediment observed today at geographical coordinates (x,y) and altitude or vertical component (z) may have been deposited at an original time of deposition or “geological-time” t(x,y,z) at paleo-geographical coordinates u(x,y,z) and v(x,y,z). Depositional coordinates (u,v,t) so defined may be different than the observed (present day's) geographic coordinates (x,y,z). The “GeoChron” model may provide systems and methods to calculate or predict the depositional (past) coordinates u(x,y,z), v(x,y,z) and t(x,y,z) of a particle of sediment in a subsurface structure from its observed (present day) coordinates (x,y,z) in the geological layers. The depositional coordinates (u,v,t) may be displayed to model a simulation of the subsurface structures as they are predicted to have appeared at their original time of deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Depending on the paleo-environment prevailing at the geological time of deposition, particles of sediment may have been deposited according to different depositional styles (such as, for example, on-lap, off-lap, or proportional) which may have impacted the geometry of the layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">For more than three decades, geologists and geophysicists in the water, mineral (e.g. mining) and energy (e.g. oil and gas) industries have modelled “attributes” to characterize the properties of sedimentary terrains in the subsurface. An attribute may be a function f(x,y,z) which, based on observed data, such as seismic data or well data, may be estimated at each location (x,y,z) or coordinate in the present-day subsurface. The functions may statistically correlate with rock types and properties of the terrains and the functions may be used to identify these properties in a current time or predict these properties at a time of original deposition. These properties may be related to two previously known families of attributes, seismic attributes and geometric attributes:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">Seismic attributes may be defined based on the shape of an observed seismic signal reflected by geological structures in the subsurface. The observed seismic signal may be recorded by a seismograph when measuring ground movement. Frequently used seismic attributes may include, for example, “instantaneous amplitude,” “instantaneous velocity.” and “instantaneous acceleration.” These attributes may be computed using first and second order derivatives of the observed seismic signal crossing the geologic layers.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">Geometrical attributes may be defined based on the shape of geological horizons or surfaces bounding geological layers and may provide information about the curvatures and distances to faults. Frequently used geometrical attributes may include “Gaussian curvature,” “mean curvature,” and “main curvature.” These attributes may be computed using first and second order derivatives of a parametric representation of the horizons bounding the geologic layers.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0009">Embodiments of the invention provide a system and method for computing and modeling sedimentary attributes, which describe stratified terrains or layers of a geological subsurface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0010">Embodiments of the invention provide a new family of attributes that may be referred to as “sedimentary attributes.” Sedimentary attributes may define the properties of the sedimentation process of particles during deposition. Sedimentary attributes may be determined or computed based on lateral variations of a “sedimentation rate.” The sedimentation rate defines the rate at which particles of sediment at their location were deposited. The sedimentation rate is proportional to the thickness of sedimentary layers. For example, the higher the sedimentation rate, the faster particles of sediment were deposited, and the thicker the layer is at that location. Sedimentary attributes may include, for example, sedimentary expansion (e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), sedimentary potential (e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), sedimentary acceleration (e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), sedimentary expansion ratio, sedimentary horizontal divergence, sedimentary horizontal norm. IPG-line curvature, N-line curvature, and normal divergence. Sedimentary attributes may be deduced or computed from lateral variations of a “sedimentation rate,” which is itself proportional to the thickness of geological layers. For example, the faster particles of sediment were deposited in geological-time, the thicker its region of the layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0011">In practice, each of the sedimentary attributes may be computed based on a lateral variation in sedimentation rate. For example, sedimentary attributes, such as, sedimentary expansion and sedimentary acceleration, may be computed based on a lateral variation (e.g. first and second derivatives) of the sedimentation rate through a geological layer. However, in the current geological time, layers become folded and/or faulted (e.g. see folded layer <b>302</b> in the left image of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and the “lateral” direction (e.g. <b>318</b> <i>a</i>, tangential to the curvature of the layer or horizons bounding the layer) likewise becomes faulted and/or folded. Therefore, the “horizontal” (x,y) direction in a rectilinear (non-curvilinear) coordinate system (e.g. Cartesian coordinate system) do not reliably conform to the curvature of the layer, but may cross in and out of the layer as it curves along folds or breaks along faults. To reliably follow the lateral direction within a faulted or folded layer, a second curvilinear coordinate system (e.g. u,v,t) may be used, having paleo-geographical axes or “iso-t” surfaces that themselves curve (e.g. see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Iso-t surfaces have a constant (“iso”) geological-time (t) and vary in paleo-geographic coordinates (u,v). Iso-t surfaces represent horizons and other layers, which curve tangentially to the folded and/or faulted layers when viewed in the original (non-curvilinear) coordinate system (e.g. curved iso-surface <b>318</b> <i>a </i>in the left image of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Accordingly, a “lateral” direction following a folded and/or faulted horizon may be modeled by iso-t surfaces (e.g. <b>318</b> <i>b</i>) of the curvilinear coordinate system (e.g. <b>310</b>). Therefore, the lateral change in sedimentation rate (V(x,y,z)) may be measured along the iso-surfaces with respect to infinitesimal changes in paleo-geographical coordinate (du and/or dv) of the curvilinear coordinate system (e.g. as dV/du and/or dV/dv).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0012">Sedimentary attributes may also be defined based on a lateral variation in layer thickness. Embodiments of the invention may generate a measure of a thickness Δh of a layer, which due to lateral variations in the sedimentation rate, may vary laterally along the layer in a present day model. Variations or changes in the thickness of the layer may be best measured with respect to paleo-geographic coordinates that vary laterally along a depositional surface (also called by geologists an “horizon”) inside the layer, e.g., with respect to (u,v) paleo-geographic coordinates. As shown for example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, paleo-geographic coordinates vary tangentially along the horizon or layer surfaces regardless of deformation or curvature in the layer. In contrast, when layers are curved or faulted, modeling the variation of layer thickness according to a (x,y) geographic coordinates may be less effective since the “lateral” or “horizontal” direction in the x-y plane may vary in depth e.g. within a horizon or even cross through several layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0013">As shown, for example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, using the uvt-transform, sedimentary attributes may be displayed in either a present-day geological time model (e.g. in xyz-space) or a depositional model (e.g. uvt-space) visualizing the subsurface layer(s) at a geological time when the structure was originally deposited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0014">A three dimensional (3D) depositional model may be represented by for example functions t(x,y,z), u(x,y,z) and v(x,y,z) such that, for any location (x,y,z) in the subsurface:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0015">t(x,y,z) represents the geological-time of original deposition of a point representing a particle of sediment observed today at location (x,y,z);</li> <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0016">u(x,y,z) and v(x,y,z) represent the paleo-geographic coordinates at the geological-time of deposition t(x,y,z) of the point representing the particle of sediment observed today or in the present-day time at location (x,y,z).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0017">Embodiment of the invention may compute the functions u(x,y,z), v(x,y,z) and t(x,y,z) that model a subsurface structure, such as one or more layers, or model attributes that are related to the structure. Note that these functions may be non-unique (e.g. there are multiple transformations from (x,y,z) coordinates to (u,v,t) coordinates), but may be considered equivalent when they represent the same equivalent geometry and deformation of the geological layers transformed to their positions as observed today.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0018">In an embodiment of the invention, a computing system or processor may be used to generate and model sedimentary attributes. The present day coordinates (x,y,z) may be an “input” of the computing system. The present day coordinates (x,y,z) may be transformed into paleo-depositional coordinates u(x,y,z), v(x,y,z) and/or t(x,y,z), and may be used to generate a sedimentary rate V(x,y,z). The sedimentary attributes SA(x,y,z) may be computed based on the lateral variation of the sedimentary rate V(x,y,z) with respect to paleo-depositional coordinates u(x,y,z), and v(x,y,z). The “output” of the computing system may include the sedimentary attributes SA(x,y,z) modelled in the present-day coordinate system (x,y,z) (e.g. as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>) and/or mapped or transformed to the depositional coordinate system, for example, by functions SA(u,v,t)=SA(u(x,y,z), v(x,y,z), t(x,y,z)).</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0030">The present description presents a preferred embodiment. The features of the invention are subject to alteration and modification and therefore the present description should not be considered limiting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0031">Geological layers may include particles of sediment which have been deposited throughout geological time at paleo-geographic locations. Sedimentary attributes may define or be used to determine parameters representing the sedimentation of particles over time. Sedimentary attributes may include, for example, sedimentary expansion (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), sedimentary potential (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), sedimentary acceleration (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), sedimentary expansion ratio sedimentary horizontal divergence, sedimentary horizontal norm, curvature of an N-line (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), curvature of an IPG-line (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), and normal divergence. Numerical method and computer systems may be used to derive these attributes from a GeoChron model describing the paleo-geographic (Geo) coordinates (u,v) and geological-time (Chron) coordinate (t) of deposition of the particles of sediment observed today in the subsurface. The sedimentary attributes may be determined from seismic data and well data and may be correlated with different characteristics or physical properties (e.g., permeability, porosity, rock type) of the subsurface on a local level, accounting for changes in the properties across the subsurface. From a practical perspective, correlations between sedimentary attributes (e.g. Ricci curvature, sedimentary acceleration) and depositional style (e.g., sedimentation mode or style) may be used to better estimate the variations of physical properties in the subsurface (e.g., variations between horizons, faults, and layers). Geological facies of rock formations may strongly depend on sedimentary attributes including the energy of sedimentary fluxes and, in turn, physical properties of layers may strongly depend on these facies. As a consequence, sedimentary attributes may be linked to the physical properties of the terrains and may be used to guide the modeling of physical properties in the subsurface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0032">For the sake of clarity and for the purpose of simplifying the presentation of embodiments of the invention, the following preliminary definitions are given, although other definitions may be used:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">Geological-Time</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0033">A particle of sediment in a geological terrain may be observed at a location in the subsurface. The location of the particle may be mathematically represented or modeled, e.g., by a vector, (x,y,z), in a three-dimensional (3D) space, such as the Cartesian coordinate system (of course, when modeling such particles, the position of many particles may be modeled together for example using a cell). When modeled, a data structure such as a node or cell may represent a subset of particles. The time when the particle of sediment was originally deposited may be referred to as the “geological-time” and may be represented or modeled, e.g., as a geological-time function of the current location of the particle, t(x,y,z). When used herein, a “current,” “observed” or modem day location for a particle (or data structure representing one or more particles) or subsurface feature may mean the location of the item in the present day, relative to geological time. The actual geological-time of the deposition of particles may be difficult to determine and may be replaced, e.g., by any arbitrary monotonic increasing function of the actual geological-time. The monotonic function may be referred to as the “pseudo-geological-time”. Geological-time and pseudo-geological-time are referred to interchangeably herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0034">The geological-time function t(x,y,z) may be monotonic. e.g., the gradient of the geological-time never reduces to the null vector and the geological-time function has no local maximum or minimum values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">Level Set Surface</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0035">Consider a function f(x,y,z) defined in a 3D space in such a way that its gradient never reduces to the null vector. A level set surface, S(f<sub>0</sub>), may be the set of points where the function f(x,y,z) is equal to a given numerical value, f<sub>0</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0036">As an example, if the geological-time t(x,y,z) represents a pseudo-geological-time of deposition, then the level set surface H(t<sub>0</sub>) of t(x,y,z) may be a geological horizon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0037">Various mechanisms are currently used for modeling subsurface geological terrains:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">GeoChron Model, G-space and <o>G</o>-space</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0038">When a layer of particles was deposited during a geological-time period in the past, the layer typically had continuous geometry during that time period. However, after the passage of time, the layers may become eroded and disrupted by faults, for example, resulting from tectonic motion or other sub-surface movements, which result in uneven and discontinuous layers in the present day subsurface. As compared to the continuous layers geometry of the past, the discontinuous layers of the present are difficult to model. Accordingly, the “GeoChron” model has recently been developed to operate between two 3D spaces (e.g. G space <b>104</b> and <o>G</o> space <b>106</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). These two 3D spaces or models may be, for example:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0039">A 3D space G, called the “Geological Space” or G-space, representing a model of the current subsurface features observed in modern times or today (e.g., current modeled locations of particles of sediment in the terrain). The modeled location of each particle (or of a subset of particles, or of cells estimating the location of numerous particles) may be represented by the coordinates (x,y,z), where (x,y) may describe the today geographical coordinates of the particle (e.g., latitude and longitude) and (z) may describe the today altitude or distance below or above a given reference surface level (e.g., the sea level); and</li> <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0040">A 3D space <o>G</o>, called the “depositional-space” or “parametric-space” or more simply <o>G</o>-space, representing modeled or predicted locations of particles of sediment at the time when the particles were originally deposited in the layer. The modeled location of each particle may be represented by the coordinates (u,v,t) where (t) may be the geological-time of deposition of the particle and (u,v) may be the paleo-geographical coordinates of the particle at geological-time (t).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0041">The GeoChron model defines a transformation between the two 3D spaces G and G. The transformation may be referred to as a “uvt-transformation,” for example, transforming the (x,y,z) coordinated of the G space to the (u,v,t) coordinated of the <o>G</o> space. The GeoChron model applies a forward uvt-transformation to transform the current model (a model of the subsurface features current in time) in G-space to the original deposition model in <o>G</o>-space and applies an inverse or reverse uvt-transformation to transform the original deposition model in <o>G</o>-space to the current model in G-space. Accordingly, the GeoChron model may execute complex computations on the original deposition model in <o>G</o>-space where geological properties are typically uniform and simple to manipulate relative to the discontinuous current model in G-space. Once the original deposition model in <o>G</o>-space is sufficiently accurate, the GeoChron model may use the “reverse uvt-transformation” to transform the model, and its geological properties, back to the current time domain in G-space to generate the present day non-uniform geological properties of the faulted and eroded present day model.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0042">Embodiments of the invention may compute the functions u(x,y,z), v(x,y,z) and t(x,y,z) at each location (x,y,z) observed (e.g. measured or interpolated) today in the present-day subsurface model. From a practical perspective, the functions u(x,y,z), v(x,y,z) and t(x,y,z) may be deduced from seismic data (e.g., a seismic cube) and/or well data (e.g., well markers). The functions u(x,y,z) and v(x,y,z) are curvilinear (e.g. as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), and may be used, for example, to characterize curvilinear “lateral” surfaces (iso-t surface shown in in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to determine variations in a layer's thickness or sedimentation rate along the curvilinear iso-t surface.</div>

In other words, similarly to faults, the geological-time function t(x,y,z) of deposition of the sediments is discontinuous across each unconformity. When discussed herein, unconformities are treated as faults: as a consequence, in this patent application, faults may include both real faults and unconformities. Alternately, unconformities may be surfaces bounding a sequence of sedimentary layers and one specific geological-time function t(x,y,z) may be assigned to each such sequence.

Paleo-geographic coordinates (u,v) may be non-unique and may be rotated and translated to generate equivalent paleo-depositional coordinate systems in <o>G</o>-space, illustrating that u-lines and v-lines may depend on the choice of paleo-geographic coordinates. In contrast, IPG-lines may have an intrinsic geological definition which may not depend on the choice of paleo-geographic coordinates (an IPG-line may be a subset of particles of sediment deposited at the same paleo-location, whatever the system of paleo-geographic coordinates). On the one hand, it may be common to use geometric properties of horizons (e.g., curvatures) as attributes. By definition, a horizon may be a set of particles of sediments which were deposited at the same geological time regardless of the paleo-geographic coordinates or system used. In the oil and gas industry, it may be common practice to compute the curvatures of an horizon and to use them as attributes. On the other hand, an IPG-line is a set of particles of sediment which were deposited at the same paleo-location whatever the system of paleo-geographic coordinates.

Layer <b>302</b> may have a thickness Δh bounded by a bottom horizon H<sub>t </sub> <b>306</b> and a top horizon H<sub>t+Δt </sub> <b>308</b>, deposited at geological-times t and t+Δt, respectively. The thickness Δh of layer <b>302</b> may be non-constant, varying laterally along layer <b>302</b>. As shown, layer <b>304</b> in <o>G</o>-space has a constant (Δt) along each horizon, e.g. since the particles of each horizon are deposited at substantially the same geological time. In G-space, horizontal motion changes only in the (x,y) <b>314</b> plane, but not in the (z) axis <b>316</b>. However, lateral motion along layer <b>302</b> changes not only in the (x,y) <b>314</b> plane but also along the (z) axis <b>316</b>. Therefore, to determine lateral variations in sedimentation rate (e.g. to generate sedimentary attributes), embodiments of the invention may determine lateral variation in sedimentation rate (or thickness Δh) based on change (e.g. derivatives) of the sedimentation rate with respect to the paleo-geographic coordinates (u,v). The paleo-geographic coordinates vary along a surface <b>318</b> that follows the curvature of horizons bounding layer <b>302</b>. Since layer <b>302</b> is folded, the shape of horizons <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> as well as intermediate surface <b>318</b> <i>a </i>in G-space varies along all dimensions (x,y,z) of the present-day G-space. Since the curvilinear coordinates (u,v) in the G-space follow the curvature of a horizon <b>318</b> <i>a </i>in the layer, it may be easier to determine lateral change or variation in the direction of the curvilinear (u,v) coordinates in <o>G</o>-space, as shown by surface <b>318</b> <i>b</i>. As with horizons <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>, surface <b>318</b> <i>b </i>may be an iso-t surface in which paleo-geographic coordinates (u,v) vary, but the geological-time of deposition (t) remains constant. Therefore, surface <b>318</b> <i>b </i>may follow the curvature of horizons <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>. Thus, the lateral change in sedimentation rate may be measured as a rate of lateral change within a layer, at a constant geological time, e.g., without crossing through different layers deposited at different geological times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0101">In a demonstrative example, a layer with constant thickness may be modeled to behave similarly to a book with a fixed number of pages bounded by a first page (e.g. representing horizon H<sub>t</sub>, <b>306</b>) and a last page (e.g. representing horizon H<sub>t+Δt </sub> <b>308</b>). Whether the layer is folded or unfolded, its thickness may be the length of a segment orthogonal to H<sub>t </sub> <b>306</b> and H<sub>t+Δt </sub> <b>308</b> and may be equal to the sum of the thicknesses of the pages or layers. In other words, if there is substantially no compaction and the layers can slide on each other without generating gaps (e.g., like the pages of a book bending and sliding against each other without creating gaps) according to a “flexural slip” tectonic style of deformation, the thickness of the layers, Δh, may be invariant throughout geological-time in a curvilinear coordinate system (u,v,t). However, contrary to the pages of a book, the thickness of real geological layers may vary laterally with respect to (u,v,t). For example, layer <b>302</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> has a non-constant thickness.</div>

The sedimentation rate may be a scalar function V(x,y,z) at any location (x,y,z) in the geological space as observed today. The sedimentation rate may be equal or proportional to the speed or rate at which sediment is deposited on the Earth's surface throughout geological time. Accordingly, the sedimentation rate is proportional to the layer's thickness, Δh. The sedimentation rate may be defined for example as:

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0104">Embodiments of the invention may account for compaction of layers, which may be a process by which the porosity of a layer of sediment is decreased, or the compression or density of the sediment is increased, for example, as a result of its particles being squeezed together by the weight of overlying layers of sediment or by mechanical means. Layers of sediment that overlie or cover another layer may be layers deposited at a time later than the layers below (e.g., having a smaller z-value in (x,y,z)). A column of sediment h(x,y,z) orthogonal to the horizons observed today at location (x,y,z) in the G-space between two horizons H<sub>t </sub>and H<sub>t+Δt </sub>may have a compacted vertical thickness Δh<sub>C</sub>(x,y,z) at geological-time t of deposition such that:

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0107">The sedimentation rate V(x,y,z) may be used to determine or calculate sedimentary attributes that characterize the shape of the layers based on lateral variations of the sedimentation rate (e.g., as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the lateral curvilinear directions u and v being tangent to the horizons). For example, throughout geological time, horizons may be impacted and shifted by tectonic forces and, as observed today, are now folded and faulted. From a geo-mechanical perspective, at any location or point (x,y,z) in the current geological G-space, these tectonic transformations may be characterized by strain or relative displacement of the particle (x,y,z). The strain at location (x,y,z) may be defined e.g. by a strain tensor E(x,y,z). The deformations may be modeled by a strain tensor E(x,y,z) and the directions of the potential fractures at that location (x,y,z) may be defined by the Eigen vectors of the strain tensor. The strain tensor may characterize the total deformations of the stack of horizons subjected to tectonic forces. A potential direction of fracture at location (x,y,z), characterized by strain tensor E(x,y,z) may indicate that if a fracture occurs at location (x,y,z), the direction of this fracture should be a function of the eigen vectors of E(x,y,z). In terms of the GeoChron model, at any location (x,y,z) in the G-space, the strain tensor E(x,y,z) may be a function of the paleo-geographic coordinates u(x,y,z) and v(x,y,z) in <o>G</o>-space space. Therefore, the directions of potential fractures E(x,y,z) may be indirectly controlled by the functions u(x,y,z) and v(x,y,z).

Contrary to the mechanical strain tensor, the Ricci tensor may quantify how far the parallelism of horizons is impacted by the variations or changes of sedimentary fluxes and may not depend on tectonic forces.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0131">Reference is made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, which schematically illustrates a vertical cross section of a layer <b>302</b> in the present-day geological space used to determine a sedimentation rate based on the geometry of N-lines <b>320</b> <i>a </i>and <i>b </i>(or equivalently the geometry of IPG-lines), according to embodiments of the invention. In the following description. N-lines are discussed, although the same discussion relates to IPG-lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0132">Sedimentary attributes may be determined based on the curvature of N-lines <b>320</b> <i>a </i>and <i>b</i>, which may be correspond to the lateral variations of sedimentation rate V(x,y,z) along a layer. For example, if the sedimentation rate V(x,y,z) is constant laterally along layer <b>302</b> in a current geological time (G-space), sediment is deposited at the same rate along the layer and the layer will have the same thickness throughout. When layer <b>302</b> is folded or deformed over time, layer <b>302</b> becomes curved, but its thickness remains the same. Accordingly, the curvature of top horizon <b>306</b> approximately matches the curvature of the bottom horizon <b>308</b>, only shifted vertically upwards (i.e. the top and bottom horizons are parallel). Because the top and bottom horizons <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> are approximately parallel. e.g. as shown in the right-side segment of layer <b>302</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, normal vectors <b>312</b> <i>a </i>and <b>312</b> <i>b </i>may be oriented substantially or approximately identically in the same direction. Thus, an N-line <b>320</b> <i>a </i>(or IPG-line) connecting those normal vectors <b>312</b> <i>a </i>and <b>312</b> <i>b </i>(or IPG-vectors) may be defined by a straight N-line <b>320</b> <i>a</i>. In one example (not shown), the top and bottom horizons bounding the layer in a current geological time may be parallel flat planes (e.g., parallel to the (x,y) plane). In this example N-lines may be straight lines parallel to the z-axis <b>316</b>. In another example (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), the top and bottom horizons <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> of layer <b>302</b> may be parallel, but curved instead of flat. In this example, N-line <b>320</b> <i>a </i>of the top and bottom horizons may be a straight line connecting normal vectors <b>312</b> <i>a </i>and <b>312</b> <i>b </i>of the top and bottom horizons. Unlike the first instance, N-line <b>320</b> <i>a </i>may not be parallel with the z-axis, but may nevertheless be a straight line. In contrast, when the sedimentary rates varies throughout layer <b>302</b> (e.g. as shown in the left-side by the bulging segment of the layer in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), the curvature of top and bottom horizons <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> are not parallel, and their corresponding normal vectors <b>312</b> <i>c </i>and <b>312</b> <i>d </i>are oriented in different directions. Accordingly, an N-line <b>320</b> <i>b </i>connecting those N-vectors will be curved. Thus, a curved N-line <b>320</b> <i>b </i>may indicate that horizons <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> bounding layer <b>302</b> are not parallel and that the thickness (and thus sedimentation rate) of layer <b>302</b> varies laterally along the layer (e.g. along surface <b>318</b> <i>a</i>). The curvature of N-line <b>320</b> <i>b </i>may therefore indicate the presence of lateral variations in the sedimentation rate along layer <b>302</b> (whereas a straight N-line having zero-curvature <b>320</b> <i>a </i>may indicate a constant sedimentation rate along layer <b>302</b>). Since the presence of lateral variations of sedimentation rate V(x,y,z) may be described by the curvatures of N-lines <b>320</b> <i>a </i>and <i>b </i>(or similarly IPG-lines or other parameters computed from the curvature of N-lines and IPG-lines), these curvatures may be sedimentary attributes. Sedimentary attributes described by N-line or IPG-line curvatures may be defined, for example, as follows:

As a consequence, using the uvt-transform described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, any sedimentary attribute SA(x,y,z) function of (x,y,z) may be also transformed or parameterized as a sedimentary attribute SA(u,v,t)=SA(u(x,y,z), v(x,y,z), t(x,y,z)) function of (u,v,t); conversely the reverse uvt-transformation or parameterization may apply. For example, the sedimentation rate defined by equation (6) or (8) may be uvt-transformed between xyz-space and uvt-space:
