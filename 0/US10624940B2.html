<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/723,980, filed May 28, 2015, which is a continuation-in-part (CIP) of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/694,303, filed on Apr. 23, 2015, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/255,296, filed on Apr. 17, 2014; the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The medicinal and psychoactive properties of the <i>Cannabis </i>plant have been known for centuries. At present, <i>Cannabis </i>is not legally available in many States. However, there is growing pressure on politicians to legalize its use, especially for medicinal purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Evidence suggests that <i>Cannabis </i>is a safe, versatile and potentially inexpensive drug. It has been reported as being beneficial to patients suffering from a wide range of symptoms experienced in connection with various, often very serious, medical conditions. For example, <i>Cannabis </i>has been used to alleviate symptoms associated with cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spacicity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine and many other illnesses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004"> <i>Cannabis </i>is recognized as having anti-emetic properties and has been successfully used to treat nausea and vomiting in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Studies also report use of <i>Cannabis </i>in treating the weight loss syndrome of AIDS and in reducing intraocular pressure for the treatment of glaucoma. <i>Cannabis </i>is also reported to have muscle relaxing effects and anti-convulsant effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, it is also well documented that these medicinal effects of <i>Cannabis </i>come at the cost of less desirable effects. It is alleged that the administration of <i>Cannabis </i>causes changes in mood, perception and motivation. The common euphoric effects have led to the use of <i>Cannabis </i>as a recreational, “soft” drug and its criminalization. The psychoactive effects are said to vary with dose, with the typical <i>Cannabis </i>smoker experiencing a “high” which lasts about 2 hours, during which there is impairment of cognitive functions, perception, reaction time, learning and memory. These side effects clearly have implications, such as for the operation of machinery, and in particular for driving. These effects also make <i>Cannabis </i>less attractive for widespread, mainstream use, as it can reduce a patient's ability to perform relatively simple tasks during treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The euphoric effects of <i>Cannabis </i>may also constitute an undesirable side effect for patients using the drug for medicinal purposes, especially for “naive” <i>Cannabis </i>users. Furthermore, there have been reports of unpleasant reactions to <i>Cannabis</i>, such as anxiety, panic or hallucinations. It is believed that these undesirable effects are most commonly associated with higher doses of <i>Cannabis. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Despite these effects, years of research have failed to show that <i>Cannabis </i>is dangerous. In fact, the results appear to have proved the opposite. <i>Cannabis </i>has been shown to be safer, with fewer serious side effects than most prescription drugs currently used as anti-emetics, muscle relaxants, hypnotics and analgesics, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The physiological and pharmacological effects of <i>Cannabis </i>depend upon a number of factors, including the dosage level and the route of administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">There are currently two main methods of <i>Cannabis </i>delivery. Lung delivery is most commonly achieved by smoking <i>Cannabis</i>. Unfortunately, there are concerns about the effect of this mode of administration on the lungs. <i>Cannabis </i>smoke carries even more tars and other particulate matter than tobacco, and so may be a cause of lung cancer. Furthermore, many patients find the act of smoking unappealing, as well as generally unhealthy. It is known that some of the chemicals produced by smoking <i>Cannabis </i>are aggressive and smoking has been shown to cause the gradual dissolving of teeth. Use of vaporizers for inhalation administration of <i>Cannabis </i>does not avoid the production of thermal byproducts, and also can produce tracheal and lung irritation. For these reasons, smoking is not an approved medical means of administration for any drug.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Attempts have been made to overcome some of the problems associated with smoking both <i>Cannabis </i>and tobacco by providing various smokeless inhalable aerosol formulations for lung delivery. A self-propelled inhalable aerosol of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol was developed as long ago as 1975 as a bronchodilator. Inhalable aerosol formulations were made including either only liquid components and or including a solid particulate component carrying the active agent, such as the <i>Cannabis</i>. The various formulations were found to be of varying effectiveness in delivering the active agent to the alveoli of the lungs in the same manner as smoke.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">However, both methods of lung delivery discussed above have been found to cause a pronounced and involuntary cough, possibly from irritation of the trachea and lungs. This unpleasant side effect is not overcome by the smoke-free method of lung delivery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">An oral dosage form of <i>Cannabis </i>is available in the United States as a Schedule II drug. The capsules contain a synthetic version of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the main active substance in <i>Cannabis</i>, and they have had limited success for a number of reasons. Firstly, in light of its anti-emetic properties, the capsules are commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting. Clearly, an oral administration is not ideal as the patient may well have difficulty keeping the capsule down long enough for it to take effect. It has also been found that orally administered THC is erratically and slowly absorbed into the bloodstream, making the dose and duration of action difficult to control. Furthermore, the oral dose is less effective than smoked <i>Cannabis </i>and therefore larger doses are required in order to achieve a desired therapeutic effect.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides a process for obtaining a first concentrate of <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or combination thereof, enriched with tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs) and a second concentrate of <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or combination thereof, enriched with cannabidiols (CBDs). The process includes (a) contacting plant material including <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or a combination thereof, with a supercritical fluid solvent system, at a pressure of about 750-4,000 psi, and at a temperature of about 35-70° C., to provide an extract of <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or combination thereof; and (b) removing the supercritical fluid solvent system from the extract. The (a) contacting of the plant material including <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or a combination thereof, with the supercritical fluid solvent system and the (b) removing the supercritical fluid solvent system, is carried out two or more times, such that the process is a fractional supercritical fluid extraction. A first fractional supercritical fluid extraction is carried out such that (a) contacting of the plant material including <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or a combination thereof, with the supercritical fluid solvent system is carried out at a pressure of about 750-4,000 psi and a temperature of about 35° C. to about 70° C. for a period of time of about 1-12 hours, to provide a first concentrate enriched with tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs). A second fractional supercritical fluid extraction is carried out such that (a) contacting of the plant material including <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or a combination thereof, with the supercritical fluid solvent system is carried out at a pressure of about 750-4,000 psi and a temperature of about 35° C. to about 70° C., for a period of time of about 1-12 hours, to provide a second concentrate enriched with cannabidiols (CBDs). In specific embodiments, the second fractional supercritical fluid extraction, relative to the first fractional supercritical fluid extraction, is carried out at a higher temperature, at a higher pressure, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention also provides another process for obtaining a first concentrate of <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or combination thereof, enriched with tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs) and a second concentrate of <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or combination thereof; enriched with cannabidiols (CBDs). The process includes (a) contacting plant material including <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or a combination thereof, with a supercritical fluid solvent system, at a pressure of about 750-4,000 psi, and at a temperature of about 35-65° C., to provide an extract of <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or combination thereof; and (b) removing the supercritical fluid solvent system from the extract. The (a) contacting of the plant material including <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or a combination thereof, with the supercritical fluid solvent system and the (b) removing the supercritical fluid solvent system, is carried out two times, such that the process is a fractional supercritical fluid extraction. The first fractional supercritical fluid extraction is carried out such that (a) contacting of the plant material including <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or a combination thereof, with the supercritical fluid solvent system is carried out at a pressure of about 750-1,250 psi and a temperature of about 35-65° C. for a period of time of about 1-12 hours, to provide a first concentrate enriched with tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs). A second fractional supercritical fluid extraction is carried out such that (a) contacting of the plant material including <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or a combination thereof, with the supercritical fluid solvent system is carried out at a pressure of about 1,750-2,250 psi and a temperature of about 35-65° C., for a period of time of about 1-12 hours, to provide a second concentrate enriched with cannabidiols (CBDs). In specific embodiments, the second fractional supercritical fluid extraction, relative to the first fractional supercritical fluid extraction, is carried out at a higher temperature, at a higher pressure, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical dosage form, which can be an oral thin film (OTF) suitable for oral delivery, or an adhesive topical patch suitable for transdermal delivery. The pharmaceutical dosage form includes a <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate including at least one of cannabinol (CBN); cannabinolic acid (CBNA); Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC); Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (Δ(9)-THCA); Δ(9)-cannabidiol (Δ(9)-CBD); Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabidiolic acid (Δ(9)-CBDA); Δ(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(8)-THC); Δ(8)-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (Δ(8)-THCA); Δ(8)-tetrahydrocannabidiol (Δ(8)-CBD); Δ(8)-tetrahydrocannabidiolic acid (Δ(8)-CBDA); Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ(9)-THV); cannabigerol (CBG); cannabigerolic acid (CBGA); cannabichromene (CBC); cannabichromenic acid (CBCA); cannabicyclol (CBL); cannabicyclolic acid (CBLA); β-caryophyllene epoxide; mentha-1,8(9)-dien-5-ol; pulegone; limonene; limonene oxide; α-terpinene; terpinen-4-ol; carvacrol; carvone; 1,8-cineole; p-cymene; fenchone; pulegone-1,2 epoxide; β-myrcene; cannaflavin A; and cannaflavin B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention provides a method of treating a mammal afflicted with a disease or disorder. The method includes administering to a mammal in need of such treatment, the pharmaceutical dosage form described herein, in an amount and for a period of time, effective to treat the disease or disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In various embodiments of the present invention, the methods of manufacturing described herein employ supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) to provide an extract of <i>Cannabis</i>. Upon removal of the solvent from the extract (which typically occurs on its own with solvents such as carbon dioxide), a concentrate (or an essential oil) of <i>Cannabis </i>is obtained. When the SFE is a fractional supercritical fluid extraction (FSFE), the desired extract of <i>Cannabis </i>can include, e.g., cannabinoids, terpenoids, and/or flavonoids. In various embodiments, the desired extract of <i>Cannabis </i>(relative to the starting plant material) will be enriched with the desired product (e.g. cannabinoids, terpenoids, and/or flavonoids). In further embodiments, the desired extract of <i>Cannabis </i>(relative to the undesired extract of <i>Cannabis</i>) will be enriched with the desired product (e.g. cannabinoids, terpenoids, and/or flavonoids). In yet further embodiments, the undesired extract of <i>Cannabis </i>(relative to the desired extract of <i>Cannabis</i>) will be enriched with the undesired product (e.g. terpenes, alkaloids, hemp oil, and/or cannabinoid acids). As such, the FSFE can be employed to selectively obtain one or more extracts from the <i>Cannabis </i>plant material that is enriched with one or more desired substances, while selectively excluding (or minimizing the amount/concentration that it is present) one or more undesired substances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In other embodiments, purified fractions enriched in certain of the <i>Cannabis </i>components listed herein relative to other of the <i>Cannabis </i>components, can be prepared by a method of the invention. For instance, fractions enriched in certain cannabinoids relative to other cannabinoids, compared to proportions as occurring in the <i>Cannabis </i>plant material that is extracted, can be obtained by practice of a method of the invention. In this way, enriched purified fractions of <i>Cannabis </i>extract can be obtained, which can offer therapeutic benefits to a patient receiving treatment thereby.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">While the concentrate (or essential oil) of <i>Cannabis </i>can conveniently be obtained from the desired extract of <i>Cannabis </i>upon removal of the solvent, the concentrate, or a SFE-purified fraction thereof, can subsequently be further purified by standard purification techniques. Alternatively, the concentrate, or a SFE-purified fraction thereof, or a further purified fraction thereof, can be used directly in a pharmaceutical dosage form (e.g., transdermal patch or oral thin film) without any further purification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In various embodiments of the present invention, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is employed as the sole solvent in a fractional supercritical fluid extraction (FSFE). In further specific embodiments, the fractional supercritical fluid extraction (FSFE) includes two (2) supercritical fluid extractions (SFEs), each employing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) as the sole solvent. The fractional supercritical fluid extraction (FSFE) provides a first concentrate of <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or combination thereof (i.e., concentrate obtained from the first fractional supercritical fluid extraction (FSFE)) and a second concentrate of <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, or combination thereof (i.e., concentrate obtained from the second fractional supercritical fluid extraction (FSFE)).</div>

This is accomplished, e.g., by carrying out the requisite FSFEs at a temperature below about 70° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Transdermal patches typically include one or more adhesives positioned on the surface of the backing that contacts the user when used. The <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate, or a SFE-purified fraction thereof, or a further purified fraction thereof, can conveniently be used directly in the manufacture of a transdermal patch, e.g., by mixing the concentrate with the one or more adhesives. This will avoid the necessity to dissolve any active pharmaceutical ingredient in the adhesive layer of the transdermal patch. This may also assist in avoiding issues that may otherwise exist with a high load of desired compounds present in <i>Cannabis </i>(e.g. cannabinoids, terpenoids, and/or flavonoids) in the transdermal patch. The <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate can be used directly from the <i>Cannabis </i>extract (e.g., upon removal of the supercritical fluid solvent), or alternatively can first be purified, e.g., by SFE fractionation, or by standard purification techniques, or by a combination thereof, and then employed in the manufacture of the topical patch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Likewise, the manufacture of an oral thin film (OTF) typically includes the casting and drying of a viscous liquid (or slurry). The <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate, or a SFE-purified fraction thereof, or a further purified fraction thereof, can be used directly in the manufacture of an OTF, e.g., by mixing the concentrate with the viscous liquid. This will avoid the necessity to dissolve any active pharmaceutical ingredient in the viscous liquid prior to drying. As such, the concentrate can conveniently be used directly in the manufacture of an OTF. This may also assist in avoiding issues that may otherwise exist with a high load of desired compounds present in <i>Cannabis </i>(e.g. cannabinoids, terpenoids, and/or flavonoids) into an OTF. The <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate can be used directly from the <i>Cannabis </i>extract (e.g., upon removal of the supercritical fluid solvent), or alternatively can first be purified, e.g., by SFE fractionation, or by standard purification techniques such as chromatography, or by a combination thereof, and then employed in the manufacture of the OTF. Further subsequent purification methods may be desirable in various embodiments, since SFE typically does not completely remove all undesirable substances, nor does it provide completely pure product. In contrast, SFE will typically provide a product that is enriched with one or more substances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In specific embodiments, advantages of a transdermal drug delivery route over other types of medication delivery such as oral, topical, intravenous, intramuscular, etc. is that the patch provides a controlled release of the medication into the patient, usually through either a porous membrane covering a reservoir of medication or through body heat melting thin layers of medication embedded in the adhesive. The fact that the transdermal patch can provide a controlled release of medication for up to seven days gives it a major advantage over other types of drug delivery, such as oral or other types of topical administration (for example, gels or creams).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The delivery of a drug via a transdermal route of application can offer the best of oral and intravenous administration. Avoidance of the first-pass effect leads to better bioavailability and may result in fewer side effects. Consistent and controlled drug delivery avoids periods of under- and overdosing. Transdermal patches deliver drugs over a longer period of time, thus allowing for reduced dosing frequency. A transdermal patch is administered by the patients themselves and administration is stopped by removal of the patch. Contrary to intravenous drips or infusion pumps, patient activity is not restricted. These numerous benefits lead to significantly improved patient compliance and as a consequence transdermal patches can offer a critical edge to new and established drugs in competitive markets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Both transdermal patches as well as oral thin films (OTFs) serve as an alternative dosage form for patients who experience dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing). Additional reasons to use transdermal patches and/or OTFs include the convenience of a dosage form that can be taken without water as well as the inability of the patient to eat or drink (e.g., nausea and/or vomiting). Additional reasons to use transdermal patches and/or OTFs with any substance derived from a plant material that is typically inhaled, includes the avoidance of smoke and carcinogenic constituents in the smoke, both with the primary user as well as individuals in close proximity (e.g., second-hand smoke).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In specific embodiments, advantages of OTFs include the potential to improve the onset of action, lower the dosing, and enhance the efficacy and safety profile of the medicament. All tablet dosage forms, softgels and liquid formulations primarily enter the blood stream via the gastrointestinal tract, which subjects the drug to degradation from stomach acid, bile, digestive enzymes and other first-pass effects. As a result, such formulations often require higher doses and generally have a delayed onset of action. Conversely, buccal and sublingual OTF drug delivery can avoid these issues and yield quicker onsets of action at lower doses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In specific embodiments, advantages of OTFs include the thin film is typically more stable, durable and quicker dissolving than many other conventional dosage forms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In specific embodiments, advantages of OTFs include the thin film enables improved dosing accuracy relative to liquid formulations since every strip is manufactured to contain a precise amount of the drug.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In specific embodiments, advantages of OTFs include the thin film not only ensures more accurate administration of drugs but also can improve compliance due to the intuitive nature of the dosage form and its inherent ease of administration. These properties are especially beneficial for pediatric, geriatric and neurodegenerative disease patients where proper and complete dosing can be difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In specific embodiments, advantages of OTFs include the thin film's ability to dissolve rapidly without the need for water provides an alternative to patients with swallowing disorders and to patients suffering from nausea, such as those patients receiving chemotherapy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In specific embodiments, advantages of OTFs include the thin film drug delivery has the potential to allow the development of sensitive drug targets that may otherwise not be possible in tablet or liquid formulations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In specific embodiments, advantages of OTFs include the ability of a sublingual film to deliver a convenient, quick-dissolving therapeutic dose contained within an abuse-deterrent film matrix that cannot be crushed or injected by patients, and rapidly absorbs under the tongue to ensure compliance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In specific embodiments, advantages of OTFs include the ability of the thin film to facilitate absorption (e.g., 3 to 10 times) greater than an oral tablet. This includes, e.g., sublingual administration under the tongue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In specific embodiments, advantages of employing a <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate into an OTF or topical adhesive patch include the ease and convenience in using a non-solid (e.g., liquid, tar, oil, syrup, etc.) <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate, which may otherwise be problematic in formulating, e.g., capsules, pills and tablets. In further embodiments, additional advantages include the ease and convenience in using a <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate without the need for subsequent purification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Additional advantages include the ability to use the <i>Cannabis </i>extract (which may include a significant and/or appreciable amount of organic solvent), without subsequent removal of the solvent, prior to use in manufacturing the OTF or topical adhesive patch. In such embodiments, the presence of the solvent will not pose any significant issues or concerns in producing the OTF or topical adhesive patch, and in some situations may aid in maintaining the solubility of the desired compounds in the <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate, which is used directly in the OTF or topical adhesive patch.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">As used herein, “<i>Cannabis</i>” refers to a genus of flowering plants that includes a single species, <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, which is sometimes divided into two additional species, <i>Cannabis indica </i>and <i>Cannabis ruderalis</i>. These three taxa are indigenous to Central Asia, and. South Asia. <i>Cannabis </i>has long been used for fiber (hemp), for seed and seed oils, for medicinal purposes, and as a recreational drug. Various extracts including hashish and hash oil are also produced from the plant. Suitable strains of <i>Cannabis </i>include, e.g., <i>Indica</i>-dominant (e.g., Blueberry, BC Bud, Holland's Hope, Kush, Northern Lights, Purple, and White Widow), Pure <i>sativa </i>(e.g., Acapulco Gold and Malawi Gold (Chamba)), and <i>Sativa</i>-dominant (e.g., Charlotte's Web, Diesel, Haze, Jack Herer, Shaman, Skunk, Sour, and Te Puke Thunder). The <i>Cannabis </i>can include any physical part of the plant material, including, e.g., the leaf, bud, flower, trichome, seed, or combination thereof. Likewise, the <i>Cannabis </i>can include any substance physically derived from <i>Cannabis </i>plant material, such as, e.g., kief and hashish.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">As used herein, “kid” refers to the resin glands (or trichomes) of <i>Cannabis </i>which may accumulate in containers or be sifted from loose dry <i>Cannabis </i>flower with a mesh screen or sieve. Kief typically contains a much higher concentration of psychoactive cannabinoids, such as THC, than that of the <i>Cannabis </i>flowers from which it is derived. Traditionally, kief has been pressed into cakes of hashish for convenience in storage, but can be vaporized or smoked in either form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">As used herein, “hashish” refers to a <i>Cannabis </i>product composed of compressed or purified preparations of stalked resin glands, called trichomes. It contains the same active ingredients—such as THC and other cannabinoids—but in higher concentrations than unsifted buds or leaves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">As used herein, “leaf” refers to an organ of a vascular plant, as defined in botanical terms, and in particular, in plant morphology. In reference to <i>Cannabis</i>, the first pair of leaves usually have a single leaflet, the number gradually increasing up to a maximum of about thirteen leaflets per leaf (usually seven or nine), depending on variety and growing conditions. At the top of a flowering plant, this number again diminishes to a single leaflet per leaf. The lower leaf pairs usually occur in an opposite leaf arrangement and the upper leaf pairs in an alternate arrangement on the main stem of a mature plant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein, “bud” refers to a flower-bearing stem or branch of the <i>Cannabis </i>plant, especially a stem or branch bearing a mass of female flowers with associated leaves. The stem or branch bearing the female flowers can be fresh, or can be dried. The pistils of the female <i>Cannabis </i>flower are surrounded by a mass of trichome-rich petals and leaves, and can contain higher concentrations of cannabinoids than do the plant leaves or stems. A bud, e.g., a mass of female flowers and associated leaves, usually covered with trichomes, can be further processed mechanically, i.e., “trimming” or “cleaning” the stern bearing the female flowers by removal of larger leaves and stem material. Buds, and cleaned buds, can be used as a <i>Cannabis </i>plant material in practice of a method of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">As used herein, “trichome” refers to a fine outgrowth or appendage on plants and certain protists. They are of diverse structure and function. Examples are hairs, glandular hairs, scales, and papillae. In reference to <i>Cannabis</i>, the trichome is a glandular trichome that occurs most abundantly on the floral calyxes and bracts of female plants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">As used herein, “seed” refers to an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering called the seed coat, usually with some stored food. It is a characteristic of spermatophytes (gymnosperm and angiosperm plants) and the product of the ripened ovule which occurs after fertilization and some growth within the mother plant. The formation of the seed completes the process of reproduction in seed plants (started with the development of flowers and pollination), with the embryo developed from the zygote and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">As used herein, “<i>Cannabis sativa </i>L.” or “<i>Cannabis sativa</i>” refers to an annual herbaceous plant in the <i>Cannabis </i>genus, a species of the Cannabaceae family.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">As used herein, “<i>Cannabis indica </i>Lam” or “<i>Cannabis indica</i>” refers to an annual plant in the Cannabaceae family. A putative species of the genus <i>Cannabis</i>, it is typically distinguished from <i>Cannabis sativa. Cannabis sativa </i>and <i>Cannabis indica </i>can interbreed, so the two strains can be viewed as sub-species or land races. Interbred stains including genetic material from both <i>sativa </i>and <i>indica </i>strains can be termed “<i>sativa</i>-dominant” or “<i>indica</i>-dominant”, depending upon perceived physical and psychotropic properties of the hybrids. The mixed interbred strains can be themselves reproductively viable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">As used herein, “<i>Cannabis ruderalis </i>Janisch” or “<i>Cannabis ruderalis</i>” refers to a species of <i>Cannabis </i>originating in central Russia. It flowers earlier than <i>C. indica </i>or <i>C. sativa</i>, does not grow as tall, and can withstand much harsher climates than either of them. <i>Cannabis ruderalis </i>will produce flowers based on its age, rather than light cycle (photoperiod) changes which govern flowering in <i>C. sativa </i>and <i>C. indica </i>varieties. This kind of flowering is also known as “autoflowering.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The <i>Cannabis </i>plant material contains suitable and desirable compounds, useful in the pharmaceutical dosage forms and methods of medical treatment described herein. The suitable and desirable compounds fall within one or more the following classes of compounds: cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids. These compounds can be obtained from the <i>Cannabis </i>in a pure or partially pure state. The compounds obtained from the <i>Cannabis </i>can be in the form of an extract of <i>Cannabis</i>, or a concentrate of <i>Cannabis. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">As used herein, “extract” refers to a substance obtained by extracting a raw material, using a solvent system. The term “extract of <i>Cannabis</i>” refers to a substance obtained by extracting <i>Cannabis </i>(or any part thereof). In specific embodiments, the process of extracting a raw material using a solvent includes a hot solvent extraction. In alternative embodiments, the process of extracting a raw material using a solvent includes supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), such as, e.g., a fractional supercritical fluid extraction (FSFE). In reference to <i>Cannabis</i>, suitable extracts include, e.g., hash oil, tincture, or combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In specific embodiments, the extract of <i>Cannabis </i>fulfills the definition of “botanical drug substance” provided in the Guidance for Industry Botanical Drug Products Draft Guidance, August 2000, US Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of: “A drug substance derived from one or more plants, algae, or macroscopic fungi. It is prepared from botanical raw materials by one or more of the following processes: pulverization, decoction, expression, aqueous extraction, ethanolic extraction, or other similar processes.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, “tincture” refers to a solvent extract of plant or animal material, a solution of such, or of a low volatility substance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">As used herein, “hash oil” refers to a form of <i>Cannabis</i>. It is a resinous matrix of cannabinoids obtained from the <i>Cannabis </i>plant by solvent extraction, formed into a hardened or viscous mass. Hash oil can be the most potent of the main <i>Cannabis </i>products because of its high THC content which can vary depending on the plant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">As used herein, “concentrate” or “essential oil” refers to a substance obtained by extracting a raw material, using a solvent, wherein the solvent has substantially been removed. In specific embodiments, the process of extracting a raw material using a solvent includes a hot solvent extraction. In alternative embodiments, the process of extracting a raw material using a solvent includes supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), such as, e.g., a fractional supercritical fluid. extraction (FSFE).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">As such, the term “<i>Cannabis </i>concentrate” or “<i>Cannabis </i>essential oil” refers to a substance obtained by extracting <i>Cannabis </i>(or any part thereof), wherein the solvent has substantially been removed. The <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate can be enriched with the desired product (e.g. cannabinoids, terpenoids, and/or flavonoids) from the <i>Cannabis </i>plant material. Additionally, compared to the <i>Cannabis </i>plant material, the <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate can contain a lower concentration of unwanted material terpenes, alkaloids, hemp oil, and/or cannabinoid acids).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">As used herein, “cannabinoid” refers to a class of diverse chemical compounds that act on cannabinoid receptors on cells that repress neurotransmitter release in the brain. These receptor proteins include the endocannabinoids (produced naturally in the body by humans and animals), the phytocannabinoids (found in <i>Cannabis </i>and some other plants), and synthetic cannabinoids (manufactured chemically). The most notable cannabinoid is the phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound of <i>Cannabis</i>. Cannabidiol (CBD) is another major constituent of the plant, representing up to 40% in extracts of the plant resin. There are at least 85 different cannabinoids isolated from <i>Cannabis</i>, exhibiting varied effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">As used herein, “terpenoid” or “isoprenoid” refers to a large and diverse class of naturally occurring organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon isoprene units assembled and modified in thousands of ways. Most are multicyclic structures that differ from one another not only in functional groups but also in their basic carbon skeletons. These lipids can be found in all classes of living things, and are the largest group of natural products. Plant terpenoids are used extensively for their aromatic qualities. They play a role in traditional herbal remedies and are under investigation for antibacterial, antineoplastic, and other pharmaceutical functions. Terpenoids contribute to the scent of eucalyptus, the flavors of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger, the yellow color in sunflowers, and the red color in tomatoes. Well-known terpenoids include citral, menthol, camphor, salvinorin A in the plant <i>Salvia divinorum</i>, the cannabinoids found in <i>Cannabis</i>, ginkgolide and bilobalide found in <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>, and the curcuminoids found in turmeric and mustard seed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">As used herein, “flavonoid” refers to a class of plant secondary metabolites. Flavonoids were referred to as Vitamin P (probably because of the effect they had on the permeability of vascular capillaries) from the mid-1930s to early 50s, but the term has since fallen out of use. According to the IUPAC nomenclature, they can be classified into: flavonoids or bioflavonoids; isoflavonoids, derived from 3-phenylchromen-4-one (3-phenyl-1,4-benzopyrone) structure; and neoflavonoids, derived from 4-phenylcoumarine (4-phenyl-1,2-benzopyrene) structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">As used herein, “supercritical fluid extraction” or “SFE” refers to the process of separating one or more components (extractant) from another (matrix) using supercritical fluids as the extracting solvent. Extraction is usually from a solid matrix (e.g., <i>Cannabis </i>plant material), but can also be from liquids or resinous material (e.g., hash oil). SFE can be used as a sample preparation step for analytical purposes, or on a larger scale to either strip unwanted material from a product (e.g. terpenes, alkaloids, hemp oil, and/or cannabinoid acids from <i>Cannabis </i>plant material) and/or collect a desired product (e.g. cannabinoids, terpenoids, and/or flavonoids). Although numerous supercritical fluids can be used, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the most used supercritical fluid, sometimes modified by co-solvents such as ethanol or methanol. Extraction conditions for supercritical fluids are above the critical temperature of (e.g., 31° C. for carbon dioxide) and critical pressure of (e.g., 74 bar for carbon dioxide). Addition of modifiers may slightly alter this.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The properties of a supercritical fluid can be altered by varying the pressure and temperature, allowing selective extraction. For example, various substances can be extracted from a plant with low pressures (e.g., 100 bar), whereas extraction from the same plant (and same solvent system) with high pressure (e.g., 750 bar) provides different substances. Likewise, changing the extraction temperature from one supercritical fluid extraction to another) can yield different substances. Moreover, various substances can be extracted from a plant with a solvent system having a specified combination of polarity (e.g., non-polar) and proticity (e.g., protic), whereas extraction from the same plant at the same temperature and pressure can provide different substances upon extraction from the plant with a solvent system having a different combination of polarity (e.g., non-polar) and proticity (e.g., aprotic). As such, various embodiments of the present invention provide for a supercritical fluid extraction carried out multiple times (i.e., a fractional supercritical fluid extraction), altering the pressure, temperature, polarity of the solvent system, and/or proticity of the solvent system. In doing so, unwanted material (e.g. terpenes, alkaloids, hemp oil, and/or cannabinoid acids) can be separated from <i>Cannabis </i>plant material, while obtaining the desired product (e.g. cannabinoids, terpenoids, and/or flavonoids).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Extraction is a diffusion-based process, with the solvent required to diffuse into the matrix, and the extracted material to diffuse out of the matrix into the solvent. Diffusivities are much faster in supercritical fluids than in liquids, and therefore extraction can occur faster. Also, there is no surface tension and viscosities are much lower than in liquids, so the solvent can penetrate into small pores within the matrix inaccessible to liquids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">As used herein, “solvent system” refers to one or more solvents that dissolves a solute (a chemically different liquid, solid or gas), resulting in a solution. The maximum quantity of solute that can dissolve in a specific volume of solvent system varies with temperature and pressure. The solvent system can have a specified polarity and proticity. As such, solvent system can be polar, nonpolar, protic, or aprotic, wherein each of these terms is used in a relative manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">As used herein, “polarity” refers to a separation of electric charge leading to a molecule or its chemical groups having an electric dipole or multipole moment. Polar molecules interact through dipole-dipole intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonds. Molecular polarity is dependent on the difference in electronegativity between atoms in a compound and the asymmetry of the compound's structure. Polarity underlies a number of physical properties including surface tension, solubility, and melting- and boiling-points.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">As used herein, “polar” or “polar solvent” refers to a molecule having a net dipole as a result of the opposing charges (i.e., having partial positive and partial negative charges) from polar bonds arranged asymmetrically. Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is an example of a polar molecule since it has a slight positive charge on one side and a slight negative charge on the other. The dipoles do not cancel out resulting in a net dipole. Due to the polar nature of the water molecule itself, polar molecules are generally able to dissolve in water. Another example includes sugars (like sucrose), which have many polar oxygen-hydrogen (—OH) groups and are overall highly polar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">As used herein, “nonpolar” or “nonpolar solvent” refers to a molecule having an equal sharing of electrons between the two atoms of a diatomic molecule or because of the symmetrical arrangement of polar bonds in a more complex molecule. For example, the boron trifluoride molecule (BF<sub>3</sub>) has a trigonal planar arrangement of three polar bonds at 120°. This results in no overall dipole in the molecule. In methane, the bonds are arranged symmetrically (in a tetrahedral arrangement) so there is no overall dipole. In the methane molecule (CH<sub>4</sub>) the four C—H bonds are arranged tetrahedrally around the carbon atom. Each bond has polarity (though not very strong). However, the bonds are arranged symmetrically so there is no overall dipole in the molecule. The diatomic oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) does not have polarity in the covalent bond because of equal electronegativity, hence there is no polarity in the molecule</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Examples of nonpolar solvents include, e.g., carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), neon (Ne), nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), argon (Ar), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), ethane (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>), and propane (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Organic solvents can range from nonpolar to polar, depending upon the molecular composition. For instance, organic solvents can be classified in a series ranging from nonpolar to polar, such as aliphatic hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbon, halocarbon, ether, ketone, alcohol. By selection of an organic solvent, e.g. as a solvent or a cosolvent (with CO<sub>2</sub>, etc.) in a supercritical fluid extraction, a selection of the polarity class of the substances extracted can be exerted. By using less polar solvent or cosolvent, a less polar set of, e.g., cannabinoid constituents can be obtained as a purified fraction. By use of a more polar solvent or cosolvent, a set of cannabinoid constituents of greater polarity can be selectively obtained as a purified fraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">As used herein, “proticity” refers to the degree (or number) of occurrences of a hydrogen atom bound to an oxygen atom (as in a hydroxyl group), and/or a hydrogen atom bound to a nitrogen atom (as in an amine group), relative to the size or molecular weight of the molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">As used herein, “protic” or “protic solvent” refers to any solvent that contains labile H+. The molecules of such solvents readily donate protons (H+) to reagents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">As used herein, “aprotic” or “aprotic solvent” refers to any solvent that does not contain labile H+. The molecules of such solvents cannot readily donate protons (H+) to reagents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">As used herein, “mutually exclusive” refers to variables being related such that each excludes or precludes the other. For example, in the methods described herein to obtain a <i>Cannabis </i>extract, fractional supercritical fluid extract (FSFE) can be employed. In various embodiments of such FSFE, the SFE can be carried out two times (FSFE 1 and FSFE 2), each with the same solvent system and each at a different temperature and pressure. In such embodiments, while the solvent system of FSFE 1 and FSFE 2 are the same, the temperatures and pressures (of FSFE 1 and FSFE 2) are mutually exclusive. Specifically, each of the temperature and pressure of FSFE 1 is mutually exclusive of (e.g., different from) the temperature and pressure of FSFE 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">As used herein, “fresh” refers to a plant (or any physical part thereof, such as a leaf, flowering bud, seed, etc.) that has been harvested within the past 21 days. In specific embodiments, the harvesting would have occurred within the past 14 days, within the past 10 days, within the past 7 days, or within the past 3 days.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">As used herein, “dried” refers to a plant (or any physical part thereof, such as a leaf, bulb, seed, etc.) has undergone a drying process, such that an appreciable and significant amount of water (or moisture) has been removed. The drying process can include, e.g., an elevated temperature, a decreased pressure, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">As used herein, “moisture content” or “water content” refers to the quantity of water contained in a material, such as, e.g., <i>Cannabis </i>plant material, or any part thereof. For example, dried <i>Cannabis </i>can have a moisture content of less than about 10 wt. %, less than about 5 wt. %, or less than about 1 wt. %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">As used herein, “harvested” refers to the act of gathering a crop (e.g., <i>Cannabis</i>) or an physical part thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">As used herein, “partially purified” refers to a raw material (e.g., <i>Cannabis</i>) that has undergone one or more processes (e.g., supercritical fluid extraction), such that the resulting product (e.g., extract of <i>Cannabis</i>) contains a desired substance (e.g., THC) in a concentration higher than the raw material. As such, the partially purified substance (e.g., extract of <i>Cannabis</i>) is said to be enriched with a desired substance (e.g., THC), relative to the raw material (e.g., <i>Cannabis</i>). As used herein, “partially purifying” refers to a process that provides a partially purified product. For example, the partially purified substance can be up to about 85% pure, up to about 75% pure, or up to about 50% pure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">“Purified fractions” can contain components present in different relative amounts or concentrations than found in the <i>Cannabis </i>plant material that has undergone a process of the invention. By this means, purified fractions of the total plant extract can be said to be “enriched” or “depleted” in specific components relative to other specific components. For instance, a purified fraction of plant material can contain a higher proportion of, e.g., cannabidiol relative to tetrahydrocannabinol, than is present in the plant material undergoing extraction. Purified fractions can be advantageous when it is desired to administer to a patient an extract that has a lower level of an undesired component (e.g., THC) and a higher level of a desired therapeutic constituent (e.g., cannabidiol).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">As used herein, “purifying” refers to a process of rendering a substance, or a set of substances, pure, i.e. substantially free of, or having a lower relative content of, undesirable components.

In such embodiments, while the solvent system of FSFE 1 and FSFE 2 are different, the temperatures and pressures (of FSFE 1 and FSFE 2) can be independently selected. In doing so, each of the temperature and pressure (of FSFE 1 and FSFE 2) can be the same, or can be different.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">As used herein, “combining” refers to the act of bringing into contact two or more substances. For example, in the methods described herein, a plant material (e.g., <i>Cannabis</i>) can be combined with a solvent system. In doing so, the plant material and solvent system will be in close proximity, such that they contact each other. The solvent system can be added to a vessel containing the plant material or the plant material can be added to the vessel containing the solvent system.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">As used herein, “enrich” refers to an increase the concentration or amount of one substance, relative to the concentration or amount of another substance; or one material containing a higher concentration or amount of a substance, compared to a second material's concentration or amount of that substance. The difference in the amount (weight/mass) can be at least about 1%, at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 25%, or at least about 50%. Likewise, the difference in concentration can be at least about 1%, at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 25%, or at least about 50%.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">As used herein, “pharmaceutical dosage form” refers to a pharmaceutical product in the form in which it is marketed for use, typically involving a mixture of active drug components and nondrug components (excipients), along with other non-reusable material that may not be considered either ingredient or packaging (such as a capsule shell, for example). The term pharmaceutical dosage form can also refer only to the chemical formulation of a drug product's constituent drug substances) and any blends involved, without considering matters beyond that (like how it's ultimately configured as a consumable product such as a capsule, patch, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Depending on the method/route of administration, pharmaceutical dosage forms come in several types. These include many kinds of liquid, solid, and semisolid dosage forms. Common pharmaceutical dosage forms include pill, tablet, or capsule, drink or syrup, and natural or herbal form such as plant or food of sorts, among many others. Notably, the route of administration (ROA) for drug delivery is dependent on the dosage form of the substance in question. A liquid pharmaceutical dosage form is the liquid form of a dose of a chemical compound used as a drug or medication intended for administration or consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">Various pharmaceutical dosage forms may exist for a single particular drug, since different medical conditions can warrant different routes of administration. For example, persistent nausea and emesis or vomiting may make it difficult to use an oral dosage form, and in such a case, it may be necessary to utilize an alternate route such as inhalational, buccal, sublingual, nasal, suppository or parenteral instead. Additionally, a specific pharmaceutical dosage form may be a requirement for certain kinds of drugs, as there may be issues with various factors like chemical stability or pharmacokinetics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">Exemplary pharmaceutical dosage forms include, e.g., pills, osmotic delivery systems, elixirs, emulsions, hydrogels, suspensions, syrups, capsules, tablets, orally dissolving tablets (ODTs), gel capsules, thin films, adhesive topical patches, lollipops, lozenges, chewing gum, dry powder inhalers (DPIs), vaporizers, nebulizers, metered dose inhalers (MDIs), ointments, transdermal patches, intradermal implants, subcutaneous implants, and transdermal implants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">As used herein, “oral delivery” or “oral administration” refers to a route of administration wherein the pharmaceutical dosage form is taken through the mouth. Oral administration is a part of enteral administration, which also includes buccal (dissolved inside the cheek), sublabial (dissolved under the lip) and sublingual administration (dissolved under the tongue). Enteral medications come in various forms, including: tablets to swallow, chew or dissolve in water or under the tongue; capsules and chewable capsules (with a coating that dissolves in the stomach or bowel to release the medication there); time-release or sustained-release tablets and capsules (which release the medication gradually); powders or granules; teas; drops; and liquid medications or syrups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">As used herein, “ophthalmic delivery” or “ophthalmic administration” refers to a route of administration wherein the pharmaceutical dosage form is taken to, or through, the eye.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">As used herein, “nasal delivery” or “nasal administration” refers to a route of administration wherein the pharmaceutical dosage form is taken to, or through, the nose (e.g., nasal cavity).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">As used herein, “dermal delivery” or “dermal administration” refers to a route of administration wherein the pharmaceutical dosage form is taken to, or through, the dermis (i.e., layer of skin between the epidermis (with which it makes up the cutis) and subcutaneous tissues).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">As used herein, “pill” refers to a small, round, solid pharmaceutical oral dosage form of medication that was in use before the advent of tablets and capsules. Pills were historically made by mixing the active ingredients with an excipient such as glucose syrup in a mortar and pestle to form a paste, then rolling the mass into a long cylindrical shape (called a “pipe”), and dividing it into equal portions, which were then rolled into balls, and often coated with sugar to make them more palatable. Today, pills include tablets, capsules, and variants thereof like caplets—essentially anything with medication that can be digested, minus the liquid forms, falls into the pill category.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">As used herein, “osmotic delivery system” or “osmotic controlled release oral delivery system” or “OROS” refers to a controlled release oral drug delivery system in the form of a tablet. The tablet has a rigid water-permeable jacket with one or more laser drilled small holes. As the tablet passes through the body, the osmotic pressure of water entering the tablet pushes the active drug through the opening in the tablet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">As used herein, “capsule” refers to a solid pharmaceutical oral dosage form wherein the active (and inactive) ingredient is encapsulated. Encapsulation refers to a range of techniques used to enclose medicines in a relatively stable shell known as a capsule, allowing them to, for example, be taken orally or be used as suppositories. The two main types of capsules include hard-shelled capsules, which are typically made using gelatin and contain dry, powdered ingredients or miniature pellets made by, e.g. processes of extrusion or spheronisation. These are made in two halves: a lower-diameter “body” that is filled and then sealed using a higher-diameter “cape”. The second main type of capsules include soft-shelled capsules, primarily used for oils and for active ingredients that are dissolved or suspended in oil. Both of these classes of capsules are made from aqueous solutions of gelling agents like such as animal protein mainly gelatin; and plant polysaccharides or their derivatives like carrageenans and modified forms of starch and cellulose. Other ingredients can be added to the gelling agent solution like plasticizers such as glycerin and/or sorbitol to decrease the capsule's hardness, coloring agents, preservatives, disintegrants, lubricants and surface treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">As used herein, “tablet” refers to a pharmaceutical dosage form that includes a mixture of active substances and excipients, usually in powder form, pressed or compacted from a powder into a solid dose. The excipients can include diluents, binders or granulating agents, glidants (flow aids) and lubricants to ensure efficient tabletting; disintegrants to promote tablet break-up in the digestive tract; sweeteners or flavours to enhance taste; and pigments to make the tablets visually attractive. A polymer coating is often applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, to control the release rate of the active ingredient, to make it more resistant to the environment (extending its shelf life), or to enhance the tablet's appearance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">As used herein, “orally dissolving tablet” or “ODT” refers to pharmaceutical dosage form designed to be dissolved on the tongue rather than swallowed whole. The ODT serves as an alternative dosage form for patients who experience dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) or for where compliance is a known issue and therefore an easier dosage form to take ensures that medication is taken. Common among all age groups, dysphagia is observed in about 35% of the general population, as well as up to 60% of the elderly institutionalized population and 18-22% of all patients in long-term care facilities. Additional reasons to use ODTs include the convenience of a tablet that can be taken without water as well as the inability of the patient to eat or drink (e.g., nausea and/or vomiting).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">As used herein, “oral thin film,” “OTF,” “oral dissolving film,” “oral drug strip,” “oral thin film,” “thin film,” “orally dissolvable film strip,” or “oral strip” refers to a product used to administer active ingredients via absorption in the mouth (buccally or sublingually), the stomach (gastrically), and/or via the small intestines (enterically). The OTF is edible and pharmaceutically acceptable. A film is prepared typically using hydrophilic polymers that rapidly dissolves on the tongue, palatine tissue, or buccal cavity, delivering the active ingredient to the systemic circulation via dissolution when contact with liquid is made. The OTF (or more appropriately “thin film” or “TF”) can also be used to adhere to mucosal tissue (e.g., at least one of mouth, nose, eye, vagina, and rectum), thereby locally delivering the active ingredient(s). As such, it is appreciated that those of skill in the art understand that reference to a thin film for use with mucosal tissue, such as nose, eye, vagina, and rectum, as an “oral thin film” or OTF is appropriate and acceptable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">The term “film” includes thin films and sheets, in any shape, including rectangular, square, or other desired shape. The films described herein may be any desired thickness and size such that it may be placed into the oral cavity of the user. For example, the films may have a relatively thin thickness of from about 0.1 to about 10 mils, or they may have a somewhat thicker thickness of from about 10 to about 30 mils. For some films, the thickness may be even larger, i.e., greater than about 30 mils. In addition, the term “film” includes single-layer compositions as well as multi-layer compositions, such as laminated films. The composition in its dried film form can effectively maintain a relatively uniform distribution of components through the application of controlled drying of the film. For example, the film can have no more than a 20%, 10%, 5%, or 1% variance of the active ingredient, per unit area of the film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">As used herein, “adhesive topical patch” or “transdermal patch” refers to a medicated adhesive patch that is placed on the skin to deliver a specific dose of medication through the skin and into the bloodstream. A transdermal patch or transdermal system (TDS) is a medicated adhesive patch that is placed on the skin to deliver a specific dose of drug through the skin and into the bloodstream. An advantage of a transdermal drug delivery route over other types of medication delivery such as oral, topical, intravenous, intramuscular, etc. is that the patch provides a controlled release of the medication into the patient, usually through either a porous membrane covering a reservoir of medication or through body heat melting thin layers of medication embedded in the adhesive. The main disadvantage to transdermal delivery systems stems from the fact that the skin is a very effective barrier; as a result, only medications whose molecules are small enough to penetrate the skin can effectively be delivered by this method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">The transdermal patch serves as an alternative dosage form for patients who experience dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing). Additional reasons to use transdermal patches include the convenience of a dosage form that can be taken without water as well as the inability of the patient to eat or drink (e.g., nausea and/or vomiting).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">As used herein, “therapeutically effective amount” is intended to include an amount of a substance (or compound) described herein, or an amount of the combination of substances (or compounds) described herein, e.g., to treat or prevent the disease or disorder, or to treat the symptoms of the disease or disorder, in a host. The combination of substances (or compounds) is preferably a synergistic combination. Synergy, as described for example by Chou and Talalay, <i>Adv. Enzyme Regul., </i>22:27 (1984), occurs when the effect of the compounds when administered in combination is greater than the additive effect of the compounds when administered alone as a single agent. In general, a synergistic effect is most clearly demonstrated at suboptimal concentrations of the compounds. Synergy can be in terms of lower cytotoxicity, increased activity, or some other beneficial effect of the combination compared with the individual components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">As used herein, “treating” or “treat” includes: (i) preventing a pathologic condition from occurring (e.g. prophylaxis); (ii) inhibiting the pathologic condition or arresting its development; (iii) relieving the pathologic condition; and/or (iv) diminishing symptoms associated with the pathologic condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problems or complications commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">As sued herein “time release technology” refers to a mechanism used in pharmaceutical dosage forms (e.g., pill, tablet, capsule, transdermal patch, etc.) to dissolve a drug over time in order to be released slower and steadier into the bloodstream, while having the advantage of being taken at less frequent intervals than immediate-release (IR) formulations of the same drug. The time release technology can include sustained-release (SR), sustained-action (SA), extended-release (ER, XR, XL), timed-release (TR), controlled-release (CR), modified release (MR), or continuous-release (Contin).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">There are certain considerations for the formation of time release formulation: (i) if the active compound has a long half-life (over 6 hours), it is sustained on its own; (ii) if the pharmacological activity of the active compound is not related to its blood levels, time releasing has little or no purpose; (iii) if the absorption of the active compound involves an active transport, the development of a time-release product may be problematic; and (iv) if the active compound has a short half-life, it would require a large amount to maintain a prolonged effective dose. In this case, a broad therapeutic window is necessary to avoid toxicity; otherwise, the risk is unwarranted and another mode of administration would be recommended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">As used herein, “single daily dosage” refers to a dose suitable for a single administration over a 24 hour period. The dose is configured for a single administration over a 24 hour period.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">In specific embodiments, the supercritical fluid extraction can be carried out multiple times. In such embodiments, the supercritical fluid extraction is a fractional supercritical fluid extraction, “Fractional supercritical fluid extraction” (hereinafter “FSFE”) refers to a supercritical fluid extraction that is carried out multiple times. Each time the supercritical fluid extraction is carried out, at least one of the (i) solvent system (with respect to polarity and proticity), (ii) temperature, and (iii) pressure will vary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">For example, in reference to <i>Cannabis</i>, the FSFE can include a supercritical fluid extraction that is carried out two times, three times, four times, etc. At each time (occurrence), the temperature, pressure, period of time, and supercritical fluid solvent system are each independently selected (e.g., can independently be the same or different).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">When the SFE is carried out two times, the FSFE can include: (a) contacting <i>Cannabis </i>plant material with a supercritical fluid solvent system (e.g., exclusively carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)) at a suitable pressure (e.g., between about 750 psi and 1,500 psi), and at a suitable temperature (e.g., between about 0° C. and 70° C.), to provide an extract of <i>Cannabis </i>and an extracted <i>Cannabis </i>plant material; (b) removing the supercritical fluid solvent system from the extract of <i>Cannabis</i>; (c) contacting the extracted <i>Cannabis </i>with a second supercritical fluid solvent system (e.g., exclusively carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)) at a suitable pressure (e.g., between about 1,500 psi and 2,500 psi), and at a suitable temperature (e.g., between about 0° C. and 70° C.), to provide a second extract of <i>Cannabis </i>and a second extracted <i>Cannabis </i>plant material; and (d) removing the second supercritical fluid solvent system from the second extract of <i>Cannabis. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">Prior to an initial supercritical fluid extraction, the <i>Cannabis </i>may be dried of any water present. Such drying may increase the efficiency of the supercritical fluid extraction, or may just lower the cost of shipping and storage of <i>Cannabis </i>plant material. The <i>Cannabis </i>may be air-dried or dried at an elevated temperature with or without reduced pressure (i.e., in vacuo). Specifically, the <i>Cannabis </i>may be dried in vacuo at an elevated temperature. Machines capable of drying <i>Cannabis </i>are known in the art and include an oven, or similar device, such as a rotating air drum drier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">For use in the processes of the present invention, the temperature at which the <i>Cannabis </i>may be dried can be greater than about 25° C.

In this case, it may be desirable to carry out the fractional supercritical fluid extraction, e.g., at multiple pressures (i.e., each at different pressures). For example, a first supercritical fluid extraction can be carried out at a lower pressure (e.g., about 1,000 psi) and a subsequent, second supercritical fluid extraction can be carried out at a higher pressure (e.g., about 2,000 psi). In doing so, e.g., the first supercritical fluid extraction can provide a first extract or concentrate, which is enriched with tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs), relative to cannabidiols (CBDs).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">Supercritical fluid extraction employs a solvent (and optionally a co-solvent) which possesses physical properties suitable as a supercritical fluid. Suitable solvents (and co-solvents) useful in supercritical fluid extraction are disclosed, e.g., McHugh, M. And Krukonis, V., Supercritical Fluid Extraction, 2nd ed, Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, 1994; Johnston, K. P., Penninger, J. M. L., Supercritical Fluid Science and Technology, ACS Symposium Series 406, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.; and Taylor, L. T., Supercritical Fluid Extraction, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1996. Suitable exemplary solvents (and co-solvents) useful in supercritical fluid extraction include: carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), neon (Ne), nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), argon (Ar), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), ethane (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>), propane (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), water (H<sub>2</sub>O), xenon (Xe), methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-hexanol, 2-methoxy ethanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, propylene carbonate, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), formic acid, carbon disulfide, acetone, toluene, hexanes, pentanes, trifluoromethane (Freon® 23), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), butane (n-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), isobutane (i-C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), ethyl ether ((C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O), benzotrifluoride (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>), (p-chlorophenyl) trifluoromethane (ClC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>), chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrofluorocarbon (HFA), and HFA-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">Typically, when present, the co-solvent will be present in about 1 wt. % to about 50 wt. %, in about 1 wt. % to about 30 wt. %, or in about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of the supercritical fluid solvent system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">The physical properties of carbon dioxide make it particularly attractive as a solvent for supercritical fluid extraction. Carbon dioxide is a major component of the atmosphere and is therefore relatively safe and abundant. In addition, carbon dioxide is relatively inexpensive. Compared to most other suitable solvents, carbon dioxide is environmentally friendly as it will not harm the atmosphere at the quantities used in the methods of the invention. Moreover, carbon dioxide is non-flammable and non-explosive. Further, carbon dioxide leaves no substantial residue or remnant upon evaporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">Carbon dioxide also possesses physical properties which enable it to change polarity over the temperature range and pressure range normally employed in supercritical fluid extraction. As a result, carbon dioxide may act as a nonpolar solvent at one temperature and pressure but may act as a polar solvent at another temperature and pressure. By varying the temperature and pressure, the solvent properties may be modified. This allows for the isolation of more than one compound using a single solvent system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">The co-solvent can be employed for several practical reasons. The co-solvent decreases the time necessary for extraction, which decreases the costs incurred for the extraction process and increases the efficiency of the extraction process. In addition, the use of at least one co-solvent decreases the likelihood that the desired compound(s) will crystallize or gum out upon evaporation of the highly volatile solvent carbon dioxide. When the supercritical fluid extraction apparatus is dismantled and the desired compounds are obtained, the carbon dioxide will evaporate, leaving the desired crude compounds as a solid or gum-like tar. The use of the co-solvent allows the desired compound(s) to remain soluble in a solvent system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">The solvent employed in supercritical fluid extraction may be a single compound or may be a mixture of compounds. In addition, the solvent may include an additive. As used herein, an “additive” refers to a substance such that upon addition will modify the physical properties of the solvent. For example, an additive may be useful to modify the polarity, critical temperature, critical pressure, etc., of the solvent system. When present, the additive can be present in about 0.5 wt. % to about 25 wt. % of the solvent system, about 0.5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the solvent system, or about 0.5 wt. % to about 15 wt. % of the solvent system. Specifically, when present, the additive can be present in about 1 wt. % to about 15 wt. % of the solvent system, about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of the solvent system, or about 1 wt. % to about 5 wt. % of the solvent system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Suitable additives include, e.g., lower alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-hexanol, or 2-methoxy ethanol); ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane); substituted hydrocarbons (e.g., acetonitrile, dichloromethane, ammonia or chloroform) propylene carbonate, N,N-dimethylaceamide; dimethyl sulfoxide; carboxylic acids (e.g., formic acid); water; carbon disulfide; lower ketones (e.g., acetone), hydrocarbons (e.g., propane, toluene, hexanes and pentanes); substituted aromatics (e.g., C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>, and p-ClC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>).</div>

Oral Thin Film (OTF)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">The OTF includes a <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate. Formulation of oral thin films involves the application of both aesthetic and performance characteristics, such as, e.g., strip-forming polymers, plasticizers, active pharmaceutical ingredient, sweetening agents, sativa stimulating agent, flavoring agents, coloring agents, stabilizing and thickening agents. From the regulatory perspectives, all excipients used in the formulation of oral drug strips should be approved for use in oral pharmaceutical dosage forms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0276">The substances can be selected in an amount such that a desired dissolution rate can be targeted. Upon contact with mucosal tissue (including, e.g., oral mucosa) the TF will completely dissolve within the desired period of time. The period of time will vary but in reference to the oral cavity, the period of time will typically be within about 30-300 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0278" num="0277">The OTF can be placed on any suitable surface within the mouth (oral mucosa), including the roof of the mouth, cheek, tongue, and under the tongue (sublingual mucosa).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0279" num="0278">Dissolving films generally fall into three main classes: fast dissolving, moderate dissolving and slow dissolving. Fast dissolving films generally dissolve in about 1 second to about 30 seconds. Moderate dissolving films generally dissolve in about 1 to about 30 minutes, and slow dissolving films generally dissolve in more than 30 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0279">The thin film can be manufactured in a manner, employing suitable ingredients, such that any one or more of the desired pharmacokinetic metrics (e.g., dose, area under the curve, peak plasma concentration, dosing intervals, time to reach peak plasma concentration, clearance, bioavailability, etc.) are achieved. For example, the thin film can be manufactured such that the thin film provides for an immediate release (IR) or a time-release (e.g., controlled release (CR), modified release (MR), extended release (ER), or combination thereof) of active ingredient. The thin films described herein therefore possess the potential to allow the development of sensitive drug targets that may otherwise not be feasible in tablet or liquid formulations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0280">The thin film described herein can include a mucoadhesive agent. The mucoadhesive agent, when placed in the oral cavity in contact with the mucosa therein, adheres to the mucosa. The mucoadhesive agent is especially effective in transmucosal delivery of the active ingredient, as the mucoadhesive agent permits a close and extended contact of the composition with the mucosal surface by promoting adherence of the composition or drug to the mucosa, and facilitates the release of the active ingredient from the composition. The mucoadhesive agent can be a polymeric compound, such as a cellulose derivative but it may be also a natural gum, alginate, pectin, or such similar polymer. The concentration of the mucoadhesive agent in the coating, such as a powder matrix coating, may be adjusted to vary the length of time that the film adheres to the mucosa or to vary the adhesive forces generated between the film and mucosa. The mucoadhesive agent may adhere to oral mucosa or to mucosa or tissue in other parts of the body, including the mouth, nose, eyes, vagina, and rectum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0282" num="0281">Mucoadhesive agents include, e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (povidone), sodium alginate, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, polyethylene glycols, carbopols, polycarbophils, carboxyvinyl copolymers, propylene glycol alginate, alginic acid, methyl methacrylate copolymers, tragacanth gum, guar gum, karaya gum, ethylene vinyl acetate, dimenthylpolysiloxanes, polyoxyalkylene block copolymers, pectin, chitosan, carrageenan, xanthan gum, gellan gum, locust bean gum, and hydroxyethylmethacrylate copolymers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0282">The thin film described herein can include a flavoring agent. “Flavoring agent” refers to a substance capable of providing a flavor. In addition to providing a palatable and pleasurable factor to the user, the flavoring agent can also mask undesirable flavors present in the OTF. The flavoring agent can include natural flavoring agents (e.g., extracts).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0283">The thin film described herein can include a flavoring extract. “Flavor extract” refers to a flavoring agent obtained by extracting a part of a raw material, e.g., animal or plant material, often by using a solvent such as ethanol or water. The majority of natural essences are obtained by extracting the essential oil from the blossoms, fruit, roots, etc., or the whole plants, through four techniques: expression (when the oil is very plentiful and easily obtained, as in lemon peel), absorption (generally accomplished by steeping in alcohol, as vanilla beans), maceration (used to create smaller bits of the whole, as in making peppermint extract, etc.), and distillation (used with maceration, but in many cases, it requires expert chemical knowledge and the erection of costly stills).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0284">Flavoring agents can include breath freshening compounds like menthol, spearmint, and cinnamon, coffee beans, other flavors or fragrances such as fruit (e.g., cherry, orange, grape, etc.,) flavors, especially those used for oral hygiene, as well as actives used in dental and oral cleansing such as quaternary ammonium bases. The effect of flavors may be enhanced using flavor enhancers like tartaric acid, citric acid, vanillin, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0285">The thin film described herein can include a sweetener. “Sweetener” refers to a substance capable of providing a palatable and pleasurable factor to the user, and/or capable of masking undesirable flavors present in the OTF. The sweetener can include one or more artificial sweeteners, one or more natural sweeteners, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0287" num="0286">Artificial sweeteners include, e.g., acesulfame and its various salts such as the potassium salt (available as Sunett®), alitame, aspartame (available as NutraSweet® and Equal®), salt of aspartame-acesulfame (available as Twinsweet®), neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, naringin dihydrochalcone, dihydrochalcone compounds, neotame, sodium cyclamate, saccharin and its various salts such as the sodium salt (available as Sweet'N Low®), stevia, chloro derivatives of sucrose such as sucralose (available as Kaltame® and Splenda®), and mogrosides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0287">Natural sweeteners include, glucose, dextrose, invert sugar, fructose, sucrose, glycyrrhizin; monoammonium glycyrrhizinate (sold under the trade name MagnaSweet®); Stevia rebaudiana (Stevioside), natural intensive sweeteners, such as Lo Han Kuo, polyols such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0288">The thin film described herein can include a bitter blocker. “Bitter blocker” refers to a substance capable of blocking or diminishing the bitter taste of another substance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0289">In specific embodiments, the thin film described can be palatable. “Palatable” refers to a substance (e.g., oral thin film) being relatively acceptable or agreeable to the palate or taste (e.g., sweet or savory), and in some cases to the olfactory nerves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0290">The thin film described herein can include a dye, pigment or coloring agent. “Dye or pigment” or “coloring agent” refers to a substance that imparts coloring and/or aesthetic appearance to the OTF. A dye is a colored substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and requires a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber. A pigment is a material that changes the color of reflected or transmitted light as the result of wavelength-selective absorption. This physical process differs from fluorescence, phosphorescence, and other forms of luminescence, in which a material emits light. Both dyes and pigments appear to be colored because they absorb some wavelengths of light more than others. In contrast with a dye, a pigment generally is insoluble, and has no affinity for the substrate. Some dyes can be precipitated with an inert salt to produce a lake pigment, and based on the salt used they could be aluminum lake, calcium lake or barium lake pigments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0291">One or more dyes, pigments, and coloring agents can be employed in the manufacture of the thin film, such that the thin film has the desired color. Suitable colors include, e.g., white, black, yellow, blue, green, pink, red, orange, violet, indigo, and brown. In specific embodiments, the color of the thin film can indicate the contents (e.g., one or more active ingredients) contained therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0292">In specific embodiments, the thin film described herein can include a preservative. “Preservative” refers to an agent that extends the storage life of food and non-food products by retarding or preventing deterioration of flavor, odor, color, texture, appearance, nutritive value, or safety. A preservative need not provide a lethal, irreversible action resulting in partial or complete microbial cell destruction or incapacitation. Sterilants, sanitizers, disinfectants, sporicides, viricides and tuberculocidal agents provide such an irreversible mode of action, sometimes referred to as “bactericidal” action. In contrast, a preservative can provide an inhibitory or bacteriostatic action that is reversible, in that the target microbes can resume multiplication if the preservative is removed. The principal differences between a preservative and a sanitizer primarily involve mode of action (a preservative prevents growth rather than killing microorganisms) and exposure time (a preservative has days to months to act whereas a sanitizer has at most a few minutes to act).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0294" num="0293">In specific embodiments, the thin film described herein can have a suitable tensile strength. “Tensile strength” refers to the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before failing or breaking. Tensile strength is the opposite of compressive strength and the values can be quite different. Tensile strength is defined as a stress, which is measured as force per unit area. For some non-homogeneous materials (or for assembled components) it can be reported just as a force or as a force per unit width. In the SI system, the unit is the pascal (Pa) (or a multiple thereof, often megapascals (MPa), using the mega-prefix); or, equivalently to pascals, newtons per square meter (N/m<sup>2</sup>). The customary unit is pounds-force per square inch (lbf/in<sup>2 </sup>or psi), or kilo-pounds per square inch (ksi, or sometimes kpsi), which is equal to 1000 psi; kilo-pounds per square inch are commonly used for convenience when measuring tensile strengths. Typically, the testing involves taking a small sample with a fixed cross-section area, and then pulling it with a controlled, gradually increasing force until the sample changes shape or breaks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0295" num="0294">In specific embodiments, the thin film described herein can be pliable. “Pliable” refers to the ability of an article to readily bend, be flexible, or to be supple.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0296" num="0295">In specific embodiments, the thin film described herein can be non-sticky. “Non-sticky” refers to an article (e.g., thin film) not having the property of readily adhering or sticking to another surface (e.g., another article, manufacturing equipment, packaging material, the user, etc.) while not in use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0296">In specific embodiments, the thin film described herein can be soft. “Soft” refers to an article being relatively smooth and agreeable to the touch; not rough or coarse. Such an article will be capable of producing agreeable sensations, pleasant or comfortable, upon contact with an animal such as a human.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0298" num="0297">In specific embodiments, the thin film described herein can have chewable configuration. “Chewable configuration” refers to an article being manufactured in such a manner and with ingredients, that it possesses a configuration capable of being readily chewed by an animal, such as a human.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0299" num="0298">In specific embodiments, the thin film described herein can have a malleable configuration. “Malleable configuration” refers to refers to an article being manufactured in such a manner and with ingredients, that it possesses a configuration capable of being readily shaped or changed in form (e.g., folded, bent, rolled, twisted, flexed, etc.) without breaking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0300" num="0299">In specific embodiments, the thin film described herein can have a ductile property. “Ductile property” refers to the ability of an article (e.g., thin film) being readily shaped or changed in form (e.g., folded, bent, rolled, twisted, flexed, etc.) without breaking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0301" num="0300">In specific embodiments, the thin films described herein can be perforated. “Perforated” refers to the one or more holes, apertures or scores existing along a line to facilitate separation. Perforations on the thin films allow the user to conveniently administer smaller dosages of the active ingredient. This is especially useful, for example, when the patient is a child, who should receive a smaller dosage. Accurate dosing can be metered, e.g., by the weight, size, age, etc. of the patient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0302" num="0301">The OTF serves as an alternative dosage form for patients who experience dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) or for where compliance is a known issue and therefore an easier dosage form to take ensures that medication is taken. Additional reasons (and advantages) to use OTFs include the convenience of a dosage form that can be taken without water as well as the inability of the patient to eat or drink (e.g., experiencing nausea and/or vomiting).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0303" num="0302">Suitable oral thin films, and methods of preparing oral thin films, are described, e.g., in WO/2012/103464A2; WO/2013/085224A1; US 2013/0039955; US 2011/0305768; WO/2011/072208A1; US 2011/0142942; US 2013/0309294; WO/2012/104834A1; US 2012/0125351; and US 2011/0280925.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">Transdermal Patch</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0303">The topical adhesive patch includes a backing having a front side and a back side. The patch includes a formulation that is in contact with the front side of the backing. The formulation includes an adhesive and <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0304">Since the backing can be porous and/or vapor permeable, many consumers typically refer to the device as a “patch,” a “skin patch,” a “topical patch,” or an “adhesive skin patch.” As such, the device will herein be referred interchangeably to as a patch, a skin patch, and/or an adhesive skin patch. It is appreciated that those skilled in the art understand that the term “patch” is used to refer to the device and is not otherwise limiting in any manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0306" num="0305">The topical adhesive patch can be manufactured in a manner, employing suitable ingredients, such that any one or more of the desired pharmacokinetic metrics (e.g., dose, area under the curve, peak plasma concentration, dosing intervals, time to reach peak plasma concentration, clearance, bioavailability, etc.) are achieved. For example, the topical adhesive patch can be manufactured such that the topical adhesive patch provides for an immediate release (IR) or a time-release (e.g., controlled release (CR), modified release (MR), extended release (ER), or combination thereof) of active ingredient. The topical adhesive patch described herein therefore possess the potential to allow the development of sensitive drug targets that may otherwise not be feasible in tablet or liquid formulations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">Backing</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0307" num="0306">The backing is defined by a front side (the side exposed to the subject, or an article of clothing of the subject, during use) and a back side (the side exposed to the environment during use). The backing should be nonirritating to human skin. The backing is a self-supporting sheet of water soluble or water insoluble, polymeric or natural material that provides strength and integrity for the formulation. The backing of the adhesive patch can be vapor permeable. The backing can also be porous, since porosity provides openings for receiving the formulation, and it helps to assure that the adhesive skin patch is vapor permeable. Specifically, the hacking can retain the formulation while allowing moisture from the skin to pass. Alternatively, the backing can be nonporous. The backing can have any suitable thickness. In specific embodiments, the suitable thickness allows for a flexible, bendable, pliable, vapor permeable, and/or a stretchable sheet of water insoluble porous material. Specifically, the thickness of the backing can be about 0.001 mm to about 5.0 mm, about 0.001 mm to about 3.0 mm, or about 0.025 mm to about 1.25 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0308" num="0307">The backing can be manufactured from any suitable material. In specific embodiments, the suitable material forms a flexible, bendable, pliable, and/or stretchable backing. The backing includes a porous or non-porous sheet of water soluble or water insoluble material that provides support for the adhesive skin patch. The backing can include water soluble or water insoluble polymeric fibers, a porous film, or any other kind of matrix with spaces within the matrix. A specific backing is a lightweight, porous, pliable strip composed of a nonwoven fabric of polymeric or natural fibers such as polyester, cotton, or cellulose fibers bonded together with a sizing resin. The hacking can be woven or nonwoven. In one embodiment, the backing includes nonwoven fabric. Specifically, the backing can include polyester fibers, polyurethane fibers, polyolefin fibers, polyamide fibers, natural fibers, cotton fibers, copolyester, copolyester fibers, cellulose acetate fibers, polycellulose fibers, or any mixture thereof. Additional stable, water insoluble flexible sheet materials and methods for manufacturing the suitable backings <b>2</b> are disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,675,009; 5,536,263; 4,696,854; 5,741,510; and references cited therein, and are suitable as backings <b>2</b> according to the present invention. The infusion of the formulation into the backing can be accomplished, e.g., with the use of a continuous process mixer, as disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,263, and references cited therein; or as discussed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0309" num="0308">In a specific embodiment, the backing can be manufactured from a substance or substances that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for topical use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0310" num="0309">The backing can be manufactured from a suitable non-woven fabric that is commercially available from, e.g., Freudenberg Faservliesstoffe K G (Weinham, Germany); Sontara Technologies (division of DuPont Corporation) (Old Hickory, Tenn.); Lystil S. A. (Brignoud Cedex, France); Dexter Nonwovens (Windsor Locks, Conn.); Testfabrics, Inc. (West Pittiston, Pa.); and Chicopee (New Brunswick, N.J.). Other commercial vendors that supply suitable non-woven fabrics can be found at the Technical Textile website (http://www.technical-textiles.net/technical-textiles-index/orgL.htm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0311" num="0310">Alternatively, the fibers of the backing can be interlocked mechanically by air or water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0312" num="0311">The backing can include a front side and a back side. The adhesive skin patch can include a formulation located in at least a portion of the front side of the backing, on at least a portion of the front side of the backing, or on and in at least a portion of the front side of the backing. As such, the formulation can be located on the entire surface of the front side of the backing, or the formulation can be located on a portion of the surface of the front side of the backing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0313" num="0312">In one embodiment, the formulation can be located on the entire surface of the front side of the backing. In addition to being located on the surface of the front side of the backing, the formulation can be located in at least a portion of the underlying surface of the front side of the backing (e.g., the formulation can be partially embedded into the backing).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0314" num="0313">The formulation can penetrate a substantial portion of the front side of the backing, as disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,263, and references cited therein. For example, the formulation can penetrate about one-tenth to about nine-tenths the thickness of the backing, or about one-fourth to about nine-tenths the thickness of the backing. As such, the formulation can be partially embedded into the backing. In one embodiment, the formulation can be located on the entire front side of the backing and partially in the front side of the backing (e.g., the formulation is partially embedded into the backing).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0315" num="0314">Alternatively, a portion of the front side of the backing can include the formulation and other portions of the front side of the backing can include any suitable and effective combination of the pressure sensitive adhesive and, optionally, the solvent. For example, a central circular portion of the front side of the backing can include the formulation while the remaining portions of the front side of the backing include only the pressure sensitive adhesive. The formulation, when partially embedded into the front side of the backing, can impart strength and structure into the adhesive patch. For example, when the formulation is partially embedded into the backing, the likelihood that the adhesive patch tears apart when separated from the release liner or when removed from the skin after use, is lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0316" num="0315">When the adhesive skin patch is placed upon the skin of a subject (e.g., a human), the formulation can be in continuous contact with the skin surface of the subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0317" num="0316">In one embodiment, the adhesive skin patch, upon contact with skin, can allow the skin to breathe. In one embodiment, the adhesive skin patch, upon prolonged contact with skin, holds in place the formulation, and permits the skin to breathe over prolonged periods of time typically experienced with the use of the patch, e.g., up to about 7 days, up to about 24 hours, up to about 12 hours, up to about 8 hours, or up to about 6 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0318" num="0317">The adhesive skin patch can be reversibly attached to a release liner. The release liner helps to maintain the adhesiveness of the adhesive skin patch prior to use, such as during manufacturing, packaging, shipping, and/or storage. Any suitable release liner can be employed for use in the present invention. Suitable release liners 10 are readily known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,675,009; 5,536,263; 4,696,854; 5,741,510; and references cited therein for further descriptions of release liners 10 useful in the present invention. The release liner can include a perforation that allows the tab section of the release liner to be removed, Removal of the tab section of the release liner can allow the adhesive skin patch to be removed from the release liner with relative ease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0318">The hacking can be a porous or non-porous, self-supporting sheet of water insoluble or water soluble, polymeric or natural material that provides strength and integrity for the formulation. For example, the backing can be water insoluble polymeric fibers, open cell foam backing (e.g., polyurethane, polyvinyl chloride, or polyethylene), a porous film, or any other kind of matrix with spaces within the matrix. In one embodiment, the backing can include polyester, polyurethane, polyolefin, polyamide fibers, natural fibers, cotton fibers, polycellulose fibers, or any mixture thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0319">The back side of the backing of the patch can be relatively dry to the touch, such that upon contact, e.g., with a skin surface or article of clothing, no appreciable or significant amount of liquid, gel, ointment, fluid, lotion, and the like, present in the back side of the backing of the patch is transferred there from and deposited upon the skin surface or article of clothing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0321" num="0320">The back side of the backing of the patch can have a relatively small degree of moisture, while still being considered a “dry” patch, and would still be relatively dry to the touch, such that upon contact, e.g., with a skin surface or article of clothing, no appreciable or significant amount of liquid, gel, ointment, fluid, lotion, and the like, present in the back side of the backing of the patch is transferred there from and deposited upon the skin surface or article of clothing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0322" num="0321">In one embodiment, the back side of the backing of the patch can be relatively dry, upon touching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">Formulation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0323" num="0322">The patch can include a formulation that includes the <i>Cannabis </i>concentrate and adhesive, and optionally any one or more of a skin penetration enhancer, solvent, adhesive, polymer, humectant, topical moisturizer, polyhydric alcohol, and water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0324" num="0323">The backing can include a front side and a back side. The patch can include a formulation located in at least a portion of the front side of the backing, located on at least a portion of the front side of the backing, or located on and in at least a portion of the front side of the backing. In one embodiment, the formulation is located on the entire front side of the backing and partially in the front side of the backing (e.g., the formulation is partially embedded into the backing).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0325" num="0324">The formulation can be positioned on and in any portion of the front side of the backing, i.e., the formulation can be positioned on at least a portion on the front side of the backing, in at least a portion on the front side of the backing, or on and in at least a portion on the front side of the backing. The formulation can be positioned in a portion of the front side of the backing (e.g., the formulation penetrates a substantial portion of the front side of the backing) as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,263, and references cited therein.

The solvent system is initially cooled to maintain liquid conditions, and then heated after pressurization. The desired temperature and pressure is achieved. The SFE extraction vessel is shaken to facilitate extraction. After the requisite period of time, the temperature and pressure are lowered to ambient conditions. The process is optionally repeated, one or more times. The spent plant material is separated from the extract, wherein the extract is optionally further processed to provide a concentrate.</div>
