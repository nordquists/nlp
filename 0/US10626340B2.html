<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure relates to alternative fuels, chemicals, and fuel feed stocks. In particular, the disclosure relates to systems and methods for producing an engineered fuel feed stock having additives to control emissions, prevent corrosion, and/or improve operational performance during combustion or gasification applications. The feed stock described herein includes at least one component of processed solid waste, an additive, and optionally other components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Sources of fossil fuels useful for heating, transportation, and the production of chemicals as well as petrochemicals are becoming increasingly scarce and costly. Industries such as those producing energy and petrochemicals are actively searching for cost-effective engineered fuel feed stock alternatives for use in generating those products and many others. Additionally, due to the ever increasing costs of fossil fuels, transportation costs for moving engineered fuel feed stocks for production of energy and petrochemicals is rapidly escalating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">These energy and petrochemical producing industries, and others, have relied on the use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil and natural gas, for use in combustion and gasification processes for the production of energy, for heating and electricity, and the generation of synthesis gas used for the downstream production of chemicals and liquid fuels, as well as an energy source for turbines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">One potentially significant source of feed stock for production of an engineered fuel is solid waste. Solid waste, such as municipal solid waste (MSW), is typically disposed of in landfills or used in combustion processes to generate heat and/or steam for use in turbines. The drawbacks accompanying combustion include the production of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulates and products of chlorine that are damaging to the environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is a need for alternative fuels that burn efficiently and cleanly and that can be used for the production of energy and/or chemicals. There is at the same time a need for waste management systems that implement methods for reducing green house gas emissions of waste by utilizing such wastes. In particular, there is a need for improved systems and methods for sorting waste material and reclaiming a resource value from components of the waste material. By harnessing and using the energy content contained in waste, it is possible to reduce green house gas emissions and/or otherwise reduce emissions generated during the processing of wastes thereby effectively using the waste generated by commercial and residential consumers.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, a waste management system includes a tipping floor, a screen, a primary shredder, a secondary shredder, a set of separators, a material classification subsystem, and an engineered fuel production subsystem. In some embodiments, the tipping floor can be configured to receive at least a portion of a waste stream to be processed within or by the waste management system. The screen is configured to process the incoming waste by removing undersized fraction of the waste consisting primarily of non combustibles, batteries, and food waste. The primary shredder is configured to shred the waste material to a predetermined size such that remaining non-processable and non-combustible waste can be separated from the waste stream by the set of separators. The set of separators can include a magnetic separator, an eddy current separator, an optical separator, and/or a glass separator. The secondary shredder can be configured to receive the processable waste stream and shred the processable waste to a predetermined size. The material classification subsystem can be configured to further separate (i.e., classify) the processable waste and deliver the classified waste to the engineered fuel production subsystem. The engineered fuel production subsystem is configured to receive the classified waste material from the material classification subsystem and selectively produce an engineered fuel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method <b>100</b> for producing an engineered fuel feed stock from solid waste material. The method <b>100</b> includes conveying a waste stream to a multi-material processing platform <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the waste stream can be, for example, MSW, recycling residue, and/or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the waste stream can be delivered to a tipping floor of a waste material receiving facility. The method <b>100</b> includes separating non-processables and prohibitives <b>104</b> from the waste stream. In some embodiments, the non-processables can be removed from the waste stream before the waste stream is conveyed to the tipping floor of the waste material receiving facility (e.g., at a previous waste handling facility).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The method <b>100</b> further includes separating marketable recyclables <b>106</b> from the waste stream. The marketable recyclables can be separated using any suitable method. In some embodiments, the marketable recyclables are separated manually (e.g., by hand). In other embodiments, the waste stream can be fed into a separator and/or series of separators. For example, in some embodiments, the separators can include a magnetic separator (e.g., to remove ferrous metals), a disc separator (e.g., to remove relatively large pieces of OCC, ONP, mixed plastics, etc.), an eddy current separator (e.g., to remove non-ferrous metals), an optical sorter separator and/or any other suitable separator (e.g. XRF sensor based separator). In this manner, materials with a sufficiently high market value can be removed (e.g., separated) from the waste stream and further processed (e.g., bailed, stored, shipped, etc.) to be sold as a marketable material. Systems and methods of processing and sorting marketable recyclables are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,264,124 to Bohlig et al., filed Nov. 17, 2004, entitled “Systems and Methods for Sorting Recyclables at a Material Recovery Facility,” U.S. Pat. No. 7,341,156 to Bohlig et al., filed Apr. 15, 2005, entitled “Systems and Methods for Sorting, Collecting Data Pertaining to and Certifying Recyclables at a Material Recovery Facility,” and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0290006 to Duffy et al., filed May 23, 2007, entitled “Systems and Methods for Optimizing a Single-Stream Materials Recovery Facility,” the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, in their entireties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">With the non-processables, prohibitives and the marketable recyclables removed from the waste stream, the waste stream can be conveyed to a material classification subsystem <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the conveying of the waste stream can include passing the waste stream through at least one shredder configured to reduce the size of the constituents of the waste stream. For example, in some embodiments, the shredder can be configured to reduce the size of the constituents of the waste stream to be less than about 4 inches. In other embodiments, the shredder can be configured to reduce the size of the constituents of the waste stream to be between about 0.75 inches and about 1 inch. In still other embodiments, the shredder can be configured to reduce the size of the constituents of the waste stream to be between about 0.1875 inches and about 0.25 inches. With the size of the constituents of the waste stream reduced, the conveying of the waste stream to the material classification subsystem can further include passing the waste stream through a set of separators. In some embodiments, the set of separators can include, for example, a density separator, a magnetic separator, an eddy current separator, a glass separator, and/or the like. For example, in some embodiments, the shredded waste stream can pass through a density separator such that materials with a density below a predetermined threshold pass to the material classification subsystem and material with a density above the predetermined threshold pass to a secondary subsystem (e.g., further separated to remove marketable recyclables not separated in the first separation process) and/or are disposed of (e.g., conveyed to a landfill).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The material classification subsystem can be configured to further separate a desired set of materials. For example, in some embodiments, the material classification subsystem receives a waste stream including hard plastics, soft plastics, and/or fibers. In such embodiments, the material classification subsystem can separate the hard plastics, soft plastics, and/or fibers via any suitable method. For example, in some embodiments, the material classification subsystem can include cyclonic separators, fluidized beds, density separators, and/or the like. With the waste stream further separated by the material classification subsystem, the method <b>100</b> includes selectively mixing additive material <b>110</b> to one or more components of the separated waste stream. The additive material can include, for example, chemical additives, sorbents, biomass waste (e.g., wood), biomaterials (e.g., animal manure), and/or any other suitable additive. With the additive material mixed with at least a portion of the waste stream, the portion of the waste stream can be processed into an engineered fuel feed stock <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, at least a portion of the waste stream and the additive material can be compressed to form a densified intermediate material. The densified intermediate material can be in the form of cubes, briquettes, pellets, honeycomb, or other suitable shapes and forms. For example, in some embodiments, chemical additives (e.g., sorbents, nutrients, promoters, and/or the like) can be mixed with hard plastics and/or soft plastics that have been separated from the waste stream by the material classification subsystem, and then compressed to form pellets such that the additives are evenly distributed (i.e., substantially homogeneous) and integrated (i.e., bound) within the plastic pellets. In some embodiments, the densified intermediate material can be used as an engineered fuel feed stock in, for example, combustion power plants (e.g., coal burning power plants). In other embodiments, the densified intermediate material can be combined with a second portion of the waste stream (e.g., the soft plastic and/or the fiber) and processed (e.g., compressed). In still other embodiments, the densified intermediate material can be granulated and/or pulverized to any suitable particle size, combined with a second portion of the waste stream and/or additional additives, and then compressed to form a densified engineered fuel feed stock. In this manner, the constituents of the separated waste stream (e.g., the constituents of the waste stream after material classification) can be combined with additives (and/or portions of previously processed materials) to produce a substantially homogeneous engineered fuel feed stock that includes inseparable additives, as described in further detail herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic illustration of a system <b>200</b> for producing an engineered fuel feed stock from solid waste material. The system <b>200</b> includes at least a tipping floor F, a primary shredder <b>230</b>, a secondary shredder <b>235</b>, a density separator <b>243</b>, a magnetic separator <b>244</b>, an eddy current separator <b>245</b>, a glass separator <b>246</b>, a material classification subsystem <b>220</b>, and a fuel feed stock production subsystem <b>280</b> (also referred to herein as “engineered fuel subsystem <b>280</b>” or “EF subsystem <b>280</b>”). In some embodiments, a waste stream is conveyed to the tipping floor F, as shown by arrow AA. The waste stream can be, for example, MSW delivered via a collection truck or recycling residue from a recycling facility. In other embodiments, the solid waste can be delivered via a conveyer from a material recovery facility or other waste handling facility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The waste stream, at least partially disposed on the tipping floor F, is configured to be separated such that non-processables, prohibitives and/or marketable recyclables (as described above) are removed (e.g., separated) from the waste stream. In some embodiments, the tipping floor is configured to have manual removal of bulky items, screen separators to remove undersized materials such as batteries, electronic parts, food waste, and noncombustibles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">While not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the system <b>200</b> can include any number of conveyers and/or transport mechanisms configured to convey at least a portion of the waste stream from a portion of the system <b>200</b> to a second portion of the system <b>200</b>. In this manner and with the non-processables, prohibitives and the marketable recyclables removed from the waste stream, the waste stream can be conveyed to the primary shredder <b>230</b>. In some embodiments, the primary shredder <b>230</b> can further be configured to receive recycling residue, as shown by the arrow BB in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, in some embodiments, the primary shredder <b>230</b> can receive the waste stream conveyed from the tipping floor F and recycling residue delivered from, for example, a material recovery facility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The primary shredder <b>230</b> can be any suitable shredder configured to reduce the size of the constituents of the waste stream to a suitable size. For example, in some embodiments, the constituents of the waste stream can be reduced to a size less than about 10-12 inches. In other embodiments, the shredder can be configured to reduce the size of the constituents of the waste stream to be less than 4 inches, and in still other embodiments the shredder can be configured to reduce the size of the constituents of the waste stream to be between about 0.75 inches and about 1 inch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The system <b>200</b> can further include a conveyer configured to transfer a portion of the waste stream from the primary shredder <b>230</b> to the density separator <b>243</b>. The conveying of the material can be pneumatically (via air blower) or mechanically (e.g. screw conveyor). The density separator <b>243</b> can be configured such that a first set of constituents of the waste stream with a density below a predetermined density threshold (e.g., plastics and/or fibers) pass through the density separator <b>243</b> to the secondary shredder <b>235</b>. A second set of constituents of the waste stream with a density above the predetermined density threshold (e.g., ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, glass, dirt, and/or the like) are configured to pass through the density separator <b>243</b> to additional separations processes. For example, the metals, glass, dirt, etc. can be conveyed to the magnetic separator <b>244</b> where the marketable ferrous metals (e.g., steel) are recovered. The remaining metals, glass, dirt, etc. can be conveyed to the eddy current separator <b>245</b> where the marketable non-ferrous metals (e.g., aluminum) are recovered. The residual non-metallic material can then optionally be conveyed to the glass separator <b>246</b> to remove the glass particles. In some embodiments, the glass separator <b>246</b> is an optical glass separator. In other embodiments, the glass separator <b>246</b> can be any suitable separator. With the portion of the waste stream substantially free of metals and/or glass, the remaining constituents (e.g., residues) can be disposed of in, for example, a landfill, if no other beneficial use of the material can be identified. In some embodiments where recycled glass does not have a market value, the glass separator can be omitted and/or bypassed and the glass can be disposed of with the residues at a landfill, or used as daily cover material in landfill.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">As described above, the first set of constituents of the waste stream (e.g., the plastics and fibers with a density below the density threshold of the density separator <b>243</b>) are conveyed to the secondary shredder <b>235</b>. The secondary shredder <b>235</b> can be any suitable shredder. For example, in some embodiments, the secondary shredder <b>235</b> is substantially similar to the primary shredder <b>230</b>. In other embodiments, the secondary shredder <b>235</b> is different from the primary shredder <b>235</b>. Furthermore, the secondary shredder <b>235</b> can be configured to shred the constituents of the waste stream to any suitable size, e.g. a smaller size than produced by the primary shredder <b>235</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the secondary shredder is configured to shred the constituents to a size between about 0.375 (⅜″) inches and about 0.25 (¼″) inches. In other embodiments, the secondary shredder <b>235</b> can shred the constituents of the waste stream to a size less than or equal to about 0.09375 ( 3/32″) inches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the density separator <b>243</b> can be configured to include multiple stages and/or portions. For example, in some embodiments, the waste stream can be delivered to a screen included in the density separator <b>243</b>. In such embodiments, the screen can define a predetermined mesh size and can be configured to separate the waste stream into a first portion including a constituent size of less than the mesh size and a second portion including a constituent size greater than mesh size. In some embodiments, the first portion of the waste stream can be delivered to a first density separator (not shown) and the second portion of the waste stream can be delivered to a second density separator (not shown). In some embodiments, for example, the screen can define a mesh size of about 0.25 inches. In some embodiments, the separation of the waste stream into the first portion, having the first constituent size, and the second portion, having the second constituent size, can increase the efficiency of the first density separator and/or the second separator. In such embodiments, constituents of greater size can, for example, reduce the efficiency of the first separator, cause the first separator to malfunction, and/or cause the first separator inadequately separate the constituents. With the constituents separated by the first density separator or the second density separator, the constituents with a density greater than the density threshold (e.g., ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, glass, dirt, and/or the like) are conveyed to the set of separators, as described above. Furthermore, the constituents of the waste stream with a density below the density threshold of the first density separator and/or the second density separator (e.g., the plastics and fibers) can be conveyed to the secondary shredder <b>235</b>.</div>

With the size of the constituents of the waste stream reduced to a predetermined size and the waste stream sufficiently separated, the waste stream can be transferred to the material classification subsystem <b>220</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The material classification subsystem <b>220</b> can be any suitable system configured to further separate (e.g., classify) a desired set of material.

In such embodiments, the material classification subsystem <b>220</b> can separate the incoming material into, for example, hard plastic, soft plastic, and/or fiber via any suitable method. In some embodiments, the material classification subsystem <b>220</b> can include cyclonic separators, fluidized beds, density separators, and/or the like. In this manner, the material classification subsystem <b>220</b> can separate the waste stream and store the separated constituents in, for example, bunkers (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The system <b>200</b> can further include a delivery mechanism (e.g., a conveyer) to convey the hard plastic, the soft plastic, and/or the fiber to the fuel feed stock production subsystem <b>280</b>.

For example, in some embodiments, the EF subsystem <b>280</b> can include a portion configured to deliver additives to the waste stream (e.g., chemical additives, sorbents, biomass, biomaterials, and/or the like), a milling portion, an extrusion portion, and/or any other suitable portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Expanding further, in some embodiments, the portion of the waste stream (e.g., the hard plastic, soft plastic, and/or fiber) can be mixed with the additives and compressed to form, for example, a densified intermediate material, as described above. In this manner, the constituents of the separated waste stream (e.g., the constituents of the waste stream conveyed from the material classification subsystem <b>220</b>) can be combined with additives and/or portions of processed materials and processed to produce an engineered fuel feed stock, as described in further detail herein.</div>

Similarly stated, since the waste stream is substantially limited to recycling residue, the need for certain separators (e.g., the magnetic separator, the eddy current separator, and/or the glass separator) is reduced or eliminated because the waste stream includes a limited amount of constituents separated by those separators.

The first mixer <b>854</b>A can be any suitable device such as a paddled continuous mixer, a rotary continuous mixer, a screw conveyor, an auger conveyor mixer, a mechanically vibrating mixer, and/or an agitating mixer. In this manner, the first mixer <b>854</b>A can mix the hard plastics, the soft plastics, and the additives and deliver the plastics and additives to a pre-treatment mechanism <b>856</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">The pre-treatment mechanism <b>856</b> can be any suitable pre-treatment mechanism such as, for example, the pre-treatment mechanism <b>756</b> described above. The system <b>800</b> further includes a second mixer <b>854</b>B configured to receive the treated plastics and additives. Moreover, the separation subsystem <b>815</b> can be configured to deliver a portion of fibers to the second mixer <b>854</b>B such that the fibers are mixed with the treated plastics and additives. In this manner, a mixed waste stream (e.g., including the treated plastics and additives and the fibers) can be delivered to a conditioner <b>855</b>, as further described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">The conditioner <b>855</b> can be any suitable device and/or system configured to condition at least a portion of the waste stream for engineered fuel feed stock production. For example, in some embodiments, the conditioner <b>855</b> can be configured to increase the temperature of the constituents of the waste stream (e.g., the fiber and the capsulated plastics/sorbent). In some embodiments, the conditioner <b>855</b> can be configured to increase the moisture of the constituents of the waste stream.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The conditioner <b>855</b> can further be configured to deliver the conditioned waste stream and additives to a densifier <b>831</b>. The densifier <b>831</b> can be any suitable device configured to encapsulate at least a portion of the additives into the plastics and fibers. For example, in some embodiments, the densifier <b>831</b> can be an extrusion device configured to apply a relatively high pressure (e.g., compress) to the mixture (e.g., plastics, fibers, and additives) such that the additives become evenly distributed (e.g., substantially homogenous) and/or encapsulated within the plastics and fibers. Furthermore, the densifier <b>831</b> can be configured to produce a densified intermediate material. The densified intermediate material can be in the form of cubes, briquettes, pellets, honeycomb, or other suitable shapes and forms. In some embodiments, the densified intermediate material can be used as an engineered fuel feed stock in, for example, combustion power plants (e.g., coal burning power plants). In other embodiments, the densified intermediate material can be returned to the conditioner <b>855</b> such as to further incorporate the additives and/or fibers. With the desired ratio of plastics, additives, and fibers produced a blower <b>870</b> can deliver a portion of the densified intermediate material from a bunker <b>861</b> for storage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">In some embodiments, it can be desirable to reduce the size of the intermediate material. In such embodiments, the blower <b>870</b> can be configured to deliver the engineered fuel pellets to a granulator <b>832</b>. In this manner, the granulator <b>832</b> can reduce the size of the engineered fuel pellets and produce a granulated fuel feed stock. In some embodiments, the granulated fuel feed stock can be delivered to a granulated fuel bunker <b>863</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In other embodiments, it can be desirable to further reduce the size of the granulated fuel feed stock. In such embodiments, a blower <b>870</b> can deliver the granulated fuel feed stock to a pulverizer <b>833</b>. In this manner, the pulverizer <b>833</b> can reduce the size of the granulated fuel feed stock to a relatively fine fuel stock. Furthermore, a blower <b>870</b> can be configured to deliver the fuel stock powder to a powdered fuel bunker <b>865</b>. Therefore, the system <b>800</b> can be configured to produce an engineered fuel feed stock for a variety of conditions (e.g., the pelletized fuel stock, the granulated fuel stock, and/or the pulverized fuel stock).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">As described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the engineered fuel feed stock can contain any suitable ratio of sorbent.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">By way of example, a fuel production process can include passing a waste stream (e.g., hard plastics, soft plastics, and/or fibers) and additives (e.g., sorbents, biomass, biomaterials, and/or the like) through a densifier any number of times to incorporate the additive into waste material. Passing the waste stream/additive mixture through the densifier multiple times increases the temperature of the constituents to facilitate incorporation of the additive into the waste material constituents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">For example, approximately 20 wt. % of hard plastic and 80 wt. % of sorbent (e.g., hydrated lime) were mixed and passed through a pelletizer 10 times to produce densified pellets of hard plastic and sorbent in order to observe the variation in physical properties of the hard plastic and/or sorbent, and determine the required temperature to produce satisfactory fuel pellets. As indicated by the arrows NN and OO in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the mixture of the hard plastic and sorbent are shown after a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth pass through the pelletizer. As shown, the sorbent, which is a white powdery substance, is gradually incorporated after each pass through the pelletizer. As described above, the temperature of the mixture increases with each pass through the pelletizer, thus, altering the physical properties of the hard plastic and/or sorbent.
