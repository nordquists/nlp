<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for metering and outputting quantities of aerosolized substances. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention can relate to systems and methods for accurately delivering atomized drugs.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Aerosolized drugs for inhalation are considered reasonable alternatives to injections or other types of drug-delivery systems, such as intravenous delivery, subcutaneous injection, and intra-muscular. For example, insulin can be delivered by inhaling an aerosolized form, thus sparing a patient pain and inconvenience caused by subcutaneous injection of insulin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Inhaling aerosols, however, typically lacks the accuracy of injections, and so is inappropriate for use in situations where accurate dosing is critical. With aerosolized drugs, the proper amount required for delivery is often not properly metered for delivery. For example, asthma inhalers typically have an acceptable accuracy of plus or minus 25% of the nominal dose. For systemic drug delivery of insulin, on the other hand, such a level of accuracy is considered too unpredictable to allow for appropriate use, even though aerosolized delivery is much less harmful to a patient than intravenous delivery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a need exists for accurately and predictably delivering a predetermined dose of aerosolized drugs.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment comprises a variable acoustic source and a microphone, both acoustically coupled to a volume that is divided into an air region and a fluid region. A processor is configured to receive a signal from the microphone, and to determine a volume of the air region. A fluid valve is configured to allow an amount of fluid to exit the fluid region, the amount of fluid being associated with the volume of the air region. An atomizer is coupled to the fluid region, and is configured to aerosolize at least a portion of the amount of fluid.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments of the invention include systems and methods for outputting an aerosol. For purposes of this application, the term aerosol includes airflows containing particles, such as aerosolized liquids, powders, and combinations of the two. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> displays a schematic overview of a system for outputting an aerosol, according to an embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, variable acoustic source <b>101</b> and microphone <b>102</b> are acoustically coupled to chamber <b>103</b>. Volume <b>103</b> is divided into air region <b>103</b> <i>a </i>and fluid region <b>103</b> <i>b</i>. For purposes of this application, the term air includes any gas or combination of gases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Processor <b>104</b> is configured to receive a signal from microphone <b>102</b>, and to determine a volume of air region <b>103</b> <i>a</i>. Processor <b>104</b> is in communication with fluid valve <b>105</b>, and is configured to send a control signal to fluid valve <b>105</b> to open and close fluid valve <b>105</b> to allow an amount of fluid out from fluid region <b>103</b> <i>b </i>into target region <b>106</b>. The amount of fluid released into target region <b>106</b> is associated with the determined volume of air region <b>103</b> <i>a</i>. In one embodiment, chamber <b>103</b> is a fixed volume, and so the volume of fluid released into target region <b>106</b> is substantially identical to a determined change in volume of air region <b>103</b> <i>a</i>. Target region <b>106</b> is coupled to atomizer <b>107</b>, which is configured to aerosolize at least a portion of the fluid that has exited fluid region <b>103</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the system includes a second processor <b>119</b> that is configured to calculate a volume of the aerosolized fluid, and is further configured to output a volume signal associated with the calculated volume. In this embodiment, the amount of fluid allowed to enter target region <b>106</b> is associated both with the volume of air region <b>103</b> <i>a </i>and with the aerosol volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The second processor is configured to receive a signal from volume sensor <b>108</b> in communication with aerosol flow chamber <b>111</b>. Volume sensor <b>108</b> can be any combination of hardware and software configured to collect information for determining aerosol volume. For the purposes of the invention, the terms pressure, air flow and flow rate are all used interchangeably, depending on the context.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The second processor is not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and for the purposes of the invention, processor <b>104</b> and the second processor can be the same processor, or can be separate from each other. For the purposes of the invention, the term processor includes, for example, any combination of hardware, computer programs, software, firmware and digital logical processors capable of processing input, executing algorithms, and generating output as necessary to practice embodiments of the present invention. The term processor can include any combination of such processors, and may include a microprocessor, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), and state machines. Such a processor can include, or can be in communication with, a processor readable medium that stores instructions that, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to perform the steps described herein as carried out, or assisted, by a processor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">For the purposes of the invention, “processor readable medium,” or simply “medium,” includes but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or other storage or transmission devices capable of providing a processor with processor readable instructions. Other examples of suitable media include, but are not limited to, a floppy disk, CD-ROM, magnetic disk, memory chip, ROM, RAM, ASIC, configured processor, all optical media, all magnetic tape or other magnetic media, or any other medium from which a processor can read.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Target region <b>106</b> is coupled to air valve <b>109</b> and air source <b>110</b>. Processor <b>104</b> can be further configured to send a control signal to air valve <b>109</b> to open and close air valve <b>109</b>, thereby selectively exposing air source <b>110</b> to target region <b>106</b> and to atomizer <b>107</b>. Air source <b>110</b> can be a compressed air source or liquefied air source, an air source open to the atmosphere, or any air source useful for moving fluid from target region <b>106</b> to atomizer <b>107</b>, and/or for purging target region <b>106</b>. In one alternative embodiment, air source <b>110</b> may comprise a volume containing an amount of liquefied propellant gas, where air valve <b>109</b> is configured in such a way as to connect to the portion of the volume typically containing vapor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In one preferred embodiment, air source <b>110</b> is connected to target region <b>106</b> through air valve <b>109</b> in close proximity to fluid valve <b>105</b>. Thus, when air valve <b>109</b> is opened, air from air source <b>110</b> will push a substantial portion of the volume of fluid in target region <b>106</b> toward the physical gap <b>112</b> in closed volume <b>113</b> and then to atomizer <b>107</b>. Additionally, if the internal diameter of target region <b>106</b> is comparatively narrow, such as in a small bore capillary, utilizing air from air source <b>110</b> to push the volume of fluid in target region <b>106</b> toward atomizer <b>107</b> may have the additional advantages of reducing or eliminating blockage of the system, such as crystal growth, and biological contamination that could result from fluid remaining otherwise remain in target region <b>106</b> and improving accuracy of the system by ensuring that a substantial portion of the fluid exits target region <b>106</b> toward atomizer <b>107</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of a system for outputting an aerosol, according to an embodiment of the invention, in the context of aerosolized drug delivery. In this embodiment, acoustic volume sensor <b>201</b> is coupled to disposable drug cassette <b>202</b>. Pressure source <b>203</b> is coupled to acoustic volume sensor <b>201</b> to assist in outputting the drug from acoustic volume sensor <b>201</b> to disposable cassette <b>202</b>. Disposable cassette <b>202</b> includes drug reservoir <b>202</b> <i>a</i>, valve <b>202</b> <i>b </i>and atomizer <b>202</b> <i>c</i>, and is detachably coupled to acoustic volume sensor <b>201</b>. Atomizer <b>202</b> <i>c </i>can be, for example, an electro-hydrodynamic atomizer. Processor <b>204</b> is coupled to acoustic volume sensor <b>201</b> to calculate an amount of drug to output from drug reservoir <b>202</b> <i>a</i>, and to control valve <b>202</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Atomizer <b>202</b> <i>c </i>is coupled to air flow sensor system <b>205</b>. Air flow sensor system <b>205</b> can be any known system for measuring air flow or pressure of the aerosolized drug to be output to a patient. For example, air flow sensor system <b>205</b> can include an anemometer, a pin-wheel sensor, or any other sensor operable to measure air flow, flow rate or pressure. In the embodiment shown, air flow sensor system <b>205</b> is a light scatter detection system that includes light source <b>205</b> <i>a</i>, light detector <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, and pressure sensor <b>205</b> <i>c</i>.

As stated above, this system is described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/670,655, titled “Detection System and Method for Aerosol Delivery.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Processor <b>204</b> is further coupled to power <b>206</b> to power the atomizer on and off at the appropriate time. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of acoustic volume sensors that can be used with three embodiments of the invention. In each embodiment, the chamber has volume V<b>1</b>, and is acoustically coupled to port M<b>1</b> to form an acoustic system. Microphone <b>301</b> (or other suitable acousto-electrical transducer) and an acoustic source <b>302</b>, such as a speaker, (or other suitable electro-acoustical transducer) are acoustically coupled to this acoustic system. The electrical output of the microphone is placed in communication with electrical input of acoustic source <b>302</b>, in such a way that the amplitude and phase relationships of the signals promote acoustic resonance of the system. A measurement of a quantity related to the system's resonant frequency can permit determination of the chamber volume, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,852, incorporated herein in its entirety. Such a resonance frequency measurement can be achieved in a processor. Alternatively, an additional chamber of known volume, configured with a port in a manner similar to one of the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may be employed to produce a resonance, and a quantity related to the resonant frequency may be measured. This can, in turn, lead to a determination of the relevant volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>(<b>1</b>), microphone <b>301</b> is placed within the chamber, and acoustic source <b>302</b> forms a portion of the wall of the chamber. Because the resonance determination does not require that the chamber be sealed in the fashion required for acoustic-pressure type systems, the transducers employed in these embodiments do not need to be located in the chamber forming part of the system. It is necessary only that the transducers be acoustically coupled to the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>(<b>2</b>) and <b>3</b>(<b>3</b>) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a second volume V<b>2</b> is associated with the system and is coupled to volume V<b>1</b> via port M<b>1</b>. In each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> (<b>2</b>) and <b>3</b>(<b>3</b>), acoustic source <b>302</b> forms a portion of the wall of volume V<b>2</b>, and can be, for example, a piezoelectric speaker. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>(<b>2</b>), microphone <b>301</b>, which can be, for example, of the velocity type, forms a part of the wall between volumes V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b>, and responds only to differences in pressure between the two volumes; because the pressure difference between the two volumes tends to be near zero at frequencies below the frequency of natural resonance of the system, noise in microphone <b>301</b> is effectively canceled out. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>(<b>3</b>), microphone <b>301</b> is disposed in volume V<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram of an acoustic volume sensor according to an embodiment of the invention.

First microphone <b>404</b> is acoustically coupled to first volume <b>401</b>, and second microphone <b>405</b> is acoustically coupled to second volume <b>402</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Printed circuit board <b>403</b> contains an acoustic source, which can be, for example, a piezoelectric speaker. In one embodiment, one or both of first microphone <b>404</b> and second microphone <b>405</b> is attached to printed circuit board <b>403</b>. Printed circuit board <b>403</b> can include, in one embodiment, an inner layer configured to pass electrical signals. Printed circuit board <b>403</b> is coupled to acoustic volume sensor enclosure <b>400</b> in a way that forms a substantially air-tight seal. In one embodiment, printed circuit board <b>403</b> includes a hole to equalize pressure between the first volume and the second volume. In this embodiment, the hole is small enough so as to not adversely impact the acoustic qualities of the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">First microphone <b>404</b> and second microphone <b>405</b> are coupled to a processor (not shown). This processor is configured to receive a signal from the microphones, and is further configured to determine a volume of the variable-volume chamber based on the received signals. In one embodiment, the processor is contained on printed circuit board <b>403</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Second volume <b>402</b> is coupled to third volume <b>407</b> via port <b>408</b> in such a way as to create an acoustic system including second microphone <b>405</b> and acoustic source <b>406</b>.

Air portion <b>407</b> <i>a </i>can contain air, or can contain any suitable gas for creating an acoustic resonance for volume determination. Fluid portion <b>407</b> <i>b </i>can include any fluid, including medicine, ink, or any fluid for which a volume measurement is desired. In one embodiment, air portion <b>407</b> <i>a </i>is separated from fluid portion <b>407</b> <i>b </i>by a diaphragm <b>409</b>. Diaphragm <b>409</b> is configured to allow for a volume measurement of air portion <b>407</b> <i>a</i>. Fluid portion <b>407</b> <i>b </i>of third volume <b>407</b> includes fluid output fitting <b>410</b> for allowing fluid to escape from fluid volume <b>407</b> <i>b </i>in a controlled way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The basic theory behind the acoustic volume sensor according to an embodiment of the invention is that two chambers of air separated by a relatively small tube of air will resonate at a specific frequency when provided with an impulse to either of the air chambers or to the air in the tube that connects the chambers. The resultant resonant frequency is related to the volumes of the chambers, the tube dimensions and miscellaneous parameters of the gas that is used as a medium within the resonator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">To ensure a resonance exists as described by the basic theory, some assumptions may be used. First, the wavelength associated with the resonant frequency should be significantly larger than any of the critical dimensions of the resonator. Typically, the free-space wavelength associated with an acoustic wave of the resonant frequency should be approximately 20 times larger than the diameter of the chambers, and also of the length and diameter of the tube. This assumption provides that the air pressure within a given chamber is approximately uniform throughout the volume and that the air in the tube is also at a uniform pressure. Resonators having resonant frequencies with wavelengths less than 20 times the critical dimensions can be designed with acceptable behavior. The applicability of the assumptions, however, and the relevance of the theory will be diminished as the wavelength is decreased (or, conversely, the resonant frequency is increased) for a given resonator design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Second, the energy lost from the resonator should be kept small so that the resonator will be underdamped. The resonator is modeled as a second-order system and the corresponding losses (damping) should be kept small so that the resonance can be readily observed. No widely accepted “rules of thumb” exist to determine the acceptability of various losses. Furthermore, no extensive studies have been performed to determine, without experimentation, the degree of losses that are expected for a given resonator geometry. Most of the losses are believed to be the result of viscous losses to the walls of the tube as the air traverses the tube's length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Finally, at all frequencies of interest, the acoustic processes should be adiabatic. In other words, the acoustic processes should occur at a rate sufficient to keep heat energy from either leaving the system or equilibrating with the surrounding media. For the purposes of this document, acoustic processes at audible frequencies are always considered to be adiabatic.</div>

This is repeated until the system finds the frequencies for which the phase difference straddles 90 degrees. Linear interpolation can then be used to calculate the system's resonant frequency.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The signal processing techniques described above can be performed using amplitude ratios instead of resonances. This technique does not specifically require the presence of an acoustic port, although with standard electronics, amplitude measurements typically lack the accuracy and precision of phase measurements. With newer, higher performance analog to digital converters and digital signal processors, amplitude ratio measurements can be an accurate substitute.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is an embodiment of the invention that does not require the presence of an acoustic port. Variable volume <b>1501</b> can be measured by driving the speaker sinusoidally and measuring the ratio of the amplitudes at microphone <b>1503</b> and microphone <b>1504</b>. Given that the speaker is a displacement device, the pressure increase in the variable volume will be proportional to the pressure decrease in reference volume <b>1505</b>. When reference volume <b>1505</b> and variable volume <b>1501</b> are equal, both microphones output the same signal level and are 180 degrees out of phase (assuming identical microphones). If the variable volume is one half the size of the reference volume, the output from microphone <b>1504</b> is twice that of microphone since, for the same speaker displacement, the acoustic pressure change in variable volume <b>1501</b> (as a portion of its nominal value) is twice as large as the change in the reference volume. The relationship is true as long as the drive frequency for the speaker produces an acoustic wavelength much longer than any of the volumes' dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The above amplitude ratio technique is also useful when implementing an acoustic volume sensor with an acoustic port. At frequencies much less than the resonances of the system, the acoustic port becomes effectively transparent (as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), and the “fixed” and “variable” volumes cannot be distinguished. This embodiment can be considered a low-frequency approximation of acoustic volume sensing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">At frequencies much higher than the system resonances, the acoustic port's impedance becomes significant and no acoustic energy passes from the port into the variable volume, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. At such frequencies, the ratio of the amplitudes between microphone <b>1701</b> and <b>1702</b> is fixed, and is independent of the variable volume (ratio=reference volume/fixed volume).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a flow chart of a signal processing technique using amplitude ratio measurements, according to an embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, at step <b>1801</b>, the speaker is set into sinusoidal oscillations at a fixed frequency. If an acoustic port is present, the frequency used can be much less than the resonant frequency of the acoustic volume sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">At step <b>1802</b>, the amplitudes output from the two microphones are measured. If desired, the phase of the two outputs can be confirmed to be 180 degrees out of phase. At step <b>1803</b>, the variable volume is calculated using the equation volume=reference volume*(reference microphone amplitude/front microphone amplitude).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">If desired, one can cycle through multiple frequencies to confirm the volume measurement. The measurement should be independent of frequency, the presence of air bubbles within the variable fluid volume, or other “acoustic leaks” or microphone or electronics errors that may be detected.</div>
