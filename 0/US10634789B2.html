<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">When in flight, the trajectory of a projectile fired from a weapon into the atmosphere at an intended target is affected by ballistic factors including temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, air friction (drag), inclination angle, Coriolis drift due to latitude, air movement (wind), and the like. A crosswind is a wind moving across the projectile's trajectory and pushing against the projectile; causing the projectile to deviate from its current trajectory, for example to a side. At longer target ranges, crosswind effects on a projectile must be taken into account. As crosswinds may vary in speed at different points along the projectile's planned trajectory, compensating for crosswind effects normally requires estimations/measurements to be made at different ranges between the weapon and the intended target and an average crosswind speed to be calculated to properly account for cumulative crosswind effects on the projectile. Crosswind speeds are often estimated by manual, visual observations made by a weapon operator and/or an assistant target spotter and then an adjustment (a target offset) is made to a weapon point-of-aim using a weapon's sights and/or physical adjustment of the weapon's direction-of-aim in order to correct for estimated crosswind effects on a fired projectile. Manual observation accuracy is affected by training, experience, and/or skills of a weapon operator/spotter. Inaccurate observations/estimations can introduce unacceptable error into offset calculations and result in a projectile missing a target.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">This disclosure generally describes methods and systems for measuring crosswind speed by optical measurement of laser scintillation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. By measuring movement of scintillation patterns along a path between an origin and destination, a cumulative crosswind speed measurement can be calculated. An example application includes providing a ballistic solution for a projectile along with a provided crosswind-corrective offset applied to enhance the likelihood that the projectile will impact an intended target. Various modifications to the disclosed implementations will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from scope of the disclosure. Thus, the present disclosure is not intended to be limited only to the described and/or illustrated implementations, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Laser Radiation Scattering</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles smaller than the wavelength of light. For example, ambient light and/or a laser of sufficient power fired through a medium such as the atmosphere, gas, water, liquid, etc. causes atoms/molecules of gas/liquid to move at the same frequency of the laser radiation and become a small radiating dipole scattering the laser radiation. Similarly, Mie scattering results when roughly spherical particles approximately the size of the wavelength of the laser radiation, for example microscopic liquid droplets, particulates, dust, pollen, smoke, and the like, scatter the laser radiation when exposed to the laser.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Atmospheric Turbulence</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Based at least partially on Kolmogorov's theory of 1941, it is known that temperature gradients in a gas or liquid cause the formation of small turbulent cells (or “eddies”) of varying density. The eddies act as lenses and prisms to diffract/refract electromagnetic radiation passing through them causing modulations in apparent intensity of the radiation (or “scintillation”). Although the temperature gradients/intensity modulations are small for a given volume of gas/liquid, the cumulative effect of applied electromagnetic radiation, for example from a laser transmitter, passing through many moving eddies over a long distance is measureable by one or more receivers that detect and measure over time an eddy-caused scintillation pattern of Rayleigh/Mie scattered laser radiation along a path from an illumination laser transmitter to a particular target and/or scattered from the particular target. As eddies drift from gas/liquid current through a laser path, an associated scintillation pattern created by the eddies moves as well. A change in a scintillation pattern is measured and the measurement converted into a cumulative weighted average crosswind/crosscurrent speed for the entire path to the particular target for use in measuring a crosswind-corrective/crosscurrent-corrective offset.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram <b>100</b> illustrating a principle of operation of an example crosswind calculation system (CCS) <b>102</b> unit in air according to an implementation. In some implementations, the CCS <b>102</b> includes a laser transmitter <b>104</b> and two receivers <b>106</b> <i>a</i>/<b>106</b> <i>b</i>. An illumination laser <b>108</b> is transmitted from laser transmitter <b>104</b> and impacts target <b>110</b> resulting laser radiation from along the laser path and scattered laser radiation <b>112</b> reflecting back toward receivers <b>106</b> <i>a</i>/<b>106</b> <i>b </i>and through atmospheric eddies <b>114</b>. The atmospheric eddies <b>114</b> diffract/refract the laser radiation and form a scintillation pattern in air as the atmospheric eddies <b>114</b> are moved by wind <b>116</b>. Turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example scintillation pattern <b>200</b> created by atmospheric eddies <b>114</b> diffracting/refracting scattered laser radiation <b>112</b> according to an implementation. Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cumulative intensity of the moving scintillation pattern is detected using “snapshots” of a series of scintillation pattern frames recorded simultaneously by each of receivers <b>106</b> <i>a</i>/<b>106</b> <i>b</i>. Each frame provides data indicating an apparent intensity of the scattered laser radiation <b>112</b> varying with respect to time for each receiver <b>106</b> <i>a</i>/<b>106</b> <i>b </i>(see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> below).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The laser transmitter <b>104</b> is coupled with appropriate optics for illumination laser <b>108</b> focusing and transmission. The illumination laser <b>108</b> is used to illuminate a target. In some implementations, a target can include a gas/liquid, for example air/water, at a desired distance. In some implementations, the laser can operate in a continuous or pulsed mode. A continuously operating laser transmitter <b>104</b> can provide real-time, continuous crosswind speed calculations while a pulsed laser transmitter <b>104</b> can provide intermittent, as-needed crosswind speed calculations. In addition, if a laser is pulsed and receivers are gated, a given segment of distance between the laser source and the atmosphere at the distance can be measured. For example, crosswind speed can be measured in a segment of 100-120 m from the laser source. Next, a segment 120-140 m can be measured. In this manner, the average crosswind to each segment can be determined and the particular segment crosswinds also determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations, the laser transmitter emission axis <b>104</b> is bore sighted parallel to the detection axis of the receivers <b>106</b> <i>a</i>/<b>106</b> <i>b</i>. In other implementations, the laser transmitter <b>104</b> emission axis is placed at an angle to the detection axis of the receivers <b>106</b> <i>a</i>/<b>106</b> <i>b</i>. In some implementations, the CCS <b>102</b> does not include a laser transmitter <b>104</b> and instead depends upon sufficient ambient or other light sources to provide necessary illumination to detect atmospheric eddies between the CCS <b>102</b> and a target. For example, for daytime use, sunlight can provide sufficient illumination for scintillation pattern detection. In some implementations, other sufficient light sources may include high-intensity flood lights, security lights, flashlights, headlights, scattered illumination, targeting, and/or other laser light, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Typically each receiver <b>106</b> <i>a</i>/<b>106</b> <i>b </i>is made up of one photodiode coupled with appropriate optics for focusing a separate received scintillation pattern image on the photodiode. The cumulative intensity of the light of the received scintillation pattern is converted by the photodiode into either current or voltage, depending on a photodiode mode of operation, which can then be analyzed in order to determine the individual scintillation pattern light intensity. In this manner, each photodiode can be considered as a single-pixel receiver in that it receives a scintillation pattern and converts the received scintillation pattern into a single data point measuring cumulative light intensity of the scintillation pattern. Known spacing between and a size of receivers <b>106</b> <i>a</i>/<b>106</b> <i>b </i>are factored into detection/calculation software allowing each receiver to detect a particular scintillation pattern intensity and for the CCS <b>102</b> to compare multiple intensity determinations over time in order to further determine whether the scintillation pattern is moving, a direction of movement, a speed of movement, and a cumulative weighted average crosswind speed for the entire path to the particular target. The minimum number of receivers is one, but two or more receivers or one or more receivers with multiple photodiodes may be used to enhance crosswind calculation accuracy as well as provide multi-axis scintillation pattern movement determinations. Other receiver implementations can include multiple photodiodes and/or single photodiodes. In some instances, optics can be used to focus light on particular detector areas of a photodiode. In these instances, the use of the optics can allow the simulation of multiple individual/grouped photodiodes. For example, a quadrant detector (or simulated quadrant detector) can be used in some implementations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates example scintillation pattern frame snapshots <b>300</b> of a moving scintillation pattern for two receivers according to an implementation. As illustrated, each receiver <b>106</b> <i>a</i>/<b>106</b> <i>b </i>receives a separate image of a scintillation pattern in each of frames <b>304</b> <i>a</i>, <b>304</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>304</b> <i>c </i>and each scintillation pattern image is converted into light intensity data. The scintillation pattern is illustrated as moving from right-to-left (as viewed from the front of the CCS <b>102</b>) from receiver <b>106</b> <i>a </i>to receiver <b>106</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example plot <b>400</b> of received light intensity per receiver over time according to an implementation as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The plotted intensity shows that the peak intensity of the moving scintillation pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> first passes through receiver <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and then receiver <b>106</b> <i>b</i>. Using the plotted determined intensity data, the CCS <b>102</b> can determine that the scintillation pattern is moving from right to left. Additionally, given the spacing between receivers and size of the receivers, the CCS <b>102</b> can determine speed of movement and calculate a crosswind speed average. In some implementations, a simple calculation can be performed where a time delay between the signal of receiver <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> <i>b </i>can be divided by a time it took the moving scintillation pattern to move a known distance between the receivers. Given an example closest distance between the receivers <b>106</b> <i>a</i>/<b>106</b> <i>b </i>of 18 mm, the scintillation pattern is illustrated to have taken approximately 8 ms to move the 18 mm. The calculated example average crosswind speed would be 2.25 m/s or 5.0 mph. In other implementations, a cross-covariance (i.e., the similarity between two signals) of the two received scintillation pattern intensities is computed providing a more robust and accurate weighted average crosswind speed along the entire path from the CCS <b>102</b> to an intended target. In the case of a quadrant detector, a Greenwood frequency is calculated from measured light intensity data and the crosswind speed then derived.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref> illustrate exemplary CCS <b>102</b> receiver configurations according to various implementations <b>500</b> <i>a</i>-<b>500</b> <i>d</i>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates an implementation of a CCS <b>102</b> with a single receiver <b>502</b> <i>a</i>. In one implementation, the receiver <b>502</b> <i>a </i>is used in conjunction with a laser transmitter <b>104</b> emission axis where the angle between the laser transmitter <b>104</b> and the detection axis of the receiver <b>502</b> <i>a </i>is varied by moving either the laser transmitter <b>104</b> or the receiver <b>502</b> <i>a</i>. In one implementation, the laser transmitter <b>104</b> is movable. In this implementation, as an emitted illumination laser <b>108</b> crosses the receiver <b>502</b> <i>a</i>'s field-of-view, a scintillation pattern is created and received by the receiver <b>502</b> <i>a</i>. The known angle of the illumination laser <b>108</b> to the receiver <b>502</b> <i>a </i>is used as a data point in determining the distance from the receiver <b>502</b> <i>a </i>and for subsequent calculations of the crosswind at that distance. Other variations include two receivers <b>502</b> <i>a</i>/<b>502</b> <i>b </i>with a wider illumination laser <b>108</b> beam that covers both receiver fields-of-view simultaneously or the illumination laser <b>108</b> being configured to cross each receiver's field-of-view at a slightly different distance due to the laser transmitter <b>104</b> emission axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In another implementation, a receiver <b>502</b> <i>a </i>detection axis can be moved to vary its angle with respect to a fixed emission axis of the laser transmitter <b>104</b>. For example, assume an (X, Y) coordinate system where the X-axis is an illumination laser <b>108</b> placed at (−100, 0) and is firing toward higher values of X and a receiver <b>106</b> is placed at (0, −100) and faces toward higher Y values. If the receiver <b>106</b> is rocked from points (−10, 0), (0, 0), and (10, 0), scintillation patterns can be detected at each point along the path of the illumination laser <b>108</b>. In these implementations, the laser transmitter <b>104</b> and/or receiver <b>502</b> <i>a </i>can be moved using, for example, electric motors, mechanical methods, hydraulics, and/or other suitable methods.</div>

The illustrated quadrant receiver <b>502</b> <i>d </i>is divided into four separate photodetectors A-D, for example photodiodes, arranged in a multi-axis configuration and separated by a small distance where each photodetector detects an intensity of light falling on the particular photodiode. For example, each pair of photodetectors A-B and D-C can provide one axis of crosswind directional movement detection similar to the implementation described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Likewise, photodetector pairs A-D and B-C can provide a perpendicular axis of crosswind directional movement detection. Combined, a single quadrant detector can provide the same dual-axis functionality as the implementation described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. In another implementation, the four quadrants can be used as two halves or in any other suitable configuration of the quadrants, including vertical, horizontal, and an ‘X’ pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In other implementations, each photodetector can also be subdivided using optics to allow/restrict illumination of a portion of the photodetector. For example, optics with diaphragms can be used to allow/restrict illumination of the portions of the photodetector. In this manner, each single photodetector can be used to simulate multiple photodetector, for example a quadrant detector. In this implementation, for example, quadrant receiver <b>502</b> <i>d </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> could be a single photodiode. Optics could then be used to create the A, B, C, and D quadrant configuration or any other number of distinguishable illuminated portions of the photodetector, including 2, 3, or 4 portions.</div>

In another example, the principles could be used to determine crosswind speeds/patterns prior to and during fireworks displays to determine if wind/atmospheric conditions are safe for the use of fireworks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref> illustrates the application <b>1000</b> <i>d </i>of CCS <b>102</b> technology to provide crosswind speed calculations of a field of crops. Winds over the field of crops affect, for example, pollen transfer, pesticide/fertilizer distribution, pest dispersion, irrigation water dispersion, humidity conditions, and the like. A CCS <b>102</b> system(s) can be placed in the field of crops and used to determine crosswinds. Knowing the crosswinds over the field of crops can permit more accurate fertilizer and pesticide dispersion, more efficient irrigation, predictive pollination studies, and the like. It should be noted that the illumination lasers <b>108</b> <i>a</i>-<b>108</b> <i>c </i>do not need to be aimed at a specific reflecting target and may just be transmitted into the air. In other implementations, the same principles could be applied to wind turbine farms (e.g., to provide similar and/or complementary data to that discussed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) for golf courses, large lawns, and predictive dispersal of pollution, toxic chemicals, bio-agents, and/or radiation plumes from nuclear accidents. In another example, the CCS technology could be used to determine winds ahead of a water-going vessel to better adjust sails and/or be prepared for wind changes or to gauge flow in industrial pipes/pipelines to provide flow control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In other implementations, a CCS <b>102</b> system can be coupled with a laser range finder (LRF) to provide laser ranging of a target and crosswind speed analysis simultaneously. Coupling can be accomplished by wired, wireless, and/or other suitable connections between the LRF and the CCS <b>102</b> system. A LRF can be coupled with any of the CCS implementations described herein. For example, for shooting sports, a shooter could use the combined instrument to simultaneously determine a range to a target and crosswind. Likewise, the described combined instrument could be used in sports such as golf to assist a player with determining a range to a hole and factoring in winds for a golf hit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">In other implementations, the CCS <b>102</b> system can include and provide integrated LRF functionality. For example, the illumination laser <b>108</b> or an alignment laser can be used in conjunction with included LRF application software and/or hardware (not illustrated) to provide the integrated LRF functionality. In some implementations, two or more of the illumination laser <b>108</b> and/or alignment lasers can be used to provide, for example, increased LRF accuracy and range. Integrated LRF functionality can be coupled with any of the CCS implementations described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In another implementation, the CCS <b>102</b> system can provide data to an automated weapon system. The weapon system can include computers, servers, platforms, electric motors/servo-mechanisms and associated components to provide multi-axis movement, and/or the like. For example, the CCS-system-provided ballistic and/or crosswind speed measurement data can be used by the automated weapon system to automatically aim a weapon at a target and/or track a target with a weapon. In some implementations, the weapon can also be automatically fired by the automated weapon system responsive to data provided by the CCS <b>102</b> system. Another implementation could include the CCS-system-provided ballistic and/or crosswind speed measurement data used to physically adjust the zero of a weapon sighting device to account for the effects of the data on a projectile, thus saving a weapon operator from making sighting device adjustments and/or holding based on provided offset/windage values.</div>
