<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/591,590, filed on Jan. 7, 2015, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/303,798, filed on Nov. 23, 2011 now U.S. Pat. No. 9,350,005, issued May 24, 2016, which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-187781 filed on Aug. 30, 2011, and contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-192227 filed on Aug. 30, 3010, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">A lithium ion secondary battery generally has a configuration in which carbon, a lithium-transition metal complex oxide, and a mixture of carbonate esters are used for the negative electrode, the positive electrode, and an electrolytic solution, respectively. Since carbonate ester used for the electrolytic solution is not easily oxidized or reduced by water or other organic solvents, and can obtain a higher voltage, the lithium ion secondary battery has a higher energy density and a higher capacity than a nickel-hydrogen battery, which is an aqueous battery. Therefore, the lithium ion secondary battery is widely distributed as a secondary battery for notebook-type personal computers, mobile phones, video cameras, and digital still cameras.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Since a laminate-type lithium ion secondary battery in which a laminate film, such as an aluminum laminate film, is used for an exterior has a light weight and a large energy density, which results from a large fraction of an active material in the battery, the laminate-type lithium ion secondary battery is widely used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the laminate-type lithium ion secondary battery has a weaker strength than a battery covered with a metal can, the voltage applied to a battery element becomes weak. Therefore, when the electrode is expanded and shrunk due to repetition of charging and discharging of the battery, there is a problem in that the inter-electrode distance between the positive electrode and the negative electrode becomes uneven due to the above fact, and thus the ion conductivity and the electric current density become uneven, whereby the capacity is degraded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">With respect to this problem, a technology in which the inter-electrode distance is kept constant by providing a resin having an adhering force between the positive electrode and the negative electrode, and degradation of the capacity due to repetition of charging and discharging is suppressed has been suggested.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, Japanese Patent No. 4099969 describes a battery in which a porous resin is formed on the surface of an electrode by floating a porous endothermic insulating resin in the electrode on the surface of the electrode by spinodal decomposition or a micelle method.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in a battery having a configuration in which a porous resin manufactured using spinodal decomposition is disposed between the electrodes, a polymer material having the optimal material kind and composition should be used as a material of the porous resin. That is, when a polymer material having the optimal material kind and composition is not used as a material of the porous resin, since the optimal porosity is not obtained, the ion conductivity is degraded, and battery characteristics are degraded. In addition, since the adhesiveness between the electrodes is degraded, and the inter-electrode distance becomes uneven due to repetition of charging and discharging, the capacity is degraded due to repetition of charging and discharging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, it is desirable to provide a non-aqueous electrolyte battery in which degradation of the ion conductivity can be suppressed, and degradation of the capacity due to repetition of charging and discharging can be suppressed, a method of manufacturing the non-aqueous electrolyte battery, an insulating material, a method of manufacturing the insulating material, a battery pack, an electronic device, an electromotive vehicle, a power storage apparatus, and an electric power system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">One non-limiting aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a battery including a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and an electrolytic solution holding layer between the positive electrode and the negative electrode. The electrolytic solution holding layer includes a porous polymer compound, and an electrolytic solution is held in the porous polymer compound.

The average molecular weight of the vinylidene fluoride polymer is 500,000 or more to less than 1.5 million, and the air permeability of the porous polymer compound is 500 seconds/100 cc or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Another non-limiting aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a separator including a base material and a porous polymer compound formed on at least one surface of the base material. The porous polymer compound is adapted to hold an electrolytic solution in pores. The material of the porous polymer compound includes a vinylidene fluoride polymer selected from the group consisting of (1) a vinylidene fluoride homopolymer and (2) a copolymer including a vinylidene fluoride monomer unit and a hexafluoropropylene monomer unit. The average molecular weight of the vinylidene fluoride polymer is 500,000 or more to less than 1.5 million, and the air permeability of the porous polymer compound is 500 seconds/100 cc or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Another non-limiting aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a battery pack including a battery, a controlling section that controls the battery, and an exterior that covers the battery. The battery includes a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and an electrolytic solution holding layer between the positive electrode and the negative electrode. The electrolytic solution holding layer includes a porous polymer compound, and an electrolytic solution is held in the porous polymer compound. The porous polymer compound includes a vinylidene fluoride polymer selected from the group consisting of (1) a vinylidene fluoride homopolymer and (2) a copolymer including a vinylidene fluoride monomer unit and a hexafluoropropylene monomer unit. The average molecular weight of the vinylidene fluoride polymer is 500,000 or more to less than 1.5 million, and the air permeability of the porous polymer compound is 500 seconds/100 cc or less.</div>

Thereby, favorable ion conductivity, and favorable adhesiveness between the positive electrode and the negative electrode can be obtained.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The non-aqueous electrolyte battery mainly accommodates the wound electrode body <b>30</b>, to which a positive electrode lead <b>31</b> and a negative electrode lead <b>32</b> are attached, in a film-shaped exterior member <b>40</b>. This battery structure in which the film-shaped exterior member <b>40</b> is used is called a laminate film type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The positive electrode <b>31</b> and the negative electrode <b>32</b> are drawn out in the same direction, for example, from the inside of the exterior member <b>40</b> to the outside. The positive electrode lead <b>31</b> is composed of, for example, a metallic material, such as aluminum, and the negative electrode lead <b>32</b> is composed of, for example, a metallic material, such as copper, nickel, and stainless steel. These metallic materials have, for example, a thin plate shape or a netlike shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The exterior member <b>40</b> is composed of an aluminum laminate film in which a nylon film, an aluminum foil, and a polyethylene film are bonded in this order. The exterior member <b>40</b> has a configuration in which, for example, two sheets of rectangular aluminum laminate films are thermally fused or mutually adhered using an adhesive at the outer circumferential portions so that the polyethylene film surfaces the wound electrode body <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Adhering films <b>41</b> are inserted between the exterior member <b>40</b> and the positive electrode <b>31</b> and the negative electrode <b>32</b> in order to prevent intrusion of external air. The adhering film <b>41</b> is composed of a material having adhesiveness with respect to the positive electrode lead <b>31</b> and the negative electrode lead <b>32</b>.

Provision of the insulating layer <b>39</b> between the positive electrode <b>33</b> and the negative electrode <b>34</b> increases the adhesiveness between the positive electrode <b>33</b> and the negative electrode <b>34</b> so as to suppress the inter-electrode distance from becoming uneven due to repetition of charging and discharging.

The fired organic polymer compound refers to a phenol resin, a furan resin, and the like which are fired at an appropriate temperature so as to be carbonized. Carbon materials are preferred since the change of the crystal structure according to absorption and discharging of lithium is extremely small, and therefore a high energy density is obtained, and excellent cycle characteristics are obtained, and, furthermore, carbon materials act as a conducting agent.

In contrast to this, when the charge density of carbon element is increased, for example, when carbon is bonded with a metal element or semimetal element, the C1s peak appears in a range lower than 284.5 eV.

Next, the separator <b>35</b> coated with the solution is immersed in a second solvent which is compatible with the polar organic solvent, such as water, ethyl alcohol, and propyl alcohol, and is a poor solvent with respect to the polymer material.

The server <b>213</b> may be managed by any of the house <b>201</b>, an electric power company, and a service provider. The information sent by the server <b>213</b> is, for example, power consumption information, life pattern information, electric power fees, weather information, natural disaster information, or information concerning electricity transactions. This information may be sent and received by a power consumption apparatus in a house (for example, a television receiver), but also may be sent and received by an apparatus in a house (for example, a mobile phone or the like).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0397" num="0396">On the other hand, in Sample 1-1, Sample 1-5, Sample 1-9, and Sample 1-13, since the weight average molecular weight of the polymer compound was smaller than the optimal value, or 500,000, the separation strength between the negative electrode and the separator was degraded, whereby the capacity retention rate after the 300<sup>th </sup>cycle was degraded.

This is because, like Sample 1-10 shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 21</figref>, when the mass composition ratio of the vinylidene fluoride polymer, or vinylidene fluoride monomer units:hexafluoropropylene monomer units, was outside a range of 100:0 to 95:5, the porous polymer compound excessively swelled during heat pressing, and therefore the pore structure was collapsed, and the pores were closed. In addition, in Sample 1-9 to Sample 1-12, since the degree of swelling of the vinylidene fluoride polymer was excessively increased, and the vinylidene fluoride polymer was dissolved in the electrolytic solution, the capacity retention rate after the 300<sup>th </sup>cycle was also degraded.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0430" num="0429">As shown in Table 2, with the mass ratio of the vinylidene fluoride polymer and the alumina in a range of 1:0 to 1:8, the “separation strength between the negative electrode and the separator” was 5 N/m or more, and the capacity retention rate after 300 cycles was also 80% or more, which was preferable. On the other hand, when the mass ratio of the vinylidene fluoride polymer and the alumina became 1:10, there was a tendency that the separation strength between the negative electrode and the separator also became 2 N/m, and the capacity retention rate after 300 cycles was also degraded to 55%. In addition, it could be confirmed that as the fraction of the alumina was increased in the mass ratio of the vinylidene fluoride polymer and the alumina, the duration, in which leaked electric current was observed with float charging at 60° C. and 4.25 V, was increased and the float resistance was also improved. In consideration of the above facts, a conclusion was made that, in the electrolytic solution holding layer, the inorganic particles may be added to the vinylidene fluoride polymer, and, in this case, the mass ratio of the vinylidene fluoride polymer to the inorganic particles is preferably in a range of 1:1 to 1:8, and more preferably in a range of 1:2 to 1:6.</div>

<heading id="h-0024">An Example of Variation</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0431" num="0430">The technology is not limited to the above embodiments of the technology, and a variety of variations or applications are allowed within the scope of the gist of the technology. For example, the above embodiments and examples described batteries having the laminate film-type battery structure, batteries having a wound structure in which electrodes are wound, and stack-type batteries having a laminate structure in which electrodes are laminated, but the technology is not limited thereto. For example, the technology can also be applied to batteries and the like having electrode structures or battery structures other than the above battery structure or electrode structure. The non-aqueous electrolyte battery of the second embodiment may have a configuration in which the positive electrode lead <b>53</b> and the negative electrode lead <b>54</b> are drawn out from the same side may be employed. The non-aqueous electrolyte battery of the third embodiment may have a configuration in which the positive electrode lead <b>53</b> and the negative electrode lead <b>54</b> are drawn out from mutually facing sides. In addition, the second embodiment has a configuration in which the outermost layer of the battery element <b>60</b> forms the separator <b>63</b>, but may have a configuration in which the outermost layer forms the positive electrode <b>61</b> or the negative electrode <b>62</b>. In addition, the second embodiment may have a configuration in which one outermost layer of the battery element <b>60</b> forms the separator <b>63</b>, and the other outermost layer forms the positive electrode <b>61</b> or the negative electrode <b>62</b>. The third embodiment has a configuration in which the outermost layer of the battery element <b>90</b> forms the negative electrode <b>62</b>, but may have a configuration in which the outermost layer forms the separator <b>63</b> or the positive electrode <b>61</b>. In addition, the third embodiment may have a configuration in which one outermost layer of the battery element <b>90</b> forms the separator <b>63</b>, and the other outermost layer forms the positive electrode <b>61</b> or the negative electrode <b>62</b>. The configuration of the laminate film <b>52</b> in the second and third embodiments may be applied to the exterior member <b>40</b> in the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0432" num="0431">In the above second and third embodiments and the examples of variation thereof, a porous polymer compound layer may be provided between the battery element <b>60</b> and the laminate film <b>52</b>. The porous polymer compound layer is configured by holding a non-aqueous electrolytic solution in a polymer material. A polymer material including vinylidene fluoride as a component is used as the polymer material. Specific examples that can be preferably used include polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF), copolymers including vinylidene fluoride (VdF) and hexafluoropropylene (HFP) as repeating units, copolymers including vinylidene fluoride (VdF), hexafluoropropylene (HFP), and chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) as repeating units, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0433" num="0432">When polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) is used as the polymer material that composes the porous polymer compound layer, it is preferable to use polyvinylidene fluoride having a weight average molecular weight of 500,000 or more to 1.5 million or less. This is because the effect of suppressing the movement of the battery element is high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0434" num="0433">In addition, inorganic particles may be mixed into the porous polymer compound layer. The strength of the porous polymer compound layer is improved, and recesses and protrusions are generated on the porous polymer compound layer so that deviation between the battery element and the laminate film can be suppressed. Therefore, an increase in the internal resistance can be further suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0435" num="0434">The inorganic particles include metallic oxides, metallic nitrides, metallic carbides, and the like, all of which have electrical insulating properties. The metallic oxides that can be preferably used include alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), magnesia (MgO), titania (TiO<sub>2</sub>), zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), and the like. The metallic nitrides that can be preferably used include silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), aluminum nitride (AlN), boron nitride (BN), titanium nitride (TiN), and the like. The metallic carbides that can be preferably used include silicon carbide (SiC), boron carbide (B<sub>4</sub>C), and the like. These inorganic particles may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds. In addition, since the inorganic particles are excellent in terms of heat resistance and oxidation resistance, the effect of suppressing the movement of the battery element is not impaired even during an increase in the battery temperature, which is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0436" num="0435">It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.</div>
