<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a fabrication method for such semiconductor device. In particular, the present invention relates to a semiconductor device having a super junction Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) structure, and a fabrication method for such semiconductor device.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">When a MOS Field Effect Transistor (FET) is composed in a bridge circuit, three power loss reductions are required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The first power loss is on-state power loss. The on-state power loss is a power loss associated with current flowing through a channel of the MOSFET, and reduction of the on resistance of the MOSFET is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The second power loss is a switching power loss associated with turn-on switching. In order to reduce the switching power loss associated with the turn-on switching, it is required that a turn-on switching time period should be shortened by increasing a gate sensitivity of the MOSFET and reducing an amount of gate charge Qg needed for the turn-on switching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The third power loss is a switching power loss associated with the turn-off switching, and is called “through loss”. In order to reduce the through loss, it is required that the turn-off switching time should be shortened by shortening Reverse Recovery Time trr of the MOSFET.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a MOSFET of planar structure as a semiconductor device related to a conventional example includes: a high resistivity first base layer <b>12</b> of a first conductivity type; a drain layer <b>10</b> of the first conductivity type formed on the back side surface of the first base layer <b>12</b>; a second base layer <b>16</b> of a second conductivity type formed on the surface of the first base layer <b>12</b>; a source layer <b>18</b> of the first conductivity type formed on the surface of the second base layer <b>16</b>; a gate insulating film <b>20</b> disposed on the surface of both the source layer <b>18</b> and the second base layer <b>16</b>; a gate electrode <b>22</b> disposed on the gate insulating film <b>20</b>; and an interlayer insulating film <b>24</b> disposed on the gate electrode <b>22</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the illustration is omitted about a drain electrode disposed on the drain layer <b>10</b>, and a source electrode disposed on both the source layer <b>18</b> and the second base layer <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an example of a switching waveform of the semiconductor device related to the conventional example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Although the MOSFET including the super junction MOS structure denotes higher performance in respect of both the switching power loss and the on-state power loss compared with the MOSFET of the conventional planar structure, the performance is poor in respect of the through loss.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">That is, the super junction MOSFET includes a column layer of the second conductivity type formed in the first base layer <b>12</b> of the lower part of both the second base layer <b>16</b> and the source layer <b>18</b> by opposing the drain layer <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the on resistance is reduced and the gate sensitivity increases, the amount of gate charge Qg needed for the turn-on switching is reduced, and thereby the turn-on switching time period can be shortened. On the other hand, since the column layer is included, a pn junction area increases, the reverse recovery time trr increases, and thereby the turn-off switching time is increased. Herein, the amount of gate charge Qg is defined as an amount of charge needed for a voltage V<sub>GS </sub>between the gate and the source in order to reach 10 V, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Generally, a method of using diffusion of a heavy metal and a method of electron irradiation are known as technology for shortening the reverse recovery time trr. According to the above-mentioned methods, although the reverse recovery time trr can be shortened, since the controllability for forming a trap level is wrong, there is a problem that the leakage current between the drain and the source increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, in an Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT), it is already proposed about a technology for forming locally a life-time controlled layer (for example, refer to Patent Literature 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, in the IGBT, it is already also disclosed about a technology for irradiating only a predetermined region with an electron ray by using a source electrode formed with aluminum as wiring and using as a mask of electron irradiation (for example, refer to Patent Literature 2).</div>
