<heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Therapeutic antibodies (mAbs) have important applications in medicine. However, antibodies of non-human origin such as murine antibodies have drawbacks in that humans mount an anti-mouse antibody response when administered murine antibodies. Techniques developed to overcome the risk of immunogenicity involved increasing the content of human sequences in antibodies, including grafting murine complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) onto human frameworks (FRs) to create an antibody with higher human sequence content. This process, known as CDR-grafting (Jones, et al., 1986, Nature 321:522-525), was the first described method of antibody humanization. Since then, several methods of humanization have been described including resurfacing (Roguska, et al., 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:969-973), specificity-determining residue (SDR) grafting (Kashmiri, et al., 2005, Methods 36:25-34), superhumanization (Hwang, et al., 2005, Methods 36:35-42), human string content optimization (Lazar, et al., 2007, Mol Immunol 44:1986-1998), and framework shuffling (Dall'Acqua, et al., 2005, Methods 36:43-60; Damschroder, et al., 2007, Mol Immunol 44:3049-3060). The underlying assumption of all these methods is that the greater global sequence identity of the humanized sequence to a natural human sequence results in a lower risk of immunogenicity. However, due to the perceived risk of losing antigen affinity, none of these methods substantially engineer the CDRs, and as such none of these humanization methods reach the global sequence identity levels of human antibodies as they still contain mostly non-human CDRs. More recently, “fully-human” mAbs generated from recombinant human antibody libraries (Griffiths, et al., 1994, Embo J 13:3245-3260; Knappik, et al., 2000, J Mol Biol 296:57-86) or transgenic mice comprising human germline configuration immunoglobulin gene sequences (Lonberg, 2005, Nat Biotechnol 23:1117-1125; Green, et al., 1994, Nat Genet 7:13-21; Lonberg, et al., 1994, Nature 368:856-859) have emerged as alternatives to murine generated and subsequently humanized mAbs. These mAbs have both high affinity as well as high human sequence content.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Linking antibodies to moieties of interest such as drugs, radioactive elements, labels or stabilizing molecules (e.g. polymers) is of high pharmaceutical interest. Current methods used for conjugation to human or humanized antibodies rely solely on direct, non-enzymatically-mediated, functionalization of certain residues with moieties of interest. Human or humanized antibodies are functionalized on cysteine residues. However a major drawback of such methods is that conjugation is not stoichiometric, with antibodies in a mixture typically having from 1 to 8 moieties (e.g. drugs) per antibody, and that conjugation can occur on unwanted cysteine residues necessitating cysteine engineering. Enzymatic methods have been shown to be capable of conjugating moieties of interest onto murine antibodies. Notably, transglutaminases (TGases) have been used to conjugate small detectable markers onto antibodies having murine variable regions (see, e.g., Josten et al. (2000) J. Immunol. Methods 240, 47-54; Mindt et al (2008) Bioconjug. Chem. 19, 271-278; Jeger et al (2010) Angew. Chem. Tnt. Ed. 49: 9995-9997); Kamiya et al (2003) Enzyme. Microb. Technol. 33, 492-496 and US patent publication no. 2011/0184147. However, the rules which govern selection by TGases of glutamine residues for modification are still largely unknown. Antibodies are estimated to have in the range of 90 lysine residues and 60 glutamine residues, including surface-exposed residues in the CDRs and FRs sequences. Current methods for producing antibody-drug conjugates are based on chemical reactions between naturally-occurring cysteines within antibodies and maleimide-reactive groups on drug-containing linkers. However such conjugation onto naturally occurring cysteine residues risks of unwanted conjugation onto different cysteines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the foregoing, there remains a need in the art for methods to conjugate moieties onto antibodies in a stoichiometric fashion and without negatively affecting the biological activity of the antibodies.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present invention provides in one aspect modified (e.g. mutated, affinity optimized), human and humanized antibodies, or an antibody comprising an acceptor glutamine in a constant region, conjugated to a moiety-of-interest via a lysine-based linker (for example, any primary amine chain which is a substrate for TGase, e.g. comprising an alkylamine, oxoamine) wherein the conjugation occurs exclusively on one or more acceptor glutamine residues present in the antibody outside of the antigen combining site (e.g. outside a variable region, in a constant region). Conjugation thus does not occur on a glutamine, e.g. an at least partly surface exposed glutamine, within the variable region. The conjugate is formed by reacting the antibody and a lysine-based linker in the presence of a TGase. The lysine-based linker may comprise, for example, in addition to a primary amine, e.g. alkylamine, oxoamine, a peptide, polypeptide, any organic molecule, a drug or diagnostic moiety, or may comprise a reactive moiety that can subsequently be reacted with a compound comprising a drug or diagnostic moiety. The present approach also provides for antibody compositions that have homogenous functionalized acceptor glutamine:antibody stoichiometry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">As presented herein, the acceptor glutamine residue is part of the immunoglobulin and the lysine-based linker is part of the moiety that is conjugated to the glutamine residue on the immunoglobulin. The primary amino group is preferably separated by at least five atoms (e.g. (CH<sub>2</sub>)—groups) or a spacer of equal length from the moiety-of-interest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The antibodies of the invention are created through use of a linking reagent that can be attached, by the action of a TGase, to a polypeptide at a glutamine residue (Q) within the primary sequence of an antibody (Ab). The linking reagent (lysine based linker) comprises a lysine derivative (Lys), or a functional equivalent thereof, that is connected to at least one reactive group. In one embodiment, a moiety-of-interest (Z) can be attached to the linking reagent. In one embodiment, a plurality of reactive groups, preferably non-complementary reactive groups, can be attached to the linking reagent. The reactive group is preferably a functionality that is insensitive to water but selectively undergoes a very high conversion addition reaction with a complementary reagent. The functional equivalent of a lysine derivative comprises a 2 to 20 carbon chain, or a functional equivalent thereof, for example an aminomethylene (H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2</sub>) group, a protected H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2 </sub>group that can be derived from the aminomethylene, an oxoamine ((H<sub>2</sub>NO) group or a protected H<sub>2</sub>NO group, positioned at one or more ends of the carbon chain. The functional equivalent of the carbon chain is a chain of 3 to 20 atoms where one or more non-terminal atoms can be other than carbon, for example oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, or other atoms. The oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen atom can be of an ether, ester, thioether, thioester, amino, alkylamino, amido or alkylamido functionality within the carbon chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">One exemplary functional equivalent of the carbon chain is an oligo (ethylene oxide) chain. The functionality within the carbon chain can be included to couple the reactive group to the H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2 </sub>group or protected H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2 </sub>group. The carbon chain, or its functional equivalent, can be substituted or unsubstituted. The substituents can be alkyl groups, aryl groups, alkyl aryl groups, carboxylic acid groups, amide groups, hydroxy groups, or any other groups that do not compete with the amino group for, or inhibit, conjugation with a glutamine residue of the protein. Typically, when a substituent is present, its presence is in a convenient starting material, such as the carboxylic acid group of lysine, from which the lysine derivative results. The aminomethylene end of a carbon chain is necessarily included in the linking reagent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Starting materials for the functional equivalent of lysine can be an α,ω-diaminoalkane, for example, 1,2-diaminoethane, 1,3-diaminopropane, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,5-diaminopentane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 1,7-diaminoheptane, 1,8-diaminooctane, 1,9-diaminononane, 1,10-diaminodecane, 1,11-diaminoundecane, or 1,12-diaminododecane. Other starting materials for the functional equivalent of a lysine derivative can be α,ω-diamino oligo (ethylene oxide), for example, H<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>x</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2 </sub>where x is 1 to about 6. The α,ω-diamino oligo (ethylene oxide) can be a single oligomer or it can be a mixture of oligomers where x defines an average size. An exemplary protected H<sub>2</sub>NCH<sub>2 </sub>is the tert-butylcarbamate protected amine of tert-butyl N-(5-aminopentyl)carbamate (N-Boc-cadaverin).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, present invention provides a multi-step (e.g. two-step) site-specific labeling and functionalization approach which involves conjugation a linking reagent with a reactive group to a human or humanized antibody, or a glutamine-engineered antibody of the invention with TGase, followed by further reaction of the reactive group. The method is particularly useful for functionalizing immunoglobulins with drugs, particularly peptides and polypeptides, relatively large chemical entities, negatively charged chemical entities and/or hydrophobic chemical entities, e.g. typical cytotoxic drugs such as duocarmycins, maytansanoids, alkylating agents, taxanes, MMAE, MMAF and the like (e.g. analogues thereof) that are derived from natural sources or analogues or derivatives thereof, typical polymers such as PEG that enhance stability of antibody fragments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention thus relates in one embodiment to a method for conjugating a moiety of interest (Z) to an antibody, comprising the steps of:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">a) providing an human or humanized antibody, or an antibody comprising a glutamine in a variable region, optionally an at least partly surface exposed glutamine in a variable region, wherein the antibody comprises at least one acceptor glutamine residue in a constant region; and</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The human or humanized antibody, or an antibody comprising a (non-functionalized) glutamine in a variable region, comprising an acceptor glutamine in a constant region linked to a reactive group (R) via a lysine-based linker can thereafter be reacted with a reaction partner comprising a moiety of interest (Z) to generate an antibody comprising an acceptor glutamine linked to a moiety of interest (Z) via a lysine-based linker. Thus, in one embodiment, the method further comprises a step (c): reacting (i) an antibody of step b) comprising an acceptor glutamine linked to a reactive group (R) via a lysine-based linker, with (ii) a compound comprising a reactive group (R′) capable of reacting with reactive group R and a moiety of interest (Z), under conditions sufficient to obtain an antibody comprising an acceptor glutamine linked to a moiety of interest (Z) via a lysine-based linker.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">Introduction</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0113">According to the invention, the functionalization of antibodies is site-specific and occurs via, respectively between a lysine or lysine-like moiety and an acceptor glutamine residue of an antibody by transglutaminase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0114">The inventors now present a convenient method for the site-specific functionalization of human and humanized immunoglobulins under near physiological conditions. The enzymatic activity of the transglutaminase family catalyzes an acyl transfer reaction between the γ-carboxamide groups of peptide-bound glutamine residues and various primary amines or ε-amino groups of lysine residues, thus forming isopeptidic bonds which are stable and resistant to chemical, enzymatic, and physical degradation. The function of TGases can be described as incorporation of alkylamine derivatives into specific glutamine residues or vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">Definitions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0115">As used in the specification, “a” or “an” may mean one or more. As used in the claim(s), when used in conjunction with the word “comprising”, the words “a” or “an” may mean one or more than one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0116">Where “comprising” is used, this can be replaced by “consisting essentially of or by “consisting of”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0117">The term “transglutaminase”, used interchangeably with “TGase” or “TG”, refers to an enzyme capable of cross-linking proteins through an acyl-transfer reaction between the γ-carboxamide group of peptide-bound glutamine and the ε-amino group of a lysine or a structurally related primary amine such as amino pentyl group, e.g. a peptide-bound lysine, resulting in a ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bond. TGases include, inter alia, bacterial transglutaminase (BTG) such as the enzyme having EC reference EC 2.3.2.13 (protein-glutamine-γ-glutamyltransferase).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0118">The term “acceptor glutamine”, when referring to an amino acid residue of an antibody, means a glutamine residue that, under suitable conditions, is recognized by a TGase and can be crosslinked by a TGase through a reaction between the glutamine and a lysine or a structurally related primary amine such as amino pentyl group. Optionally the acceptor glutamine is a surface-exposed glutamine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0119">The term “antibody” herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically includes full-length monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Various techniques relevant to the production of antibodies are provided in, e.g., Harlow, et al., A<smallcaps>NTIBODIES</smallcaps>: A L<smallcaps>ABORATORY </smallcaps>M<smallcaps>ANUAL</smallcaps>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1988).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0120">An “antibody fragment” comprises a portion of a full-length antibody, preferably antigen-binding or variable regions thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab)<sub>2</sub>, F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>, F(ab)<sub>3</sub>, Fv (typically the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody), single-chain Fv (scFv), dsFv, Fd fragments (typically the VH and CH1 domain), and dAb (typically a VH domain) fragments; VH, VL, VhH, and V-NAR domains; minibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, and kappa bodies (see, e.g., Ill et al., Protein Eng 1997; 10: 949-57); camel IgG; IgNAR; and multispecific antibody fragments formed from antibody fragments, and one or more isolated CDRs or a functional paratope, where isolated CDRs or antigen-binding residues or polypeptides can be associated or linked together so as to form a functional antibody fragment. Various types of antibody fragments have been described or reviewed in, e.g., Holliger and Hudson, Nat Biotechnol 2005; 23, 1126-1136; WO2005040219, and published U.S. Patent Applications 20050238646 and 20020161201.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0121">The term “antibody derivative”, as used herein, comprises a full-length antibody or a fragment of an antibody, preferably comprising at least antigen-binding or variable regions thereof, wherein one or more of the amino acids are chemically modified, e.g., by alkylation, PEGylation, acylation, ester formation or amide formation or the like. This includes, but is not limited to, PEGylated antibodies, cysteine-PEGylated antibodies, and variants thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0122">A “humanized” antibody is a human/non-human chimeric antibody that contains a minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit, or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR residues are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody can optionally also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992), WO 92/02190, US Patent Application 20060073137, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,750,325, 6,632,927, 6,639,055, 6,548,640, 6,407,213, 6,180,370, 6,054,297, 5,929,212, 5,895,205, 5,886,152, 5,877,293, 5,869,619, 5,821,337, 5,821,123, 5,770,196, 5,777,085, 5,766,886, 5,714,350, 5,693,762, 5,693,761, 5,530,101, 5,585,089, and 5,225,539.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0123">The term “hypervariable region” when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody that are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a “complementarity-determining region” or “CDR” (e.g. residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light-chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy-chain variable domain; Kabat et al. 1991) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop” (e.g. residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light-chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy-chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol 1987; 196:901-917). Typically, the numbering of amino acid residues in this region is performed by the method described in Kabat et al., supra. Phrases such as “Kabat position”, “variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat” and “according to Kabat” herein refer to this numbering system for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains. Using the Kabat numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence of a peptide may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of CDR H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a “standard” Kabat numbered sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0124">By “framework” or “FR” residues as used herein is meant the region of an antibody variable domain exclusive of those regions defined as CDRs. Each antibody variable domain framework can be further subdivided into the contiguous regions separated by the CDRs (FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0125">By “constant region” of an antibody as defined herein is meant the region of the antibody that is encoded by one of the light or heavy chain immunoglobulin constant region genes. By “constant light chain” or “light chain constant region” as used herein is meant the region of an antibody encoded by the kappa (Ckappa) or lambda (Clambda) light chains. The constant light chain typically comprises a single domain, and as defined herein refers to positions 108-214 of Ckappa, or Clambda, wherein numbering is according to the EU index (Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., United States Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). By “constant heavy chain” or “heavy chain constant region” as used herein is meant the region of an antibody encoded by the mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon genes to define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, or IgE, respectively. For full length IgG antibodies, the constant heavy chain, as defined herein, refers to the N-terminus of the CH1 domain to the C-terminus of the CH3 domain, thus comprising positions 118-447, wherein numbering is according to the EU index.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0126">By “Fab” or “Fab region” as used herein is meant the polypeptide that comprises the VH, CH1, VL, and CL immunoglobulin domains. Fab may refer to this region in isolation, or this region in the context of a full length antibody, antibody fragment or Fab fusion protein, or any other antibody embodiments as outlined herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0127">By “Fv” or “Fv fragment” or “Fv region” as used herein is meant a polypeptide that comprises the VL and VH domains of a single antibody.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0128">By “Fc” or “Fc region”, as used herein is meant the polypeptide comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM, Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cγ2 and Cγ3 and the hinge between Cγ1 and Cγ2. Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226, P230 or A231 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index. Fc may refer to this region in isolation, or this region in the context of an Fc polypeptide, as described below. By “Fc polypeptide” as used herein is meant a polypeptide that comprises all or part of an Fc region. Fc polypeptides include antibodies, Fc fusions, isolated Fcs, and Fc fragments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0129">By “full length antibody” as used herein is meant the structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody, including variable and constant regions. For example, in most mammals, including humans and mice, the full length antibody of the TgG isotype is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of two immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain, each light chain comprising immunoglobulin domains VL and CL, and each heavy chain comprising immunoglobulin domains VH, Cγ1, Cγ2, and Cγ3. In some mammals, for example in camels and llamas, IgG antibodies may consist of only two heavy chains, each heavy chain comprising a variable domain attached to the Fc region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0130">By “variable region” as used herein is meant the region of an antibody that comprises one or more Ig domains substantially encoded by any of the VL (including Vkappa and Vlambda) and/or VH genes that make up the light chain (including kappa and lambda) and heavy chain immunoglobulin genetic loci respectively. A light or heavy chain variable region (VL and VH) consists of a “framework” or “FR” region interrupted by three hypervariable regions referred to as “complementarity determining regions” or “CDRs”. The extent of the framework region and CDRs have been precisely defined, for example as in Kabat (see “Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,” E. Kabat et al., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (1983)), and as in Chothia. The framework regions of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDRs, which are primarily responsible for binding to an antigen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0131">By “amino acid modification” herein is meant an amino acid substitution, insertion, and/or deletion in a polypeptide sequence. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution. By “amino acid modification” herein is meant an amino acid substitution, insertion, and/or deletion in a polypeptide sequence. By “amino acid substitution” or “substitution” herein is meant the replacement of an amino acid at a given position in a protein sequence with another amino acid. For example, the substitution Y50W refers to a variant of a parent polypeptide, in which the tyrosine at position 50 is replaced with tryptophan. A “variant” of a polypeptide refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence that is substantially identical to a reference polypeptide, typically a native or “parent” polypeptide. The polypeptide variant may possess one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions at certain positions within the native amino acid sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0132">“Conservative” amino acid substitutions are those in which an amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a side chain with similar physicochemical properties. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains are known in the art, and include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0133">The term “substantially identical” in the context of two amino acid sequences means that the sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least about 50, at least about 60, at least about 70, at least about 80, at least about 90, at least about 95, at least about 98, or at least about 99 percent sequence identity. In one embodiment, residue positions that are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. Sequence identity is typically measured using sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, the publicly available GCG software contains programs such as “Gap” and “BestFit” which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild-type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide sequences can also be compared using FASTA, applying default or recommended parameters. A program in GCG Version 6.1., FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (Pearson, Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183:63-98; Pearson, Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132:185-219). Another preferred algorithm when comparing a sequence to a database containing a large number of sequences from various organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially blastp, using default parameters. See, e.g., Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215:403-410; Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25:3389-402 (1997); each herein incorporated by reference. “Corresponding” amino acid positions in two substantially identical amino acid sequences are those aligned by any of the protein analysis software mentioned herein, typically using default parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0134">An antibody having a “biological characteristic” of a reference antibody, is one that possesses one or more of the biological characteristics of that antibody that distinguish it from other antibodies that bind to the same antigen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0135">An “isolated” molecule is a molecule that is the predominant species in the composition wherein it is found with respect to the class of molecules to which it belongs (i.e., it makes up at least about 50% of the type of molecule in the composition and typically will make up at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or more of the species of molecule, e.g., peptide, in the composition). Commonly, a composition of an antibody molecule will exhibit 98%, 98%, or 99% homogeneity for antibody molecules in the context of all present peptide species in the composition or at least with respect to substantially active peptide species in the context of proposed use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0136">In the context of the present invention, “treatment” or “treating” refers to preventing, alleviating, managing, curing or reducing one or more symptoms or clinically relevant manifestations of a disease or disorder, unless contradicted by context. For example, “treatment” of a patient in whom no symptoms or clinically relevant manifestations of a disease or disorder have been identified is preventive or prophylactic therapy, whereas “treatment” of a patient in whom symptoms or clinically relevant manifestations of a disease or disorder have been identified generally does not constitute preventive or prophylactic therapy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0137">The term “reactive moiety” herein refers to a moiety that can be coupled with another moiety without prior activation or transformation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0138">The term “protecting group” refers to a group that temporarily protects or blocks, i e., intended to prevent from reacting, a functional group, e.g, an amino group, a hydroxyl group, or a carboxyl group, during the transformation of a first molecule to a second molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0139">The phrase “moiety that improves the pharmacokinetic properties”, when referring to a compound (e.g. an antibody) refers to a moiety that changes the pharmacokinetic properties of the one or more moieties Z in such a way that a better therapeutic or diagnostic effect can be obtained. The moiety can for example increase the water solubility, increase the circulation time, or reduce immunogenicity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0140">The phrase “linking group” refers to a structural element of a compound that links one structural element of said compound to one or more other structural elements of said same compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0141">The phrase “a number representing degree of branching” is used to denote that the subscript number next to a closing bracket represents how many units of the moiety within the brackets are attached to the moiety directly to the left of the corresponding opening bracket For example, A-(B)<sub>b </sub>with b being a number representing a degree of branching means that b units B are all directly attached to A This means that when b is 2, the formula reduces to B-A-B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0142">The phrase “a number representing degree of polymerization” is used to denote that the subscript number next to a closing bracket represents how many units of the moiety within the brackets are connected to each other. For example, A-(B)<sub>1</sub>, with b being a number representing a degree of polymerization means that when b is 2, the formula reduces to A-B-B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0143">As used herein, “alkyl” refers to a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain that comprises a fully saturated (no double or triple bonds) hydrocarbon group. The alkyl group may have, for example, 1 to 20 carbon atoms (whenever it appears herein, a numerical range such as “1 to 20” refers to each integer in the given range; e.g., “1 to 20 carbon atoms” means that the alkyl group may consist of 1 carbon atom, 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms, etc., up to and including 20 carbon atoms, although the present definition also covers the occurrence of the term “alkyl” where no numerical range is designated). The alkyl group of the compounds may be designated as “C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl” or similar designations. By way of example only, “C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl” indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, i.e., the alkyl chain is selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, and t-butyl. Typical alkyl groups include, but are in no way limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl and hexyl. The alkyl group may be substituted or unsubstituted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0144">As used herein, the term “heteroalkyl” refers to a straight or branched alkyl group that contains one or more heteroatoms, that is, an element other than carbon (including but not limited to oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus) in place of one or more carbon atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0145">Whenever a group is described as being “substituted” that group substituted with one or more of the indicated substituents. If no substituents are indicated, it is meant that the indicated “substituted” group may be substituted with one or more group(s) individually and independently selected from alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkynyl, heteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heteroalicyclyl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, (heteroalicyclyl)alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, acyl, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio, cyano, halogen, thiocarbonyl, carbamyl, thiocarbamyl, amido, sulfonamido, sulfonamido, carboxy, isocyanato, thiocyanato, isothiocyanato, nitro, silyl, sulfenyl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, trihalomethanesulfonyl, trihalomethanesulfonamido, an amino, a mono-substituted amino group and a di-substituted amino group, and protected derivatives thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0146">Where the number of substituents is not specified (e.g. haloalkyl), there may be one or more substituents present. For example “haloalkyl” may include one or more of the same or different halogens. As another example, “C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3 </sub>alkoxyphenyl” may include one or more of the same or different alkoxy groups containing one, two or three atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0147">The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt of a compound that does not cause significant irritation to an organism to which it is administered and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the compound. In some embodiments, the salt is an acid addition salt of the compound. Pharmaceutical salts can be obtained by reacting a compound with inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid), sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid. Pharmaceutical salts can also be obtained by reacting a compound with an organic acid such as aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic or sulfonic acids, for example formic, acetic, succinic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, nicotinic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, p-toluensulfonic, salicylic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. Pharmaceutical salts can also be obtained by reacting a compound with a base to form a salt such as an ammonium salt, an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or a potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt, such as a calcium or a magnesium salt, a salt of organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>7 </sub>alkylamine, cyclohexylamine, triethanolamine, ethylenediamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine and lysine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">Producing Antibodies</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0148">Antibodies may be produced by a variety of techniques known in the art. Typically, they are produced by immunization of a non-human animal, preferably a mouse, with an immunogen comprising a polypeptide, or a fragment or derivative thereof, typically an immunogenic fragment, for which it is desired to obtain antibodies (e.g. a human polypeptide). The step of immunizing a non-human mammal with an antigen may be carried out in any manner well known in the art for stimulating the production of antibodies in a mouse (see, for example, E. Harlow and D. Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988), the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference). Other protocols may also be used as long as they result in the production of B cells expressing an antibody directed to the antigen used in immunization. Lymphocytes from a non-immunized non-human mammal may also be isolated, grown in vitro, and then exposed to the immunogen in cell culture. The lymphocytes are then harvested and the fusion step described below is carried out. For preferred monoclonal antibodies, the next step is the isolation of splenocytes from the immunized non-human mammal and the subsequent fusion of those splenocytes with an immortalized cell in order to form an antibody-producing hybridoma. The hybridoma colonies are then assayed for the production of antibodies that specifically bind to the polypeptide against which antibodies are desired. The assay is typically a colorimetric ELISA-type assay, although any assay may be employed that can be adapted to the wells that the hybridomas are grown in. Other assays include radioimmunoassays or fluorescence activated cell sorting. The wells positive for the desired antibody production are examined to determine if one or more distinct colonies are present. If more than one colony is present, the cells may be re-cloned and grown to ensure that only a single cell has given rise to the colony producing the desired antibody. After sufficient growth to produce the desired monoclonal antibody, the growth media containing monoclonal antibody (or the ascites fluid) is separated away from the cells and the monoclonal antibody present therein is purified. Purification is typically achieved by gel electrophoresis, dialysis, chromatography using protein A or protein G-Sepharose, or an anti-mouse Ig linked to a solid support such as agarose or Sepharose beads (all described, for example, in the Antibody Purification Handbook, Biosciences, publication No. 18-1037-46, Edition AC, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0149">Antibodies may also be produced by selection of combinatorial libraries of immunoglobulins, as disclosed for instance in (Ward et al. Nature, 341 (1989) p. 544, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference). Phage display technology (McCafferty et al (1990) Nature 348:552-553) can be used to produce antibodies from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. See, e.g., Griffith et al (1993) EMBO J. 12:725-734; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332; 5,573,905; 5,567,610; 5,229,275). When combinatorial libraries comprise variable (V) domain gene repertoires of human origin, selection from combinatorial libraries will yield human antibodies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0150">Additionally, a wide range of antibodies are available in the scientific and patent literature, including DNA and/or amino acid sequences, or from commercial suppliers. Examples of antibodies include antibodies that recognize an antigen expressed by a target cell that is to be eliminated, for example a proliferating cell or a cell contributing to a pathology. Examples include antibodies that recognize tumor antigens, microbial (e.g. bacterial) antigens or viral antigens. Other examples include antigens present on immune cells that are contributing to inflammatory or autoimmune disease, including rejection of transplanted tissue (e.g. antigens present on T cells (CD4 or CD8 T cells).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0151">Antibodies will typically be directed to a pre-determined antigen. As used herein, the term “bacterial antigen” includes, but is not limited to, intact, attenuated or killed bacteria, any structural or functional bacterial protein or carbohydrate, or any peptide portion of a bacterial protein of sufficient length (typically about 8 amino acids or longer) to be antigenic.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0152">As used herein, the term “viral antigen” includes, but is not limited to, intact, attenuated or killed whole virus, any structural or functional viral protein, or any peptide portion of a viral protein of sufficient length (typically about 8 amino acids or longer) to be antigenic. Sources of a viral antigen include, but are not limited to viruses from the families: Retroviridae (e.g., human immunodeficiency viruses, such as HIV-1 (also referred to as HTLV-III, LAV or HTLV-III/LAV, or HIV-III; and other isolates, such as HIV-LP; Picornaviridae (e.g., polio viruses, hepatitis A virus; enteroviruses, human Coxsackie viruses, rhinoviruses, echoviruses); Calciviridae (e.g., strains that cause gastroenteritis); Togaviridae (e.g., equine encephalitis viruses, rubella viruses); Flaviviridae (e.g., dengue viruses, encephalitis viruses, yellow fever viruses); Coronaviridae (e.g., coronaviruses); Rhabdoviridae (e.g., vesicular stomatitis viruses, rabies viruses); Filoviridae (e.g., ebola viruses); Paramyxoviridae (e.g., parainfluenza viruses, mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus); Orthomyxoviridae (e.g., influenza viruses); Bunyaviridae (e.g., Hantaan viruses, bunya viruses, phleboviruses and Nairo viruses); Arenaviridae (hemorrhagic fever viruses); Reoviridae (e.g., reoviruses, orbiviruses and rotaviruses); Bornaviridae; Hepadnaviridae (Hepatitis B virus); Parvoviridae (parvoviruses); Papovaviridae (papilloma viruses, polyoma viruses); Adenoviridae (most adenoviruses); Herpesviridae (herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes virus; Poxyiridae (variola viruses, vaccinia viruses, pox viruses); and Iridoviridae (e.g., African swine fever virus); and unclassified viruses (e.g., the agent of delta hepatitis (thought to be a defective satellite of hepatitis B virus), Hepatitis C; Norwalk and related viruses, and astroviruses). Alternatively, a viral antigen may be produced recombinantly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0153">As used herein, the terms “cancer antigen” and “tumor antigen” are used interchangeably and refer to antigens that are differentially expressed by cancer cells and can thereby be exploited in order to target cancer cells. Cancer antigens are antigens which can potentially stimulate apparently tumor-specific immune responses. Some of these antigens are encoded, although not necessarily expressed, by normal cells. These antigens can be characterized as those which are normally silent (i.e., not expressed) in normal cells, those that are expressed only at certain stages of differentiation and those that are temporally expressed such as embryonic and fetal antigens. Other cancer antigens are encoded by mutant cellular genes, such as oncogenes (e.g., activated ras oncogene), suppressor genes (e.g., mutant p53), fusion proteins resulting from internal deletions or chromosomal translocations. Still other cancer antigens can be encoded by viral genes such as those carried on RNA and DNA tumor viruses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0154">The cancer antigens are usually normal cell surface antigens which are either over-expressed or expressed at abnormal times. Ideally the target antigen is expressed only on proliferative cells (preferably tumour cells), however this is rarely observed in practice. As a result, target antigens are usually selected on the basis of differential expression between proliferative and healthy tissue. Antibodies have been raised to target specific tumour related antigens including: Cripto, CD4, CD20, CD30, CD19, CD33, Glycoprotein NMB, CanAg, Her2 (ErbB2/Neu), CD56 (NCAM), CD22 (Siglec2), CD33 (Siglec3), CD79, CD138, CD171, PSCA, PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen), BCMA, CD52, CD56, CD80, CD70, E-selectin, EphB2, Melanotransferin, Mud 6 and TMEFF2. Examples of cancer antigens also include B7-H3, B7-H4, B7-H6, PD-L1, MAGE, MART-1/Melan-A, gp100, adenosine deaminase-binding protein (ADAbp), cyclophilin b, colorectal associated antigen (CRC)-C017-1A/GA733, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and its immunogenic epitopes CAP-1 and CAP-2, etv6, aml1, prostate specific antigen (PSA), T-cell receptor/CD3-zeta chain, MAGE-family of tumor antigens, GAGE-family of tumor antigens, BAGE, RAGE, LAGE-1, NAG, GnT-V, MUM-1, CDK4, MUC family, VEGF, VEGF receptors, PDGF, TGF-alpha, EGF, EGF receptor, a member of the human EGF-like receptor family such as HER-2/neu, HER-3, HER-4 or a heterodimeric receptor comprised of at least one HER subunit, gastrin releasing peptide receptor antigen, Muc-1, CA125, Δvβ3 integrins, α5β1 integrins, αIIbβ3-integrins, PDGF beta receptor, SVE-cadherin, IL-8, hCG, IL-6, IL-6 receptor, IL-15, α-fetoprotein, E-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin and γ-catenin, p120ctn, PRAME, NY-ESO-1, cdc27, adenomatous polyposis <i>coli </i>protein (APC), fodrin, Connexin 37, Ig-idiotype, p15, gp75, GM2 and GD2 gangliosides, viral products such as human papillomavirus proteins, imp-1, P1A, EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA)-1, brain glycogen phosphorylase, SSX-1, SSX-2 (HOM-MEL-40), SSX-1, SSX-4, SSX-5, SCP-1 and CT-7, and c-erbB-2, although this is not intended to be exhaustive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0155">DNA encoding an antibody of interest can be placed in an appropriate expression vector for transfection into an appropriate host. The host is then used for the recombinant production of the antibody, or variants thereof, such as a humanized version of that monoclonal antibody, active fragments of the antibody, chimeric antibodies comprising the antigen recognition portion of the antibody, or versions comprising a detectable moiety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0156">In certain embodiments, the DNA of a hybridoma or other cell producing an antibody can be modified prior to insertion into an expression vector, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of the homologous non-human sequences (e.g., Morrison et al., PNAS pp. 6851 (1984)), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In that manner, “chimeric” or “hybrid” antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the original antibody. Typically, such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0157">Human antibodies may also be produced by using, for immunization, transgenic animals that have been engineered to express a human antibody repertoire (Jakobovitz et Nature 362 (1993) 255), or by selection of antibody repertoires using phage display methods. For example, a XenoMouse (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif.) can be used for immunization. A XenoMouse is a murine host according to this invention that has had its immunoglobulin genes replaced by functional human immunoglobulin genes. Thus, antibodies produced by this mouse or in hybridomas made from the B cells of this mouse, are already humanized. The XenoMouse is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,963, which is herein incorporated in its entirety by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0158">Humanized antibodies are typically specific chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab′, F (ab′) 2, “dab”, or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from the murine immunoglobulin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0159">For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of the original antibody (the parent or donor antibody) while maintaining the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity of the original antibody. The CDRs of the parent antibody, some or all of which are encoded by nucleic acids originating in a non-human organism, are grafted in whole or in part into the beta-sheet framework of a human antibody variable region to create an antibody, the specificity of which is determined by the engrafted CDRs. The creation of such antibodies is described in, e.g., WO 92/11018, Jones, 1986, Nature 321:522-525, Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science 239:1534-1536.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0160">Generally, in a humanization process, nucleotides encoding the interaction-regions of a murine antibody can be cloned into a cDNA-vector encoding human IgG, which can be done such that a chimeric antibody is generated consisting of a human IgG backbone harboring the murine complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). However, such chimeric antibodies may exhibit a lower affinity, lower stability, or other undesired features in comparison with the original murine antibody, and may also be immunogenic. Therefore, individual amino acids in the chimeric Ab may need to be optimized to obtain a functional mAb of high quality for therapeutic applications in humans. “Backmutation” of selected acceptor framework residues to the corresponding donor residues is often required to regain affinity that is lost in the initial grafted construct (U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762, incorporated entirely by reference). A variety of techniques and methods for humanizing and reshaping non-human antibodies are well known in the art (See Tsurushita &amp; Vasquez, 2004, Humanization of Monoclonal Antibodies, Molecular Biology of B Cells, 533-545, Elsevier Science (USA), and references cited therein). Humanization or other methods of reducing the immunogenicity of nonhuman antibody variable regions may include resurfacing methods, as described for example in Roguska et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:969-973.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0161">In one embodiment, the parent antibody has been affinity matured, as is known in the art. Structure-based methods may be employed for humanization and affinity maturation, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,657,380. Selection based methods may be employed to humanize and/or affinity mature antibody variable regions, that is, to increase the affinity of the variable region for its target antigen. Other humanization methods may involve the grafting of only parts of the CDRs, including but not limited to methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,981,843 directed to minimal CDR3 fragments, or U.S. Pat. No. 6,797,492; Tan et al., 2002, J. Immunol. 169:1119-1125; De Pascalis et al., 2002, J. Immunol. 169:3076-3084. Other humanization methods may involve grafting less than all the CDRs, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 7,087,409 describes retaining CDR3 followed by the separate and sequential replacement of frameworks, CDR1 and CDR2. Structure-based methods may be employed for humanization and affinity maturation, or to reduce immunogenicity of the antibody for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,117,096.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0162">In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond substantially to those of the parent antibody and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human (or primate) immunoglobulin consensus sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0163">Typically, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non-human (e.g., the parent antibody). These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as “import” residues, which are typically taken from an “import” variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al, Nature, 321: 522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332: 323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239: 1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such “humanized” antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0164">The import residues can be selected to comprise a glutamine residue; the residue will not be an acceptor glutamine. For example, the glutamine may be present in any of CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and/or CDR-H3, in a heavy chain, and/or in any of CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and/or CDR-L3 of a light chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0165">The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called “best-fit” method, the sequence of the variable domain of an antibody of this invention is screened against a library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the mouse is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., J. Immunol. 151, pp. 2296 (1993); Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. 196, pp. 901). Another method uses a particular framework from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework can be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., PNAS 89, pp. 4285 (1992); Presta et J. Immunol., 51, p. 1993)). Other methods designed to reduce the immunogenicity of the antibody molecule in a human patient include veneered antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,797,492 and U.S. patent application publications 20020034765 and 20040253645) and antibodies that have been modified by T-cell epitope analysis and removal (see, e.g., U.S. patent application publications 20030153043 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,120).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0166">It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the target antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen (s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0167">As mentioned, mutation of selected acceptor framework residues to the corresponding donor residues is often required. Thus, in some instances, framework residues of the human immunoglobulin may be replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are not found in either the recipient antibody or in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0168">In one example, a parent antibody variable region amino acid sequence (e.g. one or a plurality of FRs or an entire variable region or portion thereof) is compared against a collection of human amino acid sequences (e.g. human germline amino acid sequences) and a variant immunoglobulin(s) (e.g. a heavy and/or light chain) is constructed that comprises a parent antibody CDR amino acid sequence(s) (i.e. sequences from one, two or three parent CDRs for each of the heavy and/or light chain of an antibody) and an amino acid sequence from one or more FRs taken from the human amino acid sequence(s), wherein the FR comprises a glutamine residue (such residue will not be an acceptor glutamine). Each of the CDR sequences from a parent antibody may be an entire CDR according to Kabat or other numbering systems, or a portion thereof sufficient to confer antigen specificity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0169">In one embodiment the antibody is constructed such that all the FRs in the heavy and/or light chain are amino acid sequence(s) of human origin, i.e. the 4 FRs of the heavy chain are of human origin and/or the 4 FRs of the heavy chain are of human origin. In one embodiment, all FR of a particular heavy and/or light chain are from a single human antibody or single human consensus sequence. In one embodiment, the FRs of a particular heavy and/or light chain are independently from two or more different human antibody or human consensus sequences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0170">It will be appreciated that FR sequences in a humanized antibody can be constructed by modifying those positions in a parent antibody in which the amino acids in the parent antibody variable region and human sequence differ. In one embodiment, a non-glutamine residue in a FR region is substituted by a glutamine (such residue will not be an acceptor glutamine). In one example, a parent antibody FR sequence (e.g. a FR sequence or a sequence that comprises it such as a variable region) is compared against a collection of human amino acid sequences (e.g. human germline amino acid sequences) and a variant immunoglobulin(s) is constructed that comprises the parent antibody CDR amino acid sequence(s) (i.e. sequences from one, two or three parent CDRs for each of the heavy and/or light chain of an antibody) and an amino acid substitution is made in one or more FRs taken from the human amino acid sequence(s) at a position in which the amino acids in the parent antibody variable region and human sequence differ, wherein the substitution comprises replacing a non-glutamine residue by a glutamine residue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0171">An antibody comprising a modification in it CDR or FR domains will typically retain a biological characteristics of interest of the parent antibody.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0172">In any of the antibodies or methods of the invention, a sequence (e.g. a CDR or FR sequence) of human origin may be characterized as comprising a sequence of at least 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 contiguous amino acids of a human sequence and/or as being substantially identical to a human sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0173">A VL sequence may optionally comprise mutations (e.g. a back-mutation) in one or more Vernier zone residues 24, 35, 36, 46, 47, 48, 49, 64, 66, 68-69, 71 and/or 99, and/or in one or more VH-VL interface residues 34, 36, 38, 44, 46, 87, 89, 91, 96 and/or 98, and a VH sequence may optionally comprise mutations in one or more Vernier zone residues 2, 27, 28, 29, 30, 47, 48, 49, 67, 69, 71, 73, 78, 93, 94 and/or 103, and/or in one or more VH-VL interface residues 34, 36, 38, 44, 47, 91, 93, 95, 100 and/or 103, with amino acid numbering according to Kabat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0174">The humanized antibody herein comprises non-human hypervariable region or CDR residues incorporated into a human VH domain. In one embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises no surface-exposed glutamine in the VH domain. In one embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises one, two, three or more glutamines in the VH domain, wherein the glutamine is not an acceptor glutamine, optionally in a CDR-H1, -2 and/or -3, and/or in a FR-H1, -H2 and/or -H3, optionally wherein the antibody has a FR sequence of human origin. In one embodiment, a glutamine is present at position 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 38, 39, 43, 35, 36, 66, 73, 75, 77, 83, 85 and/or 94 in a VH FR domain. In one embodiment, a glutamine is present at position 26, 35, 50, 61 and/or 64 in a VH CDR. In one embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises no FR substitution in the VH domain. In another embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises a VH domain FR substitution at one, two, three, four or more positions, optionally a position selected from 2, 27, 28, 29, 30, 34, 36, 38, 44, 47, 48, 49, 67, 69, 71, 73, 78, 91, 93, 94, 95, 100 and/or 103, utilizing the variable domain numbering system according to Kabat. In one embodiment, the substitution comprises a glutamine, i.e. replacing a non-glutamine residue by a glutamine residue. Fewer rather than more framework substitutions can minimize immunogenicity, but binding efficacy is also an important consideration. Thus, preferred substitutions are back-mutations, i.e., mutations which replace an amino acid at a certain position in the human FR with the amino acid at the corresponding position in a non-human donor FR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0175">The humanized antibody herein also comprises non-human hypervariable region or CDR residues incorporated into a human VL domain. In one embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises no surface-exposed glutamine in the VL domain, preferably no acceptor glutamine.

In one embodiment, a glutamine is present at position 3, 6, 11, 17, 18, 37, 38, 42, 45, 47, 49, 79 and/or 105 in a VL FR domain. In one embodiment, a glutamine is present at position 27, 50, 53, 55, 89, 90 and/or 93 in a VL CDR. In one embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises no FR substitution in the VL domain. In another embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises a VL domain FR substitution at one, two, three, four or more positions, optionally a position selected from 24, 34, 35, 36, 38, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 64, 66, 68-69, 71, 87, 89, 91, 96 and/or 99, utilizing the variable domain numbering system according to Kabat. In one embodiment, the substitution comprises a glutamine, i.e. replacing a non-glutmine residue by a glutamine residue. Fewer rather than more framework substitutions can minimize immunogenicity, but binding efficacy is also an important consideration. Thus, preferred substitutions are back-mutations, i.e., mutations which replace an amino acid at a certain position in the human FR with the amino acid at the corresponding position in a non-human donor FR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0176">In one example, the antibody of the invention specifically binds to cancer antigen human L1-CAM (CD171; L1 cell adhesion molecule) which has been found to be expressed in a variety of cancers (see, e.g., Kajiwara et al, (2011) Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 136 (1), 138-144). The L1-CAM nucleotide and amino acid sequences are disclosed in Genbank accession numbers NM_024003.2 and NP_076493.1, respectively, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. An example of an anti-L1-CAM antibody suitable for use in accordance with the invention is a chCE7-(or CE7-) derived antibody, e.g, having a heavy chain comprising CDRs (e.g., CDR-H1, -H2 and -H3) from chCE7 heavy chain shown in SEQ ID NO 1 and a light chain comprising CDRs (e.g., CDR-L1, -L2 and -L3) from chCE7 heavy chain shown in SEQ ID NO 2, optionally wherein any of said CDRs further comprises one, two, three, four or five amino acid modifications so long as the antibody retains specific binding to L1-CAM. ChCE7 shown in SEQ ID NOS 1 and 2 is respectively composed of murine VH and murine VL fused to the Fc part of human IgG1 (see, e.g., Jeger et al., (2010) Angew. Chem.

The humanized antibody may further comprise a glutamine in a VH FR domain at one, two, three, four or more of Kabat positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, 38, 39, 43, 35, 36, 66, 73, 75, 77, 83, 85 and/or 94.

The humanized antibody may further comprise a glutamine in a VL FR domain at one, two, three, four or more of Kabat positions 3, 6, 11, 17, 18, 37, 38, 42, 45, 47, 49, 79 and/or 105. In one embodiment, the VL domain comprises a framework region substitution in at least one Kabat position selected from the group consisting of from 24, 34, 35, 36, 38, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 64, 66, 68-69, 71, 87, 89, 91, 96 and 99.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0179">Optionally, in a particular aspect, the VH domain of any antibody of the invention comprises amino acid modifications of one or more CDR residues, e.g. where the modifications essentially maintain or improve affinity of the antibody. For example, the antibody variant may have one, two, three, or from one to about seven amino acid substitutions in the above VH CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may be prepared by affinity maturation, e.g., as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0180">Substitutions can also be made within CDR, e.g. the CDR residues imported from the parent antibody, including but not limited to methods described in SDR-grafting (Kashmiri, et al., 2005, Methods 36:25-34; Gonzales, et al., 2004, Mol Immunol 41:863-872) or making substitutions within CDRs so as to obtain sequences having maximal identity to human V-J segments as described, e.g., in US patent publication number US 2010/004431.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0181">In one embodiment, a non-glutamine residue in a non-human hypervariable region or CDR is substituted by a glutamine. In one example, a parent antibody hypervariable region sequence (e.g. a CDR) is compared against a collection of human amino acid sequences (e.g. human germline V- and J-segment amino acid sequences) and a variant immunoglobulin(s) is constructed that comprises the parent antibody variable region amino acid sequence and an amino acid substitution taken from the human germline V- and J-segment at a position in which the amino acids in the parent antibody variable region and human sequence (e.g. germline V- and J-segment) differ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0182">In another embodiment, a glutamine residue is present in a CDR (e.g., from a parent antibody variable region) and the glutamine is maintained (i.e. not substituted) in a humanized antibody.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0183">For example, the glutamine may be present in any of CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and/or CDR-H3, optionally at position 26, 35, 50, 61 and/or 64 in a heavy Ig chain, and/or in any of CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and/or CDR-L3, optionally at position 27, 50, 53, 55, 89, 90 and/or 93 of a light Ig chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0184">The humanized antibody may or may not further comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al., Nature, 321, pp. 522 (1986); Reichmann et al, Nature, 332, pp. 323 (1988); Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2, pp. 593 (1992); Verhoeyen et Science, 239, pp. 1534; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0185">Wild-type full-length IgG antibodies of human isotype will possess a conserved acceptor glutamine at residue 295 of the heavy chain which when in non-glycosylated form will be accessible to a TGase and therefore reactive with a compound of Formula I in the presence of a TGase, under suitable conditions, to form a conjugate from the antibody and the compound of Formula II or IV. The antibody will lack glycosylation at the asparagine at residue 297 of the heavy chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0186">Additional or alternative sites reactive with a compound of Formula I in the presence of a TGase can be created by engineering the antibodies. The compounds of the invention include glutamine engineered antibodies where one or more amino acids of a wild-type or parent antibody are replaced with (substituted by) a glutamine amino acid, or where a glutamine residue, optionally together with other amino acid residues, is introduced or added to a wild-type or parent antibody (e.g. wherein the glutamine residue is added to an antibody fragment).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0187">It should be noted that a single site mutation that provides a glutamine that is accessible to a TGase may yield more than one engineered glutamine residue that can be conjugated if the antibody comprises more than one engineered chain. For example, a single site mutation will yield two engineered glutamine residues in a tetrameric IgG due to the dimeric nature of the IgG antibody. The engineered glutamine residues will be in addition to any acceptor glutamine already present in an antibody, if any. The glutamine amino acid residues that are reactive, in the presence of a TGase under suitable conditions, with a compound of Formula I may be located in the heavy chain, typically in the constant domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0188">In another embodiment, a strategy for making amino acid modifications in antibodies can be used which result in compositions of antibodies (e.g. antibodies having functionalized acceptor glutamine of Formula II or IV) with greater homogeneity of resulting stoichiometry (in particular the functionalized acceptor glutamine:antibody ratio). For example, by introducing an amino acid modification at residue 297 and/or 299, antibodies can be obtained that are devoid of natural asparagine-liked glycolsylation at position 297. In one embodiment, an asparagine at amino acid position 297 is substituted with a glutamine residue. The antibody will have a constant region with a N297Q substitution (a N297Q variant antibody). In one embodiment, an asparagine at amino acid position 297 is substituted with a non-glutamine residue. The antibody will have a constant region with a N297X substitution (a N297X variant antibody), wherein X is an amino acid other than glutamine. Optionally, X is an amino acid other than glutamine and other than aspartic acid. Optionally, X is an amino acid other than glutamine and other than an electrically negatively charged amino acid. Other substitutions leading to elimination of asparagine-linked glycosylation at N297 include modifications at residues T299 (or S298 together with T299), see, e.g., any of the mutations and combinations of mutations disclosed in Sazinsky et al. 2008 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105(51):20167-20172, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. An antibody having a N297Q substitution and a glutamine at residue 295 will therefore have two conjugation sites per heavy chain. In tetravalent form will therefore have four conjugates per antibody.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0189">In one embodiment, the residue at amino acid position 297, 298 and/or 299 is substituted with a non-glutamine residue (e.g. the antibody will have a constant region with a N297X (a N297X variant antibody), S298X and/or T299X substitution, wherein X is any amino acid. Such an antibody, when comprising a glutamine at position 295 (a glutamine is naturally present in human constant regions at position 295) but no other acceptor glutamine residues will have two conjugates per antibody when the antibody comprises two heavy chains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0190">Engineered antibodies can be prepared by a variety of methods which include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants), preparation by site-directed (or oligonucleotide-mediated) mutagenesis (Carter (1985) et al Nucleic Acids Res. 13:4431-4443; Kunkel et al (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488; Liu et al (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:20252-20260), PCR mutagenesis (Ito et al (1991) Gene 102:67-70; and Vallette et al (1989) Nuc. Acids Res. 17:723-733) and cassette mutagenesis (Wells et al (1985) Gene 34:315-323) of an earlier prepared DNA encoding the polypeptide. Mutagenesis protocols, kits, and reagents are commercially available, e.g. QuikChange® Multi Site-Direct Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). Single mutations are also generated by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis using double stranded plasmid DNA as template by PCR based mutagenesis (Sambrook and Russel, (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd edition). Variants of recombinant antibodies may be constructed also by restriction fragment manipulation or by overlap extension PCR with synthetic oligonucleotides. Mutagenic primers encode the cysteine codon replacement(s). Standard mutagenesis techniques can be employed to generate DNA encoding such mutant cysteine engineered antibodies (Sambrook et al Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989; and Ausubel et al Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York. N.Y., 1993).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0194">(iii) isolating and purifying the engineered antibody.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0195">Fragments and derivatives of antibodies of this invention (which are encompassed by the term “antibody” or “antibodies” as used in this application, unless otherwise stated or clearly contradicted by context), can be produced by techniques that are known in the art. “Fragments” comprise a portion of the intact antibody, generally the antigen binding site or variable region. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, Fab′-SH, F(ab′)2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; any antibody fragment that is a polypeptide having a primary structure consisting of one uninterrupted sequence of contiguous amino acid residues (referred to herein as a “single-chain antibody fragment” or “single chain polypeptide”), including without limitation (1) single-chain Fv molecules (2) single chain polypeptides containing only one light chain variable domain, or a fragment thereof that contains the three CDRs of the light chain variable domain, without an associated heavy chain moiety and (3) single chain polypeptides containing only one heavy chain variable region, or a fragment thereof containing the three CDRs of the heavy chain variable region, without an associated light chain moiety; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Included, inter alia, are a nanobody, domain antibody, single domain antibody or a “dAb”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0196">The DNA of a hybridoma producing an antibody of the invention may be modified so as to encode a fragment of the invention. The modified DNA is then inserted into an expression vector and used to transform or transfect an appropriate cell, which then expresses the desired fragment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0197">The fragment will comprise a variable region domain that will generally be covalently attached to at least one, two or more glutamine residue covalently linked through a —NH—(C)<sub>n</sub>—X-L moiety (and optionally further a V and/or Y moiety, optionally further an R or RR′ moiety, to a moiety-of-interest Z, e.g. a polymer molecule, a drug, a radioactive moiety. The variable region will comprise hypervariable region or CDR sequences, and FR sequences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0198">The location of the glutamine residue may be varied according to the size and nature of the antibody fragment required. Thus, in one extreme example an acceptor glutamine residue to be conjugated to a lysine-based linker of Formula I may be attached directly to a C-terminal amino acid of the variable region domain. This may be for example the C-terminus of a VH or VL chain as described above. If desired, in this example, further amino acids, including further acceptor glutamine residues, may be covalently linked to the C-terminus of the first glutamine residue. In one example, a peptide “tag” comprising one or more non-glutamine residues followed by an acceptor glutamine residue (the acceptor glutamine residue is C-terminal to the non-glutamine residue in the tag) is attached directly to a C-terminal amino acid of the variable region domain. In one example, a peptide “tag” comprising one or more glutamine residues followed by one or more non-glutamine residues (the non-glutamine residues are C-terminal to the glutamine residue in the tag) is attached directly to a C-terminal amino acid of the variable region domain. A peptide tag can be of any suitable length, e.g a tag may comprise between 2 and 50, preferably 2 and 20 or 2 and 10 amino acid residues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0199">In practice however, it is generally preferable that the variable region domain is covalently attached at a C-terminal amino acid to at least one other antibody domain or a fragment thereof which contains, or is attached to one or more acceptor glutamine residues. Thus, for example where a VH domain is present in the variable region domain this may be linked to an immunoglobulin CH1 domain or a fragment thereof. Similarly a VL domain may be linked to a CK domain or a fragment thereof. In this way for example the fragment according to the invention may be a Fab fragment wherein the antigen binding domain contains associated VH and VL domains covalently linked at their C-termini to a CH1 and CK domain respectively. The CH1 domain may be extended with further amino acids, for example to provide a hinge region domain as found in a Fab′ fragment, or to provide further domains, such as antibody CH2 and CH3 domains. In one example, a polypeptide “tag” comprising one or a plurality (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) non-glutamine residues followed by a glutamine residue (the glutamine residue is C-terminal to the non-glutamine residue in the tag) is attached directly to a C-terminal amino acid of a full or truncated CH1, CH2 or CH3 domain, or to a C-terminal amino acid of a full or truncated CK domain. In one example, a polypeptide “tag” comprising one or more glutamine residues followed by one or more non-glutamine residues (the non-glutamine residues are C-terminal to the glutamine residue in the tag) is attached directly to a C-terminal amino acid of a full or truncated CH1, CH2 or CH3 domain, or to a C-terminal amino acid of a full or truncated CK domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0200">The present invention provides an antibody fragment in which the variable region domain is monomeric and comprises an immunoglobulin heavy (VH) or light (VL) chain variable domain, or is dimeric and contains VH-VH, VH-VL or VL-VL dimers in which the VH and VL chains are non-covalently associated or covalently coupled, wherein the fragment (i.e. the VL and/or VH) is covalently linked through a —NH—(C)<sub>n</sub>—X-L moiety (and optionally further a V and/or Y moiety, optionally further L′, V′, Y′, and (RR′)moieties, to a moiety-of-interest Z, e.g. a polymer molecule, a drug, a radioactive moiety.

In another embodiment, the invention provides a monovalent antibody fragment comprising a heavy chain and a light chain, wherein: said heavy chain consists of a VH domain covalently linked at its C-terminus to a CH1 domain; said light chain consists of a VL domain, which is complementary to the VH domain, covalently linked at its C-terminus to a CL domain; said CL domain comprises (e.g., the CL is extended) to provide a hinge domain which comprises a glutamine residue; and the glutamine residue in the hinge domain is covalently linked through a —NH—(C)<sub>n</sub>—X-L moiety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0202">The invention has the advantage over cysteine-based conjugation methods of not requiring cysteine-engineering to remove cysteine residues that could react with the moiety of interest. Thus, in one embodiment, the antibody fragment of the invention contains cysteine residues in the VH, CH1, VL and CL domains that are in disulphide linkage to each other; preferably the antibody fragment comprises some or all cysteines capable of forming interchain disulfide bonds in naturally present in VH, CH1, VL and CL domains. In one embodiment, the antibody comprises a light chain comprising a cysteine at position 214 and/or a heavy chain comprising a cysteine at position 127, 128, 233 and/or 235.</div>

In antibodies comprising a functionalized acceptor glutamine of Formula IVa or IVb spacing may also provide for a better accessibility of V, which in the case of enzymatic cleavage or transformation of V, may improve the rate at which V is transformed and/or cleaved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0229">L and (C)<sub>n </sub>groups can be configured based on the overall structure of the linker that is to be used.

For example, L may represent or comprise a carbon framework of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 linear carbon atoms, unsubstituted or optionally substituted at one or more atoms. Preferably, where L additionally comprises other groups, the 5-20 linear carbon atoms will be adjacent to the (C)<sub>n </sub>group, or where present, the X group.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0241">In any of the compounds of the invention (e.g. in any of Formula I, II and/or IV), linking element (L) can optionally be characterized as having a chain length of at least 2.8 Angstroms, 3, Angstroms, 4 Angstroms, 5 Angstroms, 10 Angstroms, 15 Angstroms, 18 Angstroms, 30 Angstroms, 40 Angstroms or 60 Angstroms.

Examples of compounds of Formula Ib include but are not limited to compound having the (C)<sub>n</sub>, X, L, V, Y and R groups shows in Table 3 herein. R groups in Table 3 indicated as (S) can also be S(C═O)CH<sub>3 </sub>when present as a protected reactive group. The symbol (-) in the tables indicates that the particular X, L, V or Y moiety is absent. V and Y groups, for example, can comprise any structural features in the sections titled “The V Moiety” and “The Y Moiety” herein. The L, V and/or Y groups of Formulae Ia and Ib represented in each of Tables 2 and 3 can have r, q, and/or z sites of attachment for the respective V, Y, and R or Z groups, where r and q represent the degree of branching or polymerization; r, q, and/or z can be selected from 1, 2, 3 or 4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0243">A compound of this invention may contain more than one L moiety. Any L′ moiety can be defined in the same way as a L moiety. The L moieties may or may not be the same. The linking group L may be a water-soluble moiety or contain one or more water-soluble moieties, such that L contributes to the water solubility of a compound of Formula (I)-(VI). An L may also be a moiety or contain one or more moieties that reduce(s) aggregation, which may or may not be a moiety/moieties that also increase(s) the water solubility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0244">L may be for example a linear linker or a branched linker. In one aspect, the L moiety is branched, optionally further a dendritic structure, so that it can be connected to at least two, three, four or more V, Y or R moieties (or Z where applicable). Each V-Y moiety is however only attached once to an L moiety. Branching can occur at one or more branching atoms that may for example be carbon, nitrogen, silicon, or phosphorus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0245">When the lysine-based linker comprises branching in L, the number of branches in L that are connected to V and/or Y will generally be prepared so as to equal the total number of branches available for reaction. That is, in preparing the lysine-based linker, chemical conversion will preferably be carried to completion, thereby maintain the controlled stoichiometry offered by the site-specific TGase-mediated conjugation approach. Thus, preferably, when L is branched, compounds of this invention will be functionalized such that each L, V or Y is connected to a R or Z moiety, such that the components of the mixture of antibodies (or the lysine-based linker during preparation) substantially all have the same r value. For example, it can be specified that 90%, 95%, 98% of the antibodies or the lysine-based linker have the same r value. In one embodiment, L is a linear linker. In another embodiment, L is a branched linker.</div>

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0250">R is a reactive moiety, for example a moiety comprising an unprotected or protected bioorthogonal-reaction compatible reactive group, for example an unprotected or protected thiol, epoxide, maleimide, haloacetamide, o-phoshenearomatic ester, azide, fulminate, sulfonate ester, alkyne, cyanide, amino-thiol, carbonyl, aldehyde, generally any group capable of oxime and hydrazine formation, 1,2,4,5-tetrazine, norbornene, other stained or otherwise electronically activated alkene, a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyne, generally any reactive groups which form via bioorthogonal cycloaddition reaction a 1,3- or 1,5-disubstituted triazole, any diene or strained alkene dienophile that can react via inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction, a protected or unprotected amine, a carboxylic acid, an aldehyde, or an oxyamine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0251">When more than one R group is present in a compound of the formula, the R groups will preferably be compatible such that no R group is a complementary reagent to any other R group. The L, V and/or Y groups of formulae I-IV can have r, q, and/or z sites of attachment for the respective V, Y, and R groups, where r and q represent the degree of branching or polymerization. The sites of attachment can comprise a bond or comprise a functional group selected from an alkene, alkyne, ether, thioether, ester, thioester, amine, amide, alkylamide, or other functional group readily generated by a condensation or addition reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0252">The reactive group of the linking reagent can for example chosen to undergo thio-maleimide (or haloacetamide) addition, Staudinger ligation, Huisgen 1,3-cycloaddition (click reaction), or Diels-Alder cycloaddition with a complementary reactive group attached to an agent comprising a therapeutic moiety, a diagnostic moiety, or any other moiety for a desired function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0253">Optionally, two or more compatible reactive groups can be attached to the linking reagent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0254">In one embodiment, the reactive group is a haloacetamide, (e.g. bromo-acetamide, iodo-acetamide, cloro-acetamide). Such reactive groups will be more stable in vivo (and in serum) compared with maleimide groups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0255">In one embodiment, the reactive group is a reagent capable of undergoing a “click” reaction. For example a 1,3-dipole-functional compound can react with an alkyne in a cyclization reaction to form a heterocyclic compound, preferably in the substantial absence of added catalyst (e.g., Cu(I)). A variety compounds having at least one 1,3-dipole group attached thereto (having a three-atom pi-electron system containing 4 electrons delocalized over the three atoms) can be used to react with the alkynes disclosed herein. Exemplary 1,3-dipole groups include, but are not limited to, azides, nitrile oxides, nitrones, azoxy groups, and acyl diazo groups.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">The V Moiety</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0285">The V moiety may be incorporated in the lysine-based linker (e.g. connected to L, optionally through Y). However, the V moiety may instead or in addition be incorporated in a compound comprising a moiety-of-interest Z (e.g. a compound R′-V-Y-Z of formula III) that will be reacted with an antibody conjugated with a lysine-based linker to form an antibody conjugated to the moiety-of-interest Z. Any V′ moiety can be defined in the same way as a V moiety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0286">In the compounds of the invention, the V moiety is a group that is either non-cleavable or conditionally cleavable, optionally after prior conditional transformation. In the latter case, it is designed to be transformed and/or cleaved from Y, or Z when Y is absent, by a chemical, photochemical, physical, biological, or enzymatic process, e.g. in certain conditions. This condition may for example comprise bringing a compound of the invention in an aqueous environment, which leads to hydrolysis of V, or bringing a compound of the invention in an environment that contains an enzyme that recognizes and cleaves V, or bringing a compound of the invention under reducing conditions, which leads to reduction of V, or bringing a compound of the invention in contact with radiation, e g, UV light, which leads to transformation and/or cleavage, or bringing a compound of the invention in contact with heat, which leads to transformation and/or cleavage, or bringing a compound of the invention under reduced pressure or bringing a compound of the invention under elevated or high pressure, which leads to transformation and/or cleavage. This condition may further be met after administrating a compound of this invention to an animal, e.g., a mammal: the condition may be met when the compound localizes to for example a specific organ, tissue, cell, subcellular target, or microbial target, for example by the presence of internal factors (e.g., target-specific enzymes or hypoxia) or application of external factors (e g., radiation, magnetic fields) or the condition may already be met directly upon administration (e.g., enzymes). In general, transformation of V will directly or indirectly lead to cleavage of V from Y, or Z when Y is absent. It may occur that two or more separate transformations and/or cleavages, requiring the same or different conditions, are required in order to cleave V completely from Y or Z. In this way, increased selectivity may be obtained. A compound of this invention may contain more than one V moiety. These V moieties may or may not be the same and may or may not require the same conditions for transformation and/or cleavage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0287">V may comprise for example a carbon comprising framework of 1 to 200 atoms, optionally a carbon comprising framework of at least 10 atoms, e.g. 10 to 100 atoms or 20 to 100 atoms, substituted at one or more atoms, optionally wherein the carbon comprising framework is a linear hydrocarbon or comprises a cyclic group, a symmetrically or asymmetrically branched hydrocarbon, monosaccharide, disaccharide, linear or branched oligosaccharide (asymmetrically branched or symmetrically branched), other natural linear or branched oligomers (asymmetrically branched or symmetrically branched), an amino acid, a di-, tri-, tetra-, or oligopeptide, or more generally any dimer, trimer, or higher oligomer (linear, asymmetrically branched or symmetrically branched) resulting from any chain-growth or step-growth polymerization process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0288">Generally, V may be any straight, branched and/or cyclic C<sub>2-30 </sub>alkyl, C<sub>2-30 </sub>alkenyl, C<sub>2-30 </sub>alkynyl, C<sub>2-30 </sub>heteroalkyl, C<sub>2-30 </sub>heteroalkenyl, C<sub>2-30 </sub>heteroalkynyl, optionally wherein one or more homocyclic aromatic compound radical or heterocyclic compound radical may be inserted; notably, any straight or branched C<sub>2-5 </sub>alkyl, C<sub>5-10 </sub>alkyl, C<sub>11-20 </sub>alkyl, —O—C<sub>1-5 </sub>alkyl, —O—C<sub>5-10 </sub>alkyl, —O—C<sub>11-20 </sub>alkyl, or (CH<sub>2</sub>—CH<sub>2</sub>—O—)<sub>1-24 </sub>or (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>x1</sub>—(CH<sub>2</sub>—O—CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>1-24</sub>—(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>x2</sub>-group, wherein x1 and x2 are independently an integer selected among the range of 0 to 20, an amino acid, an oligopeptide, glycan, sulfate, phosphate, or carboxylate. Optionally, V may be or absent. In some embodiments, V is a C<sub>2-6 </sub>alkyl group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0287" num="0289">In one aspect of this invention, a compound of the invention is used to target one or more therapeutic and/or diagnostic moieties Z to target cells. In this instance, V may for example contain a substrate molecule that is cleaved by an enzyme present in the vicinity of the target cells or inside the target cells, for example tumor cells. V can for example contain a substrate that is cleaved by an enzyme present at elevated levels in the vicinity of or inside the target cells as compared to other parts of the body, or by an enzyme that is present only in the vicinity of or inside the target cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0290">If target cell specificity is achieved solely based upon the selective transformation and/or cleavage of V at the target site, the condition (eventually) causing the cleavage should preferably, at least to a certain degree, be target cell-specific, whereas the presence of another target-specific moiety in the compound of the invention, for instance when the antibody recognizes an antigen present on a target cell with a degree of specificity, reduces or takes away this requirement. For example, when an antibody causes specific internalization into a target cell, an enzyme also present in other cells may transform and/or cleave V. In one embodiment, transformation and/or cleavage of V occurs intracellularly. In another embodiment, transformation and/or cleavage of V occurs extracellularly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0291">In one embodiment, the V moiety is a conditionally cleavable moiety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0292">In one embodiment, V contains a di-, tri-, tetra-, or oligopeptide which consists of an amino acid sequence recognized by a protease, for example plasmin, a cathepsin, cathepsin B, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), or a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases, present in the vicinity of or inside the target cells, for example tumor cells. In one embodiment the invention relates to a conjugate wherein V is a dipeptide, tripeptide, tetrapeptide, or oligopeptide moiety comprised of natural L amino acids, unnatural D amino acids, or synthetic amino acids, or a peptidomimetic, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, V is a peptide. In another embodiment, V is a dipeptide. In another embodiment, V is a tripeptide. In another embodiment, V is a tetrapeptide. In yet another embodiment, V is a peptidomimetic.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0296" num="0298">In yet another embodiment, V contains a substrate for one or more of the cathepsins, for example cathepsin B. When V is cleaved extracellularly, the one or more Z moieties may be released extracellularly. This may provide the advantage that these Z moieties are not only able to affect or detect the cell(s) directly surrounding the site of activation, but also cells somewhat further away from the site of activation due to diffusion (bystander effect).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0299">In one embodiment the invention relates to a compound wherein V comprises a tripeptide. The tripeptide may be linked via its C-terminus to Y. In one embodiment, the C-terminal amino acid residue of the tripeptide is selected from arginine, citrulline, and lysine, the middle amino acid residue of the tripeptide is selected from alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, cyclohexylglycine, tryptophan and proline, and the N-terminal ammo acid residue of the tripeptide is selected from any natural or unnatural amino acid.</div>

V may therefore, optionally together with the connecting atom of L and/or Y (or Z if Y is absent), for example form a carbonate, carbamate, urea, ester, amide, imine, hydrazone, oxime, disulfide, acetal, or ketal group. It is understood that V can also be or contain such a moiety and/or be transformed and/or cleaved in the same or a similar way when a compound of this invention is used for other purposes than solely improving the pharmacokinetic properties of Z.</div>

This means that V cannot be cleaved from Y, or Z when Y is absent, under the conditions the compound containing such a V moiety is designed to be applied, meaning that Z cannot be released in this way. Release of Z from a compound of this invention via another mechanism is however not excluded. When V is a non-cleavable moiety, Y may optionally be absent. A non-cleavable V moiety may be any moiety that cannot be cleaved, or that can be cleaved only very slowly, under the conditions the compound containing such a V moiety is designed to be applied, e.g. in vivo or in vitro. For example, when applied in vivo, V will not or only very slowly be cleaved by enzymes present in the in vivo model used or by hydrolysis or as a consequence of other biological processes that may occur in said model. Such V may therefore, optionally together with the connecting atom of L and/or Z, for example, be a carbonyl group, an amide group, an urea group, an ester group, a carbonate group, a carbamate group, or an optionally substituted methyleneoxy or methyleneamino group V may be preferred to be non-cleavable when it is not required that the one or more moieties Z are released.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0312" num="0314">A compound of this invention may contain more than one spacer system Y. These moieties Y may or may not be the same. In some embodiments the spacer system Y is a self-elimination spacer that is connected to one or more other self-elimination spacers via a direct bond. Herein, a single self-elimination spacer may also be referred to as a spacer system. A spacer system may be branched or unbranched and contain one or more attachment sites for Z as well as V. According to the invention, self-elimination spacers that are able to release only a single moiety are called ‘single release spacers’. Self-elimination spacers that are able to release two or more moieties are called ‘multiple release spacers’. Spacers, may be either branched or unbranched and self-eliminating through a 1,2+2n-elimination (n&gt;/=1), referred to as “electronic cascade spacers”. Spacers may eliminate through a cyclization process under formation of a cyclic urea derivative, referred to as “ω-amino aminocarbonyl cyclization spacers”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0313" num="0315">The spacer system Y may self-eliminating or non-self-eliminating. A “self-eliminating” spacer unit allows for release of the drug moiety without a separate hydrolysis step. When a self-eliminating spacer is used, after cleavage or transformation of V, the side of Y linked to V becomes unblocked, which results in eventual release of one or more moieties Z. The self-elimination spacer systems may for example be those described in WO 02/083180 and WO 2004/043493, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, as well as other self-elimination spacers known to a person skilled in the art. In certain embodiments, a spacer unit of a linker comprises a p-aminobenzyl unit. In one such embodiment, a p-aminobenzyl alcohol is attached to an amino acid unit via an amide bond, and a carbamate, methylcarbamate, or carbonate is made between the benzyl alcohol and a cytotoxic agent. In one embodiment, the spacer unit is p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PAB). Examples of self-eliminating spacer units further include, but are not limited to, aromatic compounds that are electronically similar to p-aminobenzyl alcohol (see, e.g. US 2005/0256030 A1), such as 2-aminoimidazol-5-methanol derivatives (Hay et al. (1999) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9:2237) and ortho- or para-aminobenzylacetals. Spacers can be used mat undergo cyclization upon amide bond hydrolysis, such as substituted and unsubstituted 4-aminobutyric acid amides (Rodrigues et al. Chemistry Biology, 1995, 2, 223) and 2-aminophenylpropionic acid amides (Amsberry, et al., J. Org. Chem., 1990, 55. 5867). Elimination of amine-containing drugs that are substituted at the a-position of glycine (Kingsbury, et al., J. Med. Chem., 1984, 27, 1447) are also examples of self-immolative spacers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0314" num="0316">A “non-self-eliminating” spacer unit is one in which part or all of the spacer unit remains bound to the moiety Z upon enzymatic (e.g., proteolytic) cleavage of the antibody-moiety-of-interest conjugate. Examples of non-self-eliminating spacer units include, but are not limited to, a glycine spacer unit and a glycine-glycine spacer unit. Other combinations of peptidic spacers susceptible to sequence-specific enzymatic cleavage are also contemplated. For example, enzymatic cleavage of an antibody-moiety-of-interest conjugate containing a glycine-glycine spacer unit by a tumor-cell associated protease would result in release of a glycine-glycine-drug moiety from the remainder of the antibody-moiety-of-interest conjugate. In one such embodiment, the glycine-glycine-drug moiety is then subjected to a separate hydrolysis step in the tumor cell, thus cleaving the glycine-glycine spacer unit from the drug moiety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0315" num="0317">In a compound of this invention, a spacer system Y may be connected to more than one V moiety. In this case, transformation and/or cleavage of one of these V moieties may trigger the release of one or more Z moieties.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">Conjugation of Lysine-based Linkers to an Antibody</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0317" num="0319">TGases' transamidating activity was first observed in guinea-pig liver, and later in microorganisms, plants, invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and mammals. All TGs, except plant and bacterial TGs (referred to as BTG), require Ca2+ for activation. The Ca2+ concentrations required by mammalian TGases are normally in the supraphysiological range associated with most intracellular processes and Ca2+ activation is also modulated by further regulatory processes, such that TGases are inactive under normal conditions and only activated following major disruptions in physiological homoeostatic mechanisms. Transglutaminases play an important role in biological processes which are dependent on the rapid covalent crosslinking of proteins, e.g. blood coagulation, skin-barrier formation and extracellular-matrix assembly. TGase-mediated reactions result in supramolecular protein structures with high rigidity and stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0318" num="0320">Enzymes of the TG-family catalyze covalent protein crosslinking by forming proteinase resistant isopeptide bonds between a lysine donor residue of one protein and an acceptor glutamine residue of another protein, and is accompanied by the release of ammonia. The catalytic mechanism of transglutaminases has been proposed as follows. After the Glycine-containing first substrate (acceptor or Q-substrate) binds to the enzyme, it forms a γ-glutamylthioester with the cysteine residue in the active center of TGase, known as the acylenzyme intermediate, accompanied by the release of ammonia. The second substrate (donor or K-substrate) then binds to the acylenzyme intermediate and attacks the thioester bond. The product (two proteins crosslinked by an Nε(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopetide bridge) is formed and released. This re-establishes the active-centre Cys residue of the enzyme in its original form and allows it to participate in another cycle of catalysis. The formation of the covalent acylenzyme intermediate is thought to be the rate-limiting step in these reactions. The catalytic triad of many transglutaminases is papain-like, containing Cys-His-Asp (where His is histidine and Asp is aspartic acid) and, crucially, a tryptophan (Trp) residue located 36 residues away from the active-centre Cys. In contrast, bacterial TG isolated from <i>Streptoverticillium </i>sp (vide supra) has an atypical catalytic triad and shows no sequence homology with the papain-like catalytic triad of other TGases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0321">TGases display strict specificity in recognition of glutamine protein substrates. However, TGases display broad specificity for recognition of the acyl-acceptor amine group, which can either be the ε-amino group of peptidyl lysine or a low-molecular mass primary amine (frequently a polyamine) (see, e.g. Folk, et al. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3695-3700. For example, in addition to lysine, the small lysine-mimicking primary amine 5-pentylamine (cadaverin) and variants or fragments thereof can efficiently bind to the acylenzyme intermediate, and a pseudo-isopeptide bond with the glutamine-containing protein is formed. See, e.g., Lorand, L. et al. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 1756-1765 (1979); Murthy, S. N. et al. (1994). J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22907-22911 (1994); Murthy, P. et al. (2009) Biochemistry (2009).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0322">Bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic TGases have been characterized and differ in several ways from mammalian TGases (Lorand, L. &amp; Graham, R. M. (2003) Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 4, 140-156). BTG and more generally microbial TGases (EC 2.3.2.13, protein-glutamine-γ-glutamyltransferase) such as <i>Streptomyces mobaraensis </i>are calcium-independent and have an amino acid sequence of) very different from those of mammalian TGs (Ando et al. (1989) Agric. Biol. Chem. 53, 2613-2617). BTG is furthermore much smaller (37.8 kDa versus 76.6 kDa for guinea pig liver TG). Additionally, BTG shows broader substrate specificity for the amine acceptor glutamine substrates in proteins than do mammalian TGases. These characteristics, together with a higher reaction rate, low cost of production, and a decreased tendency to catalyze deamidation make BTG a preferred enzyme for use in industrial applications such as those of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0321" num="0323">The antibodies that are to be conjugated to the lysine-based linker will preferably be free of N-linked glycosylation (e.g. an antibody which does not comprises glycosylation sites or a modified full-length antibody). Full-length wild-type IgG antibodies naturally comprise N-linked glycosylation at residue 297 of the heavy chain which interferes and prevents with TGase-mediated conjugation onto glutamine residues in the CH2 domain. Consequently, antibodies may be deglycosylated. Deglycosylation can be carried out as described herein or according to any suitable method. For example, antibody (1 mg) in PBS buffer (0.1 mol/L NaCl and 0.05 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) are incubated with 100 units (0.2 μL) of N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) from <i>Flavobacterium meningosepticum </i>(New England BioLabs, Ipswich, UK) at 37° C. overnight. The enzyme is then removed by centrifugation-dialysis (Vivaspin MWCO 50 kDa, Vivascience, Winkel, Switzerland). The product can be analyzed by LC/MS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0322" num="0324">In one embodiment, the product is analyzed for drug loading (e.g. number of conjugates per antibody. Such methods can be used to determine the mean number of conjugates per antibody (e.g., the mean DAR) as well as the distribution of number of conjugates per antibody in a composition, i.e. the percentage of total antibody with any given level of drug loading or DAR. The portion of antibodies having a number (n) of conjugated acceptor glutamines (e.g. n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) can be determined. One technique adapted to such determination and more generally drug loading is hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), HIC can be carried out as described for example in Hamblett et al. (2004) Cancer Res. 10: 7063-7070; Wakankar et al. (2011) mAbs 3(2): 161-172; and Lyon et al (2012) Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 502: 123-138, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0323" num="0325">The method allows the application of any suitable type of transglutaminase (TGase) for this purpose. Several types of transglutaminases have been reported in various living organisms including microbials. Examples are TGase from guinea pig liver (GTGase), fish liver (FTGase) and microorganisms (MTGase) and any recombinant TGase (rTGase). Other TGases than the ones listed here can also be used according to the invention. Examples of useful TGases include microbial transglutaminases, such as e.g. from <i>Streptomyces mobaraense, Streptomyces cinnamoneum </i>and <i>Streptomyces griseocarneum </i>fall disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,156,956, which is incorporated herein by reference), and <i>Streptomyces lavendulae </i>(disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,469, which is incorporated herein by reference) and <i>Streptomyces ladakanum </i>(JP2003199569, which is incorporated herein by reference). It should be noted that members of the former genus <i>Streptoverticillium </i>are now included in the genus <i>Streptomyces </i>(Kaempfer, J Gen Microbiol, 137, 1831-1892, 1991). Other useful microbial transglutaminases have been isolated from <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>(disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,183, which is incorporated herein by reference) and from various Myxomycetes. Other examples of useful microbial transglutaminases are those disclosed in WO 96/06931 (e.g. transglutaminase from <i>Bacillus lydicus</i>) and WO 96/22366, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Useful non-microbial transglutaminases include guinea-pig liver transglutaminase, and transglutaminases from various marine sources like the flat fish Pagrus major (disclosed in EP-0555649, which is incorporated herein by reference), and the Japanese oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas </i>(disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,356, which is incorporated herein by reference). A preferred TGase is bacterial transglutaminase (BTG) (see, e.g. EC 2.3.2.13, protein-glutamine-γ-glutamyltransferase). In a more preferred embodiment, the TGase is from <i>S. mobaraense</i>. In another embodiment, the TGase is a mutant TGase having at least 80% sequence homology with native TGase. A preferred example is recombinant bacterial transglutaminase derived from <i>streptomyces mobaraensis </i>(available from Zedira, Darmstadt, Germany).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0324" num="0326">The TGase-catalyzed reaction can be carried out under mild conditions, from several hours to a day (e.g. overnight). Recombinant BTG (EC 2.3.2.13) from <i>streptomyces mobaraensis </i>(Zedira, Darmstadt, Germany) can be used at a concentration of between 1 and 20 U/mL, preferably between 6 U/mL and 20 U/mL. The lysine-based linker substrates are reacted with antibody (1 mg/mL) at ligand concentrations between 400 and 600 mol/L, providing a 60 to 90-fold excess of the substrates over the antibody, or optionally at lower excess of substrates, e.g. 1- to 20-fold, or 10-20 fold. The reactions are performed in potassium-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 8) at 37° C. After 4 h to several days (depending on the antibody and the ligand), steady-state conditions are achieved. Excess ligand and enzyme are then removed using centrifugation-dialysis (Vivaspin MWCO 50 kDa, Vivascience, Winkel, Switzerland). Reactions are monitored by LC/MS. Higher amounts of TGase can be used as a function of different lysine-derivatives and substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0325" num="0327">An acceptor glutamine present on an antibody (e.g. part of the antibody's primary structure, including for example an antibody fragment with a peptide tag) will, under suitable conditions, be recognized by a TGase and covalently bound to a lysine-based linker (e.g., compound of Formula I). The results is an antibody of Formula II (the acceptor glutamine is functionalized with the compound of Formula I). Resulting antibody conjugates can be analyzed using any suitable method. Preferably, the stoichiometry of the conjugated antibodies can be characterized by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) using a top-down approach in order to assess the number of lysine-based linker and/or where applicable moieties-of-interest conjugated to antibodies, and in particular the homogeneity of the composition. Conjugates can be reduced before LC/MS analysis and light chains and heavy chains are measured separately.</div>

Connections to Y, V or L may optionally be via R or RR′. Connection may be via any suitable atoms. In one embodiment, Z is coupled via oxygen (from for example a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group), carbon (from for example a carbonyl group), nitrogen (from for example a primary or secondary amino group), or sulfur (from for example a sulfhydryl group). In one embodiment, Z is coupled in the compounds of this invention via a group such that its therapeutic abilities or diagnostic characteristics are, at least partly, blocked or masked. In case a compound of the invention is to be used for treating or preventing disease in an animal, e.g., a mammal, the Z moieties are generally therapeutic moieties. In case a compound of the invention is used to make a diagnosis or used in an ex vivo or in vivo diagnostic assay, the Z moieties are generally diagnostic moieties, for example chromogenic, fluorogenic, phosphorogenic, chemiluminescent, or bio luminescent compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0349" num="0351">In one embodiment, the Z moiety is compound, preferably an organic compound, having a molecular weight of at least 300 g/mol, 400 g/mol, 500 g/mol, 600 g/mol, 700 g/mol, 800 g/mol, 900 g/mol, 1000-g/mol or 2000 g/mol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0352">In one embodiment, the Z moiety is a chemical compound displaying hydrophobic properties, optionally additionally having a molecular weight of at least 300 g/mol, 400 g/mol, 500 g/mol, 600 g/mol, 700 g/mol, 800 g/mol, 900 g/mol. 1000-g/mol or 2000 g/mol. Hydrophobic character may be determined, for example, by decreased water solubility, decreased polarity, decreased potential for hydrogen bonding, and/or an increased oil/water partition coefficient. The presently disclosed methods can be used to produce antibody conjugates where moiety of interest (Z) comprises a hydrophobic drug. As used herein, the term “hydrophobic” is a physical property of a molecule that is repelled from a mass of water. Hydrophobic compounds can be solubilized in nonpolar solvents, including but not limited to, organic solvents. Hydrophobicity can be conferred by the inclusion of apolar or nonpolar chemical groups that include, but are not limited to, saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups and such groups substituted by one or more aromatic, cycloaliphatic or heterocyclic group(s). Conversely, “hydrophilic” molecules are capable of hydrogen bonding with a water molecule and are therefore soluble in water and other polar solvents. The terms “hydrophilic” and “polar” can be used interchangeably. Hydrophilic characteristics derive from the presence of polar or charged groups, such as carbohydrates, phosphate, carboxylic, sulfato, amino, sulfhydryl, nitro, hydroxy and other like groups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0351" num="0353">Hydrophobic molecules are poorly water soluble, for example, having a solubility of less than about 10 mg/ml. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic compound can have a solubility of less than about 1 mg/ml in water. In other embodiments, the hydrophobic compound has a solubility in water of less than about 50, μg/ml, 10 μg/ml, and in particular embodiments, about 1 μg/ml or 2.5 μg/ml. In other embodiments, the hydrophobic compound can have a solubility of about 0.001 μg/ml to about 10 mg/ml, including but not limited to 0.001 μg/ml, 0.01 μg/ml, 0.1 μg/ml, 1 μg/ml, 2 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml, 100 μg/ml, 500 μg/ml, 1 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml, and 10 mg/ml, and any other concentration between 0.001 μg/ml and 10 mg/ml.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0352" num="0354">Representative, non-limiting examples of hydrophobic drugs that can be formulated using the presently disclosed methods include taxanes, e.g. paclitaxel (PTX), and camptothecin (CPT), maytansanoids, duocarmycins, dolastatins and auristatins. Such drugs are poorly soluble in water, e.g. PTX has a solubility in water of less than about 1 μg/ml, CPT has a water solubility of about 2.5 μg/ml. Linkers and modified antibodies of the invention can advantageously link hydrophobic drugs to antibodies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0353" num="0355">In other embodiments, in view of hydrophobic drugs being poor substrates for TGase (in the absence of improved linkers or modified antibodies of the invention), the Z moiety may advantageously be a hydrophilic drug. Examples of hydrophilic drugs include amatoxins. Amatoxins are cyclic peptides composed of 8 amino acids as isolated from the genus <i>Amanita</i>. Amatoxins also include a range of chemical derivatives, semisynthetic analogs and synthetic analogs built from building blocks according to the master structure of the −5 natural compounds (cyclic, 8 aminoacids), synthetic or semisynthetic analogs containing non-hydroxylated amino acids instead of the hydroxylated amino acids, synthetic or semisynthetic analogs, in which the thioether sulfoxide moiety is replaced by a sulfide, sulfone, or by atoms different from sulfur, e.g. a carbon atom as in a carbaanalog of amanitin. Functionally, amatoxins are defined as peptides or depsipeptides that inhibit mammalian RNA polymerase IT. Preferred amatoxins are those with a functional group (e.g. a carboxylic group, an amino group, a hydroxy group, a thiol or a thiol-capturing group) that can be reacted with linker molecules or proteins. Amatoxins are described for example in European Patent publication no. 1859811, PCT publication nos. WO2010/115630 and WO2012/041504).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0354" num="0356">In one embodiment, the Z moiety is a large compound (e.g., molecular weight of at least 300 g/mol, 400 g/mol, 500 g/mol, 600 g/mol or 700 g/mol) comprising a polycyclic group, tricycle or one or more macrocycles. Such groups are often typical of hydrophobic and/or rigid structures. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that comprise a macrocycle (e.g. a ring of nine or more atoms) include maytansinoids, amatoxins, epothilones and taxanes. In one embodiment, the Z moiety comprises a ring of 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 atoms, or between 9 and 200 atoms. In one embodiment, the Z moiety is a chemical compound having a negative charge, optionally additionally displaying hydrophobic properties and/or having a molecular weight of at least 300 g/mol, 400 g/mol, 500 g/mol, 600 g/mol, 700 g/mol, 800 g/mol, 900 g/mol, 1000 g/mol or 2000 g/mol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0355" num="0357">When more than one Z moiety is connected to a self-elimination spacer system Y or Y′, at least one Z should be released upon self-elimination of Y or Y′. The moiety Z initially released may be a moiety that is not a fully active moiety itself. In other words, Z may be a moiety that has limited diagnostic or therapeutic abilities, e.g. a moiety that acts as a prodrug. Such a Z moiety may require further processing or metabolism, e.g., hydrolysis, enzymatic cleavage, or enzymatic modification (for example phosphorylation, reduction, or oxidation) in order to become fully active. In one embodiment, such further processing is intentionally designed for Z to for example allow Z to reach its final target or cross a biological barrier, e.g., a cell membrane or a nuclear membrane, before it is fully activated. Z may for example contain a hydrophobic moiety that enables Z to cross a cell membrane. This hydrophobic moiety may then be hydrolyzed or removed in any other way intracellularly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0356" num="0358">In one aspect of the invention, a Z moiety may be a backbone (e.g. polymer) to which a plurality of drugs or diagnostic moieties are linked. For example, Z may be a polyacetal- or polyacetal derivative-based polymer comprising a plurality of drug molecules, see, e.g., Yurkovetskiy et al. (2004) Mol. Pharm. 1(5): 375-382 and WO 2011/120053, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference; for example Z may be a polymer compound of Formula I of WO 2011/120053 comprising a plurality of cytotoxic anti-cancer agents.</div>

An alkylation agent is a compound that can replace a hydrogen atom with an alkyl group under physiological conditions (e.g. pH 7.4, 37 C, aqueous solution). Alkylation reactions are typically described in terms of substitution reactions by N, O and S heteroatomic nucleophiles with the electrophilic alkylating agent, although Michael addition reactions are also important. Examples of alkylating agents include nitrogen and sulfur mustards, ethylenimines, methanosulfonates, CC-1065 and duocarmycins, nitrosoureas, platinum-containing agents, agents that effectuate Topoisomerase II-mediated site dependent alkylation of DNA (e.g. psorospermin and related bisfuranoxanthones), ecteinascidin and other or related DNA minor groove alkylation agents.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0407" num="0409">In one embodiment, the Z moiety is an epothilone or epothilone derivative. An epothilone is a cyclic molecule with a 16-membered ring and variable substituents and pharmaceutical activity as a cytostatic agent that binds to tubulin. Various epothilone derivatives are known, including variants with 14-, 15- or 18-membered rings have also been developed (e.g. WO2011085523; WO2009105969). Examples of epothilones or epothilone analogs or derivative in the context of the present invention include epothilone A, epothilone B, epothilone C, 13-alkyl-epothilone C derivatives, epothilone D, trans-epothilone D, epothilone E, epothilone F, an effector conjugate of epothilone, Sagopilone, or any of the epothilones referred to in the literature as ixabepilone (BMS-247550), BMS-310705, EPO-906, Patupilone, Kos-862, Kos-1584, Kos-1803 and ABJ 879, and pharmaceutically active salts thereof. The production of epothilones, their precursors and derivatives is generally carried out according to the methods known to one skilled in the art. Suitable methods are, for example, described in DE 19907588, WO 98/25929, WO 99/58534, WO 99/2514, WO 99/67252, WO 99/67253, WO 99/7692, EP 99/4915, WO 00/485, WO 00/1333, WO 00/66589, WO 00/49019, WO 00/49020, WO 00/49021, WO 00/71521, WO 00/37473, WO 00/57874, WO 01/92255, WO 01/81342, WO 01/73103, WO 01/64650, WO 01/70716, U.S. Pat.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0410" num="0412">The chelated metal may be for example one of the above types of metal chelated with any suitable polydentate chelating agent, for example acyclic or cyclic polyamines, polyethers, (e.g. crown ethers and derivatives thereof); polyamides; porphyrins; and carbocyclic derivatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0411" num="0413">In general, the type of chelating agent will depend on the metal in use. One particularly useful group of chelating agents in conjugates according to the invention, however, are acyclic and cyclic polyamines, especially polyaminocarboxylic acids, for example diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and derivatives thereof, and macrocyclic amines, e.g. cyclic tri-aza and tetra-aza derivatives (for example as described in PCT publication no. WO 92/22583); and polyamides, especially desferriox-amine and derivatives thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0412" num="0414">Other effector molecules may include detectable substances useful for example in diagnosis. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive nuclides, positron emitting metals (for use in positron emission tomography), and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. See generally U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics. Suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; suitable prosthetic groups include streptavidin, avidin and biotin; suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride and phycoerytbrin; suitable luminescent materials include luminol; suitable bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and suitable radioactive nuclides include <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>111</sup>In and <sup>99</sup>Tc.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0414" num="0416">Particular optional substituents which may be present on the above-mentioned synthetic polymers include one or more hydroxy, methyl or methoxy groups. Particular examples of synthetic polymers include optionally substituted straight or branched chain poly(ethyleneglycol), poly(propyleneglycol), poly(vinylalcohol) or derivatives thereof, especially optionally substituted poly(ethyleneglycol) such as methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or derivatives thereof. Such compounds, when used as a moiety Z can be employed as a moiety that improves the pharmacokinetic properties of the antibody.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0415" num="0417">The size of the polymer may be varied as desired, but will generally be in an average molecular weight range from 500 Da to 50,000 Da, preferably from 5,000 to 40,000 Da and more preferably from 10,000 to 40,000 Da and 20,000 to 40,000 Da. The polymer size may in particular be selected on the basis of the intended use of the product for example ability to localize to certain tissues such as tumors or extend circulating half-life (for review see Chapman, 2002, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 54, 531-545). Thus, for example, where the product is intended to leave the circulation and penetrate tissue, for example for use in the treatment of a tumor, it may be advantageous to use a small molecular weight polymer, for example with a molecular weight of around 5,000 Da. For applications where the product remains in the circulation, it may be advantageous to use a higher molecular weight polymer, for example having a molecular weight in the range from 20,000 Da to 40,000 Da.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0416" num="0418">Particularly preferred polymers include a polyalkylene polymer, such as a poly(ethyleneglycol) or, especially, a methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or a derivative thereof, and especially with a molecular weight in the range from about 10,000 Da to about 40,000 Da.</div>

It is believed that BTG activity is inhibited by negative electrical charges. One possible explanation is therefore that a negative electrical charge at the amino acid residue at the +2 position relative to the acceptor glutamine inhibits BTG's ability to couple onto the glutamine within the particular context of the Fc domain of the antibody. The findings therefore open the possibility to use modified antibodies where aspartic acids are no longer present at the +2 position for the coupling of large and/or hydrophobic molecules to antibodies, or more generally to modify antibodies to avoid negative electrical charges adjacent to the acceptor glutamine, notably at the +2 position.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0571" num="0573">The selectivity of BTG coupling with respect to labeling of the heavy and light chain of a diverse range of human antibodies of various isotypes was studied by reacting human polyclonal antibodies with biotin-cadaverin as substrate in the presence of BTG.

SDS-PAGE analysis of the conjugates revealed lack of substantial labeling of the heavy chain of the antibodies. Thus, BTG does not functionalize glutamines present within the variable regions of the antibodies.</div>
