<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the invention relate to a semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, a diode or an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) with a breakdown voltage of 600 V or 1200 V has been known as a power semiconductor device. The power semiconductor device is generally used in a power conversion device, such as a converter or an inverter, and needs to have characteristics such as low loss, low power consumption, a high processing speed, and high efficiency. In recent years, a semiconductor device in which a drift layer has a field stop (FS) layer structure has been proposed as the power semiconductor device for achieving the characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The FS layer structure has an impurity concentration higher than the drift layer and has a gentle concentration gradient such that the depletion layer does not reach the cathode of the diode (the collector of the IGBT) when the semiconductor device is turned off. In addition, in the FS layer structure, a region with the same conduction type as the drift layer is provided on the cathode side of the drift layer (the collector side in the IGBT). The use of the FS layer structure makes it possible to prevent punch-through when an off-voltage is applied. When the FS layer structure is used, it is possible to obtain the same breakdown voltage as that in a semiconductor device without the FS layer structure even though the thickness of the drift layer is small. As a result, it is possible to reduce the on-voltage. In addition, since the thickness of the drift layer is small, the number of excess carriers in the drift layer is reduced. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the reverse recovery loss of the diode (turn-off loss in the IGBT).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">When the semiconductor device with the FS layer structure is manufactured (produced), the following method has been used as a method for preventing the breaking of a wafer during a wafer process. A thick wafer is put to the wafer process. First, a semiconductor function region (including an aluminum (Al) electrode film) required for a device is formed on the front surface of the wafer. Then, the rear surface of the wafer is ground such that the thickness of the wafer is reduced to a value substantially equal to that in the finish process. Then, n-type impurity ions, such as phosphorus (P) ions or selenium (Se) ions, are implanted into the ground rear surface of the wafer to form an FS layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in this method, it is difficult to perform heat treatment for activating the FS layer after the ions are implanted into the rear surface of the wafer at a temperature equal to or higher than the deterioration temperature of the Al electrode film on the front surface of the wafer. Therefore, when the heat treatment for activating the FS layer needs to be performed at a temperature equal to or higher than the deterioration temperature of the Al electrode film on the front surface of the wafer, the Al electrode film needs to be formed on the front surface of the wafer with a small thickness (hereinafter, referred to as a thin wafer) after the FS layer is formed, that is, after the rear surface of the wafer is ground. As a result, the number of processes increases in the thin wafer state. Therefore, there is a concern that the wafer will be likely to be broken and yield will be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the problem that the number of processes increases in the thin wafer state after the rear surface is ground, a new method has been developed which forms an FS layer structure including an n buffer layer (corresponding to the FS layer) that is obtained by changing a crystal defect formed in the drift layer by proton radiation into a donor. According to this method, it is possible to activate the FS layer at a temperature lower than the deterioration temperature of the Al electrode film. In addition, a diode or an IGBT has been proposed in which a broad buffer (BB) layer structure is provided in a drift layer in order to reduce the loss or oscillation of the diode or the IGBT (for example, see the following Patent Literature 1).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">A method of forming the BB layer <b>7</b> using proton radiation has been known as the method of forming the BB layer structure.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, a structure has been proposed in which a termination process is performed for a crystal defect formed by the implantation of hydrogen ions to reduce a leakage current or the peak intensity (hereinafter, referred to as DLTS signal peak intensity) of trap density measured by a deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) method is high in the crystal defect with a trap level generated by the hydrogen termination process (for example, see the following Patent Literature 3). In addition, a method has been proposed which introduce a vacancy into the wafer formed by the CZ (Czochralski) method using proton radiation, performed a heat treatment to diffuse oxygen to the outside, and forms a low-oxygen precipitation layer (for example, see the following Patent Literature 4).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Hereinafter, a semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to exemplary embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the specification and the accompanying drawings, in the layers or regions having “n” or “p” appended thereto, an electron or a hole means a major carrier. In addition, symbols “+” and “−” added to n or p mean that impurity concentration is higher and lower than that of the layer without the symbols. In the description of the following embodiments and the accompanying drawings, the same components are denoted by the same reference numerals and the description thereof will not be repeated. The invention is not limited to the following embodiments as long as it does not depart from the scope and spirit thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">First, crystal defects formed by proton radiation will be described. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a characteristic diagram illustrating a DLTS spectrum waveform of a semiconductor device according to embodiments of the invention after proton radiation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a spectrum waveform (mark ♦) when the details of the crystal defect formed by proton radiation for forming an FS layer of the semiconductor device according to embodiments of the invention, which will be described below, are measured by a DLTS (Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy) method. In addition, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a spectrum waveform (mark □) obtained by the DLTS method when helium (He) radiation is performed under the same conditions as the proton radiation. After the proton radiation, a heat treatment was performed at a temperature of 350° C. for one hour.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the horizontal axis is an absolute temperature (K) and indicates the depth of the trap level of the crystal defect formed in a silicon substrate. The depth of the trap level increases from the left side to the right side of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. A DLTS signal (DLTS signal intensity) on the vertical axis indicates a capacitance variation (ΔF). The peak waveforms represented by peaks <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> indicate the trap density of the crystal defect, that is, crystal defect density at each trap level which is measured on the basis of the capacitance variation (ΔF). In addition, as peak intensity (DLTS signal peak intensity) increases, the trap density increases, that is, the total number of crystal defects increases (which holds for the horizontal axis and the vertical axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">As can be seen from the result shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, as described above, three peaks <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> have been found in the proton radiation. The inventors have found that peak <b>1</b> is a VO complex defect caused by a vacancy (V) and an oxygen (O) atom, peak <b>2</b> is a VOH complex defect caused by the vacancy (V), the oxygen (O) atom, and a hydrogen (H) atom, and peak <b>3</b> is a (VV+VP) complex defect caused by a divacancy (VV), the vacancy (V), and a phosphorus (P) atom. In the helium radiation, peak <b>1</b> (VO complex defect) caused by the vacancy and oxygen and peak <b>3</b> (VV+VP complex defect) caused by the divacancy, the vacancy, and phosphorus have been found, but peak <b>2</b> has not been found.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">As such, in the proton radiation, as described above, peak <b>2</b> (VOH complex defect) caused by the vacancy, oxygen, and hydrogen can be found as a high clear peak in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, unlike the helium irradiation. In addition, the inventors have found that, among the three crystal defects, only the VOH complex defect caused by the vacancy, oxygen, and hydrogen indicated by peak <b>2</b> contributes as a donor source. In addition, the contribution of peak <b>2</b> as the donor source can be known from the fact that there is little VOH complex defect represented by peak <b>2</b> among the crystal defects formed by helium radiation as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and the fact that the change of the defect into the donor does not occur in the helium radiation unlike the proton radiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">From the above-mentioned results, the inventors found that the formation of crystal defects under the conditions that peak <b>2</b> (VOH complex defect) was a main component was effective in changing a defect into a donor with high efficiency, that is, obtaining a donor layer which was little affected by an increase in an on-voltage or an increase in a leakage current. In addition, the inventors found that, when the peak value of the DLTS signal intensity of the VV+VP complex defect was less than the peak value of the DLTS signal intensity of the VOH complex defect and the VO complex defect, it was possible to increase peak concentration (hereinafter, referred to as donor peak concentration) in the concentration distribution of the donor layer, reduce the leakage current, and reduce the on-voltage, which will be described below.</div>

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, data at an annealing temperature of 0° C. on the horizontal axis does not mean that annealing is performed at 0° C., but means that annealing is not performed at a temperature higher than room temperature (20° C. to 30° C.) (which holds for the other drawings).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">The DLTS spectrum waveform is acquired under the conditions shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a characteristic diagram illustrating DLTS measurement conditions. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the distribution of carrier concentration (that is, impurity concentration) obtained by the C-V method or the DLTS method, depending on the distance from the anode region <b>4</b>. The C-V method or the DLTS method increases the voltage applied to the semiconductor device and measures the impurity concentration at the position of the end of the depletion layer which is spread depending on the voltage. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the DLTS spectrum waveform is acquired by the voltage at the position (peak position) where the impurity concentration is the maximum. The DLTS spectrum waveform is acquired by changing (sweeping) the temperature of the element to be measured from a very low temperature (a few K; K is Kelvin and is an absolute temperature) to a temperature close to room temperature (for example, 300 K) according to the known DLTS method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The DLTS method observes a transient change (the phenomenon of emitting carriers from the trap) in the capacitance of the depletion layer when a pulsed voltage is applied, while changing (sweeping) the temperature, thereby measuring energy for activating the trap with a deep level, a capture cross-section, and the trap density of a crystal defect. The DLTS method uses that the carrier emission time (time constant) is a function of temperature. In the DLTS method, the time range (time constant) to be measured is fixed and the temperature is increased from a very low temperature (low temperature obtained from, for example, liquid helium or liquid nitrogen). Then, a capacitance difference (DLTS signal (ΔF)) depending on the temperature difference (K) when the temperature is swept is plotted to obtain a curve which is called a DLTS spectrum with a peak value corresponding to the depth (the energy level from the center of the energy gap) of the trap level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">As can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the same proton radiation, the type of main crystal defect varied depending on the conditions of the subsequent heat treatment. The result shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> proved that the number of VV+VP complex defects caused by a divacancy (VV), a vacancy (V), and phosphorus (P) was the largest when no annealing (mark x) was performed, the number of VOH complex defects caused by a vacancy (V), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H) was the largest when annealing (mark ♦) was performed under the conditions of this embodiment, and the DLTS signal peak intensity of the VOH complex defect was more than the DLTS signal peak intensity of the other defects. In addition, as can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the DLTS signal (DLTS signal intensity) (ΔF) is approximately zero when annealing (mark ◯) is performed under a high temperature condition of 500° C. or more and most of the crystal defects are removed by the heat treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the maximum intensity of each of the VOH complex defect, the VO complex defect, and the VV+VP complex defect with respect to DLTS signal intensity at an annealing temperature other than the conditions (350° C.) of this embodiment. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an annealing temperature of 0° C. corresponds to the case in which no annealing is performed and an annealing temperature of 500° C. or more corresponds to the case in which annealing is performed at a high temperature condition of 500° C. or more. As can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when no annealing is performed (which is displayed at a position corresponding to 0° C.) and when annealing is performed under the conditions (350° C.) of this embodiment, the donor layer is formed. As can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the magnitude relationship among the maximum intensities of signals in three types of defects, that is, the ratio of the maximum intensities is different.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">When no annealing is performed, the ratio of the maximum intensities of the DLTS signals is VOH:VO:VV+VP=0.5:2:4 and the VV+VP complex defect has the highest signal intensity. On the other hand, when annealing is performed under the conditions of this embodiment, the signal intensity of the VOH complex defect is the highest and the ratio is VOH:VO:VV+VP=2:1:1. That is, even though the donor layer is formed by proton radiation, the configuration of the density of the defects (trap levels) is different when no annealing is performed and when annealing is performed under the conditions of this embodiment. A difference in the configuration ratio of the DLTS signal intensity strongly appears in the characteristics which will be described below. It was confirmed that, when annealing was performed at a temperature higher than 350° C., the maximum intensity of the DLTS signal of each defect was reduced while the same ratio (2:1:1) as that when annealing was performed under the conditions of this embodiment was maintained. In the annealing performed under a high temperature condition of 500° C. or more, DLTS signal intensity is zero in any defect, which means that the number of defects is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the relationship between the annealing temperature and the peak concentration (donor peak concentration) of the concentration distribution of the donor layer obtained by the C-V method or the DLTS method. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the donor peak concentration is the highest at an annealing temperature of 300° C. and is substantially equal to bulk crystal concentration at a temperature of 450° C. or more. In particular, it was confirmed that peak concentration when the annealing temperature was 300° C. was substantially equal to that when the annealing temperature was 350° C., was reduced to about one third of that when the annealing temperature was 400° C., and was equal to that when no annealing is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">The on-voltage Vf-leakage current Ir characteristics of the semiconductor device according to embodiments of the invention with respect to the annealing temperature after proton radiation were verified and the verification result was different from the results shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a characteristic diagram illustrating the relationship between the annealing temperature and the Vf-Ir characteristics after proton radiation in the semiconductor device according to Example 1. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the on-voltage Vf when a forward current of a diode is 200 A/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the leakage current Ir when a reverse bias of the diode is 600 V, with respect to the annealing temperature. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the on-voltage Vf and the leakage current Ir are both the maximum when no annealing is performed. The on-voltage Vf and the leakage current Ir are reduced when annealing is performed at a temperature of 300° C. or more. In particular, the rate of reduction in the on-voltage Vf and the leakage current Ir at a unit temperature is high in the temperature range of 300° C. to 400° C. In particular, the leakage current at an annealing temperature of 350° C. is reduced to about one third of the leakage current at an annealing temperature of 300° C. As such, the electrical characteristics tend to be different from the DLTS signal intensity and the donor peak concentration shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">That is, the results shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 6</figref> proved that, in order to increase the donor peak concentration and reduce the leakage current, it was necessary to control the ratio of the DLTS signal intensities of the VOH complex defect, the VO complex defect, and the VV+VP complex defect, in addition to increasing the concentration of oxygen or performing annealing at a high temperature. The reason why the leakage current Ir when no annealing is performed is different from that when annealing is performed at a temperature of 300° C. even though the donor peak concentration is high is that the DLTS signal intensity ratio of the VV+VP complex defect is relatively higher than that of the VOH complex defect and the VO complex defect, that is, trap level density is high. The reason why the donor peak concentration when annealing is performed at a temperature of 350° C. is substantially equal to the donor peak concentration when annealing is performed at a temperature of 300° C., but the leakage current Ir when annealing is performed at a temperature of 350° C. is reduced to about one third of that when annealing is performed at a temperature of 300° C. is that the DLTS signal intensity of the VV+VP complex defect is equal to or less than half the DLTS signal intensity of the VOH complex defect and the VO complex defect, particularly, the DLTS signal intensity of the VO complex defect is close to that of the VOH complex defect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">When the characteristics of embodiments of the invention are summarized from the above-mentioned results, it is preferable that a preferred embodiment have the following three characteristics:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">(a) The DLTS signal intensity (that is, trap level density) of the VOH complex defect is the highest;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">(b) The DLTS signal intensity (trap level density) of the VOH complex defect and the VO complex defect is higher than that of the VV+VP complex defect, preferably, is equal to or more than two times the DLTS signal intensity of the VV+VP complex defect; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">(c) The ratio of the DLTS signal intensities of the VOH complex defect, the VO complex defect, and the VV+VP complex defect is as follows when the VO complex defect is seen as a parameter: VOH:VO:VV+VP is <b>2</b>:<b>1</b>:<b>1</b> and <b>2</b>:<b>2</b>:<b>1</b> and the ratio thereof is, for example, 2:1.2:1, 2:1.5:1, or 2:1.8:1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">According to embodiments of the invention, since the heat treatment is performed at a temperature equal to or higher than 300° C. and equal to or lower than 450° C. at which the VOH complex defect caused by vacancy (V), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H) which contribute to changing a defect into a donor is the main crystal defect, the rate of changing a defect into a donor is improved and a large number of main crystal defects are changed into donors. Therefore, a forward voltage drop (on-voltage Vf) due to the crystal defect and the influence of the crystal defect on the leakage current Ir are reduced and a desired donor change condition is obtained. In particular, when the annealing temperature is equal to or higher than 350° C. and equal to or lower than 400° C., the ratio of the DLTS signal intensities (trap level densities) of VOH:VO:VV+VP have all of the above-mentioned characteristics (a), (b), and (c), which is preferable. It is more preferable that the annealing temperature be higher than 350° C. and lower than 400° C.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Next, a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device according to embodiments of the invention will be described in detail. In this embodiment, an example in which the pin diode with a breakdown voltage of 1200 V shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is manufactured will be described. An FZ-n-type silicon semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a wafer <b>1</b>) with a resistivity of 90 Ωcm (a phosphorus concentration of 5.0×10<sup>13 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>) is prepared as the silicon semiconductor substrate. A heat treatment is performed in a nitrogen and oxygen atmosphere at a temperature of 1250° C. for 100 hours to thermally diffuse phosphorus to a depth of about 80 μm from both main surfaces of the wafer <b>1</b>. The surface impurity concentration of a phosphorus diffusion layer formed in the wafer <b>1</b> is, for example, about 1.0×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. A large amount of oxygen is introduced from both surfaces of the wafer <b>1</b> into the wafer <b>1</b> by the heat treatment and the oxygen concentration of the wafer <b>1</b> becomes solubility limit concentration (about 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>). Then, one main surface of the wafer <b>1</b> is ground to remove the phosphorus diffusion layer and mirror-like finishing is performed for both main surfaces of the wafer <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">Then, for example, an anode region <b>4</b>, an anode electrode <b>8</b>, a guard ring <b>6</b>, a field plate <b>11</b>, and an interlayer insulating film are formed on the front surface of the wafer <b>1</b> subjected to mirror-like finishing by a standard diode process.

In addition, an aluminum absorber is used to adjust the thickness thereof such that the range Rp of the proton is 60 μm from the interface between the front surface of the wafer <b>1</b> and the anode electrode <b>8</b>. Alternatively, for example, an electrostatic accelerator may be used to generate acceleration energy which enables the range Rp of the proton to be 60 μm and proton may be directly radiated, without using the aluminum absorber. In this case, the acceleration energy is 2.3 MeV. It is preferable that a proton dose be selected from the range of 1.0×10<sup>11 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 1.0×10<sup>14 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the spectrum waveform (mark ♦) obtained by measuring the crystal defects formed by the proton radiation using the DLTS method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Then, a heat treatment (annealing) is performed in a hydrogen atmosphere at a temperature of, for example, 350° C. for one hour to recover some of the crystal defects represented by the spectrum waveform indicated by the mark ♦ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, thereby changing the crystal defects into donors. In this way, the high-concentration donor layer <b>3</b> is formed at a depth of about 60 μm from the interface between the front surface of the wafer <b>1</b> and the anode electrode <b>8</b>. A desired BB layer is formed by the donor layer <b>3</b>. The inventors have found that the heat treatment is preferably performed at a temperature of 300° C. to 400° C. for one minute to 300 minutes after the proton radiation. In addition, as can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the VV+VP complex defect remains in a region from the incident surface (front surface) of a proton to a portion of the donor layer <b>3</b> in which the proton is stopped at a heat treatment temperature of 300° C. to 400° C., particularly, at a heat treatment temperature of 350° C. Therefore, the lifetime of a minor carrier in the region through which the proton passes and the donor layer <b>3</b> is in the range of about 0.3 μs to 3.0 μs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Then, grinding or wet etching is performed for the rear surface of the wafer <b>1</b> to reduce the thickness of the wafer <b>1</b> to a predetermined value, for example, 140 μm. Then, n-type impurity ions, such as phosphorus ions or arsenic (As) ions, are implanted into the rear surface of the wafer <b>1</b>. At that time, acceleration energy is, for example, 50 keV and the dose is, for example, 1×10<sup>15 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>. Then, the ion-implanted rear surface of the wafer <b>1</b> is irradiated with a laser beam from, for example, an SHG (second harmonic generation) YAG laser by a double pulse method which is a known technique. The double pulse method continuously radiates a plurality of pulsed laser beams from a plurality of laser irradiation devices to each laser beam irradiation area while shifting the irradiation timing by a predetermined delay time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">When the laser beams are radiated by the double pulse method, the total energy density of the laser beams for each irradiation area is, for example, 3 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. In addition, the double pulse delay time is, for example, 300 nsec. The implanted n-type impurity ions, such as phosphorus ions or arsenic ions, are electrically activated by the laser irradiation and an n<sup>+ </sup>cathode region <b>5</b> is formed on a surface layer of the rear surface of the wafer <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Finally, metal films are formed on the surface of the n<sup>+ </sup>cathode region <b>5</b> in the order of, for example, titanium (Ti), nickel (Ni), and gold (Au) and a cathode electrode <b>9</b> which comes into ohmic contact with the n<sup>+ </sup>cathode region <b>5</b> is formed. In this way, the pin diode according to embodiments of the invention exemplified <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">As described above, the proton is not radiated from the front surface, but may be radiated from a ground and etched surface (rear surface). For example, the range of the proton may be 70 μm from the ground and etched surface in order to set the peak position of the donor layer <b>3</b> to 70 μm from the front surface. In this case, the acceleration energy of the proton is 2.5 MeV. However, the heat treatment temperature after the proton radiation is higher than the above-mentioned value. The reason is that, when the diode is reversely recovered, the carrier remains on the rear surface and the remaining carrier suppresses oscillation. That is, when the proton is radiated from the rear surface, the recombination of the carrier is accelerated since there is the VV+VP complex defect in the region in which the carrier remains. Therefore, the carrier is depleted during reverse recovery and oscillation is likely to occur. In the manufacture of the diode, when the proton is radiated from the ground and etched surface (rear surface), it is necessary to sufficiently reduce the number of VV+VP complex defects. In order to meet the requirements, as can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the heat treatment temperature is at least equal to or higher than at least 350° C. and, preferably, equal to or higher than 400° C. In this case, the lifetime of the minor carrier in the region through which the proton passes and the donor layer <b>3</b> is about equal to or more than 3.0 μs and equal to or less than 30 μs.</div>

When the distance index L is calculated by the above-mentioned Expression 4 using these values, the value shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is obtained. The distance X of the peak position of the n-type BB region <b>26</b> <i>a </i>which the end of the depletion layer reaches first from the rear surface is calculated by subtracting a value that is 0.7 to 1.6 times the distance index L from the thickness W0 of the n<sup>− </sup>semiconductor substrate.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">The above-mentioned Expression 5 results from the substantially constant product of the rated voltage and the rated current density.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Next, a method of manufacturing the IGBT shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> will be described. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a state during the manufacture of the semiconductor device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. An example in which an IGBT with a rated voltage V<sub>0 </sub>of 1200 V and a rated current of 150 A will be described. First, as the wafer (n<sup>− </sup>semiconductor substrate), an FZ wafer <b>20</b> with a bulk resistivity of 144 Ωcm to 300 Ωcm to 300 Ωcm, for example, 150 Ωcm (a phosphorus concentration of 2.0×10<sup>13 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>) and a thickness of about 500 μm is prepared. The FZ wafer <b>20</b> is used as the n<sup>− </sup>drift layer (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(<i>a</i>)</figref>). Oxygen with a concentration higher than solid solubility at room temperature (for example, 20° C.) may be diffused in the FZ wafer <b>20</b> by driving in advance and the FZ wafer <b>20</b> may be introduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Then, the p base layer <b>22</b>, a termination structure including a guard ring (not shown), the trench, the gate insulating film <b>31</b> and the gate electrode <b>27</b> in the trench, the n emitter layer <b>29</b>, and an interlayer insulating film <b>32</b> are formed on the front surface of the FZ wafer <b>20</b> by a standard IGBT manufacturing process (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(<i>b</i>)</figref>). The impurity concentration of the p base layer <b>22</b> is, for example, 2×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>and the junction depth thereof from the surface is, for example, 3 μm. The impurity concentration of the n emitter layer <b>29</b> is 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>and the junction depth thereof from the surface is, for example, 0.5 μm. The material forming the gate electrode <b>27</b> may be, for example, polysilicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Then, the emitter electrode <b>24</b> which comes into contact with the n emitter layer <b>29</b> is formed. In addition, a protective film (not shown) is formed in the termination structure including the guard ring. The emitter electrode <b>24</b> is made of, for example, Al—Si1% and the protective film is, for example, a polyimide film or a silicon nitride (SiN) film. Then, grinding and wet etching <b>42</b> are performed for the rear surface of the FZ wafer <b>20</b> to reduce the thickness of the FZ wafer <b>20</b> to a desired value (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(<i>c</i>)</figref>). In this stage, the thickness of the FZ wafer <b>20</b> is in the range of, for example, 100 μm to 160 μm when the rated voltage V<sub>0 </sub>is 1200 V. In this stage, the thickness of the FZ wafer <b>20</b> is 120 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Then, the rear ground and etched surface (the surface on which the collector electrode <b>25</b> will be formed later) of the FZ wafer <b>20</b> is irradiated with protons H<sup>+ </sup> <b>41</b> which is accelerated by, for example, an electrostatic accelerator (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(<i>d</i>)</figref>). At that time, the range Rp of the proton H<sup>+ </sup> <b>41</b> is 70 μm from the front surface of the FZ wafer <b>20</b>, that is, 50 μm from the rear ground and etched surface. In this case, the acceleration energy of the proton is 2.06 MeV and the dose of the protons H<sup>+ </sup> <b>41</b> is 1.0×10<sup>14 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>. An aluminum absorber is not used. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(<i>d</i>)</figref>, crystal defects <b>13</b> which are generated in the FZ wafer <b>20</b> by the radiation of the protons H<sup>+ </sup> <b>41</b> are represented by a mark x.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Then, for example, a heat treatment is performed in a nitrogen atmosphere (hydrogen may not be included) at a temperature of 400° C. for five hours to recovery the crystal defects <b>13</b>. In this way, an n-type high-concentration region is formed at a depth of about 50 μm from the rear surface of the FZ wafer <b>20</b>. A desired n-type BB region <b>26</b> is formed by the high-concentration region (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(<i>e</i>)</figref>). The processes shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19(<i>d</i>) and 19(<i>e</i>)</figref> are repeatedly performed to form the plurality of n-type BB regions <b>26</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19(<i>e</i>) to 19(<i>h</i>)</figref>, the plurality of n-type BB regions <b>26</b> are shown as one layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Then, the rear surface of the FZ wafer <b>20</b> subjected to the grinding and the wet etching <b>42</b> is irradiated with n-type impurities, such as protons H<sup>+ </sup>or phosphorus<sup>+ </sup> <b>15</b> which will be the n FS layer <b>23</b>. In the irradiation with the n-type impurities, the dose of the n-type impurities is set such that the impurity concentration of the n FS layer <b>23</b> after activation (which will be described) is, for example, 2×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(<i>f</i>)</figref>). Then, p-type impurity ions, such as boron ions<sup>+ </sup> <b>14</b> which will be the p collector layer <b>28</b>, are implanted (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(<i>g</i>)</figref>). In the ion implantation, acceleration energy is, for example, 50 keV and the dose of the p-type impurities is set such that the impurity concentration of the p collector layer <b>28</b> after activation is 3×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Then, the p collector layer <b>28</b> to be electrical activated by laser annealing is formed on the ion-implanted surface (rear surface) of the FZ wafer <b>20</b>. The p collector layer <b>28</b> may be activated by furnace annealing, instead of the laser annealing. In the case of the furnace annealing, for example, a heat treatment is performed in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 450° C. for five hours (hydrogen may not be included). Finally, metal films are deposited on the surface of the p collector layer <b>28</b> in the order of, for example, Al—Si1%, titanium, nickel, and gold to form the collector electrode <b>25</b> which comes into ohmic contact with the surface of the p collector layer <b>28</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(<i>h</i>)</figref>). In this way, the IGBT shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">Next, the formation conditions of the n-type BB region of the IGBT will be described. During turn-off or reverse recovery, the number of accumulated carriers remaining in the rear surface (a region from about 0 μm to 50 μm on the horizontal axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) is reduced. The region in which the carrier remains is referred to as a residual region. The carrier in the residual region suppresses the oscillation of the diode or the IGBT. However, there are many defects (disorders) in the residual region, the disorder becomes the recombination center. When a large number of recombination centers remain, the lifetime is reduced and the reduction rate of the carrier increases. As a result, even when the BB layer is formed, oscillation is likely to occur. In the case of the IGBT, as described above, since the proton is radiated from the rear surface of the wafer, the residual region is disposed in the region through which the proton passes and the disorder is likely to remain. Therefore, particularly, in the IGBT, it is necessary to reduce the disorder of the residual region which is also the region through which the proton passes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In order to reduce the disorder, it is necessary to reduce the proton dose, increase the annealing temperature after proton radiation, or increase the time. However, in order to form the BB layer with predetermined doping concentration, it is necessary to ensure a certain proton dose and a certain activation ratio (the ratio of the donor-integrated concentration obtained by integrating the proton dose with respect to the region of the formed BB layer). When the donor layer of the diode according to Embodiment 3 is formed, the lifetime of the diode can be reduced (for example, in the range of 0.3 μs to 3.0 μs). Therefore, the heat treatment temperature is set to 350° C. In contrast, during the formation of the donor layer (BB layer) of the IGBT, when a heat treatment temperature of 350° C. is applied, the number of defects increases and the on-voltage increases, which is not preferable. Therefore, the annealing temperature needs to be at least equal to or higher than 350° C. and, preferably, equal to or higher than 380° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">When the annealing temperature after proton radiation is higher than 450° C., there is a concern that the aluminum thin film forming the emitter electrode <b>24</b> which has been formed on the surface of the wafer will be deformed. Therefore, it is difficult to set the annealing temperature to be higher than 450° C. It is preferable that the annealing temperature after proton radiation be equal to or less than 450° C. An example of the result obtained when the annealing temperature after proton radiation is 400° C. will be described with reference to the characteristic diagram shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> which will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a characteristic diagram illustrating the relationship between the DLTS signal intensity and the proton dose of the semiconductor device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> after proton radiation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows the dependence of the DLTS signal intensity of each of the VOH complex defect, the VO complex defect, and the VV+VP complex defect on the proton dose when the DLTS signal intensity is measured at the maximum concentration position of the deepest n-type BB region <b>26</b> <i>a </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the DLTS signal intensity of the VV+VP complex defect is lower than that of the other defects in the range of 7×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 3×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the ratio of the defect (trap) density of the VV+VP complex defect is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">On the other hand, the signal intensity of the VOH complex defect is higher than that of the other defects in the range of 5×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 5×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the ratio of the defect (trap) density of the VOH complex defect increases. It was confirmed that this tendency was common when the annealing temperature after proton radiation was in the range of 380° C. to 450° C. In particular, the tendency is strong when the annealing temperature after proton radiation is in the range of 390° C. to 420° C. Therefore, the annealing temperature after proton radiation is preferably in the range of 380° C. to 450° C. and more preferably, in the range of 390° C. to 420° C. In any one of the two temperature ranges, the proton dose is preferably in the range of 5×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 5×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably, in the range of 7×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 3×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, and most preferably, in the range of 1×10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 3×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. In this case, the defect density of the VOH complex defect is higher than that of the other defects, which is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">The DLTS signal intensity of the VOH complex defect is significantly higher than that of the other defects when the proton dose is in the range of 3×10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 3×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. This means that the ratio of the defect (trap) density of the VOH complex defect is high as described above. The above dose range is preferable since the disorder and the leakage current are reduced. In particular, as can be seen from the above, when the proton dose is in the range of 1×10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 1×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, the DLTS signal intensity of the VOH complex defect is critically high and the ratio of the defect (trap) density of the VOH complex defect is critically higher than that of the other defects (the VO complex defect and the VV+VP complex defect). Therefore, in the case of the BB layer of the IGBT, it is most preferable that the proton dose be equal to or more than 1×10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>and equal to or less than 1×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. In addition, in each of the above-mentioned ranges of the proton dose, the temperature of annealing which is performed after the proton radiation is equal to or higher than 390° C. and equal to or lower than 420° C., which makes it possible to significantly increase the ratio of the VOH complex defect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">Next, oxygen concentration of the semiconductor substrate which is required to form the VOH complex defect and the VO complex defect will be described. When a substrate is formed by the FZ method or the CZ method, oxygen in the semiconductor substrate enters the substrate during a high-temperature heat treatment or an oxidizing process. However, when the oxygen concentration is too low, the VOH complex defect and the VO complex defect are not sufficiently formed. The examination result of the inventors proved that the preferred DLTS signal intensity (defect/trap density) of the VOH complex defect and the VO complex defect was obtained when the oxygen concentration was equal to or higher than 1×10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. It is preferable that the oxygen concentration be high. However, it was confirmed that, when the oxygen concentration was higher than 1×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, an oxide-induced stacking fault (OSF) occurred remarkably during a process, resulting in deterioration of the characteristics of the element (an increase in the on-voltage increases and an increase in the leakage current) or a reduction in yield. Therefore, it is preferable that the oxygen concentration of the semiconductor substrate be equal to or lower than 1×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">As described above, according to the invention, the VOH complex defect is mainly formed in the drift layer by proton radiation. Therefore, even when the density of the crystal defects formed by the proton radiation is increased in order to increase the impurity concentration of the donor layer, it is possible to effectively change a large number of main crystal defects into donors with a high rate. In this way, it is possible to form the donor layer which is little affected by, for example, an increase in the on-voltage or an increase in the leakage current in the drift layer. Therefore, it is possible to provide a semiconductor device capable of suppressing an increase in the on-voltage and an increase in the leakage current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">In the above-described embodiments, the semiconductor device and the method of manufacturing the semiconductor device according to the invention are applied to the FS layer of the diode or the BB layer of the IGBT. However, the invention can be similarly applied to any structure in which the donor layer is formed in the drift layer by proton radiation. For example, the invention can be applied to the FS layer of the IGBT. In this case, the effect of the invention is also obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">As described above, the semiconductor device and the method of manufacturing the semiconductor device according to embodiments of the invention are useful for a power semiconductor device which is used in, for example, a pin diode or an IGBT.</div>
