<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A privacy display comprises a spatial light modulator and a compensated switchable liquid crystal retarder arranged between first and second polarisers arranged in series with the spatial light modulator. In a privacy mode of operation, on-axis light from the spatial light modulator is directed without loss, whereas off-axis light has reduced luminance. The visibility of the display to off-axis snoopers is reduced by means of luminance reduction over a wide polar field. In a wide angle mode of operation, the switchable liquid crystal retardance is adjusted so that off-axis luminance is substantially unmodified.</div>

<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure generally relates to illumination from light modulation devices, and more specifically relates to switchable optical stacks for providing control of illumination for use in a display including a privacy display.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Privacy displays provide image visibility to a primary user that is typically in an on-axis position and reduced visibility of image content to a snooper, that is typically in an off-axis position. A privacy function may be provided by micro-louvre optical films that transmit some light from a display in an on-axis direction with low luminance in off-axis positions. However such films have high losses for head-on illumination and the micro-louvres may cause Moiré artefacts due to beating with the pixels of the spatial light modulator. The pitch of the micro-louvre may need selection for panel resolution, increasing inventory and cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Switchable privacy displays may be provided by control of the off-axis optical output.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Control may be provided by means of luminance reduction, for example by means of switchable backlights for a liquid crystal display (LCD) spatial light modulator. Display backlights in general employ waveguides and edge emitting sources. Certain imaging directional backlights have the additional capability of directing the illumination through a display panel into viewing windows. An imaging system may be formed between multiple sources and the respective window images. One example of an imaging directional backlight is an optical valve that may employ a folded optical system and hence may also be an example of a folded imaging directional backlight. Light may propagate substantially without loss in one direction through the optical valve while counter-propagating light may be extracted by reflection off tilted facets as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,519,153, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Control of off-axis privacy may further be provided by means of contrast reduction, for example by adjusting the liquid crystal bias tilt in an In-Plane-Switching LCD.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Terms related to optical retarders for the purposes of the present disclosure will now be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">In a layer comprising a uniaxial birefringent material there is a direction governing the optical anisotropy whereas all directions perpendicular to it (or at a given angle to it) have equivalent birefringence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">Optical axis refers to the direction of propagation of a light ray in the uniaxial birefringent material in which no birefringence is experienced. For light propagating in a direction orthogonal to the optical axis, the optical axis is the slow axis when linearly polarized light with an electric vector direction parallel to the slow axis travels at the slowest speed. The slow axis direction is the direction with the highest refractive index at the design wavelength. Similarly the fast axis direction is the direction with the lowest refractive index at the design wavelength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">For positive dielectric anisotropy uniaxial birefringent materials the slow axis direction is the extraordinary axis of the birefringent material. For negative dielectric anisotropy uniaxial birefringent materials the fast axis direction is the extraordinary axis of the birefringent material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">The terms half a wavelength and quarter a wavelength refer to the operation of a retarder for a design wavelength λ<sub>0 </sub>that may typically be between 500 nm and 570 nm. In the present illustrative embodiments exemplary retardance values are provided for a wavelength of 550 nm unless otherwise specified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">The retarder provides a phase shift between two perpendicular polarization components of the light wave incident thereon and is characterized by the amount of relative phase, Γ, that it imparts on the two polarization components; which is related to the birefringence Δn and the thickness d of the retarder by
<br/>
Γ=2·π·Δ<i>n·d/λ</i> <sub>0</sub>  eqn. 1
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">In eqn. 1, Δn is defined as the difference between the extraordinary and the ordinary index of refraction, i.e.
<br/>
Δ<i>n=n</i> <sub>e</sub> <i>−n</i> <sub>o</sub>  eqn. 2
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">For a half wave retarder, the relationship between d, Δn, and λ<sub>0 </sub>is chosen so that the phase shift between polarization components is Γ=π. For a quarter wave retarder, the relationship between d, Δn, and λ<sub>0 </sub>is chosen so that the phase shift between polarization components is Γ=π/2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">The term half wave retarder herein typically refers to light propagating normal to the retarder and normal to the spatial light modulator.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">Homogeneous alignment refers to the alignment of liquid crystals in switchable liquid crystal displays where molecules align substantially parallel to a substrate. Homogeneous alignment is sometimes referred to as planar alignment. Homogeneous alignment may typically be provided with a small pre-tilt such as 2 degrees, so that the molecules at the surfaces of the alignment layers of the liquid crystal cell are slightly inclined as will be described below. Pretilt is arranged to minimise degeneracies in switching of cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">In the present disclosure, homeotropic alignment is the state in which rod-like liquid crystalline molecules align substantially perpendicularly to the substrate. In discotic liquid crystals homeotropic alignment is defined as the state in which an axis of the column structure, which is formed by disc-like liquid crystalline molecules, aligns perpendicularly to a surface. In homeotropic alignment, pretilt is the tilt angle of the molecules that are close to the alignment layer and is typically close to 90 degrees and for example may be 88 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">Liquid crystal molecules with positive dielectric anisotropy are switched from a homogeneous alignment (such as an A-plate retarder orientation) to a homeotropic alignment (such as a C-plate or O-plate retarder orientation) by means of an applied electric field.</div>

Negative retarders such as negative C-plates may be provided by stretched films or discotic like liquid crystal molecules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">Parallel liquid crystal cell alignment refers to the alignment direction of homogeneous alignment layers being parallel or more typically antiparallel. In the case of pre-tilted homeotropic alignment, the alignment layers may have components that are substantially parallel or antiparallel. Hybrid aligned liquid crystal cells may have one homogeneous alignment layer and one homeotropic alignment layer. Twisted liquid crystal cells may be provided by alignment layers that do not have parallel alignment, for example oriented at 90 degrees to each other.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0296">In the present embodiments, ‘crossed’ refers to an angle of substantially 90° between the optical axes of the two retarders in the plane of the retarders.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0438" num="0437">The operation of retarder layers between parallel polarisers for off-axis illumination will now be described further. In the various devices described above, retarders are arranged between a pair of polarisers (typically the additional polariser <b>318</b> and one of the input polariser <b>210</b> and output polariser <b>218</b>) in various different configurations. In each case, the retarders are configured so that they not affect the luminance of light passing through the pair of polarisers and the plural retarders along an axis along a normal to the plane of the retarders but they do reduce the luminance of light passing through the pair of polarisers and the plural retarders along an axis inclined to a normal to the plane of the retarders, at least in one of the switchable states of the compensated switchable retarder <b>300</b>. There will now be given a description of this effect in more detail, the principles of which may be applied in general to all of the devices described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0439" num="0438"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in perspective view illumination of a retarder layer by off-axis light. Correction retarder <b>630</b> may comprise birefringent material, represented by refractive index ellipsoid <b>632</b> with optical axis direction <b>634</b> at 0 degrees to the x-axis, and have a thickness <b>631</b>. Normal light rays <b>636</b> propagate so that the path length in the material is the same as the thickness <b>631</b>. Light rays <b>637</b> are in the y-z plane have an increased path length; however the birefringence of the material is substantially the same as the rays <b>636</b>. By way of comparison light rays <b>638</b> that are in the x-z plane have an increased path length in the birefringent material and further the birefringence is different to the normal ray <b>636</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0440" num="0439">The retardance of the retarder <b>630</b> is thus dependent on the angle of incidence of the respective ray, and also the plane of incidence, that is rays <b>638</b> in the x-z will have a retardance different from the normal rays <b>636</b> and the rays <b>637</b> in the y-z plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0441" num="0440">The interaction of polarized light with the retarder <b>630</b> will now be described. To distinguish from the first and second polarization components during operation in a directional backlight <b>101</b>, the following explanation will refer to third and fourth polarization components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0442" num="0441"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in perspective view illumination of a retarder layer by off-axis light of a third linear polarization state at 90 degrees to the x-axis and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29C</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating in perspective view illumination of a retarder layer by off-axis light of a fourth linear polarization state at 0 degrees to the x-axis. In such arrangements, the incident linear polarization states are aligned to the optical axes of the birefringent material, represented by ellipse <b>632</b>. Consequently, no phase difference between the third and fourth orthogonal polarization components is provided, and there is no resultant change of the polarization state of the linearly polarized input for each ray <b>636</b>, <b>637</b>, <b>638</b>. Thus, the retarder <b>630</b> introduces no phase shift to polarisation components of light passed by the polariser on the input side of the retarder <b>630</b> along an axis along a normal to the plane of the retarder <b>630</b>. Accordingly, the retarder <b>630</b> does not affect the luminance of light passing through the retarder <b>630</b> and polarisers (not shown) on each side of the retarder <b>630</b>. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A-C</figref> relate specifically to the retarder <b>630</b> that is passive, a similar effect is achieved by a switchable liquid crystal retarder and by plural retarders in the devices described above.</div>

The linear polarization state may be resolved into third and fourth polarization components that are respectively orthogonal and parallel to optical axis <b>634</b> direction. The retarder thickness <b>631</b> and material retardance represented by refractive index ellipsoid <b>632</b> may provide a net effect of relatively shifting the phase of the third and fourth polarization components incident thereon in a normal direction represented by ray <b>636</b> by half a wavelength, for a design wavelength. The design wavelength may for example be in the range of 500 to 550 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0444" num="0443">At the design wavelength and for light propagating normally along ray <b>636</b> then the output polarization may be rotated by 90 degrees to a linear polarization state <b>640</b> at −45 degrees. Light propagating along ray <b>637</b> may see a phase difference that is similar but not identical to the phase difference along ray <b>637</b> due to the change in thickness, and thus an elliptical polarization state <b>639</b> may be output which may have a major axis similar to the linear polarization axis of the output light for ray <b>636</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0445" num="0444">By way of contrast, the phase difference for the incident linear polarization state along ray <b>638</b> may be significantly different, in particular a lower phase difference may be provided. Such phase difference may provide an output polarization state <b>644</b> that is substantially circular at a given inclination angle <b>642</b>. Thus, the retarder <b>630</b> introduces a phase shift to polarisation components of light passed by the polariser on the input side of the retarder <b>630</b> along an axis corresponding to ray <b>638</b> that is inclined to a normal to the plane of the retarder <b>630</b>. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29D</figref> relates to the retarder <b>630</b> that is passive, a similar effect is achieved by a switchable liquid crystal retarder, and in the plural retarders described above, in a switchable state of the switchable liquid crystal retarder corresponding to the privacy mode.</div>
