<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Understanding of living cells is beneficial for a variety of research and development. In order to understand the complex machinery at work within living cells, the position of individual biomolecules is measured. For example, single-particle tracking (SPT), in which the trajectory of a moving individual molecular label, quantum dot, or nanoparticle is determined, provides a valuable tool for a wide range of biological applications. Information inferred from the extracted particle trajectory sheds light on physical properties such as particle size, conformation, and the local environment, because observing the motion of single particles directly unmasks nanoscale behavior such as diffusion, directed motion, or anisotropy. A useful way to obtain information is to label different objects in different colors, increasing the optical complexity of the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">These and other matters have presented challenges to three-dimensional imaging of multicolored particles, for a variety of applications.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is directed to overcoming various challenges related to the types of devices and techniques discussed above and in other implementations. The present invention is exemplified in a number of implementations and applications, some of which are summarized below as examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Various embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure simultaneously measure all of these physical parameters, with minimal modification of a conventional microscope. For example, in some embodiments, a 4f optical processing circuitry is added to the camera of the conventional microscope. In other embodiments, prisms or gratings with wavelength-dependent characteristics are used to create a multiplicity of optical paths. In addition, such apparatus embodiments includes a relatively simple and cheap light-sheet microscope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A number of aspects of the present disclosure include a method comprising encoding wavelength-based characteristics, in addition to data concerning or defining three-dimensional positions, of objects of a plurality of different wavelengths directly in an image of the objects. In various specific aspects, the wavelength-based characteristics are encoded (in addition to data concerning the three-dimensional positions), of the objects by simultaneously providing a different phase delay for (each of) the different wavelengths from light passing along an optical path using a phase mask. In specific aspects, wavelength-based characteristics and three-dimensional positions are encoded for at least two objects, using a single phase mask and within one field of view, that are labeled using different colors. Each of the different colors corresponds to one of the plurality of wavelengths. In related aspects, the image of the objects is generated by passing light along an optical path from the objects to a phase mask, and providing a different phase delay, using the phase mask, for each of the different wavelengths from the light passed along the optical path.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Various aspects of the present disclosure include an apparatus comprising a phase mask and circuitry. The phase mask is arranged with optics in an optical path to modify a shape of light for each of a plurality of wavelengths of light passed from a plurality of objects. For example, the shapes of light are modified for each respective wavelength independently of one another by the phase mask simultaneously providing different phase delays for each wavelength and using a single optical channel. The circuitry characterize a three-dimensional image of the objects based on each of the modified shapes of light and the respective wavelengths. In specific aspects, the circuitry detects relative movement of different ones of the objects based upon the modified shape of lights.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Other related aspects of the present disclosure include a method comprising providing optics and a phase mask in an optical path. Light is passed through the optical path to circuitry where the light is detectable. Further, circuitry encodes wavelength-based characteristics of a plurality of objects based on the detected light. For example, the wavelength-based characteristics of the objects are encoded by modifying a shape of light passing along the optical path for each of a plurality of wavelengths of light passed from the objects. In various specific aspects, the method further includes concurrently locating the objects, such as particles, in the single optical path based on the modified shapes of light for each respective wavelength. For example, the objects are labeled in different colors and the locations of the objects are tracked based on the encoded wavelength-based characteristics and three-dimensional positions (x, y, and z).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Various more specific aspects of the present disclosure include an apparatus comprising an imaging circuit, optics, and a phase mask. The imaging circuit is at an image plane in the optical path for detecting light at or incident upon the imaging circuit. The optics pass light from the objects toward the image plane. And, the phase mask is arranged with the optics to modify a shape of light passing along the optical path, passed from the objects. The light passing along the optical path is modified to create a point-spread-function (PSF) for each of a plurality of respective wavelengths of light passed from the objects and along the optical path. The circuit characterizes a three-dimensional image of the objects based on each of the modified shapes of light and the respective wavelengths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Other specific aspects include axial-related and/or 3D-related microscopic localization of multiple point-like light objects labeled in different wavelengths as generated using wide-field microscopy. In accordance with various aspects 3D (x, y, and z) position information is obtained, even when an object is above or below the focal plane. In other aspects, less than all the 3D information is needed; for example, the axial (z) information alone and/or in combination with some lateral (x or y) information is used instead of the full 3D position information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">According to other aspects, the present disclosure is directed to phase masks that are optimized to create PSFs corresponding to wavelengths expected from target objects and/or to the manufacture and/or use of such phase masks. In some embodiments, the phase mask is placed at the Fourier plane of the optical system to yield a shift-invariant PSF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In other related embodiments, the present disclosure is directed to a method that includes determining a set of different wavelengths or wavelength ranges for defining voltage patterns for phase mask, and then using an optimization function to provide an optimal voltage pattern applicable to each of the different wavelengths or wavelength ranges and thereby determining an optimal voltage pattern for a desired single phase mask. This phase mask is then characterized by the pattern and used to create PSFs that are sufficiently similar to desired phase masks as though respectively manufactured for each of the different wavelengths or wavelength ranges.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">While various embodiments discussed herein are amenable to modifications and alternative forms, aspects thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the disclosure including aspects defined in the claims. In addition, the term “example” as used throughout this application is only by way of illustration, and not limitation.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Aspects of the present disclosure are believed to be applicable to a variety of different types of apparatuses, systems and methods involving encoding wavelength-based (e.g., color) characteristics and three-dimensional positions of a plurality of objects. For example, the wavelength-based characteristics and three-dimensional positions are encoded by modifying respective point-spread-functions (PSFs) for each wavelength of light passed from the plurality objects via a phase mask. In certain implementations, aspects of the present disclosure have been shown to be beneficial when used in the context of optical microscopy or with PSFs that vary based on a depth range. While the present invention is not necessarily limited to such applications, various aspects of the invention may be appreciated through a discussion of various examples using this context.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Accordingly, in the following description various specific details are set forth to describe specific examples presented herein. It should be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that one or more other examples and/or variations of these examples may be practiced without all the specific details given below. In other instances, well known features have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the description of the examples herein. For ease of illustration, the same reference numerals may be used in different diagrams to refer to the same elements or additional instances of the same element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">For particle tracking and/or three dimensional (3D) imaging, the context in which the imaging takes place is often of interest. For example, when tracking a moving emitter in a cell, the motion of the emitter relative to other elements in the cell provides vital information. As another example, a trajectory of a protein, or a structure within a cell, is more informative when it is related to other proteins, organelles, or the cell membrane. In order to track the movement of one object relative to movement of another object, the objects are labeled using different colors. For example, one object is labeled in a first wavelength (e.g., color) and the other object is labeled in a second wavelength that is different than the first wavelength. Certain embodiments in accordance with the present invention include an apparatus with a phase mask that modifies a shape of light for each of a plurality of wavelengths of light passed from objects. The phase mask modifies the shape of light to generate a point spread function (PSF). A single phase mask can simultaneously create different PSFs, one for each wavelength, using a single optical channel and camera/detector and resulting in an increased amount of information and increased simplicity obtainable as compared to other techniques. Such other techniques include additional optical channels (e.g., multiple cameras), sequential imaging, wavelength dispersive optics (e.g., gratings, prisms) and/or dedicated fields of view for each wavelength. For example, for each color being imaged, a dedicated optical channel is used. Each dedicated optical channel requires use of an additional imaging apparatus (e.g., camera) or takes up some of the field of view of a particular imaging apparatus. Further, the imaging apparatus has corresponding special filters or other optics with wavelength-dependent transmission. However, this limits the number of different colors that can be used and thus the amount of information obtainable from the acquired data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Various embodiments involve super-resolution microscopy. Super-resolution microscopy is a form of light microscopy that allows images to be taken with a higher spatial resolution than the optical diffraction limit. Surprisingly, a number of embodiments of the present disclosure encode spectral information (wavelengths/color) in addition to the 3D position, directly in the image. By exploiting chromatic dispersion, a phase mask simultaneously yields controllably different PSFs for different wavelengths in a single field of view. Further, in various embodiments, objects labeled in multiple wavelengths are simultaneously tracked using super-resolution imaging and a single optical path.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In some specific embodiments, aspects of the present disclosure involve localization of individual objects that are labeled with different wavelengths in optical microscopy. For example, a phase mask is added to a conventional microscope. The phase mask includes a dielectric mask, deformable mirror, or a spatial light modulator (SLM), such as a liquid crystal SLM. A spectral degree of freedom is added to the microscope by modifying a shape of light detected using a phase mask that is in the Fourier plane of the optical path of a microscope. In various embodiments the phase mask is used to encode the wavelength-characteristics and three-dimensional position of multiple observed objects (e.g., particles, emissive molecules, scattering objects).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The phase mask, in various embodiments, exploits the spectral dependence of the light corresponding to different objects and creates different, controllable, phase delay patterns (e.g., PSFs) for different wavelengths. As a result, different wavelengths correspond to different PSFs. The phase mask is designed with a particular thickness such that at any point on the phase mask, the mask produces a different phase delay for respective wavelengths. This occurs by taking advantage of the refractive index change between the mask material (e.g., dielectric material, quartz, deformable air, and liquid-crystal) and air. Accordingly, embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure, involve a single optical channel to simultaneously image multiple, distinguishable objects labeled with different colors and/or objects of different wavelengths. An object, as used herein, corresponds to and/or includes an emitter, such as a particle, a molecule, a cell, a quantum dot, a nanoparticle, etc. Further, multi-wavelength spatial registration is simplified as all wavelengths go through the same optical channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In accordance with specific embodiments, aspects of the present disclosure involve 3D super-localization microscopy techniques. Such techniques include tracking single biomolecules with fluorescent labels inside a biological sample, and 3D analysis using other light emitting objects such as quantum-dots or the scattered light from gold beads or nano-rods. Additionally, various embodiments include use of a microfluidic device to characterize flow in 3D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Other specific embodiments include axial-related and/or 3D-related microscopic localization of multiple point-like light objects labeled in different wavelengths as generated using wide-field microscopy. When a point-like (e.g., sub-wavelength) source of light is positioned at the focal plane of a microscope, the image that is detected on the imaging circuitry, such as a camera and/or a detector, is known as the PSF of the microscope. A conventional microscope's PSF (e.g., essentially a round spot) is used for imaging a two-dimensional (2D) ‘slice’ of a specimen, and for 2D (x,y) transverse localization of an object within that slice. By fitting the shape of the spot with a 2D function such as a centroid, Gaussian, or Airy function, in some instances, the position of the object can be detected with precision (a process termed super-localization). However, objects that are a small distance above or below the microscope's focal plane can appear blurry, and furthermore, their depth (or axial distance from the focal plane) is difficult to determine from their measured image. In accordance with various embodiments, 3D (x, y, and z) position information is obtained, even when an object is above or below the focal plane. In other embodiments, less than all the 3D information is needed; for example, the axial (z) information alone and/or in combination with some lateral (x or y) information is used instead of the full 3D position information. Using a phase mask, in various embodiments, an additional module is installed on a conventional microscope to solve the blur and depth issues. Instead of a point of light forming a single ‘spot’ on the camera, light passing through the phase mask forms a shape on the camera that looks different as a function of the object and distance from the focal plane (or amount of defocus).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Various embodiments are directed to an apparatus or method involving encoding wavelength-based characteristics and 3D positions of a plurality of objects of different wavelengths. In specific embodiments, optics pass light from the plurality of objects toward the image plane. A phase mask is used to modify a shape of the light for each of the plurality of respective wavelengths of light passed from the plurality of objects. In a number of specific embodiments, the shape of light for each respective wavelength is different than the shape of the light for other ones of the respective wavelengths. Alternatively, the phase mask modifies the shape such that the resulting shape (e.g., PSF) is the same for each respective wavelength. For example, by providing different phase delays for each wavelength, the phase mask creates a modified shape of light for each wavelength that is different and/or the same. Further, circuitry characterizes a 3D image of the plurality of objects based on each of the PSFs and the respective wavelengths. In specific embodiments, the circuitry is configured to detect relative movement of different ones of the objects based on each of the PSFs and the respective wavelengths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Certain embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure involve optimizing PSFs with applicable depth ranges far beyond previously obtained ranges having a maximum of 2-3 um. As a specific example, using a phase mask optimized for a particular depth range, super-localization over a customizable depth range is performed up to 20 um for a 1.4 NA objective lens (with other parameter-set limitations, such as magnification, background/signal levels, and noise issues). In specific embodiments, the PSF is used for 3D super-localization and tracking, as well as for 3D super-resolution imaging in biological samples, since this is the applicable depth range used for observing the 3D extent of a mammalian cell. However, embodiments are not so limited and the depth range in various embodiments can be greater than 20 um. The depth range, for example, is a function of system limitations, such as NA objective lens and the light emitted by the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Certain PSFs, in accordance with the present disclosure may be referred to as tetrapod PSFs, due to the shape they trace out in 3D space, as a function of the emitter position (the position of the object). In a number of embodiments, the modified shape characterizes the light as having two lobes with a lateral distance that changes along a line, having a first orientation, as a function an axial proximity of the object to the focal plane, and the line having a different orientation depending on whether the object is above or below a focal plane. For example, the different orientation of the line as compared to the first orientation, in various embodiments, includes a lateral turn of the line from the first orientation to the different orientation, such as a 90 degree or 60 degree lateral turn. This shape has lines from the center of a tetrahedron to the vertices, or like a methane molecule. The PSF is composed of two lobes, where their lateral distance from one another and orientation are indicative of the z position of the object. Above the focal plane, the two lobes are oriented along a first line, and below the focal plane the two lobes are oriented along a second line that is differently orientated than the first line (e.g., perpendicular to the first line). For example, the modified shape is created, in various embodiments, by decreasing the lateral distance (e.g., moving together) of the two lobes along the first line when the object is above the focal plane and is closer to the focal plane (e.g., moving closer), turning the two lobes laterally, such as 90 degrees, and increasing the lateral distance (e.g., moving apart) of the two lobes another along the second line when the object is below the focal plane and is further away from the focal plane (e.g., moving away). The tetrapod PSF, as used herein, is not a rotation of a shape of the passing light (e.g., relative to a center line) as a function of the axial position of the object (as with a spiral and/or helix PSF).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Emitter (e.g., object) localization can be optimally performed using maximum likelihood estimation, based on a numerical or experimentally obtained imaging model. However, other localization methods can be used. While other methods for 3D imaging can be used, such methods use scanning (e.g. confocal), in which temporal resolution is compromised, or parallelizing the imaging system (multi-focal imaging), which complicates the implementation. Certain embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure do not use a scan or parallelization technique, and include observation of multiple single emitters in a field at high precision throughout depth ranges, such as discussed above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In accordance with specific embodiments, aspects of the present disclosure involve encoding wavelength (e.g., color) characteristics, in addition to 3D positions, of a plurality of objects by modifying a shape of light for each of a plurality of wavelengths of light passed from the objects and in a single optical path. In specific embodiments, optics pass light from the objects in each of a plurality of wavelengths toward the image plane and the phase mask. The phase mask is used to modify a shape of light, passed from the object. In various embodiments, modifying the shape of light includes redirecting and modifying the light to create a PSF for each of the respect wavelengths simultaneously using the same phase mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In various embodiments, the phase mask produces different (or same) shapes of light for the different wavelengths by providing a different phase delay for each of the respective wavelengths. For example, the phase mask modifies the shape of the light by producing a plurality of PSFs for the respective wavelengths of light. The PSF for each respective wavelength is different than the PSF for other ones of the respective wavelengths. For example, the phase mask creates the plurality of PSFs by producing a different phase delay for each respective wavelength. In some embodiments, the circuitry generates an image of a plurality of colors, each of the colors corresponding to one of the wavelengths, on a single optical channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The circuitry infers depth information, in addition to the wavelength-based characteristics, about objects that are imaged. In various embodiments, the generated 3D image is indicative of respective depths of objects that are greater than 3 microns of one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">For a given application, a desired phase mask (e.g., a pattern) for certain different wavelengths (or wavelength ranges) can be designed by way of an optimization function that is used for determining an optimal voltage pattern most applicable to each of the relevant wavelengths. As an example, a minimization function solves for a pixel-wise weighted least squares problem to determine the optimal voltage pattern. The resulting (optimal) voltage pattern (e.g., when placed on an SLM) can be used to create PSFs that are similar to the desired phase masks for each set of different wavelengths/ranges. These ensuing PSFs (output by the voltage pattern) are not necessarily identical to a PSF output by the desired phase masks. The resulting PSFs for each wavelength, however, are similar to the desired phase masks and this relationship can be optimized for a given set of N wavelengths, for example, using an optimization function that minimizes a phase distance between the desired phase mask patterns and the corresponding phase masks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The phase mask, in some embodiments, is a deformable mirror used to tune the depth characteristic by deforming. For example, the phase mask tunes a depth characteristic to obtain light from the object at different respective depths. In some embodiments, the apparatus and/or method, as described above, includes a tuning circuit used to tune the depth characteristic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In a number of particular embodiments, an apparatus and/or method in accordance with the present disclosure is used to track objects. For example, an apparatus and/or method is used to localize objects that labeled in different wavelengths, tracking locations of objects and/or particles of a plurality of different colors corresponding to the wavelengths simultaneously, and/or characterizing movement of objects with respect to one another and that are at least 3 microns from one another in the axial direction (and any combination thereof).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Certain embodiments involve adjusting phase mask design parameters to deliver optimal performance for a given depth range. Thereby, the phase mask in accordance with the present disclosure is not as limited in depth range as other depth estimation techniques. A module incorporating a phase mask, in accordance with various embodiments, is installed on an existing microscope (e.g., commercial microscope) in a short period of time, such as less than thirty minutes. A phase mask can allow for a high numerical aperture (NA) implementation for light-sheet-microscopy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Turning now to the figures, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates an example apparatus <b>109</b> in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. In such embodiments, the apparatus <b>109</b> creates different PSFs for different wavelengths using a single phase mask <b>103</b> and optical channel. The phase mask <b>103</b>, surprisingly, allows for simultaneous scan-free 3D imaging of objects of different wavelengths on a single optical channel. The PSFs allow for precise localization of nanoscale emitters (e.g., objects) in 3D over customizable axial (z) ranges of up to 20 μm, with a high numerical aperture (NA) objective lens. In some specific embodiments, apparatus <b>109</b> is used to track movement of multiple objects relative to one another, such as movement of a protein with respect to movement of other proteins or organelles, simultaneously and in 3D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">An object, as used herein, corresponds to and/or includes an emitter, such as a particle, a molecule, a cell, a quantum dot, a nanoparticle, etc. In various embodiments, a plurality of objects are labeled in and/or emit different wavelengths of light. The plurality of objects are located in a sample and imaged using the apparatus <b>109</b>, as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The apparatus <b>109</b> includes a phase mask <b>103</b> and circuitry <b>107</b>. The phase mask <b>103</b> is arranged with optics <b>101</b> in an optical path. For example, the optical path is from the optics <b>101</b> to the phase mask <b>103</b> to the circuitry <b>107</b>. The optics <b>101</b> pass light from a plurality of objects toward the image plane. For example, the optics can include the various lenses, as illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2</figref>. The phase mask <b>103</b> modifies a shape of the light for each of a plurality of respective wavelengths of light passed from the objects. For example, the objects are of a particular color corresponding to one of the wavelengths and/or are otherwise labeled in the color. The phase mask <b>103</b> includes a pattern that produces a different phase delay for the different wavelengths to create the shapes of light for each respective wavelength. For example, the phase mask <b>103</b> has an input voltage pattern such that two (or more) wavelengths experience different phase delay patterns resulting in a different modification of light (e.g., different PSF and/or same resulting PSF from different modifications). The phase mask <b>103</b> creates the PSF for each respective wavelength based on a distance of the object from the image plane, as discussed further herein. Unlike other optical components including, for example, gratings, shape modification accordingly to the present disclosure includes a phase-delay pattern (e.g., voltage pattern) for this modification. In accordance with a number of embodiments, the phase mask has a pattern that includes two peaks and two valleys, such as a two-dimensional saddle point function with two peaks and two valleys.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the phase mask <b>103</b> modifies the shapes of light by redirecting and modifying light passing along the optical path to create the PSF at or incident upon the image plane for each respective wavelength. The modification is simultaneous for each respective wavelength, independent of one another, and from the same optical path.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In a number of specific embodiments, the PSFs created are different for each wavelength. For example, the phase mask <b>103</b> modifies the shape of light for each respective wavelength differently than the shape of light for other ones of the respective wavelengths and resulting in different shapes of light for each wavelength. The different shapes for each respective wavelength are created by the phase mask <b>103</b> providing different phase delays for the each of the respective wavelengths. Thereby, the phase mask <b>103</b> modifies the shapes of lights to create a plurality of PSFs for the wavelengths of light, the PSF for each wavelength being different than the PSF for other ones of the respective wavelengths. In other specific embodiments, the PSFs created are the same for each wavelength of light. For example, the phase mask <b>103</b> modifies the shape of light differently for each respective wavelength, resulting in a PSF for each wavelength that is the same.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The phase mask <b>103</b>, in various embodiments, is placed in the Fourier plane to modify light in the optical path. For example, the phase mask <b>103</b> modifies the shape of light by redirecting and modifying the light passing along the optical path to create a PSF for each wavelength at the image plane (e.g., the circuitry <b>107</b>). The shape modification includes a shape of light as a function of an axial proximity of the object, such as a tetrapod PSF. In a number of embodiments, the shape of light is characterized by having two lobes with a lateral distance that changes along a line, having a first orientation, as a function an axial proximity of the object to the focal plane, and the line having a different orientation depending on whether the object is above or below a focal plane. In some specific embodiments, the lateral distance decreases as a function of the axial proximity of the object to the focal plane. For example, as the object gets closer to the focal plane, the lateral distance decreases. Similarly, as the object gets farther away from the focal plane, the lateral distance increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The phase mask <b>103</b> creates such PSFs, in various embodiments, by decreasing the lateral distance (e.g., moving together) of the two lobes along the first line when the object is above the focal plane and is closer to the focal plane (e.g., moving closer), turning the two lobes laterally, such as 90 degrees, and increasing the lateral distance (e.g., moving apart) of the two lobes another along the second line when the object is below the focal plane and is further away from the focal plane (e.g., moving away). The second line is at an angle, based on the lateral turn of the two lobes, to the first line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The phase mask <b>103</b> creates any of a variety of axially-dependent PSFs, where different wavelengths produce different PSFs so that they may be distinguished.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In a number of embodiments, the circuitry <b>107</b> encodes wavelength-based characteristics, in addition to 3D positions, of the objects based on the PSFs created by the phase mask <b>103</b>. Encoding the wavelength-based characteristics allows for the circuitry <b>107</b> to localize the objects labeled in different colors, such as particles, in 3D based on the PSFs. Wavelength-based characteristics, as used herein, is information indicative of an object's emitted wavelength(s) useful for distinguishing the object by its corresponding wavelength(s) for a given application. For example, in various embodiments, wavelength-based characteristics include the wavelength, frequency, emission spectrum, spectrum of the color, resulting phase delay and/or PSF corresponding to the wavelength, among other characteristics indicative of wavelength.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">A number of embodiments include a family of (tetrapod-type) PSFs. The specific phase mask design (corresponding to a certain PSF from the tetrapod family) is dependent on the apparatus parameters, mainly on the depth range. For different imaging apparatus parameters (magnification, numerical apertures, etc.), the phase mask <b>103</b> is optimized using an optimization routine, as discussed further herein. For example, the phase mask <b>103</b> yields slightly different phase mask patterns for a respective wavelength depending on the axial position of the object associated with the wavelength. Related embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure utilize PSF engineering to provide optimized, high-precision localization capability, for a large depth range. For example, such a phase mask design can yield a depth range of 2-20 um for a 1.4 NA objective lens (with other parameter-set limitations, such as magnification, background/signal levels, and noise issues). In some embodiments, the tetrapod PSF is tailored and optimized to a specific depth range, which is dependent on and/or defined as a function of the information encoded in the PSF, as well as the NA objective lens and the light emitted by the object.

Above the focal plane, the two lobes are oriented along a first line, and below the focal plane the two lobes are oriented along a second line that is at an angle (e.g., perpendicular) to the first line. For example, the modified shape is created, in various embodiments, by decreasing the lateral distance (e.g., moving together) of the two lobes along the first line when the object is above the focal plane and is closer to the focal plane (e.g., moving closer), turning the two lobes laterally, such as 90 degrees, and increasing the lateral distance (e.g., moving apart) of the two lobes another along the second line when the object is below the focal plane and is further away from the focal plane (e.g., moving away).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">As described above, a feature of the tetrapod PSF is two lobes that vary in separation as function of the object depth. The axis along which the lobes separate rotates a particular lateral degree, such as 90 degrees, depending on whether the object is above or below the focal plane. The applicable z-range of a tetrapod PSF is 2-20 um for a 1.4 NA objective lens. To distinguish between two wavelengths, the second PSF, in various embodiments, is rotated by 45 degrees as illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8G</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">The freedom in designing multi-wavelength phase masks enables many applications.

In various embodiments, a multi-wavelength phase mask is used for simultaneous multi-wavelength super-resolution imaging, such as of biological specimen. For example, a fixed BS-C-1 cell is imaged, with microtubules marked by anti-alpha-tubulin primary antibodies labeled with a red fluorescent die, such as Alexa646, and mitochondria marked via anti-ATPB primary and a green fluorescent die, such as Alexa532-labeled secondary antibodies.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">A parameter that determines the precision to which one can localize an object is the number of detected photons. The-phase only liquid crystal SLM, for example, is designed to modulate one polarization of light. The light polarization in the unmodulated direction is filtered out, in various embodiments, by a polarizer upstream from the SLM. To take advantage of the maximal number of signal photons, in a number of embodiments, both polarizations of light are used that are impinging on the SLM. The light polarization that is not modulated by the liquid crystal SLM produces a standard PSF in the image plane. To encode wavelength characteristics, the other polarization is modulated by the multi-wavelength mask by laterally shifting the standard PSF in the y-direction for a first wavelength using a phase ramp, such as corresponding to red, and in the x-direction for a second wavelength using a phase ramp, such as corresponding to green. The combined result of both polarizations in the image plane is a PSF that is elongated vertically for the first wavelength and horizontally for the second wavelength (e.g., see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>).</div>

After light has propagated beyond the objective, paraxial approximations are valid. Specifically, the tube lens of the microscope performs an optical Fourier transform operation. The electric field present at a point (u, v) in the microscope's image plane, (E<sub>img</sub>) is given by the formula:

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The precision of a given PSF can be quantified by the Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) which is a mathematical quantity indicative of the sensitivity of a measurement to its underlying parameters. The optimization procedure is based on a CRLB minimization method. With the CRLB being related to (e.g., as the inverse of) the Fisher information matrix the objective function being minimized is the mean trace of the Fisher information matrix (corresponding to mean x,y,z CRLB) over a finite set of N unique z positions in a defined z-range. More specifically, the CRLB corresponds to the lowest possible variance in estimating these parameters with an unbiased estimator. In accordance with various specific embodiments of the present disclosure, the measurement is a noisy, pixelated manifestation of the PSF (the 2D image), and the underlying parameters are the 3D coordinates of the object (e.g., emitter), as well as the brightness expressed as total photons, and a background level. In various embodiments, given the apparatus parameters (such as magnification, numerical aperture, background and signal levels, and a (Poisson) noise model), a numerical imaging model is built based on the above image-model equation and is used to find the Fourier phase pattern P(x′,y′) which yields the PSF with the lowest theoretical localization variance (or the lowest CRLB).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">A set of tetrapod PSFs with z-ranges throughout the 2-20 μm range can be derived by running the optimization procedure iteratively. Starting with a design z-range of 2 μm, the procedure is run once to produce an optimal PSF. Then, the output solution is used as an initial point for another iteration, with a larger z-range of 4 μm. This iterative process is repeated, iteratively increasing the z-range by 2 μm each time, to a final z-range of 20 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Performing optimization with different specified z-ranges, in some embodiments, yields different phase masks (and corresponding PSFs) that share common characteristics including for any tested z-range (e.g., from 2-20 μm), two distinct lobes, with growing transverse distance between them as the emitter departs from the apparatus' focal plane. The orientation of the two lobes of the PSF, in some embodiments, is rotated by 90° above and below the focal plane. PSFs, in accordance with the present disclosure, are therefore referred to as tetrapod PSFs, due to the 3D tetrahedral shape they trace out as the object is moved in z (the axial direction).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">In accordance with various embodiments, using the above described imaging apparatus with PSF engineering (e.g. the 4f optical system with phase mask in the Fourier plane), a phase pattern is designed that produces different PSFs for different wavelengths. Such embodiments allow for simultaneous scan-free 3D imaging of objects with different wavelengths using a signal optical channel (e.g., a single channel). The resulting phase mask is used to encode spectral information in the PSF of the apparatus. PSF engineering for 3D imaging exploits optical aberrations for encoding depth and uses chromatic aberrations for encoding color.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">In terms of signal compromise, in various embodiments, the elongated PSF used in cell measurement (e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A-10C</figref>) is around 13% dimmer than a standard PSF. In terms of spectral separation, a liquid crystal SLM in some embodiments generates a multi-wavelength tetrapod PSF at up to a 20 um z-range for two objects at wavelengths that are separated by 60 nm or more. One limitation of the multi-wavelength liquid crystal SLM is the modulated range is limited to around 4π at 633 nm, and has a spectral dependence as the SLM relies on finding the voltage values that optimizes the different phase delays for the different wavelengths. Further, the liquid crustal SLM modulates one polarization, which limits the detectable signal and degrades object detectability, localization precision, and spatial resolution. The limitation of only one polarization, in various embodiments, is overcome by utilizing the unmodulated part of the emitted light as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In some embodiments, the phase mask is a dielectric mask. A dielectric mask includes a multi-wavelength phase mask that can create a PSF for five or more different wavelengths, in a 300 nm spectral range.</div>

A camera is used to record data. In various embodiments, simultaneous illumination of the sample is performed using a 641 nm diode laser, and a 514 nm line of an Ar-iron laser.
