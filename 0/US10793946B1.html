<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Integrated circuits are currently manufactured by an elaborate process in which various layers of materials are sequentially constructed in a predetermined arrangement on a semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Meeting the ever increasing electromigration (EM) requirement in copper interconnects is becoming more difficult as Moore's law progresses, resulting in smaller devices. As line dimensions shrink, critical void size for EM failure is also reduced, causing a sharp decrease in mean time to failure. A significant improvement in EM resistance is required to enable continued scaling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The interface between the dielectric diffusion barrier and metallic material has been shown to be the main path for metallic material diffusion and the weakest link in resisting EM failure. The implementation of a selective metal cap has been challenging because of the difficulty in achieving good selectivity on metallic surfaces versus the dielectric surface. Methods are disclosed herein for selective deposition of metallic films that can be used in this context to decrease electromigration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Selective deposition of tungsten advantageously reduces the need for complicated patterning steps during semiconductor device fabrication. However, gentle surface treatments, such as thermal or radical treatments are typically preferred to provide desired surface terminations for selective deposition. Such surface treatments may not adequately prepare the desired surface for selective deposition, leading to a loss of selectivity.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, methods are disclosed for selective deposition of metallic films on metal or metallic materials while avoiding deposition on silicon containing materials, such as silicon dioxide. For example, a metallic film may be deposited on copper for end of the line substrate processing. In some embodiments, metallic films are deposited on an integrated circuit workpiece comprising copper lines in silicon containing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In some such applications, the selective deposition methods disclosed herein can be used to deposit material onto copper thereby decreasing electromigration of the copper. In some embodiments, the selective deposition is on the copper metal layers and not on silicon containing materials on the substrate. Deposition on the silicon containing materials in these applications is undesirable because it can decrease the effective dielectric value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the process flows described herein are used to selectively deposit metal on micrometer-scale (or smaller) features during integrated circuit fabrication. In some embodiments feature size may be less than 100 micrometers, less than 1 micrometer or less than 200 nm. In the case of selective deposition of W on Cu for interconnect applications, in some embodiments the feature size/line widths may be less than 1 micrometer, less than 200 nm, less than 100 nm, or even less than 50 nm. Of course the skilled artisan will recognize that selective deposition on larger features and in other contexts is possible using the disclosed methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the selective deposition can avoid additional processing steps, thereby saving time and decreasing the costs associated with processing the substrates. For example, lithography will be very expensive in the future for small dimensions. With 8 or more layers of Cu metallization in the chips, the time and cost savings achievable using selective deposition are magnified because time is saved for each area of copper metallization during substrate processing. Also, the methods disclosed herein can obviate the need for diffusion barriers and other processing steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart generally illustrating a process <b>10</b> for selectively depositing a metal film on a first metallic surface of a substrate relative to a second silicon containing surface. In some embodiments the process may comprise an optional reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> prior to a selective deposition step <b>14</b> in order to enable selective deposition, improve selectivity, and/or increase the number of consecutive cycles before selectivity is lost during a selective deposition process. In some embodiments the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may increase the number of consecutive cycles in which a desired level of selectivity is achieved. The optional reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may include providing a passivation material or passivation layer on chamber surfaces and other locations which may be exposed to a precursor or reactant during the selective deposition step <b>14</b>. The reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may limit or prevent deposition of metallic material on chamber surfaces during a subsequent selective deposition step <b>14</b>, thereby reducing or eliminating the amount of reactive byproducts generated by the selective deposition step <b>14</b>. In some embodiments the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may reduce contamination of the substrate during the selective deposition step <b>14</b> which in turn may enable selective deposition or increase selectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments the passivation layer may comprise, for example, SiN. In some embodiments the passivation layer may comprise a metal oxide and may be formed by, for example, oxidizing a metallic material that is present on chamber surfaces. In some embodiments the passivation layer may not be pure metal or pure silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Selective deposition using the methods described herein does not require treatment of the silicon containing layer to block deposition thereon. As a result, in some embodiments the second surface comprising silicon does not comprise a passivation or blocking layer, such as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), which would prevent the actual top surface of the second dielectric surface from being exposed to the chemicals of the deposition processes described herein. Thus, in some embodiments the film is deposited selectively on the first metal surface on a substrate which has not received treatment designed to prevent deposition of the film on the second silicon containing surface, such as a blocking or passivation treatment. That is, in some embodiments selective deposition can be obtained even though deposition is not blocked on the second surface comprising silicon by a blocking or passivation layer. Instead, the deposition conditions are selected such that the selective deposition process will occur without the need for pretreatment of the second surface comprising silicon prior to deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments the second silicon containing layer may be exposed to a treatment designed to treat the first surface. For example, in some embodiments it is desirable to passivate the first metal surface and the second surface comprising silicon may be exposed to the same passivation treatment as the first metal surface. For example, in the case of Cu both the first Cu surface and the second surface comprising silicon may be exposed to BTA or another passivating chemical. However, no specific further treatments or exposures (besides what it may receive during transportation of the sample) are done for the second surface comprising silicon before a first surface treatment step to remove the passivation layer from the metal surface. In particular no treatment designed to block deposition of the film on the second surface comprising silicon need be carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments at the time of selective deposition of the film, the second dielectric surface comprises only surface groups that are naturally occurring in the low-k material, and does not comprise a significant amount of functional groups or ligands that would not naturally be present in the low-k material itself. In some embodiments no active treatment of the second dielectric surface is carried out after first surface treatment that would add surface groups to the second dielectric surface. In some embodiments the second dielectric surface comprises only surface groups that are naturally occurring in low-k materials, including those that could be formed during for transportation of the substrate in air, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">However, in some embodiments the second silicon containing surface may optionally be treated at step <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, a silicon containing surface can be treated at step <b>12</b> to enhance the selectivity of the deposition process by decreasing the amount of material deposited on the silicon containing surface, for example by passivating the silicon containing surface. In some embodiments the treatment step <b>12</b> is intended to restore the silicon containing layer and not to block deposition on the silicon containing layer. In some embodiments the second silicon containing surface treatment at step <b>12</b> may comprise contacting the second surface with treatment chemical, for example the second surface comprising silicon may be contacted with a treatment chemical comprising trimethyl(dimethylamino)silane. In some embodiments the substrate may be outgassed at the beginning of or prior to step <b>12</b> in order to remove, for example, any moisture from the substrate surface or inside the silicon containing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments the substrate surface is cleaned at step <b>13</b> prior to beginning the selective deposition step <b>14</b>. In some embodiments the first surface treatment step <b>13</b> may comprise exposing the substrate to a plasma, for example a plasma generated from NH<sub>3</sub>. In some embodiments the first surface treatment step <b>13</b> may comprise exposing the substrate to a vapor phase treatment chemical, for example formic acid. In some embodiments the first surface treatment step <b>13</b> may reduce the first metallic surface. In some embodiments the first surface treatment step <b>13</b> may remove any native oxide that may be present on the first metallic surface. Although in some embodiments a native oxide may still be present on the first surface after the first surface treatment step <b>13</b>. In some embodiments the first surface treatment step <b>13</b> may remove any hydrocarbon layer that may be present on the first metallic surface. In some embodiments the first surface treatment step <b>13</b> may provide active sites on the first metallic surface. In some embodiments the substrate may be outgassed at the beginning of, or prior to step <b>13</b> in order to remove, for example, any moisture from the substrate surface or inside the silicon containing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments step <b>14</b> of the selective deposition process comprises selectively depositing a film on a substrate comprising a first metal surface and a second surface comprising silicon using a plurality of deposition cycles. The cycle comprises: contacting the substrate with a first precursor comprising silicon or boron to selectively form a layer of first material comprising Si or B over the first metal surface relative to the second surface comprising silicon; and converting the first material to a second metallic material by exposing the substrate to a second precursor comprising metal. The selective deposition step <b>14</b> involves forming a greater amount of material on the first metal surface relative to the second surface comprising silicon. The selectivity can be expressed as the ratio of material formed on the first surface to amount of material formed on the first and second surfaces combined. For example, if a process deposits 10 nm of W on a first copper surface and 1 nm on a second silicon oxide surface, the process will be considered to have 90% selectivity. Preferably, the selectivity of the methods disclosed herein is above about 80%, more preferably above 90%, even more preferably above 95%, and most preferably about 100%. In some cases the selectivity is at least about 80%, which may be selective enough for some particular applications. In some cases the selectivity is at least about 50%, which may be selective enough for some particular applications. In some embodiments, multiple deposition cycles are used to deposit material at step <b>14</b>. In some embodiments the selectively deposited film is a metallic layer. The metallic layer may be elemental metal. In some embodiments, the metallic layer can include additional elements, such as Si, B, N, and/or dopants. Thus, in some embodiments the metallic layer is a metal nitride or metal silicide. As used herein, “metallic” indicates that a film, reactant or other material comprises one or more metals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The substrate can comprise various types of materials. When manufacturing integrated circuits, the substrate typically comprises a number of thin films with varying chemical and physical properties. For example and without limitation, the substrate may comprise a silicon containing layer and a metal layer. In some embodiments the substrate can comprise metal carbide. In some embodiments the substrate can comprise a conductive oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably the substrate has a first surface comprising a metal, referred to herein as the first metal surface or first metallic surface. In some embodiments the first surface is essentially an elemental metal, such as Cu or Co. In some embodiments the first surface comprises a metal nitride. In some embodiments the first surface comprises a transition metal. The transition metal can be selected from the group: Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Au, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir and Pt. In some embodiments the first surface preferably comprises copper. In some embodiments the first surface comprises cobalt. In some embodiments the first surface comprises tungsten. In some embodiments the first surface may comprise a native oxide of a metal, for example the first surface may comprise tungsten oxide. In some embodiments the first surface may comprise a seam, gap, or space, and the selective deposition process closes or substantially fills the seam, gap, or space of the first surface. In some embodiments the first surface comprises a noble metal. The noble metal can be selected from the group: Au, Pt, Ir, Pd, Os, Ag, Re, Rh, and Ru.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The second surface is preferably a silicon containing surface, referred to herein as the second silicon containing surface or second surface comprising silicon. In some embodiments, the silicon containing surface comprises, for example, SiO<sub>2</sub>. In some embodiments the second surface may comprise silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, silicon oxynitride, silicon dioxide, or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments the material comprising the second surface is a porous material. In some embodiments the porous material contains pores which are connected to each other, while in other embodiments the pores are not connected to each other. In some embodiments the second surface comprises a low-k material, defined as an insulator with a dielectric value below about 4.0. In some embodiments the dielectric value of the low-k material is below about 3.5, below about 3.0, below about 2.5 and below about 2.3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The precursors employed in the processes disclosed herein may be solid, liquid or gaseous material under standard conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure), provided that the precursors are in vapor phase before being conducted into the reaction chamber and contacted with the substrate surface. Plasma conditions can also be used. Thus, plasma can be formed from the vapor phase reactants or precursors in some embodiments. “Pulsing” a vaporized precursor onto the substrate means that the precursor vapor is conducted into the chamber for a limited period of time. Typically, the pulsing time is from about 0.05 to 10 seconds. However, depending on the substrate type and its surface area, the pulsing time may be even higher than 10 seconds. Pulsing times can be on the order of minutes in some cases. In some cases to ensure full saturation of reactions, the precursor might be supplied in multiple shorter pulses rather than in one longer pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The mass flow rate of the precursors can also be determined by the skilled artisan. In one embodiment, for deposition on 300 mm wafers the flow rate of precursors is preferably between about 1 and 2000 sccm without limitation. In some embodiments the flow rate may be between about 50 sccm and about 1500 sccm, between about 100 sccm and about 1000 sccm, or between about 200 sccm and about 500 sccm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The pressure in the reaction chamber is typically from about 0.01 to about 50 mbar. In some embodiments the pressure may be between about 0.1 mbar and about 20 mbar, or between about 1 mbar and about 10 mbar. However, in some cases the pressure will be higher or lower than this range, as can be readily determined by the skilled artisan.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">Chamber Passivation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some embodiments it may be desirable for the reaction chamber or chambers in which a selective deposition process will be carried out to be passivated at step <b>11</b> prior to selectively depositing a metallic film at step <b>14</b>. In some embodiments the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may enable selective deposition, improve selectivity, and/or increase the number of cycles before selectivity is lost during a selective deposition process, for example a metallic film selective deposition process as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments a selective deposition process for selective depositing a film on the first surface of a substrate, for example a metallic surface, relative to a second surface, for example a silicon containing surface can generate reactive byproducts which can rapidly damage the second surface. The reactive byproducts may provide active sites on the second surface, resulting in a loss of selectivity. In some embodiments unwanted deposition may occur on reaction chamber surfaces, thereby leading to an increased amount of reactive byproducts in the reaction chamber over a selective deposition process wherein deposition occurs primarily on the substrate. In order to reduce the amount of unwanted deposition on chamber surfaces, for example the interior surfaces of the reaction chamber, and consequently reduce the amount of reactive byproducts generated by the selective deposition process it is desirable to passivate these chamber surfaces against deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, in some embodiments a W selective deposition process may generate reactive byproducts having the formula SiF<sub>x</sub>, where x=1-4. In some embodiments where the reaction chamber has not been passivated, unwanted W deposition may occur on chamber surfaces, thereby producing an undesirable amount of SiF<sub>x </sub>byproducts. In some embodiments where a reaction chamber has been passivated, W deposition may occur primarily on the first surface of the substrate and may not occur on unwanted chamber surfaces, thereby leading to a reduction in the amount of SiF<sub>x </sub>byproducts generated during the selective deposition process relative to a W selective deposition process wherein the reaction chamber had not been passivated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> is performed when there is no wafer or substrate in the reaction chamber. Therefore, in some embodiments a substrate, for example a substrate comprising a first metallic surface and a second silicon containing surface is not subjected to the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b>. In some embodiments the substrate may be subjected to other processing before, during, or after the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may be repeated after a selective deposition process has been performed at step <b>14</b>. In some embodiments the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may be repeated after every one, two, three, or more selective deposition steps <b>14</b> have been carried out. For example, in some embodiments the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may be repeated after every 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, or more substrates, for example wafers, have been subjected to selective deposition step <b>14</b>. In some embodiments the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may be repeated after a certain number of cycles of selective deposition step <b>14</b> have been performed. In some embodiments the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may be repeated after every 50, 100, 150, or more selective deposition cycles. In some embodiments the substrate or substrates may remain in the reaction chamber, or may not be present in the reaction chamber during the reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments a reaction chamber passivation step <b>11</b> may include providing a passivation layer or passivation material on chamber surfaces and other surfaces in which may be exposed to a precursor or reactant during the selective deposition step <b>14</b>. In some embodiments the passivation material is deposited or formed on the interior surface of the reaction chamber, the chamber showerhead, and/or any other parts of the chamber which may be exposed to a precursor or reactant during selective deposition step <b>14</b>. In some embodiments the passivation material may be deposited on any surface in the reaction chamber that is not the substrate upon which selective deposition is desired to occur. In some embodiments the passivation material is a different material than the material being selectively deposited in step <b>14</b>. In some embodiments a disposition process used to deposit the passivation layer may not be a selective deposition process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments reaction chamber passivation <b>11</b> can increase the number of consecutive cycles in which a desired level of selectivity of a selective deposition process <b>14</b> is maintained.

For example, for embodiments when the first material is copper, the copper surface can be cleaned or reduced such that pure elemental copper is on the substrate surface. In some embodiments a first surface treatment process may remove any organic material present on the first metallic surface. For example a first surface treatment process may remove a passivation layer present on the first metallic surface. For example, the first surface treatment process may remove a benzotriazole (BTA) passivation layer from a copper surface. In some embodiments the first surface treatment process may reduce the first metallic surface of the substrate. In some embodiments the first surface treatment process may remove any native oxide that may be present on the first metallic surface. In some embodiments the first surface treatment process may remove any hydrocarbon layer that may be present on the first metallic surface. In some embodiments the first surface treatment process may provide active sites on the first metallic surface. The first surface treatment process can be done in any of a variety of methods, for example using a chemical such as citric acid or using plasma. For example, the substrate surface may be cleaned using hydrogen containing plasma or radicals, such as H-plasma or NH<sub>3</sub>-plasma. In some embodiments HCl treatment is used as the first surface treatment method. In some embodiments the first surface treatment process comprises exposing the substrate to a treatment reactant, for example formic acid. Other first surface treatment methods are also possible. The specific first surface treatment method to be used in any particular case can be selected based on a variety of factors such as the materials and the deposition conditions, including, for example, the types of materials on the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">In some cases a first material on which selective deposition is desired, such as copper, is passivated.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">In some embodiments the temperature is selected to facilitate the selective deposition. Deposition is generally defined as selective if the amount of the deposited material per surface area or volume (e.g. at/cm<sup>2 </sup>or at/cm<sup>3</sup>) on the first surface is greater than the amount of the deposited material per surface area or volume on the second surface. The amount of material deposited on the surfaces can be determined by measuring the thicknesses of each layer. In some cases, the thickness measurement might not be possible due to non-continuous film. In some cases the selectivity can be determined by measuring the deposited atoms per surface area or volume. As mentioned above, the selectivity can be expressed as the ratio of material formed on the first surface to amount of material formed on the first and second surfaces combined. Preferably, the selectivity is above about 70%, above about 80%, more preferably above 90%, even more preferably above 95%, and most preferably about 100%. In some cases selectivity above 80% may be acceptable for certain applications. In some cases selectivity above 50% may be acceptable for certain applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">In some embodiments the deposition temperature is selected such that the selectivity is above about 90%. In some embodiments, the deposition temperature is selected such that a selectivity of about 100% is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">In some embodiments, the deposition temperature is selected such that the first precursor comprising silicon or boron forms a layer containing silicon or boron on the first metal surface. In some embodiments the first precursor does not form a layer on the second surface comprising silicon, or forms a less than a complete layer on the second surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">The particular temperature utilized can depend, in part, on the silicon or boron precursor that is selected along with the first surface or metal and the second surface or dielectric on the substrate. Preferably, the silicon or boron source forms on the first metal surface instead of the second surface comprising silicon to form a layer comprising silicon or boron. Preferably, the layer comprising silicon or boron is about a monolayer or less. In some cases, more than a monolayer of silicon or boron can be formed. In some embodiments a layer of silicon or boron with a thickness of from about 0.05 nm to about 4 nm is formed on the metal surface of the substrate. In some embodiments preferably a layer of silicon or boron with a thickness of from about 0.1 nm to about 2 nm is formed on the metal surface of the substrate. In some embodiments the formation of silicon or boron on the metal surface is self-limiting. In some embodiments the layer comprising silicon or boron is formed by decomposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">In some cases the silicon or boron layer can form on both the metal and silicon containing surfaces at higher temperatures. In such situations, the use of lower temperatures is preferred because the silicon or boron can form on the metal surface at a lower temperature than the surface comprising silicon. Thus, the temperature can be selected such that the silicon precursor interacts preferentially with the first surface or metal surface relative to the second surface or silicon containing surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">In some embodiments deposition temperatures are selected to achieve the desired level of selectivity. For example, a temperature can be selected such that absorption of the silicon or boron containing precursor to the low-k material is limited to an amount necessary to achieve a desired level of selectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">The deposition temperature can be selected based on the silicon or boron source and the particular substrate surfaces that are used (e.g. silicon containing surface and copper surface).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">In some embodiments the deposition temperature is preferably less than 200° C., more preferably less than about 175° C., more preferably less than about 150° C., most preferably less than about 110° C. In some cases temperatures of less than about 100° C. can be used. In some embodiments the deposition temperature range for selective deposition having selectivity of over 50% in films having thicknesses of less than about 5 nm (e.g. deposited W thickness) deposited using disilane and WF<sub>6 </sub>is from about 30° C. to about 200° C. In some embodiments desirable levels of uniformity and selectivity can be achieved using deposition temperature ranges from about 30° C. to about 110° C. In some embodiments desirable levels of uniformity and selectivity can be achieved using deposition temperature ranges from about 40° C. to about 110° C. In some embodiments desirable levels of uniformity and selectivity can be achieved using deposition temperatures ranges less than about 100° C. In these temperature ranges a person skilled in the art can optimize the process to achieve desired or acceptable uniformity and selectivity for the films deposited using a particular reactor with particular precursors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">In some embodiments the silicon or boron-containing precursor and the second metal precursor are provided at the same temperature and in the same reaction space. In some embodiments the silicon precursor is provided at a first deposition temperature and the second metal reactant is provided at a second deposition temperature. In practice, this may mean providing the first reactant in a first reaction space and providing the second metal reactant in a second reaction space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">In some embodiments using disilane and depositing tungsten using WF<sub>6 </sub>on a copper or cobalt surface, a selectivity of more than about 80%, preferably more than about 90%, relative to a surface comprising silicon can be achieved with a deposition temperature of from about 30° C. to about 110° C. The deposition temperature for trisilane can be even lower than the deposition temperature for disilane. In the above mentioned embodiments the deposited film may be, for example and without limitation, a tungsten film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">In some embodiments the thickness of the film that is selectively deposited is less than about 10 nm, less than about 5 nm, about 4 nm or less or, in some embodiments, from about 1 nm to about 4 nm. However, in some cases a desired level of selectivity, for example more than 50%, more preferably more than 80%, is achieved with the thicknesses of the selectively deposited film being over about 10 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">In some embodiments a W film having a thickness of about 10 nm or less is deposited selectively over Cu of Co on a substrate surface with a selectivity of greater than 50% relative to a silicon containing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">In some embodiments a W film having a thickness of about 5 nm or less is deposited selectively over Cu or Co on a substrate surface with a selectivity of greater than about 80% relative to a silicon containing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">In some embodiments a W film having a thickness of about 3 nm or less is deposited selectively over Cu or Co on a substrate surface with a selectivity of greater than about 90% relative to a silicon containing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">If a lower selectivity is preferred the temperature can be slightly higher than the temperature for processes that achieve more than 90% selectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">In some embodiments, deposition conditions and/or reactants are selected such that etching of the silicon containing surfaces is avoided or minimized. For example, at higher temperatures metal fluorides can start fluorinating any Si—OH groups that may be present on the second surface and in some cases they can etch the silicon containing surface. Thus in some embodiments the deposition temperature is selected so that etching of silicon containing surface is avoided or eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">The substrate temperature during the provision of the second reactant can be the same as the temperature during the provision of the silicon or boron containing reactant. In other embodiments, different temperatures may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">In embodiments where WF<sub>6 </sub>is used as the second reactant with disilane as the first reactant a temperature of from about 30° C. to about 110° C. can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">In some embodiments, the temperature of the substrate can be increased when providing the second reactant to increase the conversion of the metal reactant. For example, a higher temperature can be used when TaF<sub>5 </sub>and NbF<sub>5 </sub>are used as the second reactant. For example, when using TaF<sub>5 </sub>the temperatures can be over about 300° C. When using NbF<sub>5 </sub>the temperature can be above about 250° C. This can be accomplished by heating the substrate, using a higher reaction temperature for the second material or other means known to the skilled artisan.</div>
