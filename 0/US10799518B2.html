<heading id="h-0004">Summary of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family belongs to the seven transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This family includes 3 members in humans and one member of this family FPR2 (also known as FPRL-1, ALXA4) is expressed predominantly on inflammatory cells such as monocytes and neutrophils, as well as on T cells and has been shown to play a critical role in leukocyte trafficking during inflammation and human pathology (Chiang N, Serhan C N, Dahlen, S, Drazen J M, Hay D W P, Rovati E, Shimizu T, Yokomizo T, Brink, C. The lipoxin receptor ALX: Potent ligand-specific and stereoselective actions in vivo. <i>Pharmacological Reviews </i>2006; 58: 463-519). FPR2 is an exceptionally promiscuous receptor that responds to a menagerie of structurally diverse exogenous and endogenous ligands, including serum amyloid A (SAA), chemokine variant sCKβ8-1, the neuroprotective peptide humanin, anti-inflammatory eicosanoid lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and glucocorticoid-modulated protein annexin A1 (Chiang N, Serhan C N, Dahlen, S, Drazen J M, Hay D W P, Rovati E, Shimizu T, Yokomizo T, Brink, C. The lipoxin receptor ALX: Potent ligand-specific and stereoselective actions in vivo. <i>Pharmacological Reviews </i>2006; 58: 463-519). FPR2 has been shown to transduce anti-inflammatory effects of arachidonic acid derived Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in many systems, and has been shown to play a key role in the resolution of inflammation (Dufton N, Perretti M. Therapeutic anti-inflammatory potential of formyl peptide receptor agonists. <i>Pharmacology </i>&amp; <i>Therapeutics </i>2010; 127: 175-188). FPR2 knockout mice show exaggerated inflammation in disease conditions as expected by the biological role of the receptor (Dufton N, Hannon R, Brancaleone V, Dalli J, Patel H B, Gray M, D'Aquisto F, Buckingham J C, Perretti M, Flower R J. Anti-inflammatory role of the murine formyl-peptide receptor 2: Ligand-specific effects on leukocyte responses and experimental inflammation. <i>Journal of Immunology </i>2010; 184: 2611-2619.

Leukocyte recruitment in the brain in sepsis: involvement of the annexinl FPR2/ALX anti-inflammatory system. <i>FASEB </i>2012; 26: 1-13).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Activation of FPR2 by lipoxin A4 or its analogs and by Annexin I protein has been shown to result in anti-inflammatory activity by promoting active resolution of inflammation which involves inhibition of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and eosinophils migration and also stimulate monocyte migration enabling clearance of apoptotic cells from the site of inflammation in a nonphlogistic manner (Gavins F N E, Hughes E L, Buss N A P S, Holloway P M, Getting S J, Buckingham J C. Leukocyte recruitment in the brain in sepsis: involvement of the annexinl FPR2/ALX anti-inflammatory system. <i>FASEB </i>2012; 26: 1-13, Maderna P, Cotten D C, Toivonen T, Dufton N, Dalli J, Perretti M, Godson C. FPR2/ALX receptor expression and internalization are critical for lipoxin A4 and annexin-derived peptide-stimulated phagocytosis. <i>FASEB </i>2010; 24: 4240-4249). In addition, FPR2 has been shown to inhibit natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity and promote activation of T cells which further contributes to down regulation of tissue damaging inflammatory signals. FPR2 interaction with LXA4 and Annexin has been shown to be beneficial in experimental models of dermal inflammation, angiogenesis, epithelial migration, edema, alopecia and corneal wound healing. (Reville K, Cream J K, Vivers S, Dransfield I, Godson C.

Aspirin-triggered 15-epi-lipoxin A4 and LXA4 stable analogues are potent inhibitors of acute inflammation: evidence for anti-inflammatory receptors. <i>Journal of Experimental Medicine </i>1997; 185: 1693-1704.; Leoni G, Alam A, Neumann P A, Lambeth J D, Cheng G, McCoy J, Hilgarth R S, Kundu K, Murthy N, Kusters D, Reutelingsperger C, Perretti M, Parkos C A, Neish A S, Nusrat A.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Targeting FPR2 selectively would also have benefits in skin wound healing given its potent anti-inflammatory and pro-epithelial repair role. In addition, some skin diseases have been shown to have an abnormal expression of LL37, a pro-inflammatory cathelicidin which has been shown to be a natural ligand of FPR2. In the chronic inflammatory disease Rosacea, LL37 is highly expressed and is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis (Yamasaki K, Di Nardo A, Bardan A, Murakami M, Ohtake T, Coda A, Dorschner R A, Bonnart C, Descargues P, Hovnanian A, Morhenn V B, Gallo R L. Increased serine protease activity and cathelicidin promotes skin inflammation in rosacea. <i>Nature Medicine. </i>2007; 13:975-80).</div>
<heading id="h-0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to a method for treating dermal inflammation and dermal diseases by local or systemic delivery, in a subject in need of such treatment, which comprises administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one agonist of Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Given the anti-inflammatory axis of LXA4-FPR2 we propose that FPR2 agonists will be useful in inhibiting LL-37-mediated inflammatory diseases such as Rosacea. Pharmaceutical utility of lipoxin A4 and its analogs are hampered by inherent physicochemical properties of the natural poly-olefinic natural product. Therefore, small molecule anti-inflammatory agonists of FPR2 would have a wide variety of therapeutic benefit in inflammatory disorders especially in the skin. FPR2 is widely expressed in human skin and its appendages. FPR2 thus represents an important novel pro-resolutionary molecular target for the development of new therapeutic agents in dermatological diseases with excessive inflammatory responses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention pertains to the ability of FPR2 agonists to exhibit dermal anti-inflammatory activity with chemical stability and suitable for topical dermal delivery. These FPR2 compounds show good potency at the receptor and, importantly, the FPR2 compounds are topically active, and therefore could be administered in many forms, including but not limited to creams, lotions, gels, solutions, sprays, and foams. These compounds may also be administered IV, intramuscularly, intrathecally, subcutaneously, orally or intraperitoneally. These compounds will be useful for the treatment of dermatological diseases including, but not limited to, rosacea, rosacea fulminans, sunburn, psoriasis, menopause-associated hot flashes, flushing and redness associated with hot flashes, erythema associated with hot flashes, hot flashes resulting from orchiectomyatopic dermatitis, treatment of redness and itch from insect bites, photoaging, seborrheic dermatitis, acne, allergic dermatitis, telangiectasia (dilations of previously existing small blood vessels) of the face, angioectasias, rhinophyma (hypertrophy of the nose with follicular dilation), acne-like skin eruptions (may ooze or crust), burning or stinging sensation, erythema of the skin, cutaneous hyperactivity with dilation of blood vessels of the skin, Lyell's syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, local itching and discomfort associated with hemorrhoids, hemorrhoids, erythema multiforme minor, erythema multiforme major, erythema nodosum, eye puffiness, urticaria, pruritis, purpura, varicose veins, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, nummular dermatitis, generalized exfoliative dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, perioral dermatitis, pseudofolliculitis barbae, granuloma annulare, actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, eczema, dermal wound healing, hypertrophic scars, keloids, burns, rosacea, atopic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, viral warts, photoaging, photodamage, melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, other disorders of pigmentation, and alopecia (scarring and non-scarring forms). The compounds below would be expected to have therapeutic effects in many different types of skin disease, but have been exemplified by demonstrating accelerated wound healing activity in a mouse dermal wound healing model (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and reduction of LL-37-induced inflammation in mice (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and human keratinocytes (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Anti-inflammatory activity in the LL-37-induced rosacea mouse model has been exemplified with three FPR2 agonists: {[(2S)-2-{[(4-bromo-2-fluorophenyl)carbamoyl]amino}-4-methylpentanoyl]amino}acetic acid, {[(2S,3S)-2-{[(4-bromophenyl)carbamoyl]amino}-3-methylpentanoyl]amino}acetic acid, {[(2S)-2-{[(4-bromophenyl)carbamoyl]amino}-4-methylpentanoyl]amino}acetic acid. Skin penetration of FPR2 agonists following topical administration has also been demonstrated (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">FPR2 agonists would be expected to have significant effects in many different types of dermatological inflammation, but have been exemplified by demonstrating wound healing in a mouse model of punch dermal wound (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Anti-inflammatory activity in this model has been exemplified with the FPR2 agonists described in Table 4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">FLIPR:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">HEK-Gα16 cells stably expressing the human FPR2 receptor was utilized. Cells were plated into 384-well poly-D-lysine coated plates at a density of 18,000 cells per well one day prior to use. The growth media was DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 400 μg/ml geneticin. On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed twice with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution supplemented with 20 mM HEPES (HBSS/hepes buffer). The cells were then dye loaded with 2 μM Fluo-4 diluted in the HBSS/Hepes buffer and incubated at 37° C. for 40 minutes. Extracellular dye was removed by washing the cell plates four times prior to placing the plates in the FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader, Molecular Devices). Ligands were diluted in HBSS/Hepes buffer and prepared in 384-well microplates. Data for Ca<sup>+2 </sup>responses were obtained in relative fluorescence units.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">Immunohistochemistry:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">Fluorescent immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific to FPR2 was used to determine localization in normal human skin. Anti-FPR2 antibody (Abcam) was used at a dilution of 1:200 to detect FPR2 protein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">Dermal Wound Healing Model:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">Groups of 5 ICR male mice weighing 24-28 g were used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">During the study, the tested animals were housed in individual cages. Under hexobarbital (90 mg/kg, i.p.) anesthesia, the shoulder and back region of each animal was shaved. A sharp punch (ID 12 mm) was applied to remove the skin including <i>Panniculus carnosus </i>and adherent tissues. The wound area, traced onto clear plastic sheets, was measured by use of an Image—ProPlus (Media Cybernetics, Version 4.5.0.29) on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. Test substances and vehicle (Placebo, 20 μL/mouse) were administered topically (TOP) once daily post skin punch for a total of 10 consecutive days. The positive control of CGS-21680 in 0.5% CMC/PBS, pH 7.4 was given topically as the same regimen. The percent closure of the wound (%) was calculated, and wound half-closure time (CT50) was analyzed by linear regression using Graph-Prism (Graph Software USA). One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test was applied for comparison between the treated and vehicle groups at each measurement time point. Differences are considered significant at P&lt;0.05.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">LL37-Induced Model of Rosacea in Mice:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">Prior to dosing, animals are lightly anaesthetized with isofluorane and baseline right and left ear thickness measurements are made with a digital caliper (Mitutoyo 293-340). At t=−1 hrs, animals are lightly anaesthetized with isoflurane to allow topical application (dorsal side) of 10 μL of FPR2 agonist formulated in a vehicle consisting of PBS:ethanol (50:50), or vehicle control to both ears. At t=0 hr, mice are re-anaesthetized. Following ear thickness measurements, 20 uL of LL-37 (100 μM) is injected into the right ear, while PBS is injected into the left ear. Additional ear thickness measurements are taken at t=3 and 6 hours. After the last time point, mice are euthanized by CO<sub>2 </sub>inhalation and ears collected for additional analyses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">In Vitro Human Skin Penetration Model:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">Briefly, split-thickness human abdominal skin (˜0.50 mm) sections from two donors were mounted in flow-through diffusion cells (PermeGear). FPR2 agonists are applied at a dose of 10 μL to a surface area of 0.64 cm<sup>2 </sup>(n=7 per compound). PBS is pumped beneath the skin at a constant flow rate of ˜42 μL/min. Receptor fluid samples are collected at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hrs and analyzed by LC/MS/MS.</div>
