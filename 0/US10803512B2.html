<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The present invention is generally directed to methods and systems for object discovery and mapping through an app with a GUI for displaying an object map and a narrowcast channel for facilitating additional object discovery. The present invention provides a context for creating an object map and developing the object map through addition of new objects, with particular applicability for mapping products and services and discovering new products and services. The narrowcast channel, or object recommendation channel, includes products advertised or offered for sale on the Internet. This user interface driven system of the present invention provides for application oriented object mapping and discovery via a GUI of the application. Signals are formed using raw data from this app as well as other user data and device data, and are sent or sold to parties and devices which can aid in further object discovery, such as vendors. These signal constructs enable these improved methods and systems for object discovery while simultaneously providing for improved, secure transfer of electronic data between the device running the app and devices which facilitate further object discovery, including vendor computers. Advantageously, the signal constructs protect consumer privacy and prevent the disclosure of the raw data, thus preserving the value of that raw data. Devices which receive the signals, such as vendor computers, send targeted advertisements and offers to the app based on the contents of the signal, with these targeted advertisements and offers being operable to be added to the object map and/or facilitate a purchase through the app.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">By way of background, creators of signals are the sellers of information. Signal constructs are used to provide feedback on stimuli and are discussed at length herein and in related applications U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,223, filed Mar. 14, 2014, U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,232, filed Mar. 14, 2014, U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,253, filed Mar. 14, 2014, U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,269, filed Mar. 14, 2014, now U.S. Pat. No. 9,799,042, U.S. application Ser. No. 14/633,770, filed Feb. 27, 2015, U.S. application Ser. No. 14/677,315, filed Apr. 2, 2015, and U.S. application Ser. No. 15/821,014, filed Nov. 22, 2017, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The content of a seller's information based upon an historical interaction with one or more events, objects or activities that correspond to the behavior of a multitude of objects. Sellers of data or information have multiple requests to share their information. Signals or indicators are a mechanism to share derived information without disclosing the raw data. The value of any asset is highly correlated to the price that buyers are willing to pay.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">There is a longstanding and unmet need for providing an automated, virtual signals data marketplace or exchange where signal creators (also the signal sellers and/or signal owners) selectively provide information of interest to signal buyers for defined uses, while protecting the underlying data and maintaining the control of the signal seller through its usage within a network-based, distributed data exchange where economic value of the data, as derived from its use, is the central pricing mechanism within agreements between the sellers and buyers. Nothing in infinite supply can have a price. Data may theoretically have an infinite value, but once it is shared, further dissemination is hard to prevent, thus the value of data quickly diminishes once it is shared. It is an objective of the signals exchange marketplace to create a market for data within a signal or indicator framework, which protects the underlying data that the signals or indicators represent. This signals metaphor allows each signal or indicator provider/owner/seller the ability to construct, control and price their signals and protect further dissemination of both the signals, as well as the underlying data and constrains use of the data for defined objectives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">As illustrated in the various figures, the present invention provides systems and methods for processing signals in a virtualized or cloud-based computing system, including at least one correlation engine for processing the signals. The correlation engine defines what how signals correlate to objects, events, activities, behaviors and other identifiers. In other words, the correlation engine assists buyers, sellers and the market which signals are best for which requests. While the correlation engine does not structure data, the signals are constructed and corrected with input from internal and external data as well as locally held object behavior estimators, object state estimators and signal response management. By way of example, a correlation engine is described within U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,839 for “Processor and processing element for use in a neural network” by inventor Mobus, filed Aug. 29, 1994, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In systems embodiments for processing signals in a virtualized or cloud-based computing system according to the present invention, the following components and their relationships are provided: a distributed data system having a remote server computer constructed and configured for network-based communication with a marketplace and or a multiplicity of distributed computers, wherein the remote computer server includes at least one data correlation engine operable to generate at least one correlation from at least one internal signal as it relates to at least one object, event, behavior, state or activity.

Significantly, this remote data correlation is shared with the centralized marketplace to assist with buyer discovery and object feedback. Third party observers thus participate in the marketplace to provide feedback on objects, which may be covered within a multitude of agreements between a multitude of sellers and buyers. Observers are entities that can attest to object state, behavior, activities or events. Observers may not be direct party in the buyer and seller agreements.

The system provides incorporation of observations and feedback corresponding to the behavior, the activity, and/or the event, and then the correlation engine(s) automatically adjust the correlation value(s) for the signal(s) based on the feedback; then the system operates to update the signal index to include the feedback. Signal feedback is used by the systems and methods of the present invention to correct estimated behaviors, correlations, and states in a federated signals environment. By way of example and not limitation, observer attributions may be have different weight, value or trust to different participants. In competitive situations, some observers are economically incented to provide erroneous data to a defined buyer.

By way of example and not limitation, historically when a person (Joe) travels to Chicago he has historically flown by United Airlines, stays at a Marriott, and eats at a steak chain restaurant for dinner. This information is held by many signal sellers such as airlines, credit card companies, hotel chains, mobile phone companies, etc. Thus the object Joe has behaviors that are correlated to travel to Chicago. In this example, the airline observer would correlate their historical travel data on passenger travel to Chicago for object Joe and return information regarding the recency and frequency of Joe's travel to Chicago. An object behavior estimator could further predict the future travel based not only on an airline observer's historical data, but their data correlated to external data such as a business conference, or another objects actions and behaviors (e.g., Joe always travels with Susan to Chicago), or the presence of Joe's computer in an airport as observed by a Wi-Fi hot spot. To summarize, the statistical machines within the data correlation engines and the estimators provide correlation of internal data to external objects and behaviors, and the reputations of the source.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In systems and methods of the present invention, a neural network leveraging distributed signals is provided, and operable for generating and/or calculating predicted object state and/or behavior. The distributed signals-based neural network further includes both a remote and centralized systems for estimating object state and object behavior estimators forming a network. The object state and object behavior estimation network can be used improve correlations and predict behaviors and states of objects based upon observations, events, behaviors, activities. A marketplace neural computer having at least one correlation engine, at least one object estimator, and at least one mechanism for external observation is used to aggregate remotely held correlations, estimations, observations, and statistical models. The remote neural computer predicts objects state and behavior based data held remotely. The marketplace neural computer predicts the relationship of object state and behavior to signals based upon the aggregate of participant predictions, models, history, and observations. Importantly, the marketplace neural computer is dependent on a multitude of remote data within relevant participants to operate. In other words the marketplace neural computer does not hold the signal payload, or raw data, but rather aggregated relationship of signals to objects, behaviors, and activities. The present invention further includes an object behavior estimator for creating an estimation based upon an input; the object behavior estimator functions to provide prediction where correlation exists between one or more objects, activities, states, behaviors or other signals. The provides for estimation of and object, activity, or behavior of the first type signal which subsequently can be used as a predictor of an episode of a second type, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Marketplace statistical systems within signals management <b>250</b> provide for the correlation of signals, the estimation of value, the estimation of state, the estimation of behavior, and so on. Correlation engines relate the historical and predicted performance of signals both in isolated and combined usage, thus retaining the ability to assess value for a single signal within the marketplace and its participants. In addition to combining signals, the marketplace statistical engine also includes random samples of other signals. When two or more signals are used toward an objective it is statistically necessary to vary the use of signals in order to properly calculate their performance, covariance and other correlations. The marketplace varies use of signals by altering their content, weighting, and presence or adding other signal information. By way of example and not limitation, an Italian restaurant wishes to advertise after the showing of a movie at a movie theater. The movie theater has a signal LEAVING MOVIE THEATER for a given object, or consumer. The campaign manager that manages the advertising campaign for an Italian restaurant finds the movie theater signal of use, but must gain additional information to determine which consumers leaving the movie theater prefer Italian food. The campaign manager requests AFFINITY to ITALIAN FOOD for a given object or consumer from the consumer's bank and the same signal from an Italian Food magazine. By varying the AFFINITY to ITALIAN FOOD use signals from the bank and the magazine, and including random signals, the statistical performance, correlation, and covariance of the bank signals, the magazine signals, and other prospective signals can be easily calculated within the marketplace signal management. Thus, signal sellers are required to support signals management driven requests for any registered signal data to assess the cross correlation of signals. Such random signals are anonymized to protect the anonymity of the signal source and content. Random sampling is also used to assess the unique performance of specific signal types, and identify and or update correlations, prediction, estimations and interdependencies of signals, object, events and behaviors. In this way the random samples allow the marketplace to update correlations and indices in a way which allows for automated identification of alternate data sources which may improve price-performance of a given objective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment of the present invention a behavior estimator is provided. A behavior estimator is a unique linear, multi-staged adaptive filter which models a synaptic processor. The multistage filter is a sequence of interacting processes which interact with defined stimuli or signals. Processes are impacted by other processes, other signals, environmental forces and most importantly the history of process patterns within any given object. The behavior estimator is a computational model of principles seen in the biological model. It produces a response to the current primary input which is proportional not only to that input, but also to both the history of the input and, optionally, the history of secondary correlated inputs. By way of example, a synaptic processor within a neural network is described within U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,839, referenced and incorporated supra. This device is the basis of a new machine learning approach that addresses a critical problem in the construction of autonomous and/or automatic or intelligent agents within a federated data and distributed signals environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The present invention further includes methods, systems, and apparatus embodiments for object estimation and/or data processing. In one embodiment of the present invention, a mechanism to estimate object state may be determined by a distributed Kalman filter, using distributed data processing techniques. By way of example, Kalman filtering techniques are described in WIPO International Publication No. WO1988001409 for “Distributed kalman filter” by inventor Hubert Chin, filed Aug. 10, 1987, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Kalman filtering techniques have been developed primarily for estimating state parameters in dynamic systems; they have been used in many applications, such as control systems, where real time measurements are not possible. The Kalman filter, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm_that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing noise (random variations) and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more precise than those based on a single measurement alone. More formally, the Kalman filter operates recursively on streams of noisy input data to produce a statistically optimal estimate of the underlying system state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The distributed Kalman filter network includes a state processor. The distributed Kalman filter also preferably includes means for combining input signals having noise with a first state vector and an object present state vector to produce a derivative state vector, and means for integrating the derivative state vector to produce the object present state vector, and means for combining a second object present state vector in the first combining means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Furthermore, the Kalman filter is a widely applied concept in time series analysis used in fields such as signal processing and econometrics. The algorithm works in a two-step process. In the prediction step, the Kalman filter produces estimates of the current state variables, along with their uncertainties. Once the outcome of the next measurement (necessarily corrupted with some amount of error, including random noise) is observed, these estimates are updated using a weighted average, with more weight being given to estimates with higher certainty. The method utilizes various mathematical multivariate structural time series models and applies Kalman filters where appropriate. The mathematical multivariate structural time series models are enormously powerful tools which open the way to handling a wide range of data. A strong feature of time series models used in conjunction with state-space models is the usage of an algorithm for filtering, smoothing and predicting. A state-space model is a two-layer model. An external layer involves an observed process ‘y’. This process is assumed to follow a measurement equation:
<br/>
<i>yt=Ztαt+dt+εt </i>
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">For each t, yt is a n-vector. The n*m matrix Zt is a matrix of regressors, while at is the regression coefficient. The vectors Et are independent multi-normals with zero mean and covariance Ht. The internal layer involves the unobserved process a. The process is assumed to follow the transition equation:
<br/>
α<i>t=Ttαt+ct+Rtnt </i>
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Here Tt is an m*n matrix, Rt is an m*q matrix and the components of white noise nt have a multi-normal distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix Qt. The process is initiated with a random vector αo, which has a mean of ao and a covariance matrix of Po. The elements Zt, dt, Ht, Tt, ct, Rt, and Qt are referred to as the system matrices. If the system matrices do not change in time the system is said to be time-invariant or time homogeneous. The system is also stationary for a specific selection of ao and Po.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Once the data has been put in state space form, the Kalman filter may be applied which in turn leads to algorithms for prediction and smoothing. The Kalman filter also opens the way to a maximum likelihood estimation of unknown parameters in a model. This is achieved via prediction error decomposition. Thus, a Kalman filter can be used to access and predict cost of medical services based on acceptable data associated with such services or similar services.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The Kalman filter is a recursive procedure for computing an optimal estimator of a state vector at time t, based on information available at time t. In certain engineering applications, the Kalman filter is important due to on-line estimations. The current value of a state vector is of prime interest (for example, the vector may represent the coordinates of escalating charges from the medical service provider) and the Kalman filter enables the estimate of the state vector to be continually updated as new observations become available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Another reason for the importance of Kalman filter is that when disturbances and initial state vectors are normally distributed, the Kalman filter enables likelihood function to be calculated via what is known as a prediction error decomposition. This opens the way for the estimation of any unknown parameters in the model. The Kalman filter also provides the basis for statistical resting and model specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The Kalman filter is an efficient recursive algorithm for the computation of the optimal estimator at and at, given the information up to (and including) t. A by product is the computation of the error in estimation:
<br/>
<i>Pt=E</i>[(α<i>t−αt</i>)(α<i>t−αt</i>)′]
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Suppose that at time t−1, at −1, and Pt−1 are given. The algorithm then computes the predicted values with the prediction equations:

<i>Pt/t−</i>1<i>=TtPt−</i>1<i>Tt′+RtQtRt′</i>

<i>Ft=ZtPt/t−</i>1<i>Zt′+Ht </i>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Once the new observation yt becomes available, the estimates of the state can be updated using the updating equations:

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">As such the Kalman filter is used in a novel technique to predict costs of medical procedures based on cost information of similar medical procedures. The Kalman filter can be used to accurately estimate a cost of a new medical procedure.

Additional method steps include: the step of automatically updating the listed index and/or creating new listings; receiving a defined use and an agreement to report on a result of use by a registered buyer with the server computer; releasing signal data to a registered buyer based upon the agreement between the signal owner and the registered buyer; monitoring performance of the at least one signal compared with a corresponding objective; automatically determining a relevance to an objective for the at least one signal based on comparison with consumer feedback and consumer behavior; and/or limiting signal availability based upon a rules engine that automatically considers buyer agreement, identity, campaign type, signal requested, price, redemption signal type, purchase quantity, past performance of signal, past performance of campaign type, past performance of buyer; automatically correlating how the value of the information decays over time and with respect to relevance to the objective; and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">According to the present invention, the signal owner controls how the at least one signal is created, generated and/or constructed and how the at least one signal is used by the buyer, although for facilitating the virtual marketplace or exchange between signal sellers and signal buyers, preferably the at least one signal includes a signal type selected from the group consisting of: event signals, activity signals, behavior signals, performance signals, relational signals, location signals, loyalty signals, purchase signals, social signals, and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Methods of the present invention further include the step of generating a value of signal relevance to the objective based upon signal feedback, object behavior, object state, and/or consumer reputation; and, more particularly, wherein the value of the at least one signal depends upon the time of the at least one signal from an event occurrence, and wherein the value of the at least one signal decays over time. Also, the methods include the step of automatically correlating how the value of the information decays over time and with respect to relevance to the objective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Preferably, the virtual marketplace or exchange server computer receives feedback from the buyers and observers regarding qualities of relevance, correlation, and/or strength of each of the at least one signal. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a signal quality and a signal reputation are automatically generated by the virtual marketplace based upon an assessment of signal performance compared with an objective and/or based on the feedback received.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">The present invention virtual data marketplace for signals is built on the framework of creating signals or indicators by their corresponding signal owners or signal sellers, the method steps performed by a signal owner include: constructing at least one signal associated with a behavior of an object and/or an activity and/or an event associated with the object in a signal owner computer that is constructed and configured for network-based communication with a remote server computer, wherein the at least one signal based upon at least two factors associated with each value, the at least two factors selected from the group consisting of: event, object state, change in state, behavior of an object, relationship to another object, relationship to a behavior, economic indicators, relevance to an objective, near-real-timeliness, frequency, recency, predictive accuracy, fidelity, reputation of the signal, reputation of the seller, affinity to a target, usefulness to an objective, and combinations thereof; generating a first value for each of the at least one signal; and tracking usage of the at least one signal. Also, the at least one signal provides a feedback corresponding to the behavior, state, activity, and/or the event. Additional steps include indexing the at least one signal; listing the indexed signals in a remote database associated with the remote server computer; communicating the remote index signal to the centralized data marketplace signal index, wherein the centralized signal index listing provides for automated discovery and matching with buyer candidates having corresponding objectives for buying signals and signals data, wherein the objectives may include object behavior(s), activities, performance, and/or events; and updating the listing of the indexed signals by the signal seller or signal owner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">The at least one signal includes a signal type selected from the group consisting of: event signals, activity signals, behavior signals, relational signals, location signals, loyalty signals, purchase signals, social signals, and combinations thereof. Signals are generated or constructed from both structured and unstructured data. Significantly, each signal owner controls how the at least one signal is created, generated and/or constructed; in embodiments of the present invention, methods of the present invention provide steps wherein signals or indicators are created by the signal owner transforming its own data into the signals or indicators through steps of automatically organizing structured data, unstructured data, external data <b>360</b>-<b>80</b> based upon historical patterns, external usage, external feedback, external object observations, locally maintained correlation engines, centrally managed correlation engines, signal response management, and object estimators. In constructing the at least one signal or indicator, preferably the signal seller (or its system and seller correlation engine) automatically determines a relevance to an objective from historical performance and including external observations and feedback on object state, activity or behavior.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">While the definition and construction of the signal is at the discretion of the Seller, generally signals conform to a common signal structure whose elements are named and formatted to marketplace conventions for the purpose of creating a common taxonomy for exchange of signal information. In the case of a signal exchange within a signals marketplace, but also for exchange outside of a marketplace, the signal structure provides for secure and reliable transportation and translation of an information payload contained with a signal. The signal construct defines the source, the destination, the delivery channel, the method for securing the data, the agreement under which the data is exchanged, a transaction identifier, a transaction time, information necessary to confirm receipt, template which describe the message type, and the payload of the message. Sellers and buyers use the signals construct to create, register, publish, discover, assess, sell, manage, and measure data exchange according to the systems and methods of the present invention. Signal types include both buyer-initiated and seller-initiated signals; some examples follow for illustration purposes, but are not intended to limit the claimed invention thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Buyer Initiated Behavior Signal (BIBS). Behavior signals are published by sellers which observe object behavior. For a given buyer initiated behavior signal, the buyer of a behavior signal requests behavior signal from seller for a given event, object or category of objects. The content of the seller's signal is based upon an historical interaction with one or more events, objects or activities that correspond to the behavior of an object. To obtain the seller's signal, the buyer must provide a reference point for the seller to create the behavior signal. In this model it is the request of the buyer triggers the exchange of data. For a given reference point, the seller's signal describes a behavior such and such information as the recency and the frequency of the behavior. By way of example and not limitation, a behavior name is illustrated by “Travel-To [Variable]”. The buyer initiates the request and seeds the reference point variable for the signal. Each buyer could pay a different price depending on the value they derive from the signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Buyer Initiated Event Signal (BIES). Event signals are published by sellers which observe events. For a given buyer initiated event signal, the buyer of an event signal requests objects, or categories of objects from seller that have a relationship to a given event. The content of the seller's signal is based upon an historical interaction with one or more events, objects or activities that correspond to an event. To obtain the seller's signal, the buyer must provide a reference point for the seller to create the event signal. In this model it is the request of the buyer triggers the exchange of data. A signal request is initiated by the buyer asking the seller if a given reference event has occurred. The signal response can contain information on the event, objects within the event, recency, frequency, location, as well as specifics surrounding the event. By way of example and not limitation, consider “movie purchases in Cincinnati Ohio in last five minutes” as a signal request of this type, each buyer could pay a different price depending on the value they derive from the signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">Seller Initiated Behavior Signal (SIBS). In this case the seller is initiating (or publishing) that a behavior has occurred. The content of the seller's signal is based upon a current or historical interaction with one or more events, objects or activities which correspond to the behavior of an object. The signals can be published to one or more buyers, and prospective buyers as the activity occurs. Each buyer could pay a different price depending on the value they derive from the signal. By way of example and not limitation, consider “consumer [CONSUMER NAME] is shopping in [Location]” as a signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Seller Initiated Event Signal (SIES). Seller is publishing an event to one or more buyers. The content of the seller's signal is based upon a current or historical interaction with one or more events, objects or activities which correspond to the behavior of an object. From a software design perspective, this model is consistent with software based publish/subscribe paradigm. Within commerce signals buyers “subscribe” to an event made known by the seller. Each buyer could pay a different price depending on the value they derive from the signal. The seller initiates the signal, and can communicate specifics about the event. By way of example and not limitation, consider “consumer [CONSUMER NAME] purchased movie ticket” as a signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">The signals may be directly derived, constructed, or generated from signal owner raw data (including data sourced by the signal seller) and/or synthetic signals may be constructed from at least one signal or a multiplicity of signals, i.e., one or more signals are used to construct additional signals, so the synthetic signals are not directly associated with the underlying raw data. Once again, signals or indicators according to the present invention are generated or constructed from both structured and unstructured data of the signal owner. Similarly, a consensus signal or a generalized signal from one or more signals. Note that the method steps of the present invention are made for a multiplicity of signals and corresponding signal owners, in particular in the case of distribution in the context of a virtual marketplace or exchange for signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Preferably, after constructing signals, their distribution or sale to buyers is controlled by the signal owner and rules governing seller signals or owner signals that provide for limiting signal availability based upon a rules engine that automatically considers buyer identity, campaign type, signal requested, price, redemption signal type, purchase quantity, past performance of signal, past performance of campaign type, past performance of buyer, and combinations thereof. The rules engine resides within a remote computer of the signal seller and is communicated through a distributed network, either directly and/or within a virtual marketplace having a centralized rules engine governing the management of the exchange of signals for a multiplicity of signal sellers and signal buyers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Signal value cannot be established conclusively independently of a signal buyer's objective. Additionally the value of any of the signals depends upon signal relevance to the objective based upon a multiplicity of factors, including feedback such as time from last observation and/or interaction, effectiveness of consumer interaction, depth of interaction, consumer feedback, buyer behavior, and/or consumer reputation. The signal seller correlation engines provide options for automatically correlating how the signals or indicators relate to data held within the signal seller to data external to the signal seller. The present invention also provides an embodiment including a method for adjusting the correlation of data with time and with respect to relevance to the objective(s) of buyers. Significantly, regardless of the objectives, generally the value of the signal(s) depends upon the time of the signal construction from an event occurrence, wherein the value of the signal decays over time. Also, the present invention provides for the economic value of the signal to decay over time. By way of example and not limitation, consider a signal “Consumer [ID] Purchased Movie Ticket at TIME”. This signal has relevance to a buyer's objective which is dependent on time since the observation. In other words a signal has a higher relevance if it is one second old, and a lesser relevance as time progresses. The economic value of a signal is in proportion to its relevance, hence the value of the signal is also higher if the signal is one second old, and a lesser value as time progresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Feedback is a form of signal sourced from observers of objects. Observers typically have no need to maintain historical information, but rather report on current object state or activity. By way of example and not limitation, consider a Wi-Fi hotspot at LOCATION that has a current request for access from COMPUTER ID. If the objective of a signal buyer was for COMPUTER ID presence at LOCATION, then this observation is relevant to the buyer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Furthermore, the process of receiving feedback from observers, pertaining to object state, activity, performance and behavior, provides a mechanism to assess and adjust performance of marketplace participants, marketplace systems, signals and campaigns operating within a federated data marketplace. And so evolving the at least on signal based upon the feedback received is an additional step in methods of the present invention. Additionally, a signal quality and a signal reputation is automatically generated (by the correlation engine of the signal seller and/or by the signal marketplace or signal exchange) based upon an assessment of signal feedback. The signal feedback may provide information useful for evaluating performance of the signal compared with the buyer's objectives; the virtual marketplace will determine what feedback is relevant toward any objective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The present invention provides methods for creating signals or indicators by corresponding signal owners, the method steps performed by a signal owner includes: constructing at least one signal associated with a behavior of an object and/or an activity and/or an event associated with the object in a signal owner computer that is constructed and configured for network-based communication with a remote server computer, wherein the value of the signals is controlled by the seller and based upon at least two factors associated with each value, the at least two factors selected from the group consisting of: event, object state, change in state, behavior of an object, relationship to another object, relationship to a behavior, economic indicators, relevance to an objective, near-real-timeliness, frequency, recency, predictive accuracy, fidelity, reputation of the signal, reputation of the seller, affinity to a target, usefulness to an objective, and combinations thereof; generating a first value for each of the at least one signal; and tracking usage of the at least one signal. Also, the at least one signal provides a feedback corresponding to the behavior, activity, and/or the event. Additional steps include indexing the at least one signal; listing the indexed signals in a remote database associated with the remote server computer, communicating the remote index to the centralized data marketplace signal index, wherein the centralized signal index listing provides for automated discovery and matching with buyer candidates having corresponding objectives for buying signals and signals data, wherein the objectives include consumer behavior(s), events, object states, object performance; and updating the listing of the remote and centralized indices by the signal seller or signal owner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">The content of the seller's signal is based upon the seller's interaction with one or more events, objects or activities. Signals are generated or constructed from both structured and unstructured data, which contain records of interaction. Significantly, each signal owner controls how the at least one signal is created, generated and/or constructed; in embodiments of the present invention, methods of the present invention provide steps wherein signals or indicators are created by the signal owner transforming its own data into the signals or indicators through steps of automatically organizing structured data, unstructured data and external data <b>360</b>-<b>80</b> based upon historical patterns, external usage, external feedback, external object observations, locally maintained correlation engines, centrally managed correlation engines, signal response management, and object estimators. While the definition and construction of the signal is at the discretion of the seller, generally signals conform to a common signal structure whose elements are named and formatted to marketplace conventions for the purpose of creating a common taxonomy for publishing, discover and exchange of signal information. By way of example and not limitation, the taxonomy of the at least one signal includes a signal type selected from the group consisting of: state signals, event signals, activity signals, behavior signals, relational signals, location signals, loyalty signals, purchase signals, social signals, and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The present invention provides for the signal owner selectively sharing signals information with signal buyers in a virtual marketplace or exchange, wherein the signals information includes a unique identifier associating each signal transmitted by an owner and/or signal seller for exchange with a signal buyer and/or signal data marketplace and agreement within which the data exchange was governed. Preferably, the information shared provides privacy protection for the signal owner. Furthermore, each signal includes an defines the source, the destination, the delivery channel, the method for securing the data, the agreement under which the data is exchanged, a transaction identifier, a transaction time, information necessary to confirm receipt, template which describe the message type, and the payload of the message. In any case, the signals or indicators constructed by the signal seller (signal owner) provide the seller with a mechanism to protect the underlying data from which the signals or indicators are derived. Also, in preferred embodiments, additional privacy protection may be provided by at least one of: screening, anonymizing, and/or using hashed values. For example with hashed values, methods provide for matching credit card objects with MD5 hash of a credit card number allowing signal sellers to identify behavior on the match of hash values versus the match of actual credit card numbers; importantly the MD5 hash cannot be easily reversed (except by NSA). Both entities or parties to the transaction are doing consistent hash, but neither one disclose a number. The same methods and systems are used with email hash; it confirms the match, but only discloses the encrypted information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Systems and methods of the present invention provide for releasing signal data to a registered buyer based upon an agreement between the signal owner and the registered buyer. Before an agreement is generated, the signal seller retains control of the signal data until after receiving a defined use by a registered buyer, which provides one of the key terms for the agreement. Preferably, the agreement also provides requirements for feedback and/or measurement of objective, such as by way of example and not limitation, to report on a result of use by a registered buyer. Also, the release of the signal data is can be either based upon an observance by the seller or by a request of the buyer. In another embodiment, the release of signal data is based upon a trigger. Preferably, the release of signal data or signals to registered buyer(s) is automatic based upon detection of the trigger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">The systems and methods of the present invention also provide for automatically confirming receipt of the at least one signal by a destination or signal buyer(s); this step is achieved by automated messaging generated from the buyer computer and communicated automatically through the network to the seller computer directly and/or to the signal marketplace server computer for tracking the distribution of all signals and associated object identifiers based upon unique signal identifiers and the agreements between signal sellers and signal buyers for predetermined uses of the signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">As set forth in the foregoing, the construction of signals is provided for use between signal sellers and signal buyers via the virtual marketplace through a network for communication between their distributed computers and a remote server computer associated with the virtual marketplace for signals data. The present invention further provides methods and systems for establishing and using a virtual marketplace for value-based exchange of those constructed signals, wherein the value of the signals is determined in the context of willing signal buyers and signal sellers for the signals. The signals of the present invention are derived from data sources that are owned by a multiplicity of entities and/or individuals, and the signals are abstracted from distributed information and data associated with the multiplicity of entities and/or individuals to protect the underlying information and data. Each entity or individual that sells signals data in the virtual marketplace first converts or transforms their unique raw data (or underlying data) into a “signal” or signals, which are indicators associated with object behavior as observed by their respective owners. Importantly, each distributed data source which is a member of the marketplace may make remote indices and correlations available to the virtual marketplace for the purpose of aiding buyer discovery, matching, clearing and settlement, reputation, identifying data leakage, and performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">The value of any signal cannot be determined separate from one or more buyers, their objectives, and the corresponding use of the signals toward those objectives. Signal sellers create and define rules in which to sell signals. Rules can be based upon requestor, usage, object, behavior, performance, reputation or any other attribute available in the market. By way of example and not limitation, Barclays Bank will only allow consumer travel signals to be used by approved vendors and with explicit consumer permission for the a hotel reservation use. Buyers have the opportunity to request access to signals within the rules of the marketplace seller, consumer and other regulatory authority. Sellers may choose to accept requests within the terms of an agreement, which is maintained in the marketplace or directly between the two parties. In the case of a signals marketplace or exchange for the signals, the marketplace centralized server computer retains the information on the agreement, signal requests, signal exchanges, feedback, historical data, buyer, seller, seller reputation, signal reputation, price, effectiveness, rules, constraints, and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">According to the present invention, signal creators (signal sellers) or signal owners retain control of their respective data and the signals constructed therefrom, until a registered buyer defines use of the signals, agrees to report on result (by way of example and not limitation, reports on effectiveness for a given use) and other terms, and an agreement is created between buyer and seller. This method for creating and using signals or indicators establishes control, value, and price for those signals between the signal seller and signal buyer(s), and/or the signal sellers and signal buyers who are the participants in a virtual marketplace or signals exchange. The signal supplier or signal seller (or signal owner) controls how each signal is constructed or generated; the underlying data or information owned by the signal seller may be reconstructed or regenerated into more than one signal for use by third parties for different purposes. Marketplace rules govern construction, transmission and tracking of signal information and the associated object throughout their defined use; this allows signals to be correlated to object behavior. Tying signal performance to object behavior and object events subsequently provides for measurement of value and subsequent market based pricing of signals within the virtual marketplace. Object behavior may take the form of feedback from parties, which are external to any given agreement between buyer and seller. This object behavior obtained from external third party observers inform and correct the correlation of signals to objects and behavior within the marketplace. Importantly this correlation is external to information available to either buyer or seller independently. Third party observers thus participate in the marketplace to provide feedback on objects, which may be covered within a multitude of agreements between a multitude of sellers and buyers. Thus the present invention provides for the interaction of third party observers both directly to the signal sellers and across the entire marketplace participants. The signal construct defines the source, the destination, the delivery channel, the method for securing the data, the agreement under which the data is exchanged, a transaction identifier, a transaction time, information necessary to confirm receipt, template which describe the message type, and the payload of the message. The construction of a signal by a signal seller will have varying degrees of relevance to any given signal buyer and that buyer's objective, thus the value of the information and data, as well as the signals generated therefrom, will vary with its correlation and fidelity. This provides a natural feedback loop in the virtual marketplace or exchange. Signals that have poor fidelity or poor correlation with an objective will have poor performance, and thus a correspondingly poor price.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Signal sellers have minimal insight into prospective buyers, and the value of their signals in any given context. Visibility is further limited into competing data. For example, if an advertiser intends to sell hotels to frequent travelers of a predetermined destination, they have the choice of seeking information from flight records, geo location, rental car records, credit card issuers, etc., and combinations thereof. Buyers of information also have interests to optimize price for a given performance or quality of correlation. If a signal buyer could obtain geographic location information for $0.05 with a 70% correlation, it may well be a preferred purchase to flight records, which cost $5.00 and have a 100% correlation. Within a signals advertising application embodiment, the signal marketplace provides services to the buyer for discovering, directing and optimizing the purchase of signals for targeted advertising, including campaigns across multiple prospective sources, to determine which signals (if any) have relevance to a given advertising campaign, and providing both buyers and sellers with a liquid market in which to exchange, and protect, information, while providing and purchasing use of the signals within the marketplace or exchange. Significantly, a category of signals that represents real time or near real time activity, events, states and behavior have values that decay quickly with time. In this instance a signal that represents an object's activity one second ago has a greater value than the same signal that is one hour old. The signals marketplace enables the transmission of these real time signals within the rules and constraints of the participants, consumers, marketplace and regulatory authorities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Furthermore, the marketplace for signals includes a signals index for discovery, tracking and comparing signals and their historical value, reputation and performance. Categories or groups of signals by type, behavior, seller, and usage are also provided. By way of example and not limitation, signals include an expression of frequency and relevance toward an input variable (e.g., affinity to a city, type of food, automobiles, sports, etc.). Also, signals responses are tracked with unique object identifiers which the seller uses internally to uniquely identify a given object. By way of example and not limitation, object identifiers include encrypted forms of e-mail address, phone number, location, loyalty card number, etc. Correlation between signals and their performance is represented by the signal pricing and trading (buying/selling) within the virtual marketplace, third party observers, and/or directly between signal sellers and signal buyers. Additionally, initial rating for expected correlation between signals and their performance is provided by the seller. A new signal will have no historical performance and thus buyers will likely minimize their purchase until the performance can be validated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">In the embodiment having a signals marketplace or exchange including at least one correlation engine, the centralized server computer associated with the signals marketplace maintains a master directory of signals and associated correlations in order to facilitate buyer discovery, matching, clearing and settlement, reputation, identifying data leakage, and performance. Historical performance of a signal, signal seller and third party observer information may be used to correlate between signals based upon buyer and usage. Additionally, initial rating for expected correlation between signals and their performance is provided by the seller. A new signal will have no historical performance and thus buyers may likely minimize their purchase or until the performance can be validated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flow diagram indicates signal construction or generation method steps. Signals are based on structured <b>380</b> and unstructured <b>370</b> data. The content of the seller's signal is based upon an historical interaction with one or more events, objects or activities that correspond to the behavior of an object. To obtain the seller's signal, the buyer must provide a reference point for the seller to create the behavior data. For example, a signal of AFFINITY_TO_CITY may require input of ID, and CITY_NAME. A plane, a phone, a consumer, a computer could all have an affinity to a city. Similarly a phone company, an airline, a rental car company, a bank, a search engine, a restaurant, or similar entity could all have a set of data that would inform the affinity toward a city. The signal seller has multiple options when constructing a signal of “AFFINITY_TO_CITY”, sellers could use consumer billing records, flight records, payment records, location records, in sourcing data for to respond to this request. In order to protect consumer information, the signal seller may use any source of information in constructing a response and a signal response is always normalized to be between 0 and 1. For example an airline may use flight information to determine that a consumer has traveled to NYC five times in the last year and has set AFFINITY_TO_CITY for New York equal to 0.5. The value of this information is completely dependent on its accuracy, recency, competing information sources, price and intended use. The marketplace informs, through marketplace analytics <b>250</b>, the rules and pricing engine <b>320</b> of relevant information to set price.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">Signal sellers have control over how they sell their signals data within the rules engine <b>320</b>. These rules can be constructed based on any marketplace attribute. For example if United Airlines bought signals data within the signal marketplace, or directly from signals seller(s), and receives a response from a signals data seller that is a competing airline for a particular traveler, United Airlines could surmise the this particular traveler uses the competing airline for travel to that city and could thus directly market to the that consumer. In one embodiment of the present invention, the signals data seller rules engine <b>320</b> is within the control and ownership of the each signal seller. In this case, the marketplace data is not held centrally; remote signal index information may be transferred to the common centralized server computer for the signals market. Significantly, this federated model provides for control of the data by the owner, allowing the marketplace to establish linkage to federated data owners, with each data owner in control of rules and parameters for the release of information to approved buyers; allowing the centralized market to manage rules during the exchange and provide for clearing and settlement of federated data (signals) for multiple participants and/or multiple federated data sources which act in concert toward a common objectives, with each participant paid based upon value delivered, observed externally or price agreed to.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">By way of example and not limitation, the signal marketplace rules include registration of participants, construction of signals, destruction and safeguarding of data, purchase of signals, use of signals, tracking of signal performance, clearing and settlement, marketplace history, tracking reputation of signals and all participants, involvement of non-participants, dispute process, participant responsibilities, and other significant areas. Given that the price of signals is unknown to any given buyer, the prospective buyer must first issue a request for quote to a signal seller. The request for quote contains information necessary for the seller to determine price and establish bid-response communication protocol. Sellers respond with a request for quote (RFQ) response or no response. If there is an RFQ response it can include acceptance or alternate terms. Upon receiving the RFQ response the buyer may propose alternate terms until an acceptance is issued by the seller via the network-based communications between distributed computing devices. Upon receiving the accepted RFQ message from the seller, the buyer issues a binding purchase confirmation after which the seller confirms receipt and respond with the delivery of the signal(s) in the timeframe specified. Signals can be transmitted in any volume defined within the purchase confirmation. By way of example and not limitation, signal pricing can consist of both fixed price and price based upon an objective measured within the marketplace. The marketplace embodying the invention provides an anonymous trading system having a communicating network for transmitting electronic messages between distributed computers of signal sellers and signal buyers. A plurality of order input devices such as buyer and seller terminals are connected to the communication network. Each signal order device may generate price quotation messages, which include bid and/or offer prices and may communicate estimated price and analytics information to a buyer. A plurality of seller rules and pricing engines are connected to the network, to match bids and offers the marketplace execute deals and records transactions where matches are made. At least one of the matching engines has an associated market publisher <b>400</b> (illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), which with the signal will be distributed and tracked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">Trackable behaviors are defined within the marketplace and may include by way of example and not limitation: purchase with one time use code, purchase with credit card, location, registration, viewing of a web site, opening of email, phone call or viewing of a television show or commercial. Marketplace rules require participants to record defined behaviors and object identifiers which are correlated to a signal, object, event or behavior.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Within the signals marketplace or virtual marketplace or exchange, signals from multiple sources can be combined to identify objects. Similarly, object correlation to other objects, object correlation to behaviors, object correlation to events, object correlation to states, are tracked so that the marketplace requests will match corresponding data. By way of example and not limitation, objects such as: a person, a car, and a computer can all be correlated. Each of these objects can also have behaviors that can be correlated using a correlation engine, which may be provided in the centralized server computer or distributed among computers in communication over a network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">By way of example and not limitation if the signal AFFINITY_TO_CITY (New York) was combined with AFFINITY_TO_THEATER the target audience of likely Broadway Ticket purchasers could be developed. A statistical engine within the marketplace cross correlates signal performance for any given objective. The statistical engine assesses the performance of signals both in isolated and combined usage, thus retaining the ability to assess value for a single signal within the marketplace and its participants. In addition to combining signals, the marketplace statistical engine also includes random samples of other signals. Thus, signal sellers are required to support analytics driven requests for their signals data to assess the cross correlation of signals. Random sampling is also used to assess the performance the unique performance of specific signal types, and identify and or update correlations, prediction, estimations and interdependencies of signals, object, events and behaviors. In this way the random samples allow the marketplace to update correlations and indices to may make automated suggestions of alternate data sources which may improve price-performance of a given objective. When two or more signals are used toward an objective it is statistically necessary to vary the use of signals in order to properly calculate their performance, covariance and other correlations. The marketplace varies use of signals by altering their content, weighting, and presence or adding other signal information. By way of example and not limitation, an Italian restaurant wishes to advertise after the showing of a movie at a movie theater. The movie theater has a signal LEAVING MOVIE THEATER for a given object, or consumer. The campaign manager that manages the advertising campaign for an Italian restaurant finds the movie theater signal of use, but must gain additional information to determine which consumers leaving the movie theater prefer Italian food. The campaign manager requests AFFINITY to ITALIAN FOOD for a given object or consumer from the consumer's bank and the same signal from an Italian Food magazine. By varying the AFFINITY to ITALIAN FOOD use signals from the bank and the magazine, and including random signals, the statistical performance, correlation, and covariance of the bank signals, the magazine signals, and other prospective signals can be easily calculated within the marketplace analytics.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">Federated Data Centralized Intelligence. With any given seller correlations can be held remotely with object behavior and state estimated from both internal and external data. Significantly, this remote data correlation is shared with the centralized marketplace to assist with buyer discovery and object feedback. This approach allows each signal seller to control their data within their own environment, and perform analysis locally to provide a standardized result set to data buyers. This standardized result set provides security to the owner of the data as to not allow unapproved usage and further dissemination. The result set and marketplace allow for the tracking of the benefit that this indicator provided to a given objective (e.g., marketing campaign). It also allows the seller to control the price of the response based upon the benefit to which it provides, understanding that it will provide different benefits to different buyers and different usages.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">By way of additional background for the signal marketplace of the present invention, it is a significant factor how the federated data for the distributed signals is used. As opposed to “sharing lists” and joining information within a single database. Federated data keeps raw data localized with the owner responsible for disclosure, usage, pricing, security, and privacy. Within a data marketplace federated data providers (sellers) use signals as a way to protect sensitive information. Signals (or indicators described hereinabove) are a type of meta data indicators that are based upon information in control of the data sellers. These signals or indicators require input context and are sold for purposes explicitly defined within the signal marketplace. For example, in an AFFINITY_TO_CITY signal example, consumer flight records are never shared nor is the traveler's current location, rather the signal response can reflect how often or how recently an object was associated with a given city. Signals create scarcity and enable control both of which are critical in any functional marketplace. The value of any good is dependent on quality, availability, use, alternatives and price. The virtual signal marketplace performs analysis on signal results to determine effectiveness and value. This information is communicated to all participants, which informs the market of potential buyers and sellers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">In order for a signal to be controlled, the following factors or considerations are required: a) the signal's owner must have sole discretion on access and dissemination; b) the underlying data or information associated with the signal must also be controlled, since there can be no efficient market for the data or signals if they can be obtained elsewhere at a lower cost; c) a signal request must contain information for the owner to release, which includes information on the buyer, status of agreement with marketplace, agreement with the buyer (if any), consumer constraints (if any), price offered, planned usage, and combinations thereof; the marketplace processes, systems, and services to protect the exchange, assure secure delivery, track usage, track value generated, settle funds, issue receipt, deliver auditability; and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">There are different control requirements on “consumer information” (or personally identifiable information or PII), proprietary information, object behavior information, object state information and other generic information. Some of these control requirements are driven by regulatory issues or requirements. Some information can only be exchanged to another party where an agreement is in place (i.e., a closed market). The control elements of a signal include the following: a) signal type: open, restricted, PII; b) signal price: market, floor, value generated c) buyer information or profile; d) consumer consent information (if any).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">After defining the signals to sell, and registering their corresponding rules and constraints, signals information is exchanged within the virtual signal marketplace. There are five primary data flows between a signal provider and the signal marketplace or signal exchange, including:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0164">1) RFQ. Request for quote. In this data flow, a prospective buyer will request a price from signal provider. The signal buyer provides: ID, signal(s) requested, input parameters (e.g., destination city, campaign type, price offered (per item and per success), time, expiry time, minimum fill, maximum, settlement. Along with this information the signal marketplace or signal exchange will also provide Buyer ID reputation information.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0165">2) RFQ Response. Signal Provider will either respond with an acceptance of order and time/quantity to fill, or a respond with alternate price/denial. The signal marketplace or signal exchange provides “optional” seller side software to manage this interaction. Rules surrounding minimum price, data effectiveness and buyer ID are incorporated to response. If offer is accepted, signal marketplace or signal exchange will begin tracking of the transaction order.</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0166">3) Purchase Confirmation. Buyers will issue purchase confirmation for approved RFQs. Within our marketplace agreement, a purchase confirmation is a commitment by the buyer to pay for information within the terms of the Commerce Signals Marketplace Agreement.</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0167">4) Signal Delivery. Signal provider provides the signals and buyer confirms receipt</li> <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0168">5) Settlement. Transaction Reference number, quantity provided, time provided, item fees (if any), redemption fees (if any), redemptions to date, redemption expiry period, amount paid, amount paid to date, dispute reference numbers, receipt confirmed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0169">The present invention creates a virtual market for data, wherein the underlying or actual data has been transformed into signals or indicators to protect the underlying data, while still providing information relating to the data that is actionable by signal buyers. Each data seller can develop their own signals or indicators, controlled by their own rules and corresponding correlation engine(s), which data they wish to sell to the outside world. For example a retailer could develop a signal “affinity for golf” with a result of 0-1. Consumers who buy golf balls, golf equipment would have a stronger signal based upon affinity. Golf marketers could subsequently use this information to better inform advertising, in particular for targeted advertising campaigns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0170">Signal buyers participate directly with signal sellers and/or in the marketplace to identify objects that they wish to influence or measure. Other entities, such as campaign managers, publishers, media companies take different roles in the measurement and influencing of the behavior of objects through the use of signal information. The virtual marketplace supports both buyer led transactions and seller led transactions. By way of example and not limitation seller led campaigns can begin with a publisher that has a relationship with a consumer of a given profile. Buyers can bid for the influencing the behavior of that consumer through the marketplace. Marketplace participants can assume multiple roles such as buyer, seller, and distributor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0171">Regardless of signal or indicator construction, signals must be registered to participate in the signal marketplace. To provide security to protect the signals within the marketplace, and to control signal dissemination or access and distribution to signals registered in the signal marketplace, multiple object identifiers can be used. By way of example and not limitation these include encrypted forms of e-mail address, card number, phone numbers, device ID, location, loyalty card and address as key for purchase of information from a seller. Thus the data seller or signal provider controls the information that is shared within the marketplace and with prospective buyers. These controls relate to access, viewing, downloading, copying, etc. and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0172">Technical communication protocols for signals include writing data of the buyer into a buyer computer application; notifying buyer computer application to send XML file when data has been written to the marketplace order computer application data file by the buyer computer application; monitoring the marketplace order computer application queue from the marketplace execution application for notification that data has been written to the data file by the buyer computer application; reading the data of the buyer computer application data file from the marketplace execution computer application upon detection of notification; notifying marketplace order computer application to send XML file when data has been written to the seller computer application data file by the marketplace order computer application; monitoring the seller computer application queue from the marketplace order application for notification that data has been written to the data file by the marketplace order computer application; notifying a buyer computer application read file when data has been read by the seller computer application from the marketplace order computer application data file; monitoring the seller read file from the marketplace order computer application for notification that data has been read from to the buyer computer application data file by the seller computer application to initiate further writing to the marketplace order computer application data file.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0173"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the invention illustrating components and functions relating to signals management, generally referenced <b>250</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0174">The object behavior estimator uses one or more statistical engines to predict behavior of an object to external signals (which represent events or stimuli). Objects such as people have a current state (e.g., in transit, having a baby, sitting at home) and historical behavior patterns that are both dynamic and complex. For example, historically when a person (Joe) travels to Chicago he has historically flown by united airlines, stays at a Marriott, and eats at a steak chain restaurant for dinner. This information is held by many Observers such as airlines, credit card companies, hotel chains, mobile phone companies, etc. Thus the object Joe has behaviors that are correlated to travel to Chicago.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0175">Observers which sell their observations in the data marketplace are signal sellers. There are two primary flows by which a signal sellers (or signal owners) interact with a signal buyer: Buyer Initiated Request for Signal, and Seller Initiated Signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0176">A buyer initiated signal typically requests predict behavior of an object from historical observation information. For example the signal request of affinity to City, with the object context of the city of Chicago for object Joe, could be sent to an airline observer. In this example, the airline observer would correlate their historical travel data on passenger travel to Chicago for object Joe and return information regarding the recency and frequency of Joe's travel to Chicago. An object behavior estimator could further predict the future travel based not only on an Airline observer's historical data, but their data correlated to external data such as a business conference, or another objects actions and behaviors (example Joe always travels with Susan to Chicago). Within the distributed (or federated) signals marketplace, each observer retains the correlation to external data signals, not based upon the data itself. For example the correlation engines for the airline above would hold both internal correlation of Joe's travel preferences toward an external signal request, and the correlation of airline data to other external objects and behaviors (Susan's travel and conference events). The airline would not know the identity of the object Susan, but only that there is a strong correlation to an external object behavior (Susan is traveling to Chicago). Neither would the airline know that the external event was a specific conference. To summarize, the statistical machines within the data correlation engines and the estimators provide correlation of internal data to external objects and behaviors. These correlations allow for prediction of current state and behavior to external stimuli, with external information protected by the signals construct.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0177">In a seller initiated signal, the observation signal has buyers that have registered for the observation, without historical context. In this model it is the buyer that has correlated an external signal (from the seller) toward an objective. An example of a seller initiated signal is an airline with a signal Airline-Ticket-Purchase by object at time. In this example, the seller initiated signal is an event, which one or more buyers have chosen to register for within the signals marketplace, and the seller has agreed to terms, which are contained within the Marketplace Contract Management System. For example, when Joe purchases an airline ticket, the airline (acting as signal seller) informs approved signal buyers Marriott and Hilton that Joe will be travelling to Chicago. Event signals are a primary real time mechanism for selling and transferring observations. The signals marketplace provides for the dissemination of approved real time data within the signals metaphor to protect the contents of the information (or underlying data), its usage and performance, and realize value of the information based upon time decay. The signal Purchased-Airline-Ticket has a higher value within 1 second of the event, than at 10 minutes, 10 hours, or 10 days. The marketplace provides for price prediction based upon the time decay, and for measurement of performance of the event signal during its use. For example, if the hotel chain Hilton was able to use the Signal Purchased-Airline-Ticket to secure a reservation by Joe, where Joe had previously stayed at Marriott, Hilton received a known value in the incremental sale of that Chicago room. If the Signal Purchased-Airline-Ticket was the only signal used in an advertising campaign (or “campaign”) to Joe, than the performance of the signal toward the objective is known. If Purchased-Airline-Ticket was used in conjunction with other information the marketplace will calculate the proportional effectiveness of the Airline signal in the context of other signals used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0191">Preferably, the present invention utilizes Bayes strategies in providing for discovery, optimization, and forecasting in open market systems. These strategies and algorithms are particularly useful for calculating IoIs. Mathematically, one Bayes strategy can be represented by choosing d(X)=θ<sub>r </sub>such that h<sub>r </sub>l(θ<sub>r</sub>) f<sub>r</sub>(X)≥h<sub>s </sub>l(θ<sub>s</sub>) f<sub>s</sub>(X) for all s≠r, where X=a vector of signals for an individual to be classified, d(X)=the decision on an X, θ<sub>k</sub>'s=the classes (offers) or categories of behaviors (responses), f<sub>k</sub>(X)=the value of the estimated probability density function for θ<sub>k </sub>at point X, l(θ<sub>r</sub>)=the loss (or gain) associated with assigning an individual to θ<sub>r</sub>, and h<sub>k</sub>=the a priori probability of a sample belonging to category θ<sub>k</sub>. In its most simple form, a Bayes strategy chooses, for each individual, the category of behavior for which the probability is greatest. In this most simple case, this would be responding to a single object or message (θ<sub>1</sub>=respond; θ<sub>2</sub>=not respond); however, the present invention can select or prioritize among multiple competing objects or messages, each with different content, for each individual within an instance. Bayes strategies that utilize probability density functions for data mining in closed systems exist in the prior art, but are narrowly focused based upon simplified assumptions. An exemplary utilization of probability density functions for data mining in closed systems is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,631,360, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In particular, collaborative open systems are not considered in the prior art utilizing probability density functions for data mining in closed systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0192">Advantageously, the present invention provides a method to employ probability density functions for Federated Data platforms in open markets. This method retains the full value of the estimated probability density functions which enables many capabilities unique to Federated Data platforms. By way of example and not limitation, one client of the system could deploy a marketing campaign using the Federated Data platform, thus selecting an individual to which the marketer wishes to send a product offer in a message. Similarly, another marketing campaign might wish to send an offer to that same individual; however, the individual may only be able or willing to accept one offer. A mobile device, in particular, would have a limited capacity for displaying offers in messages to a specific individual. Rather than recasting these two one category campaigns as a two category campaign to deal with a single individual, the Analytics Module can query those campaigns and chose the offer which has the highest probability of eliciting a response from the individual. In most closed systems the simplifying assumptions used in the pattern recognition method prevent the probability of response from being comparable among differing instances, such as marketing campaigns. Thus, the present invention will accommodate any analytic method in the decision rule. However, the preferred embodiment uses Probability Density Functions directly because differing models do not preclude comparisons among instances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0193">Because the Federated Analytics Module of the present invention will accommodate any probability density function, a wide array of applications can be supported by a scalable module. For example, Gaussian probability density functions are well recognized and attribution of the predictive contribution of each Signal is straightforward and quantitatively unbiased. Further, Gaussian estimators do not require that the data identifying individuals be retained, as only summary statistics are needed, and thus are important for applications with strict privacy requirements. Parzen density functions can be used in applications where maximum likelihood estimators are preferred. Further, arbitrary rule of logic can be used when formalized as probability density functions. Similarly, third party proprietary estimators can be accommodated. The Federated Analytics Module is thus extensible and provides for continued evolution of application programs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0194">A strategic consequence of open systems is that the Signals containing the predictive data and the response from the individuals are not contained within a closed system, such as a data silo or social network. Rather, potentially predictive elements of X for each individual are derived from the Signals provided by the multiplicity of Signal Providers. The response to the object or message for each individual is obtained by the Signal User. Thus, most analytics simply do not have the necessary Federated Data to operate, and therefore have not been developed. The present invention defines a method by which those data structures both necessary and sufficient for analytics are constructed from the data provided by the Federated Data Platform. Thus, in the present invention, every instance is preferably a federated process enabled by the Analytics Module. The Platform accommodates from any Signal Provider the effectively infinite population of data about individuals in an open system. The Analytics Module tracks both predicted and actual responses from individuals obtained by the Signal Users. In the present invention, the Analytics Module preferably accumulates responses from individuals obtained by the Signal Users in data objects for analysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0195">The mathematics for calibrating classifiers for open systems in nature is well developed in the open literature. In the Analytics Module of one embodiment of the present invention, a Signal User samples n individuals from a population of N individuals from the Signal Providers. The expected outcome for each individual (Respond and Non-Respond) is calculated from the estimated density functions, and the actual result is observed. These audit data are collated in a Decision Array for use in attribution and optimization. In a similar fashion, a sample by the Signal User of n individuals from a population of N individuals is taken and the expected response is calculated and collated in the Resultant Vector, R. For each instance or marketing campaign, the Analytics Module forms these basic data structures from certain Federated Data contained in signals and signal responses from among a wide constituency of collaborators.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0196">With regards to loss functions, the classic loss function is a simplified model for the benefits and costs associated with correct or incorrect decisions. Generally, for closed system implementations, these Bayes strategies are narrowly focused on a static objective before they are reduced to practice; however, the simplifying assumptions regarding the loss functions are rarely if ever valid for open systems. Therefore, the present invention disregards any assumptions for closed systems and has generalized a use of the loss function as an explicit business method in its Analytics Module. The method retains a one-to-one correspondence between gains and losses for all elements of the Decision Array. The resulting Benefit/Cost Matrix, B, provides an innovative method for accommodating the full array of possible benefits and costs in an open system for Federated Data. Within an instance, these benefit and cost elements can be obtained from any arbitrary set of business or contractual arrangements among constituencies, namely the Signal Providers and Signal Users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0197">Significantly, a key aspect to reduce this invention to practice in a marketing embodiment is the ability to use payment, purchasing and physical presence information as inputs for the Benefit/Cost Matrix. This information allows the Federated Analytics Module to identify and report which data contribute to the shared economic value of the modeled business application. The GUI of the present invention also provides for payouts for users of the methods and systems of the present invention. The payouts are preferably in the form of monetary compensation. The GUI provides for a signal provider to receive forecast reports and attribution reports from the federated data marketplace. Preferably, the GUI is also operable to send the forecast reports and attribution reports to signal users. The forecast reports preferably contain benefits, costs, and probabilities relating to signals individually and in groups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0198">In one embodiment, the present invention includes computer network implementable methods and objects that are both necessary and sufficient for a comprehensive and scalable Analytics Module for Federated Data Platforms in open systems and markets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0199">Additionally, in one embodiment, the present invention is utilized as an improvement in the technical field of advertising. The present invention relates to methods and systems for quantitative collaborative cognition in advertising, which is an improvement in the field of advertising. More preferably, the present invention provides for indexing, discovery, attribution, optimization, and forecasting in advertising. In one embodiment, the present invention utilizes signals for quantitative collaborative cognition in advertising. Quantitative collaborative cognition has not been used in the technical field of advertising, and thus is an improvement in the technical field of advertising. Advantageously, the present invention allows for network learning and identification and discovery of heterogeneous data held remotely by a multitude of participants in a way that protects the integrity of the data. In addition, because the model is held by a neutral third party, the present invention allows for the economic value of the model to also be protected. The integrity of the data has historically not been protected in the technical field of advertising. The present invention is useful for establishing behavior patterns of people and groups of people spanning data sets and organizational boundaries. These behavior patterns are preferably established with respect to specific activities. By way of example, one specific activity is going out to eat. The present invention uses behavior patterns to predict a future behavior and/or to influence a behavior. Advantageously, predicting a behavior and/or successfully influencing a behavior has monetary value for a variety of participants and parties to the present invention, and the economic value can be measured and settled. For example, the ability to predict and/or influence the behavior of going out to eat can hold monetary value for a number of participants including the restaurant, taxi or shuttle services, parking services, gas stations, grocery stores (providing an alternative to going out to eat), and other merchants and service providers offering goods and services incidental to the activity of going out to eat or providing an alternative to the activity of going out to eat. Through advertising, these parties can use these predictions and influence the behavior of the consumer by using the data. Additionally, the present invention provides compensation for a variety of data providers in the technical field of advertising, thus making it an improvement in the technical field of advertising as the conventional field of advertising does not provide for this. Specifically, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of instantiating a multiplicity of marketing campaigns in a federated data marketplace to provide for collaborative attribution, optimization, and forecasting through a graphical user interface (GUI) including providing at least two signals through a federated data marketplace using the GUI on a computing device connected over a communication network with a server including the federated data marketplace, estimating at least one probability density function using the at least two signals, wherein the at least one probability density function is based on a probability of at least one action of at least two users corresponding to at least two signals in response to at least one advertisement or at least one offer, wherein the at least one action includes a purchase, determining at least one probable benefit and at least one probable cost for purchasing each of the at least two signals, wherein the probable benefit includes a monetary benefit amount associated with the purchase, thereby creating a benefit/cost matrix, creating a decision array for at least one of the at least two signals, wherein the decision array includes the probability of the at least one action of at least one user corresponding to the at least one of the at least two signals in response to the at least one advertisement or the at least one offer; and creating a resultant array for the at least two signals, wherein the resultant array includes the probability of the at least one action of the at least two users corresponding to the at least two signals in response to the at least one advertisement or the at least one offer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0200">The present invention also adds specific limitations other than what is well-understood, routine, and conventional in the field of advertising. Historically, users have not been compensated for the use of their personal data, including spending data, behaviors, location data, etc. However, the present invention provides for compensation for users for use of their personal data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0201">In a further embodiment, the present invention includes using a transmission server with a microprocessor and a memory to store preferences of one or more subscribers of a signal marketplace and/or a signal database, transmitting an alert from the transmission server over a data channel to a wireless device, and providing a GUI application that causes the alert to display on the subscriber computer and enables a connection from the subscriber computer to the data source over the Internet when the subscriber computer comes online. This embodiment of the present invention addresses the Internet-centric challenge of alerting a subscriber with time sensitive information when the subscriber's computer is offline. This is addressed by transmitting the alert over a wireless communication channel to activate the GUI, which causes the alert to display and enables the connection of the remote subscriber computer to the data source over the Internet when the remote subscriber computer comes online. This Internet-centric problem is solved with a solution that is necessarily rooted in computer technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0202">Trackable behaviors are defined within the marketplace and may include by way of example and not limitation: purchase with one time use code, purchase with credit card, location, registration, viewing of a web site, opening of email, phone call or viewing of a television show or commercial. Marketplace rules require participants to record defined behaviors and object identifiers, which are correlated to a signal, object, event or behavior. By way of example and not limitation, an objective behavior for an automotive advertiser is consumer presence in an automotive show room. The automotive show room has a Wi-Fi hot spot which identifies devices which are present. The Wi-Fi hotspot is a signal provider. The presence signal for any given device identified by the Wi-Fi provider is of value to the campaign manager. Hence the Wi-Fi provider sells data to the automotive campaign manager.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0203">Location data can also be obtained in a variety of other ways using non-generic computing devices besides utilizing WiFi location techniques. Examples of such non-generic computing devices include GPS devices (including GPS receivers), cellular location devices which operate through pinging or triangulation, and any other non-generic computing devices capable of determining location. Preferably, these non-generic computing devices determine location in real-time or near real-time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0204">Notably, one embodiment of the present invention solves the problem of prior art advertising systems and methods, namely that the value of data decays with respect to time and the prior art advertising systems present the risk that advertisers miss the opportunities to capitalize on the activities of consumers in real-time or near real-time. The pre-computer analog of the GUIs and computerized advertising of the present invention is legacy advertising systems such as word of mouth and paper, where parties would use verbal communication and physical pieces of paper to transfer information about advertising and purchasing opportunities. There is no question that computerized advertising is much different than the legacy advertising systems. The speed, quantity, and variety of advertisements and offers that can be made by advertising entities are no doubt markedly different than the advertisements that could be made in legacy advertising systems. Thus, the apparent differences between computerized advertising systems and legacy advertising systems indicate that the present invention is not merely applying ideas on computer systems, but rather is inextricably tied to computer technology. The systems and methods of the present invention cannot be performed on pen and paper, and the present invention is thus inextricably tied to computer technology. None of these limitations can be performed by a human alone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0205">Additionally, in one embodiment, the present invention requires specific structures, including non-generic computing devices to perform the methods of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0206">In one embodiment of the present invention, the invention adds a new subset of numbers, characters, or tags to the data, thus fundamentally altering the original raw datum to form signals. This is not reproducible by hand alone, but is rather inextricably tied to computer technology. The addition of the numbers, characters, or tags to the raw datum transforms the data into signals which are usable by a variety of parties, importantly protecting the raw datum and therefore increasing the value of the signals, as knowing the entirety of the raw datum dramatically decreases the value of the raw datum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0207">Furthermore, one embodiment of the present invention utilizes a tangible hardware interface as the GUI. Preferably, this GUI is a touchscreen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0208">In one embodiment of the present invention, the signals improve the functioning of the computing devices themselves, as the signals represent raw datum. The signals are smaller in size than the raw datum in one embodiment, leading to faster processing times of data which is protected and therefore advantageous over the raw datum. Thus, the present invention represents an improvement to computers in one embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0209">In one embodiment of the present invention, the combination of method steps also produces a new and useful result in that important aspects of data of users (consumers in the advertising context) is protected and therefore retains more value over time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0210"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> provides an illustration of the method by which gain and loss for the federated constituencies are accommodated by the system for one signal provider and one signal user. The individual receiving the offer from the signal user will either respond or not respond. Therefore, the categories are: θ<sub>1</sub>=Responder and θ<sub>2</sub>=Non Responder. The vertical axis is f(x) <b>101</b>. The horizontal axis <b>103</b> is the numeric value of the signal associated with the individual to which the offer is to be delivered. In this illustration the f<sub>k</sub>(X) are non-Gaussian with distortions to the familiar bell-shaped graph. The method will work for any valid mathematical model for f<sub>k</sub>(X) or derivation thereof. Shown are the estimated probability density function for the Non-Responder population <b>105</b> and the estimated probability density function for the Responder population <b>107</b>. This illustrates a hypothetical difference in the value of the signal for the individuals comprising each category. In practice these probability density functions are estimated by delivering the offer to a subpopulation (test marketing), and an expectation of the performance of the method can be modeled. The decision boundary at x=b <b>111</b> is the decision boundary where the least error in classification occurs. The decision boundary at x=a <b>109</b> is the decision boundary where the estimated probable maximum gain occurs. Most useful are the classification rates for each pairwise category obtained from the empirical data. That is there is an estimate of C<sub>11</sub>, the percentage of Responders that the model will correctly classify as Responders, represented by the area under the estimated probability density function curve for the Responder population from x=a to x=infinity <b>119</b>; an estimate of C<sub>21</sub>, the percentage of Responders that will incorrectly classify as Non-Responders, represented by the area under the estimated probability density function curve for the Responder population from x=0 to x=a <b>113</b>; an estimate of C<sub>22</sub>, the percentage of Non-Responders that will correctly classify as Non-Responders, represented by the area under the estimated probability density function curve for the Non-Responder population from x=0 to x=a <b>117</b>; and an estimate of C<sub>12</sub>, the percentage of Non-Responders that will incorrectly classify as Responders, represented by the area under the estimated probability density function curve for the Non-Responder population from x=a to x=infinity <b>115</b>. The system is not limited to 2 response categories but is generalized for M categories. Preferably, a benefit and a gain is associated with each of these classification rates. Notably, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> provides for accommodating losses and gains. In the illustration, it is assumed that the gain by correctly delivering an offer to an individual who will respond is considerably greater that the loss obtained by in correctly delivering an offer to an individual who will not respond. Thus, the decision boundary (x=a) is provided so that there is theoretically the highest probability of achieving the most gain by sending offers to individuals who fall to the right of the decision boundary. At the decision boundary, the losses and gains are offset. Mathematically, this can be represented as l(θ)<sub>22</sub>C<sub>22</sub>+l(θ)<sub>21</sub>C<sub>21</sub>=l(θ)<sub>11</sub>C<sub>11</sub>+l(θ)<sub>12</sub>C<sub>12</sub>. At x=b, the boundary for achieving the highest probability of minimum error, the gains and losses are not accommodated. Notably, the goal in drawing the decision boundary is not to minimize classification error, but rather to minimize potential losses or maximize potential gains. However, a wide variety of scenarios are possible based upon the general method and object model. For example, in the case where there are a multiplicity of signal providers to an application, at the point of maximum gain there is a mathematical solution based upon to the expected percentage contribution to that gain attributed to each signal and thus for each signal provider based upon the density functions estimated from results on the sample of size n.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0211">The Analytics Module is not limited to 2 response categories but is generalized for M categories. The Analytics Module associates a benefit and a cost with each of these classification rates. In the illustration, it is assumed that the gain by correctly delivering an object or message to an individual who will respond is considerably greater that the loss obtained by in correctly delivering an object or message to an individual who will not respond; however, a wide variety of scenarios are possible based upon the general method and object model.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">A Priori Probabilities and Prior Knowledge</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0212">This invention expands upon the simple concept of a priori probabilities to a full model of collaborative cognition for open systems. The early general case for self-organizing networks in open systems in the wild was first put forth by Hutchins (1995) in which Prior knowledge is accommodated in a variety of very powerful, unique and innovative ways. The limitations of a single scalar in traditional Bayesian strategies to characterize prior knowledge are obvious. In stand-alone applications in closed systems, they are typically sufficient; however, the Federated Data Platform is a system in which the Application Module fields numerous instances. The invention thus accommodates prior knowledge by enabling collaboration among Signal Users and Signal Providers. That is, the Federated Data Platform and Federated Analytics Module are the first and only quantitative implementation of a data driven social network for online merchants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0213">The Analytics Module accommodates individual expertise in a manner that is critical to instantiating and to sustaining innovation in Federated Data Ecosystem. Signal Providers have a vast reserve of expertise for which the synergies for federated signals are intuitively obvious. These Mavens can scale out beneficial instances by using the Analytics Module. Ultimately, as many instances are fielded, the Analytics Module creates a framework for collaborative discovery: a self-organizing network in which all Signal Providers and Signal Users interact with one another and adapt to one another's behaviors. A simple outcome is increased demand for signals that provide the greatest benefits, or decreased cost structure and repackaging of signal data that are less predictive. In the larger environment, a wide variety of continuously evolving user interfaces and application interfaces for a variety of Signal Providers and Users will allow these users to field increasingly effective instances by improving their respective applications. This triggers adaptive responses, both long and short term, in other campaigns as they evolve in the larger Federated Data ecosystem.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0218">Calibrating Mavens. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows a set up process for Example 1. Preferably the process steps are performed through at least one API through the platform <b>400</b>. The process is started in step <b>401</b>. A signal is attached in step <b>403</b>. Next, p is set to be equal to 1 and M, the number of categories, is set equal to 2 in step <b>405</b>. A message is created in step <b>407</b>. Process step <b>409</b> includes setting θ<sub>1</sub>=Respond and θ<sub>2</sub>=Not Respond. Index pricing is set in step <b>411</b> and one or more signals is priced in step <b>413</b>. From the signal pricing <b>413</b>, a Benefit/Cost Matrix B is generated in step <b>415</b>. A delivery cost is then set in step <b>417</b>. The signal provider reports a population size in step <b>419</b>. A sample size is selected in step <b>423</b>, and a subset of n individuals from a population of N is selected in step <b>421</b>. The probability density functions of responders is set equal to 1 and the population density function of nonresponders is set equal to 0 in step <b>425</b>. The signal provider confirms set up in step <b>427</b>. The setup is validated in step <b>429</b> at the platform. The signal user confirms the set up in step <b>431</b>. In this case, a Signal Buyer and a Signal Seller have a priori agreed to a simple business exchange in which the individual managers have an intuitively obvious opportunity. These individuals are called Mavens in this example. In this simplified example only one signal is being provided and the Signal Buyer is only delivering one message. Thus p, the number of signals selected to comprise X, is set to 1, and M the number of categories is set equal to 2. θ<sub>1 </sub>is set to be the “Responders” to the message and θ<sub>2 </sub>is set to be the “Non-Responders” to the message. The Mavens, using their a priori competencies set mutually agreed costs and prices for the signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0219">The Signal Seller then provides the total number of individuals available for message delivery and the Signal Buyer selects the number of individuals to which they wish to deliver the message. In the Analytics Module this deterministic decision to send the message to an entire list of n individuals by the Mavens is accommodated by setting the estimated distribution function value to 1 for any individual's signal value of X for each Responder, and to 0 for the Non-Responder. This will cause the Analytics Module to initially classify each individual on the list as a Responder and indicate that each individual should be contacted. Notably, the Analytics Module informs Signal Users which individuals should be contacted, but does not contact the individuals directly. In one embodiment, a Sender Module contacts the individuals directly. The net effect is that the n of N individuals comprise a test market by which the ƒ<sub>k</sub>(X) can be empirically obtained by federating the response obtained by the Signal Buyer from the n individuals with any numeric value in the Signal for those n individuals as supplied by the Signal Seller. The Responders and non-Responders are segregated into separate samples and the response rate calculated. If sufficient, the system will proceed to fit a stochastic model to improve profit performance.</div>

Step <b>441</b> includes sending signals between the signal provider and the platform via the API. The platform includes a subset of signals and the corresponding individuals n <b>443</b>. Step <b>445</b> includes delivering a message between the platform <b>400</b> and the signal user <b>203</b>.

A break-even targeting accuracy, based upon benefits, and other performance calculations can also displayed.

In Sensitivity mode the full set of frequency histograms for the selected set of signals is displayed. In Test Market mode, the p-tuple of signal values for each individual consumer provided by the Signal Seller is plotted.

It can be further appreciated that very simple campaigns, such as that discussed in Example 1, can be easily scripted and fielded by using the Graphical User Interface touchpoints for this invention. A multiplicity of applications programs each hosting a multiplicity of campaigns can be hosted in a scalable and repeatable fashion by the Analytics Module. As such, the Graphical User Interface for this invention makes it intuitively obvious for Signal Sellers and Signal Buyers to integrate Federated Data and Federated Analytics into full suites of new and existing application programs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0239">Additional steps in the systems and methods of the present invention include retaining control of signal data within a defined use of the signal by a registered buyer, based upon at least one rule and/or the signal owner limiting signal availability to signal buyers within the federated data marketplace based upon at least one rule, wherein the at least one rule includes factors regarding: buyer identity, campaign type, signal requested, price, redemption signal type, purchase quantity, past performance of signal, past performance of campaign type, past performance of buyer, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the platform or system is operable to determine which offer has the highest probability of eliciting a response from the individual. Preferably, the system or platform determines the offer having the highest probability of eliciting a response by considering the past responses of the individual to identical or similar offers. In another embodiment, the system or platform determines the offer having the highest probability of eliciting a response by considering the past responses of individuals with at least one of similar interests, geographies, income, status, age, gender, occupation, family size, religious background, political affiliation, physical features, possessions, habits, services subscribed to, items purchased, housing situations, and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0240">Mobile Classifier Application</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0241">The mobile classifier application (“app” or “application”) is preferably run on a device connected over a network to one or more computers. The network is preferably the Internet or another network which enables real-time or near real-time communication of data, such as a 3G, 4G, or 5G network. Preferably, the computers are server computers or vendor computers. In an exemplary embodiment, an object discovery and mapping system of the present invention includes at least one server computer and at least one user device with an app running GUI, with the at least one device being in network communication with the at least one server computer. In one embodiment, the at least one server computer includes a signal marketplace platform server computer and one or more object recommendation or narrowcast server computers. The app is operable to create a quantitative cognitive object map to assist in product discovery for a consumer by providing a context for objects and orientation for searching for objects, mapping the objects in the object map, and quantifying preferences for objects visually and/or numerically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0242">The present invention overcomes problems of prior art search methods and systems, particularly centralized or closed prior art search methods and systems. Closed prior art systems, such as vendor websites, typically only provide context or orientation for a user in the form of a current location on the website. This orientation fails to provide a context for the user, and does not effectively account for user interests and past user behavior, such as past purchases. The prior art is thus disadvantageous for both the user, as there is no context provided on a vendor website based on the user's past behavior and interests, and the vendor, as the vendor is unable to obtain and leverage user information to direct the user to one or more products which have the highest likelihood of interest and purchase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0243">In an analogy, the prior art vendor website merely provides a “You Are Here” sign to the user on a site map of an internet store. This is true for closed systems or centralized systems generally, as closed systems or centralized systems are unable to provide context from other sources for a user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0244">In contrast, in prior art open systems, the user has traditionally relied upon himself or herself for orientation, with a secondary reliance upon context given by the system which includes objects. To continue the analogy above, a user in prior art open systems provides a sign “I Am Here” in the open system that reflects the user's orientation from their perspective. The present invention recognizes this distinction in orientation and defines an open system object model for a quantitative cognitive object map for quantification of preferences, past behavior, and for facilitating in object discovery. The present system is also decentralized, which also advantageously provides for self-orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0245">The principles of orientation in open and closed systems have been discussed in the prior art. Cognition in the Wild (Hutchins, 1995), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discusses collaborative navigation and discovery by self-organizing networks of individuals. Wayfinding in Architecture (Passini, 1992), which is also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discusses orientation in physical locations, such as cities, towns and pavilions. However, these approaches fail to address orientation in open systems, particularly in view of modern networks such as the Internet, which account for individual interaction with a computer implemented system to define an object map that quantifies interest in objects and relationships among objects. The present invention addresses these problems of the prior art by providing a computer-based quantitative object model that accommodates both virtual individual interaction with the system and a platform for the objective evaluation of decisions by customers and vendors based on quantifiable data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0246">While some vendors maintain product purchase history and peripheral information about customers, this history and information is not stored or accessible in a manner which permits effective marketing or object discovery for consumers. Profiles of individual consumers typically have been stored on a database on the server hosting the commerce website, with sellers choosing products to advertise or recommend to consumers based on the profiles stored in the database. Other systems which have traditionally been considered closed include social media sites and search engines, which use internally stored profiles to generate content and advertising for users. These systems often utilize metrics which are weighted in favor of predetermined content or advertisements, which prevents effective product discovery for consumers. Additionally, these systems often overcharge advertisers for advertising.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0247">Furthermore, trust and loyalty between a customer and a vendor has not previously been quantified. The prior art also has not accounted for Bayesian decision making in object or product discovery and purchase. Notably, Bayesian decision making is prominently used methodology for discovering objects and purchasing products and services, as well as advertising products and services. Additionally, the prior art has failed to provide a cognitive object map for mapping objects, including products, goods, and services, as well as the relationships between these objects and attributes of these objects including indications of interest based on time, frequency, and other factors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0248">The present invention advantageously creates a networked architecture to connect users, vendors, and products for creation and modification of an object map for a user. This networked architecture is advantageously app-centric or user-centric, whereas the prior architectures are vendor-centric. The information about the user is retained in the device where these data originate. Only derivative data based on the information about the user leaves the device in the form of one or more signals. Vendor and product messages, such as advertisements and offers, originate at are displayed on the device. The present invention therefore provides for existing closed systems, such as vendor websites, to benefit from data obtained through open systems, and as such, more effectively meet consumer demand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0249">The architecture preferably is implemented via a system including an application operable to run on a device which utilizes a GUI to quantitatively define objects of interest and define relationships among those objects. This user interface driven system provides local storage and mapping of raw data, which has the benefits of individual data ownership and improved privacy and security for the raw data. The structures of current methods of privacy protection limit access to information useful in creating and maintaining accurate predictive profiles for personalization for recommendation of objects and goods or services. By providing a virtual model of objects that is stored locally on a device, the present invention advantageously enables interaction among a vast multiplicity of constituents, consumers, and vendors across open systems while simultaneously providing protection for raw data and identity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0250">Basic elements for product and service discovery are familiar to most people as stores, shopping malls, and bazaars. In these locations, there is typically a rectangular layout of streets or aisles with stores and shops arranged along pathways. Within the shops and stores are found products in display cases. The present invention offers a graphical, computer-based improvement on these layouts by providing an object map where visual elements are superimposed so that the object map adapts based upon usage, habits, purchases, and patterns of behavior recorded through the app as user interaction with the object map, as well as other user actions performed on the device running the app and other devices and other user raw data. The object recommendation channel, also referred to as the object recommendation area, the narrowcast, or the narrowcast channel throughout the specification, provides functionality for a consumer to “enter a store”, “view a product”, and/or read a “you are here” directory within the object map of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0251">However, the present invention is distinguishable from mere orientation in the physical world because the present invention provides orientation via a GUI with an object map which is constructed based on user preferences and input. Furthermore, the present invention is operable to provide orientation through web pages and online commerce, as opposed to commerce in brick and mortar stores. Thus, the visual display is created and controlled by a user of the app, with vendors purchasing space in the app based on received user data in the form of signals. Creation and development app, including the object map and the narrowcast channel of the GUI, as well as overcoming problems of the prior art, included overcoming problems specific to computer technology that do not exist in the closest analogy to the present invention, which is a display in a brick and mortar store. Specifically, creating an object map which quantifies interest numerically and visually in each object, and also quantifies relationships among objects both numerically and visually, includes overcoming challenges specific to computer technology. Additionally, providing for automatic updates to the object map upon changes in time, recency of usage, frequency of usage, etc. of the object, goes beyond mere product or object mapping in the physical world. By way of further illustration, integration of a channel in which vendor computers communicate offers and advertisements to a user of the app in real-time or near real-time based upon data sent to the vendor computers in the form of derivative data, which is preferably transferred via key pairs, encryption, hashed values, or other forms of computer-specific data protection, involves overcoming challenges specific to computer and Internet technology. The use and advantages of key pairs for data transfer, particularly through the use of signals, is discussed in U.S. application Ser. No. 15/477,473, filed Apr. 3, 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0252">The system of the present invention also improves the prior art by providing for quantification of concepts traditionally not considered as quantifiable, such as trust and loyalty between a customer and a vendor in the object map. Trust and loyalty are quantified in the object map by moving objects from the narrowcast or object recommendation area to the object map. Placing an object originated from a particular vendor or source indicates trust and/or loyalty in that vendor or object source. The object map is a cognitive map with GUI elements allowing for Bayesian methods to be interoperable not only between a closed system server and a user device, such as a phone, tablet, or laptop, but also with those Bayesian decisions that have already been made by the vendor and the customer. These decisions and preferences currently are not accessible, as they are most typically kept in the minds of users and are not quantified. The present invention improves the art of object discovery, and more particularly advertising and marketing, by providing permissioned information from the object map to one or more parties, including vendors. Computer-based methods for Bayesian targeting are preferably utilized by vendors in providing offers, advertisements, and other forms of marketing to users of these devices. Notably, permissioned information from the object map is provided by signals in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Signal constructs are discussed at length herein, and also in U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,223, filed Mar. 14, 2014, U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,232, filed Mar. 14, 2014, U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,253, filed Mar. 14, 2014, U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,269, filed Mar. 14, 2014, now U.S. Pat. No. 9,799,042, U.S. application Ser. No. 14/633,770, filed Feb. 27, 2015, and U.S. application Ser. No. 14/677,315, filed Apr. 2, 2015, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The object map is evolved through the app of the device by a user and/or a vendor to quantify areas of interest, objects of interest, relationships among objects of interest, and relationships between vendors and consumers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0253">The present invention addresses these problems of the prior art by providing a system including an app for object mapping and discovery, with the app including a GUI for defining objects of interest and the relationships among those objects. In an exemplary use case, the present invention is utilized in product discovery. However, many other use cases of the app and the GUI of the present invention are contemplated, including for discovery of food and cuisine, media such as books, music, movies, TV shows, and even mapping people, such as personnel in a company or a network of professional and/or personal connections. The present invention is also applied in the fields of online social media and social networks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0254">The app including the object map and algorithms used to define numeric elements of the IoI, relationships between objects, logs, and other app data is preferably stored locally on the device. Local storage of the app data on the device provides the ability to protect the raw data relating to the objects and their relationships, as well as the identity of the device and user of the device. This configuration of the data also provides an open system which is not confined to a centralized database as in the prior art. Therefore, the present invention addresses the prior art issues of bias in object discovery because data input and relationships are customized and controlled locally as opposed to by a central operator. The device in the present invention is by way of example and not limitation, a smart phone, a computer, a console, a wearable device, or any other computing and communication device with a display and input.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0255">Alternatively, the app data is stored on one or more server computers connected to the device over a network, with the device operable to run the app. The app data is stored on the cloud or a cloud-based system in another embodiment of the present invention. This architecture advantageously provides many advantages of a decentralized architecture to a centralized platform including or connected to the one or more server computers or cloud-based system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0256">The GUI of the app includes a variety of features and functionality to provide for object mapping and object discovery. An object map allows for defining the intensity of interest for objects as well as the relationships among objects. Intensity of interest is preferably defined numerically and/or by relative size and/or position within the map. The relationships among objects are defined by the proximity of one object to other objects, the negative space between objects, and other visual and/or numerical relationships as discussed below. Specifically, negative space defines relationships among objects by providing a distance between objects in the object map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0257">Objects preferably include at least a key word or key phrase, an Intensity of Interest, and a log file. Although objects are represented as rectangles and squares in the object map, other shapes for objects such as circles, triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc. are operable to be used to represent objects and are within the scope of this invention. The log file preferably records interactions in the app with the object. The log file records “clicks”, purchases, the time the object was added to the object map, the path of the object in the object map, the times correlating to positions of the object within the object map, etc. Notably, the log files remain localized on the device running the app. The IoI of the object is based at least in part on the log file in one embodiment of the present invention. Objects include one or more Uniform Resource Locators or Universal Resource Locators (URLs) in one embodiment of the present invention. The URLs provide, by way of example and not limitation, links to more information about those objects or links to purchase those objects. In another embodiment, objects also include advertisements or direct solicitations for products or services. In a further embodiment, the object is an electronic offer or an electronic coupon. Upon being added to the object map or being displayed in the narrowcast channel, the electronic offer or electronic coupon is preferably linked to another consumer account, such as an online account with a vendor or a financial account including but not limited to an online credit card account or online banking account. The system of the present invention includes functionality for activating or enabling the offer or electronic coupon, such as by automatically adding the offer or coupon to a financial account or online account with a vendor. Alternatively, the offer or coupon is added to a mobile wallet or digital wallet of a consumer. Notably, an object is operable to be any type of computer-based object, program, or feature, including an application, a shortcut to an application, an icon, an image file, a document file, a spreadsheet file, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0258">In another embodiment, an object operates as a bin. A bin is preferably a user-defined bin or a user-selected bin. Each bin is operable to include one or more objects. Each bin is also operable to hold one or more other objects, also referred to as secondary objects or sub-objects, with each object in the bin further operable to act as a bin. Thus, each bin is operable to include a multiplicity of bins or sub-bins in a hierarchy such that there are a multiplicity of levels or layers of bins. This hierarchy of bins is organized as primary bins, secondary bins, tertiary bins, etc. in one embodiment of the present invention. By way of example and not limitation, a primary bin includes a secondary bin and two objects, with each of the two objects linking to a different URL. The secondary bin further includes a tertiary bin and an object, with the object in the secondary bin linking to another URL. The tertiary bin includes yet another object linking to yet another URL. Thus, the present invention provides for a customizable hierarchy within bins, with customizable values for each object and bin to reflect the IoI. Notably, the IoI is defined in one embodiment of the present invention as a quantified interest input into the app by a user. Alternatively, the IoI is a quantified interest automatically generated for each object and bin based on an existing object map, a user profile, or other device or user information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0259">By way of example, a New Car bin is operable to include a 2017 Chevy Silverado bin and a 2017 Dodge Journey Bin. The 2017 Chevy Silverado bin is operable to include one or more objects or bins relating to vendors, body styles, paint colors, or other information relevant to a 2017 Chevy Silverado and/or purchase of a 2017 Chevy Silverado. By way of example, a vendor object is a Chevy of Abbotsford object, body style bins include a regular cab object, a double cab object, and a crew cab object, and paint color objects include a white object, a black object, and a red object. Each of these objects is operable to be bins which contain objects. Alternatively, each of these objects is linked to a URL. In a further alternative, the 2017 Chevy Silverado object is operable to include vendor information such that the object is 2017 Chevy Silverado (Chevy of Abbotsford). The object map therefore provides highly customizable electronic storage and electronic quantification and mapping of relationships for a multiplicity of objects or bins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0260">To add objects to the object map, a product discovery process is initiated through the app. Preferably, object discovery and object addition to the object map is accomplished by entering in a dialog box a key word, a multiplicity of key words, or a key phrase that indicate interest in certain information, which in an exemplary embodiment includes products, product categories, and/or services. A suggested object drop-down menu is included in the dialog box in one embodiment of the present invention. The suggested object drop-down menu is preferably auto-populated based on popular objects, device data, user data, a user profile, and other factors. Upon receiving entry of text, the suggested object drop-down menu changes to reflect objects identical or similar to the entered text. Although the suggestion feature of the present invention is referred to as a suggested object drop-down menu, other forms of graphical suggestion and display are utilized in other embodiments of the present invention. By way of example, a suggested object map is displayed which displays suggested objects in a map with sizes indicating probable intensities of interest for the suggested objects, with the proximity among the suggested objects indicating relationships among the suggested objects. The suggested object map preferably is built based at least in part on app data, device data, user data, existing object map data, and/or other inputs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0261">In another embodiment of the present invention, objects are automatically added to the object map based on purchase data from a payment account, such as a credit card account, a debit card account, an online banking account, a mobile or digital wallet account, etc. An object map is operable to be automatically generated and updated from this data. The objects in an object map are products, services, or goods in one embodiment of the present invention. Alternatively, the objects are the names of vendors, and these objects act as bins. The bins are automatically populated based on data from electronic receipts, or through user input in the application. In another embodiment, a purchase history or shopping cart history from one or more online vendor sites is utilized to add objects to an object map or create an object map. In yet another embodiment, objects are added to an object map and/or an object map is created based on preferences and other data from online accounts such as social network accounts. This data includes “likes,” “shares,” “check-ins,” “posts,” “tweets,” and “hash tags” from a personal user account, as well as the same or similar data from associated accounts, such as those from friends, followers, or accounts following the personal user account.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0262">Upon selection of an object for addition to the object map of the present invention, the object is added to the object map, preferably via double clicking the object, selecting the object and activating a button, drag and drop, and/or any other method of manipulation of objects in GUIs. In one embodiment, an IoI and other attributes of an object are automatically determined by the app of the present invention based on one or more log files, a user profile, and other structured or unstructured raw data locally stored on the app or device. Preferably, the app determines the IoI based on a recency of addition of the object, IoIs and other attributes for other objects in the object map, frequencies of use of other objects in the object map, signals associated with the app, device, or user, and/or raw data, including structured data and unstructured data, associated with the app, device, or user. In another embodiment of the present invention, the IoI values are obtained based on memory trace encoding. A variety of formulas are utilized to calculate IoI values according to the previous factors. In yet another embodiment, the app is linked to one or more social media accounts, financial accounts, and/or location data of a user, and IoI values are derived based on these accounts and/or location data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0263">Each IoI contains a vector of data including an interest score, a recency calculation, and a frequency calculation in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The vector of data is extensible for parameters of algorithms. The IoI object preferably includes, at a minimum, a single numeric value as the primary datum. In one embodiment of the present invention, the IoI value is a value selected from the range from 0 to 100. In another embodiment, the IoI value is in a range from 0 to 10. In yet another embodiment, the IoI value is in a range from 0 to 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0264">IoI is preferably calculated from the recency and the frequency of usage of each bin and product. In one embodiment of the present invention, IoI values decrease exponentially with time, and require usage to avoid diminution. Alternatively, IoI values decrease linearly with time. However, any formula for decay of the IoI values is considered in the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0265">The IoI of the present invention is extensible to include any parameters, estimated or actual. The IoI is also an object in one embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, the app utilizes a rollup algorithm to calculate numeric elements in the IoI object from one or more log file entries. Numerical elements are preferably incremented for each action made in the app and decremented with time by using functions of recency and frequency of usage. The app of the present invention also accommodates a more sophisticated algorithm including multiple memory traces to calculate an IoI. By way of example, real-time, online, lifetime learning algorithms by Mobus as described above are utilized to calculate an IoI. Any other algorithm or</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0266">The IoI and other attributes of objects are preferably adjustable through the GUI of the app. In one embodiment, the IoI and other attributes of objects are adjustable via a slider. The IoI and other attributes of objects are manually entered through the GUI of the app in another embodiment of the present invention. Preferably, other attributes of objects including spatial and temporal relationships with other objects are quantified automatically through the app.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0267">The relationships among objects is displayed as an object map in one embodiment of the present invention. The app receives numerical indicators of relationships between and among objects to construct the object map in one embodiment of the present invention. In another embodiment, the app receives input through movement of the objects, both for relative position of the objects in relation to other objects and absolute position of the objects in the object map, and quantifies these positions and relationships between objects numerically. Preferably, a direction and distance in Cartesian or polar coordinates provide the basic structure of the object map. The IoI also affects the absolute position of the objects in the object map in one embodiment of the present invention. IoIs are also operable to affect and determine relative positions of objects in the object map. Objects with a greater relative IoI are positioned closer to the center of the object map, while objects with a lower relative IoI are positioned further from the center of the object map. Additionally, a recency of use, a recency of addition, and/or a frequency of use affect the position of the objects in the object map, with more recently used or added or more frequently used or added objects being positioned closer to the center of the object map. In this embodiment, time is related to distance from a center of the map such that a longer time in terms of use or addition to the map equates to an object being positioned further from the center. Also, intervening bins increase perceived distance between and among bins. Intervening bins are defined as bins which are positioned between other bins in the present invention. Intervening bins have the psychological effect of making a distance appear longer between two bins than the distance otherwise would if the intervening bins were not present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0268">In one embodiment of the present invention, the object map changes slowly, with continuous accretion and diminution of objects and bins, and reorganization of the objects and objects within bins. In another embodiment of the present invention, a consumer's cognitive map changes abruptly with immediate prominence of those bins with IoIs set to maximum through the app, either automatically upon addition of an object to the object map or manually through input in the app. Thus, the prominence of an object decreases in the object map as its IoI value decreases. By way of example but not limitation, the object becomes smaller and/or moves towards the periphery of the app GUI compared to its original size and position in the cognitive object map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0269">In one embodiment of the present invention, objects which contain at least one other object, referred to herein as bins, also include internal maps, referred to herein as bin maps. Similar or identical rules to those used to determine the absolute and relative positions of objects in the object map determine the position of objects within bins. Thus, a hierarchy of object and bin maps is utilized in one embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0270">An object recommendation feature of the app provides recommended objects for addition to the object map and/or for further action, including by way of example and not limitation, purchase. Object recommendations are presented as a narrowcast of recommended objects in one embodiment of the present invention. The consumer can add these objects or bins to their object maps by dragging an object or bin from the object recommendation area to their object map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0271">Various vendor targeting methods as well as peer to peer sharing are utilized for populating the object recommendation area. Recommended objects are also recommended based on an app user's belonging to a group of app users, with the recommended objects populating the recommendation area of the GUI for each of the group members in one embodiment of the present invention. Unsolicited anonymous targeting using the maven methods and algorithms described above are also used to populate the object recommendation area in one embodiment of the present invention. Recommended objects are also selected based on the objects in an object map, the relationships among objects in an object map, key words or key phrases, and/or signals relating to activity of the user of the app. The key words or key phrases are stored on the app or are generated by the app in real-time or near real-time based on user input or suggestions from the app. Signals include signals which have been previously sold to information providers or vendors based on information about objects in the object map, or other raw data including structured data and/or unstructured data. Other signals include real-time or near real-time signals which are generated in real-time or near real-time based on information about objects in the object map or other raw data including structured data and/or unstructured data. By way of example, structured app data includes objects, records of past purchases within the app, etc. In one embodiment, unstructured data includes the proximity and relationships between and among objects in the map. Unstructured data further includes device data such as location, time, temperature, and any other type of data not stored in a structured format in the device. The unstructured data is real-time data or historical data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0272">The broadcast channel or section of the GUI includes objects or bins with system information relating to accounts and controls. Alternatively, these objects or bins are displayed in the object map, with the IoI being fixed at the maximum value so that these broadcast objects bins are always displayed in the GUI. In another embodiment, the IoIs of the broadcast objects or bins are customizable by the user or automatically adjusted based on use in the app such that different bins or objects in the broadcast section have different relative sizes and orientation within the broadcast section of the GUI. By way of example and not limitation the broadcast area contains a payment portal or payment account portal object, a privacy settings object, a permissions object, and/or a security alerts object. Alternatively, the broadcast area contains one or more bins containing each of these objects. Preferably, each of these objects links to a dialog box for adjusting the relevant setting or displaying the relevant information. These objects are also operable to link to other apps on the device or to outside apps or webpages. In one embodiment, the payment portal object links to a digital wallet. The digital wallet includes payment methods such as credit card, debit card, bank account, cryptocurrencies (e.g., bitcoins, Ethereum, etc.), and reward points. A user can set up preferred and/or available payment methods in a digital wallet. Notably, the payment account portal is operable to link a payment account to the app and populate the object map and/or populate the object recommendation channel based on recent purchases with the payment account. Privacy settings include, by way of example and not limitation, passwords, security questions, multi-step verification, multi-factor verification, and any other privacy/security features known in the art. Permissions include the ability for a user to opt in to receiving unsolicited targeted advertisement and selection and/or exclusion of vendors the user will receive unsolicited targeted advertisement from. The permissions also include permissions for sharing certain objects in his/her cognitive map with other users and selection of whom the user wants to share the objects. The permissions also include permissions for the app to access data from other user apps installed on the user device or data from a user's accounts over a network. In one embodiment, upon a login to the app from an unrecognized or unsaved device, a security alert is sent to the user's email or phone number on file.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0273"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a generic object map, a recommended object area or narrowcast, and a broadcast in a list view. Four objects, which are user-defined bins in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, are shown, with each user-defined bin including a slider bar correlating to numerical values for the relevant user-defined bin. These numerical values represent an Intensity of Interest for each object. The IoI is operable to be determined through a variety of methods, including automatically assigning the IoI by the app based on factors including a relationship to existing objects in the object map, a profile associated with the app, and a recency of the addition of the newly added object. Alternatively, the IoI is initially set at a default value determined by the user or the app, and is later adjusted by a user of the app.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0274">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the IoI for each user-defined bin is initially set to 50. Activation of the box next to “Get Offers Now” for each user-defined bin directs to a URL associated with a web page containing one or more offers for each relevant user-defined bin. Preferably, the order of the user-defined bins in the app is determined based on relationships between and among the bins, with related bins in proximity to each other in the list. The order of the user-defined bins is based on the order of addition to the app in another embodiment. Three vendor recommended objects are included in the List View. These vendor-recommended objects are operable to be added to the object map through dragging to the object map area in the list view. Preferably, selection of a vendor-recommended object via double clicking directs the app to a URL and web page associated with the vendor-recommended object. Finally, the My Account object or bin directs to an account page.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0275"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a visual landscape with an object map, an object recommendation area or narrowcast, and a broadcast. The landscape is further defined by Regions of Interest (RoIs), Areas of Interest (AoIs) and layout. The RoIs include the region for the object map, the region for the narrowcast, and the region for the broadcast. The AoIs include sections of a grid in the object map, in which an object or groups of objects are placed. Notably, AoI sizes, layout distances, and user actions are considered virtual unstructured data for signal construction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0276">The visual landscape of the present invention advantageously provides visual indication through the size of each object. Relationships between and among objects are defined by the proximity of one object to other objects, the negative space between objects, placement of the objects in the map, and other visual relationships. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, user-defined bin <b>1</b>, user-defined bin <b>2</b>, user-defined bin <b>3</b>, and user-defined bin <b>4</b> have identical or similar IoIs, as is reflected by the identical size of each of these bins. Placement of objects or bins in the object map is determined by recency of use, recency of addition, and/or frequency of use. Therefore, because user-defined bin <b>1</b>, user-defined bin <b>2</b>, user-defined bin <b>3</b>, and user-defined bin <b>4</b> are near the center of the object map, these bins have been recently used, recently added, and/or are frequently used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0277">Spacing between and among objects or bins also indicates correlation or relationships between and among bins. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, there is a higher correlation between user-defined bin <b>5</b> and user-defined bin <b>6</b> than user-defined bin <b>5</b> and user-defined bin <b>12</b>, as is evidenced by the close proximity between user-defined bin <b>5</b> and user-defined bin <b>6</b>. Minimal or no space between user-defined bins represents the closest relationship between the bins, whereas more space between bins signifies dissimilarity relative to bins which have less space between them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0278">The object recommendation space or narrowcast channel of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> includes a multiplicity of recommended objects, which in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> are vendor bins. In one embodiment, the app has received permission for specific vendors to populate the object recommendation space with recommended objects. Recommended objects in the narrowcast channel are preferably generated and presented based on in-situ data in the object map, including AoIs, relationships among AoIs, individual objects, IoIs associated with objects, frequency of use of objects or AoIs, recency of use of objects or AoIs, and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0279">In another embodiment, all vendors are granted permission to populate the object recommendation space with recommended objects by default, and the app is operable to receive restrictions on which vendors are prohibited from populating the object recommendation space with recommended objects. Alternatively, vendors auto-populate objects into existing bins or auto-populate objects in the object map. Preferably, one or more vendor computers are connected to the device running the app of the present invention over a network. The size and placement of the vendor bins is determined by the objects in the object map and the relationships among those objects, profile data, past purchases through the app, a likelihood of purchase, information obtained from one or more signals previously obtained for the device or user, a price paid by the vendor, and/or a variety of other factors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0280">The present invention advantageously provides both a List View as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and a Landscape View as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> for displaying an object map, recommended objects, and a broadcast space. These two views provide alternatives for assigning and viewing IoIs for objects in the object map as well as for understanding the relationships among objects in the object map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0281"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a GUI of the app operable to create a signal based on raw data in the form of user input after the app has facilitated purchase of shoes. The object map includes the bin Shoes, which was created after the purchase of the shoes. In another embodiment, the bin Shoes was added to the object map before the purchase of shoes. The Intensity of Interest of the bin Shoes is increased, automatically by the app or manually, after the purchase of the shoes. The IoI of the bin Shoes has a primary datum value equal to the primary datum value of the bin Socks in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. One or more objects is added to the bin Shoes based on the purchase of the shoes after the purchase. By way of example, the one or more objects added to the bin shoes include a link to the purchased shoes, links to similar shoes, a receipt for the purchased shoes, a warranty for the purchased shoes, information about the purchased shoes, and/or a link to a coupon or offer for additional products.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0278" num="0282">After the purchase of shoes has been made through the app, a dialog box prompts for custom entry of a key word or key phrase or selection of a key word or key phrase from an auto-populated list. The auto-populated list is populated based on objects, preferably products, related to the purchased product. In alternative embodiments, a dialog box prompts for custom entry of a key word or key phrase or selection of a key word or key phrase from an auto-populated list to add a first object or bin to the object map, with the auto-populated list being populated based on raw data including structured data and/or unstructured data, popular objects based on a location of the device running the app, the time of the year, the time of the day, and/or a profile associated with the app.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0279" num="0283">Upon receiving input of a key word or key phrase via selection or custom entry, an object based on the key word or key phrase is added to the object map. In one embodiment, the IoI of the newly added object is automatically determined by the app based on a variety of factors including a relationship to existing objects in the object map, a profile associated with the app, and a recency of the addition of the newly added object. Alternatively, the IoI for the newly added object is defined through a slider bar, numerical input, or any other method known in the art for assigning value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0284">If the app has one or more permissions to one or more vendors to send one or more signals to vendors, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a signal based on the key word or key phrase is generated along with a time of the addition of the object to the object map or time of entry of the key word or key phrase, and is sent to vendors who have subscribed to signals from the device. As is explained throughout the specification, the signal is anonymized and offers identity protection which does not reveal the identity of the device or a user or consumer associated with the device. Preferably, the identity is protected and anonymity is preserved through utilization of a key value pair system as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 15/477,473, filed Apr. 3, 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternative methods of protecting the identity of the device and consumer such as encryption are also utilized in other aspects of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0285">Upon a vendor purchasing a signal in accordance with the agreement between the vendor and the signal owner, which is the owner or administrator of the app in one embodiment, or alternatively, the owner of the device, recommended objects are added to the object recommendation space of the GUI, which is also referred to herein as the narrowcast. The recommended objects are preferably provided by information providers or vendors of the objects or items related to the objects. The app preferably has granted permission for information provider or vendor devices to populate the object recommendation space of the GUI. Permission is granted to these parties by moving objects into the object map, preferably from the narrowcast or object recommendation area. Placing an object in the object map that is associated with a vendor preferably grants that vendor permission to populate objects within that object (i.e. the object added to the object map acts as a bin for objects). Alternatively, the vendor is granted permission to populate an Area of Interest (AoI). Vendors are charged a fee for each object added to a bin in one embodiment of the present invention. The vendors are charged a fee based on an actual purchase through the object map in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, vendors are charged a fee when the object is initially added to the object map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0282" num="0286">Each recommended object is operable to function as a direct, exclusive link to one or more products on the vendor's site. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the vendors REI, NikeTown, ShoeMart, SuperShoes, and Sarah's Sandals purchased signals based on the entry of the key word “socks”. Each of these vendors is represented by an object with the vendor's name in the object recommendation space of the GUI in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In this embodiment, these recommended objects provide exclusive links to the vendors' webpages. Alternatively, these recommended objects are bins which contain multiple links to multiple products on different webpages of the vendor. In an exemplary embodiment, the recommended objects are created based on the signal sent to the vendor upon entry of the key word or key phrase and other signals previously purchased for the device and/or consumer. This combination of signals advantageously provides for more accurate recommendations for users and more advanced targeting for vendors. Predictive analytics is preferably utilized in combination with the signals to identify specific products of interest to the user. The recommended objects are operable to be added to the object map directly or to be added to an existing object, with the existing object functioning as a bin. Various methods provide for adding the recommended objects to the object map or to an object which already functions as a bin or is converted into a bin upon association with the recommended object. In one embodiment, the customer drags a recommended object to a bin in the cognitive map and the recommended object is added to the bin. By way of example, the recommended object “Shoe Mart” is dragged to the object “Socks”. The object “Socks” functions as a bin and the recommended object “Shoe Mart” is added to the bin. Upon selection of the bin “Socks”, the recommended object “Shoe Mart” is retrieved in the GUI, with the recommended object “Shoe Mart” providing one or more URLs directing the app to one or more specific products on the Shoe Mart website. The app further includes functionality for adding multiple recommended objects to the relevant bin through dragging the recommended objects to the bin, selecting a button with functionality to add all the recommended objects to the relevant bin, or any other method of selection and addition known in the art. Alternatively, a recommended object is automatically added to a relevant bin upon selection of the recommended object and/or activation of the URL associated with the recommended object. In yet another embodiment, the application is operable to automatically add the recommended object to an object in the object map, wherein the object functions as a bin operable to include other objects, based on a projected IoI for the recommended object exceeding a threshold for automatic addition to the object map, wherein the projected IoI for the recommended object is calculated based on IoIs of the objects in the object map. The threshold for automatic addition to the object map is calculated based on average or median IoIs for related objects, based on an average or median IoI for all objects in the space, and/or based on an average IoI for related recommended objects or recommended objects overall that have been added to the object map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0287">After adding one or more recommended objects to the relevant bin, which in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is the “Socks” bin, the contents of the bin are operable to be accessed. Preferably, the contents of the bin are operable to be displayed in a List View and a Landscape view; other views for the bin contents are deleted herein for the sake of conciseness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0288"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a List View of the recommended objects that are now part of the “Socks” bin. The List View of the “Socks” bin includes a list created based on the recommended objects added to the “Socks” bin, with an IoI for each recommended object and functionality to obtain offers related to each recommended object through the app; this functionality is preferably a URL. The IoI is represented as a numeric value selected on a slider with a value range of 0-100 in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The IoI is preferably prepopulated for each recommended object based on the object map, log files, user profile data, past purchase data, order of addition to the bin, etc. Alternatively, the IoI for each object is automatically set to a predetermined value, is set when the object is added to the bin, or is not set until the bin with the added objects is opened. Notably, more than one object is added for Shoe Mart in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, as the recommended objects Tube Socks, Brand X Socks, and Brand Y Socks are all included. In contrast, the objects associated with vendors REI, Nike, and Sarah's Sandals all include the generic term “Socks”. URLs associated with the vendors REI, Nike, and Sarah's Sandals link to specific products selected based on signal and/or app data, a search results page for socks generated based on signal and/or app data, or a general overview page of socks offered by that vendor. Advantageously, the app provides functionality to add specific brands of socks at these vendors to the “Socks” bin. In various embodiments, this is performed directly on the web browser opened within the app, through an app plugin on a web browser, automatically upon adding the specific brand of socks to a cart or shopping bag on the website, or automatically upon purchasing the specific brand of socks on the website.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0289">Activation of a URL in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> occurs upon activation of a check box next to “Get Offers Now”. Alternatively, a “Get Offers Now” button is provided next to each object in the bin. In yet another embodiment, a URL associated with each object for which a check box is selected is accessed upon activation of a “Get Offers Now” button, with each URL accessed in a separate tab or a separate window on a web browser. In one embodiment, the web page associated with the URL is opened in the app. Alternatively, web page associated with the URL is opened in an external web browser, such as CHROME, FIREFOX, SAFARI, or EDGE. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> includes a “My Account” object separate from the object map and the recommended object area or narrowcast. The “My Account” object is displayed in a broadcast section of the GUI of the app and upon activation, directs the app to settings for the user account.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0290">In one embodiment, the app of the present invention is implemented by a payment processor. Advantageously, the payment processor manages individual accounts which correspond to users of the app of the present invention. Individual customers are increasingly unlikely to submit to extensively invasive profiling by vendors, but are even more unlikely to abandon their usual and accustomed vendor relationships. In this embodiment, a payment processor represents an individual customer's incremental adoption of the present invention and in doing so creates substantial revenue opportunities by selling space in the narrowcast or object recommendation area. Space in the narrowcast area is sold through a bid process in one embodiment. The price for adding an object to the object map is determined via a bid process, a relative price based on a variety of factors including a likelihood of response or addition of an object presented in the narrowcast, a spend level, and other information which is preferably conveyed to purchasers of space in the narrowcast via signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0287" num="0291">Following a successful shopping experience, the customer is then presented with another series of dialog boxes for which the customer either types a key word or key phrase, or selects from a list as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Preferably, the list is updated in real-time or near real-time based on text entry in the key word or key phrase text box. In this example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the app has received the key phrases “New Car” and “Kitchen Project.” When the “Kitchen Project” key phrase is entered into the dialog box, the app populates the drop-down menu list with descriptions of objects relating to “Kitchen Project.” Examples of such descriptions include “Lighting,” “Counters,” “Dishwasher,” “Stove,” “Sinks,” and “Tiles.” In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the app has received selection of “Lighting,” “Sinks” and “Tiles” from the drop-down menu. The list is populated based on data from other app users in one embodiment. In another embodiment, the app maintains a database of key words and key phrases that are associated with user-entered key words and key phrases. In yet another embodiment, a web search is performed based on the user-entered key word or key phrase to create the list of descriptions of objects to suggest through the drop-down menu.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0292">Upon receiving selection of objects, the app creates the objects and automatically places them in the object map. Preferably, each object is automatically placed in an AoI within the object map. Alternatively, the app provides for custom placement of objects within an AoI. Placement is achieved in one embodiment via drag and dropping objects in the object map. Thus, the objects “Lighting,” “Sinks,” and “Tiles” in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> have been automatically placed next to the object “Kitchen Project” in one embodiment of the present invention. Alternatively, the objects “Lighting,” “Sinks,” and “Tiles” have been placed next to the object “Kitchen Project” through dragging and dropping or another GUI method of placing objects. In a further alternative, the objects “Lighting,” “Sinks,” and “Tiles” are included in the object “Kitchen Project,” with “Kitchen Project” operating as a bin. The app has also automatically placed the object “New Car” front and center. Alternatively, the app has received input via the GUI regarding the placement of object “New Car.” The object “New Car” has a greater IoI than the object “Kitchen Project” in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The IoI is automatically determined by the app in one embodiment of the present invention based on factors listed above, including recency of addition, existing objects in the object map, app data including user settings, past raw data including structured data and unstructured data, and past signals for the app, user or device. Advantageously, the present invention provides for modification of IoI through resizing of objects to change the value of the IoI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0293">The key words or key phrases upon which the objects are based are transformed into signals and sold to vendors. Preferably, one or more vendors has an agreement for purchase of signals and advertising in place with the signal marketplace platform and/or the app. This advantageously provides for real-time or near real-time population of the narrowcast with advertisements and/or offers from vendors. In one embodiment, key words or key phrases are combined to form a signal. Alternatively, signals are created based on a combination of related data from the app, device, or user and the key word or key phrase upon which the object is based. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, advertisements and offers from Car, Home Improvement, Shoe, and Sock vendors are displayed as recommended objects in the narrowcast. The recommended objects are automatically added to the object map in one embodiment based on a threshold of probability. The threshold of probability is defined as a cutoff for a group sorted by likelihood of response to an advertising message. The recommended objects are added to either a new AoI or an existing AoI as a separate object in the object map or are added to an existing bin or an existing object to transform the object into a bin. The app also provides for custom addition of recommended objects to the object map as a new object in a new AoI or an existing AoI as a separate object in the object map, or to an existing bin or an existing object to transform the object into a bin. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the narrowcast was populated with the recommended object “Ford.” Either through automatic addition based on a threshold of probability or custom addition to the object map, the object “Ford” has been placed adjacent to the object “New Car” in the object map. The object “Ford” has an identical or similar IoI to the object “New Car.” The IoI of the object “Ford” is preferably determined automatically by the app of the present invention or through custom definition, but is alternatively automatically given the same IoI as the related object “New Car.” Other recommended objects are operable to be added to the object “New Car,” with the object “New Car” having previously been defined as a bin or being transformed into a bin upon addition of the recommended objects. Notably, the present invention provides for sharing of any app element or combination of elements with other devices running the app. By way of example, a bin is shared with an authorized user such as a life partner of the device user. A shared bin advantageously provides for app data from at least two devices to be used in populating the narrowcast and the objects in the bin. The signal marketplace platform preferably utilizes this app data in combination with user data and/or device data corresponding to the at least two users and/or devices in creating signals for selling to the vendors who populate the narrowcast. One shared, the shared bin is “synced” across the apps such that modification of the bin in one app is reflected in all other apps in which the shared bin is shared. The syncing of the bin preferably occurs in real-time or near real-time. Alternatively, the bin is synced across apps on a regular interval, such as every 30 seconds, every 5 minutes, every 10 minutes, every hour, every day, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0294">An object map within a shared bin is preferably created and modified based on the app data, device data, and/or user data related to the devices and users which have access to the shared bin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0295">In one embodiment, steps for sharing an object or bin with another application running on another device include the application receiving a request to share the object with a second application on a second device, wherein the object is a bin which contains at least one other object, the application sharing the object with the second application on the second device, the second application on the second device receiving a key word or a key phrase related to a second object, the second application on the second device adding the second object to the bin, and the second application on the second device syncing the bin with the first application such that the bin in the first application includes the at least one other object and the second object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0296">Thus, the shared bin provides for quantifying preferences of multiple users and devices and allows these users to find overlapping or similar preferences through the object map of the shared bin. By way of example, in a shared bin “New Car,” one app has added the object “2017 Honda Civic” and the other app has added the object “2017 Honda Accord.” In the shared bin, each of these objects have a greater IoI, and a greater corresponding size, and are displayed closer to the center of the object map of the shared bin. Similarly, IoIs of dissimilar objects in the object map of the shared bin are decreased. The relative positions of these objects are further from the center of the object map. By way of example, for the “New Car” shared bin, if one app provides the object “2017 Hummer” and the other app provides “2017 Smart Car,” the IoIs of each of these objects are decreased since these objects are dissimilar. These objects are also preferably displayed closer to the periphery of the object map of the shared bin because of this dissimilarity. As one of ordinary skill in the art appreciates, many algorithms are available in the art for calculating similarity or dissimilarity between and among objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0297">In another embodiment, a shared bin is shared with a second app, wherein the second app is only operable to read the information relating to the bin, such as the objects within the bin. The second app is preferably operable to define an IoI for the shared bin which affects the size and presentation of the shared bin on the object map in the second app. The narrowcast of the second app is preferably populated based on the shared bin. Preferably, recommended objects in the narrowcast which are based on the shared bin are marked with an indication that these recommended objects are recommended based at least in part on the shared bin. In one embodiment, the second app is operable to add the recommended objects to the shared bin without the added recommended objects syncing with the shared bin in the first app such that the added recommended objects in the shared bin of the second app are private to the second app. This embodiment is particularly useful for a user of the second app when contemplating gifts for the user of the first app, as the second app has access to a list of potential gifts via the objects in the shared bin as well as through recommendations in the narrowcast.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0294" num="0298">Sharing of a bin or object is accomplished via selection of another user from a list or searching by username or email address or other identity related information to identify and select the user for sharing. In another embodiment, the list is created based on proximity of devices. Alternatively, sharing of a bin or object is accomplished through a selection of a bin or object and a “tap” or other gesture from one device in the direction of another user device. The app selected for sharing receives a notification and/or message about the sharing. In one embodiment, the selected app has the option to accept or decline the sharing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0295" num="0299"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows the contents of the bin “New Car” from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> in landscape view. In one embodiment, the bin “New Car” is a shared bin and the objects are all displayed in each app in which the bin has been shared. By way of further illustration, the object 2016 Chevy Silverado has been added to the bin by a first app while the objects 2017 Dodge Journey and 2012 Ford F-350 have been added to the bin by a second app. In one embodiment, the object 2017 Dodge Journey has been added to the bin by a second app through a narrowcast recommended object, which was automatically added to the shared bin “New Car” or manually added from the narrowcast to the shared bin via drag and drop or any other technique for manipulating objects in a GUI. The objects 2016 Chevy Silverado, 2017 Dodge Journey, and 2012 Ford F-350 all have the same size and are located at the center of the landscape view, which indicate that these three objects have the same or similar IoI. The objects 2016 Jeep Liberty, 2014 Subaru Outback, 2017 Ford F-250, and 2011 Ford F-250 are positioned around the three largest objects and have similar or identical size and correspondingly, similar or identical IoI. The objects 2015 Subaru Outback and 2013 Subaru Outback have the smallest size, and correspondingly the smallest IoIs. These two objects are located at the peripheral of the landscape view. The grouping of these objects within the bin “New Car” is preferably based on AoIs within the bin. The Subaru objects are grouped in one AoI, and the Ford objects are grouped within another AoI. These AoIs are defined in a variety of ways, including by brand, vehicle type, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0296" num="0300"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a layout of the object map from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> after further usage and development through the app in one embodiment of the present invention. The object map includes indications of which bins or objects are shared with other apps and an indication of the users of the apps that the bins or objects are shared with.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0301">As is evident from the foregoing, the object map is operable to fulfill a variety of different purposes. By way of example, for one user, the object map of the app resembles a directory to favorite stores and products within those stores. Another user utilizes the object map for displaying shared objects and shared bins from one or more other apps. The app and object map is also operable to be used as a hybrid of these approaches, as well as for many other purposes. This rich array makes the personalized object map an ideal channel for permissioned personalized messaging in the form of advertisements and offers from vendors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0298" num="0302">Advantageously, the mix of objects and bins and the layout provide quantifiable insights. With a longer timeframe and richer log files, refined IoI values reflect longer term habits and thinking, in addition to usage and immediate requests. The app also quantifies distances among objects and bins. Preferably, these distances are quantified as pair-wise distances. The pair-wise distances are preferably Euclidian. Alternatively, the pair-wise distances are quantified along a path in the landscape. The distances are quantified to create a personalized hash table of object or product affiliations, which are preferably weighted by usage. Lower distance values indicate a higher affiliation or similarity between objects while higher distance values indicate a lower affiliation or similarity between objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0299" num="0303">An example of a hash table or path table of object affiliations is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Each object is assigned a row and a column, with each cell in the row or column providing a distance between that object and another object. The contents of the hash table, including the distance between two objects and the two objects, are raw data used to construct one or more signals in the present invention. This raw data can be combined with other raw data from the app, device, or user, and transformed into at least one signal in one embodiment of the present invention. Multiple cells and objects are combined to construct a signal in another embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0300" num="0304">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the object map includes Object<sub>1</sub>, Object<sub>2</sub>, Object<sub>3</sub>, Object<sub>4</sub>, Objects, and Object<sub>N</sub>. More objects are added between Objects and Object<sub>N </sub>as needed based on the object map. The distance between Object<sub>1 </sub>and Object<sub>2 </sub>is quantified as P<b>21</b> in the column for Object<sub>1 </sub>and the row for Object<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, the distance between Object<sub>2 </sub>and Object<sub>1 </sub>is quantified as P<b>12</b> in the column for Object<sub>2 </sub>and the row for Object<sub>1</sub>. The distances between each pair of objects is preferably automatically calculated by the app of the present invention, and the hash table is preferably automatically updated based on the distances between these pairs. In one embodiment, the center of each object is used to calculate the distances between each pair of objects. In another embodiment, the edge of each object closest to the other object is used to calculate the distances between each pair of objects. Upon addition of a new object to the object map, a row and a column for the new object is automatically added to the hash table, the distances between the new object and all other objects in the object map is determined, and the hash table is updated with these distances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0301" num="0305">In one embodiment, the app maintains a separate hash table for each object map in the present invention. By way of example, the main object map includes a hash table, a bin that is part of the main object map includes a bin hash table for the distances between objects in the bin, a sub-bin within the bin includes a sub-bin hash table for distances between objects in the sub-bin, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0302" num="0306">In another embodiment, the app maintains a master hash table which includes distances between each set of objects in the object map of the app, regardless of the level of the object in the hierarchy in the object map. A secondary object has the same position as the bin which contains the secondary object in Cartesian or polar coordinates for purposes of determining the distances between objects for the hash table in one embodiment. Similarly, a tertiary object has the same position as the secondary bin and the primary bin for purposes of determining the distances between objects for the hash table. Alternatively, secondary objects in the bin have positions based on the position of the bin, but which are modified based on the positions of the secondary objects within the bin. In this alternative embodiment, tertiary objects in a secondary bin within a primary bin have positions based on the positions of the secondary bin within the primary bin and the primary bin within the object map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0303" num="0307">The distances between objects in an object map provided in the hash table provides for quantifying similarity and/or association between objects. These values provide insight on which objects are correlated in the app. Generally, a smaller value or shorter distance between objects indicates greater similarity or greater association. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the objects Shoes and Socks are positioned closer together than Socks and New Car. Thus, the distance between the objects Shoes and Socks is smaller than the distance between the objects Socks and New Car. Therefore, there is a greater similarity or greater association between the objects Socks and New Car. The object New Car acts as a bin in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-19</figref>. Accordingly, the objects in the bin New Car have the same position as the object New Car in one embodiment of the present invention. Alternatively, the objects in the bin New Car have different positions than the object New Car based on the variations of the positions of these objects in the bin New Car.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0308">By way of illustration, the distance between the object Socks and the object Shoes is quantified with a value of 1 in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The distance between the object Socks and the object New Car is quantified with a value of 2. Thus, there is a greater association and/or similarity between the object Socks and the object Shoes than the object Socks and the object New Car.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0309">In another example, a bin Shoes includes ALDO, Boss, and Johnston &amp; Murphy objects and a bin Shirts includes Brooks Brothers, Banana Republic, and Calvin Klein objects. Within the bin Shoes, Boss is positioned in the center, ALDO is positioned to the left of Boss, and Johnston &amp; Murphy is positioned to the left of ALDO. Within the bin Shirts, Brooks Brothers is positioned in the center, Banana Republic is positioned to the left of Brooks Brothers, and Calvin Klein is positioned to the left of Banana Republic. In this example, the distance between the bin Shoes and the bin Shirts is quantified as 1 in the hash table. Because the object Brooks Brothers is positioned in the center of the bin Shirts, the distance between the bin Shoes and the object Brooks Brothers is also 1 in the hash table. The distance between the bin Shoes and the object Banana Republic is 1.5 and the distance between the bin Shoes and the object Calvin Klein is 2 in the hash table. Likewise, because the object Boss is positioned in the center of the bin Shoes, the distance between the bin Shirts and the object Boss is also 1 in the hash table. The distance between the bin Shirts and the object ALDO is 1.5 and the distance between the bin Shirts and the object Johnston &amp; Murphy is 2 in the hash table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0306" num="0310">Alternatively, the distance between the bin Shoes and the bin Shirts is quantified as 1 in the hash table. Because the object Brooks Brothers is positioned in the center of the bin Shirts, the distance between the bin Shoes and the object Brooks Brothers is also 1 in the hash table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0307" num="0311">Distances between objects within bins are also quantifiable in the present invention. Continuing with the example including the bin Shirts and the bin Shoes above, the distance between the object Brooks Brothers and the object Boss is 1, the distance between the object Brooks Brothers and the object ALDO is 1.75, and the distance between the object Brooks Brothers and the object Calvin Klein is 2.25. Likewise, the distance between the object Banana Republic and the object Boss is 1.75, the distance between the object Banana Republic and the object ALDO is 2.25, and the distance between the object Banana Republic and the object Johnston &amp; Murphy is 2.50. The values for distances used in this example are exemplary only. Notably, the values for distances are operable to be any integer or numerical value (ex: 1, 5.3, 115.7657) and are operable to be on any scale (ex: 0-1, 1-10, 1-100, etc.). Thus, the distances between objects in different bins and sub-bins are raw data which is transformed into one or more signals in one embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0308" num="0312">Signals and Data</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0309" num="0313">A signal on the signal marketplace platform computer includes data provided by the signal seller to the signal buyer. The relationships between the signal seller and signal buyer are defined by the rules management engine on the signal marketplace platform computer of the present invention, as defined herein and in other patent applications from applicant and assignee Commerce Signals. The signal marketplace platform computer preferably includes price, performance, attribution by market segment for these entities, and other attributes. However, these data are “peripheral” to the data contained in the signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0310" num="0314">A signal is created from a source of data, be it structured or unstructured. The “commerce” aspects establish complex sending and receiving relationships that define the data component for the signal that will offer peak performance. For example, a consumer with immediate demand is much like a simple voltage spike and the signal call to action is a single binary. The present inventions and other inventions from Commerce Signals allow the signal seller and signal buyer to meet this immediate demand as all rules and peripheral data elements for the response to the consumer's demand or request have been distributed in advance of a signal exchange.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0311" num="0315">For each pair wise relationship, the signal marketplace platform enables optimization of the objectives of both the signal buyer and signal seller, subject to constraints such as privacy, budget, or policy. This defines how a “signal” component is constructed using unstructured data and those necessary and sufficient structured data components to instantiate and complete a transaction. The peripheral structured data often become parameters of the rules management capabilities of the “commerce” component to provide context to the “signal” component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0312" num="0316">Unstructured data does not originate in a structured database. The present invention and other inventions from Commerce Signals define unstructured data as environmental in one embodiment. The individual requestor does not need to provide these data; however, individual requestor user input data is not precluded. With a ship's radar, a signal requestor makes a broadcast to the environment “who is listening” and receives “ID, time” with no anticipation of response. In the world of online commerce, when an individual requestor goes shopping, the individual's mobile phone or other mobile electronic device can “listen” for various data, by way of example and not limitation, time, altitude, temperature, lighting (sunny, dark, shade), position, Wi-Fi signals, Bluetooth signal, pictures, location, pulse, blood pressure, and any other data collectable by the individual's mobile phone or other mobile electronic device. Some of the data are collected by physical elements of the mobile phone or other electronic mobile devices, for example but not for limitation, time is obtained from communication with local cellular towers, location data is from the GPS receiver, pictures are captured by a camera. Some of the data are collected by specific application programs installed on the mobile phone or other electronic mobile devices, for example but not for limitation, weather, pulse, blood pressure, etc. These data are captured in the “signal” component as described herein and in other applications from applicant and assignee Commerce Signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0313" num="0317">Structured data used by the “signal” component typically originates in a signal seller database and is of predictive value. The signal buyer makes a traditional query about its desired customer. The criterion can be simple demographics or more complex questions, such as those which identify recent and frequent customers. For example, a query is directed by an Italian Restaurant Chain to determine “who likes Italian food.” A bank responds by looking at historical transactions in a relational data base and summarizes the count of all transactions in food for each individual, categorizing a count of Italian food and giving a response as the sum of all Italian food transactions (counts) divided by sum of all transactions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0314" num="0318">At a minimum, a signal buyer would like to send a message to those individuals who have the highest propensity to choose Italian food. In one embodiment, the data in the signal contains “Italian Food Ratio, email address” and is sent as a batch. In another embodiment, the email address is not provided, and the signal buyer only wants to send a timely alert on the individuals' cellphones when they are in proximity to a restaurant. In one embodiment, another signal seller, for example, a cell phone company, provides unstructured data to the signal marketplace platform computer, and the signal marketplace platform computer incorporates the unstructured data into the signal so that the signal includes “Italian Food Ratio, location.” The “commerce” component of the platform enables delivery of promotional messages and feedback on performance to marketing entities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0315" num="0319">In one embodiment of this Italian Restaurant example, the unstructured data providing location does not require the individual requestor to provide these data directly. They are provided by the individual's device, as permissioned by the individual. However, direct individual requestor user input data is not precluded. For purposes of commerce, unstructured data is also stored in the mind of the individual consumer. Namely, what does the consumer wish to buy next? User interfaces can be used to capture such data. For example, a GUI can simply ask a user. A GUI can capture other unstructured data for predicting latent demand. The present invention provides extensive and innovative GUI capabilities for capturing certain unstructured data for use in the “signal” component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0316" num="0320">The foregoing examples have illustrated a relationship between a signal buyer and a signal seller. Given that both parties have relationships with the same individual customer and that this relationship is maintained with a GUI, both parties have access to unstructured data about that individual. Advantageously, the Restaurant Chain in the above example can be both a signal buyer and a signal seller. Given the real-time nature of environmental or unstructured data, the “signal” component enables complex interchanges between marketing entities that will meet the immediate demands of the consumer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0317" num="0321">The rich information displayed in the object map, including individual bins and objects, is obtained from a set of interactions with the app as well as user, app, or device data, preferably in the form of signals. In one embodiment, the payment processor represents the user of the app, and acts as a broker for signals. The signals are preferably created in real-time or near real-time from the structured data distributed among the objects and bins in system variables and small databases in the cognitive map and from unstructured data in the cognitive map such as the proximity of one bin to another bin or other relationships among the bins, as well as from any unstructured data from the user device in the device such as location. Structured data distributed among the objects and bins includes log file data, relationships among objects and bins, and any other data stored in a table or database the app. The signals are updated in real time or near real time when there is any change in the structured data and the unstructured data. In one embodiment, unstructured data from the user's device include time, altitude, temperature, lighting (sunny, dark, shade), position, Wi-Fi signals, Bluetooth signals, camera/pictures, location, pulse, blood pressure, and any other data the device collects from the environment. Some of the unstructured data are collected by physical elements of the user device, by way of example but not limitation, time is obtained from an antenna of a phone communicating with local cellular towers, and pictures are captured by a camera on a phone. Specifically, the location data is preferably obtained from the GPS receiver of the user device, an IP address of the user device, a Wi-Fi connection or wireless network connection of a user device to a router or other device, cellular triangulation, beacons, and/or other location service provided by the device. Unstructured data includes data collected by specific application programs installed on the mobile phone or other electronic mobile devices, by way of example but not limitation, weather apps, biometric apps for pulse and blood pressure, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0318" num="0322">The present invention relates to methods and systems for consumer-driven product discovery in open systems and provides a technology-based solution that overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art vendor-centric architecture, thereby providing improvement to the advertising and marketing industry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0323">The present invention is also inextricably tied to computer technology. A quantitative cognitive object map is created on an app via a GUI in the present invention. Sizes and positions of and distances between visual elements in the quantitative cognitive map are calculated based on usage, habits, and thinking patterns of a consumer as the consumer interacts with the GUI. Location data is also collected from a GPS receiver of a user device, an IP address the user device uses, or cellular triangulation. Signals are created in real time for sale based on the quantitative cognitive map and the location data and other unstructured data; and purchased by certain merchants for targeted advertisement. The consumer receives product links in the targeted advertisement and makes purchases through the app or through the device in the present invention. These inventive elements are not well-understood, routine, or conventional.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0324">Notably, JAVA is utilized to implement the object map and narrowcast in one embodiment of the present invention. However, other programming languages, including object oriented programming languages, are considered within the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0321" num="0325">Certain modifications and improvements will occur to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the foregoing description. The above-mentioned examples are provided to serve the purpose of clarifying the aspects of the invention and it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that they do not serve to limit the scope of the invention. All modifications and improvements have been deleted herein for the sake of conciseness and readability but are properly within the scope of the present invention.</div>
