<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">Broadband slot-coupled stacked patch antenna elements are capable of continuous broadband operation between 1.71 GHz and 2.69 GHz. The broadband slot-coupled stacked patch antenna element includes a mid-band radiating patch, a high-band radiating patch, and a low-band resonator with coupling slots capable of resonating at low, mid, and high band frequencies. Additionally, a low-profile probe-fed patch element is provided for pattern enhancement of antenna arrays at high-band frequencies. This low-profile patch element features fan-shaped probes that have three degrees of tune-ability, namely a length, a width, and a spreading angle. Further aspects include 3-column and 4-column offset arrays of the broadband patch radiators and an interleaved array of the low-profile high-band patch radiators and the broadband radiating elements. A new type of azimuth beam forming network (ABFN) is also introduced for the beam forming of the 3-column and 4-column dual-beam arrays.</div>

<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to wireless communications, and in particular embodiments, to a broadband low-beam-coupling dual-beam phased array.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Modern day wireless cellular antennas can emit a single or multiple beam signal. Single beam antennas emit a single beam signal pointing at the bore-sight direction of the antenna, while dual-beam antennas emit two asymmetric beam signals pointing in two different directions in opposite offset angles from the mechanical bore-sight of the antennas. In a fixed coverage cellular network, azimuth beam patterns of a dual-beam antenna are narrower than that of a single beam antenna. For example, a dual-beam antenna may emit two beams having a half power beam width (HPBW) of about thirty-three degrees in the azimuth direction, while a single beam antenna may emit one beam having a HPBW of about sixty-five degrees in the azimuth direction. The two narrow beams emitted by the dual-beam antenna may typically point in offset azimuth directions, e.g., plus and minus twenty degrees to minimize the beam coupling factor between the two beams and to provide 65 degree HPBW coverage in a three-sector network.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The making and using of embodiments of this disclosure are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the concepts disclosed herein can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts, and that the specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative and do not serve to limit the scope of the claims. Further, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure as defined by the appended claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Base station antennas often use arrays of antenna elements in order to achieve enhanced spatial selectivity (e.g., through beamforming) as well as higher spectral efficiency. Conventional dual-beam antenna arrays may be configured to perform transmissions over frequencies within a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) band (e.g., between 1.71 GHz and 2.17 GHz) and frequencies within a long term evolution (LTE) frequency band (e.g., between 2.49 GHz and 2.69 GHz), but not over frequencies encompassing both the UMTS and LTE bands (e.g., between 1710 MHz and 2690 MHz). Accordingly, mechanisms and techniques for providing antenna arrays capable of continuous broadband operation (e.g., between 1.7 GHz and 2.69 GHz) are desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Aspects of this disclosure provide broadband slot-coupled stacked patch antenna elements that are capable of continuous broadband operation between 1.71 GHz and 2.69 GHz. This broadband slot-coupled stacked patch antenna element includes a mid-band radiating patch, a high-band radiating patch, and a low-band resonator with coupling slots capable of resonating at low, mid, and high band frequencies. Aspects of this disclosure also provide a low-profile probe-fed patch element for pattern enhancement of the array at high-band frequencies. This low-profile patch element features fan-shaped probes that have three degrees of tune-ability, namely a length, a width, and a spreading angle. Additional aspects of this disclosure provide 3-column and 4-column offset arrays of the broadband patch radiators and an interleaved array of the low-profile high-band patch radiators and broadband radiating elements.</div>

As shown, the radiating element <b>400</b> comprises a low-band resonator <b>420</b>, a low-band radiating patch <b>430</b>, a high-band radiating patch <b>440</b>, and a central feed <b>450</b>. The low-band resonator <b>420</b> is positioned above the antenna reflector <b>410</b>, and includes bent edges that serve to extend the signals radiated by the radiating patches <b>430</b>, <b>440</b> to a low-frequency bandwidth.

Non-conductive spacers <b>425</b> are positioned between the low-band resonator <b>420</b> and the low-band radiating patch <b>430</b>, and non-conductive spacers <b>435</b> are positioned between the high-band radiating patch <b>440</b> and the low-band radiating patch <b>440</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates an embodiment probe-fed patch element <b>800</b> mounted to an antenna reflector <b>810</b>. As shown, the proposed probe-fed patch element <b>800</b> comprises a PCB <b>805</b>, a plurality of feed wires <b>820</b>, a PCB <b>830</b>, and a radiating patch <b>840</b>. The PCB <b>830</b> includes a plurality of fan probes <b>832</b>, which are conductively coupled to microstrip feed lines in the PCB <b>805</b> by the feed wires <b>820</b>. Signals from the fan probes <b>832</b> are then electromagnetically coupled to the radiating patch <b>840</b>. In some embodiments, the radiating patch <b>840</b> is suspended above the surface of the PCB <b>830</b> by non-conductive spacers <b>835</b> such that the radiating patch <b>840</b> and the fan probes <b>832</b> are not in direct/physical contact. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates a side view of the narrowband radiating element <b>800</b>, while <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> illustrates a top view of the narrowband radiating element <b>800</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the fan probes <b>832</b> extend inwards, towards the center of the PCB <b>830</b>. Further, a width of the fan probes <b>832</b> increases as the fan probes <b>832</b> extend inwardly, thereby giving the fan probes <b>832</b> a fan-like shape. Notably, the fan-fed probes <b>832</b> offer enhanced tune-ability, as their dimensions (e.g., length (L), width (W), and spreading angle (θ)) can be manipulated to achieve different bandwidth characteristics. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref> shows typical excitation arrangement for the probe-fed patch for dual linear polarization. Each of the fan-shaped probes is fed by an independent port at the bottom PCB. For a linear positive 45° polarization operation, the two ports P1 and P2 are excited in equal amplitude with opposite phase (0° and 180°), while the other two ports N1 and N2 are excited in the similar fashion for linear negative 45° polarization operation. These two linear polarizations can be operating simultaneously. The probe-fed element <b>800</b> have a lower profile than embodiment broadband radiating elements provided by this disclosure. This difference in profile thickness reduces inter-band interference when both the high-band radiating elements <b>800</b> and embodiment broadband radiating elements are included in an antenna array configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a graph of radiation patterns produce by the embodiment narrowband radiating element <b>800</b>. As shown, the embodiment narrowband radiating element <b>800</b> produces broad half power beamwidth (HPBW) across the various sample frequencies. Beam shapes having broad HPBWs may be desirable at high-band radiating frequencies, as they may tend to compensate for the narrower high band patterns produced by broadband arrays and therefore improve the overall coverage performance at high-band frequencies.</div>

As shown, the embodiment narrowband radiating element maintains a port isolation between the two polarization modes of less than 30 dB over much of the frequency spectrum ranging from about 2.2 GHz to 2.8 GHz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates an embodiment broadband antenna array architecture <b>1200</b> comprising rows of broadband radiating elements <b>1210</b>, <b>1220</b> interleaved with rows of high-band elements <b>1230</b>, <b>1240</b>. In some embodiments, the broadband radiating elements <b>1210</b>, <b>1220</b> may be configured similarly to the embodiment broadband radiating element <b>400</b> described above, while the high-band elements <b>1230</b>, <b>1240</b> may be configured similarly to the embodiment probe-fed element <b>800</b> described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">As show in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the odd rows of high-band elements <b>1230</b> are horizontally shifted in relation to the even rows of high-band elements <b>1240</b>, while the odd rows of broadband elements <b>1210</b> are horizontally shifted in relation to the even rows of broadband elements <b>1220</b>. With proper amount, this horizontal shift (HS) allows reduction in radiation side-lobes in the azimuth plane without loss of directivity. Additionally, the high-band elements are also shifted in the horizontal direction with respect to the broadband elements to provide optimum horizontal patterns for the high-band signals. In cases where cost is the primary concern, the offset array can be constructed using only the broadband radiators without interleaving the high-band radiators. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> illustrates an embodiment 4-column broadband offset array architecture <b>1301</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> illustrates an embodiment 3-column broadband offset array architecture <b>1302</b>. The offset architectures <b>1301</b> and <b>1302</b> may use broadband radiators.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the embodiment broadband antenna arrays may achieve improved operation by including an element spacing that is approximately one-half wavelength in the azimuth direction and/or slightly over one-half wavelength in the elevation direction. For improved beam patterns across the a frequency band from 1710 MHz to 2690 MHz, an azimuth spacing of the broadband elements may be selected to optimize the low-band performance, while the azimuth spacing of the narrowband radiating elements is selected to optimize the high-band performance. The broadband radiators may be distributed in an offset four-column configuration for improved aperture efficiency. The lower-profile narrowband radiating elements can be inserted between the broadband arrays. In some embodiments, alternating rows of narrowband/broadband radiating elements are offset in the azimuth direction to achieve low side-lobe performance for high and low frequency bands. In this configuration, the azimuth beams are first formed for each sub-group of array consisting of two or more rows of the array, using tailor-made 4×2 or 3×2 azimuth beam forming network (ABFN). A multi-port variable phase shifters is then used to feed these ABFNs to complete formation of the 2-dimensional array.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an azimuth radiation pattern achieved by the embodiment broadband antenna array architecture <b>1200</b>. In a dual-linearly polarized array, for each frequency of operation, there are four independent asymmetric beams: Left Positive 45° (LP), Right Positive 45° (RP), Left Negative 45° (LN) and Right Negative 45° (RN) beams. To encompass a typical 65° cell coverage, each of the dual-beam array provides azimuth beam patterns with an azimuth HPBW of approximately 33°. This way, the combined HPBW of the two beams can provide approximately the same coverage of a standard 65° beam. Beam shapes of the radiation patterns are carefully designed such that each component beam (left and right) are orthogonal to each other with very low beam coupling factor. The design parameters may be designed in accordance with the following formula: Min (β<sub>RL</sub>)=min (k*∫E<sub>R</sub>(θ,Φ)·E<sub>L</sub>(θ,Φ) dΩ), where k is normalization constant, E<sub>R</sub>(θ,Φ) represents the radiation pattern of the right beam, and E<sub>L</sub>(θ,Φ) represents the radiation pattern of the left beam. Low beam coupling factor, β<sub>RL</sub>, implies highly orthogonal component beams, which is critical for the optimum network performance. Other typical features of these patterns include high roll-off rate at points where the two component beams intersect, low azimuth side lobes, beam cross-over −7 dB to −13 dB between patterns, good front to back ratio of typically over 30 dB in the back of the antenna. Through the virtue of orthogonality of the BFN and spectrum isolation between the two bands, the four asymmetric beams produced by the broadband BSA can be reduced to extremely low values. Therefore, this architecture results in significantly improved network performances without having the penalty of increasing the overall size of a base-station antenna.</div>

Table I and II give a typical azimuth excitation weight functions for the low-band (LB) and high-band (HB) beams, where the β represents the required azimuth phase offset angle between rows. For the Low-band operations, only the full-band elements are excited. For high-band operations, both the full-band and high-band radiators are excited according to the Table II.</div>
