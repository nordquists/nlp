<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">In a broadband wireless communication system, a spread spectrum signal is intentionally overlapped with an OFDM signal, in a time domain, a frequency domain, or both. The OFDM signal, which inherently has a high spectral efficiency, is used for carrying broadband data or control information. The spread spectrum signal, which is designed to have a high spread gain for overcoming severe interference, is used for facilitating system functions such as initial random access, channel probing, or short messaging. Methods and techniques are devised to ensure that the mutual interference between the overlapped signals is minimized to have insignificant impact on either signal and that both signals are detectable with expected performance by a receiver.</div>

<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">A direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) system is inherently capable of supporting multi-cell and multi-user access applications through the use of orthogonal spreading codes. The initial access of the physical channel and frequency planning are relatively easier because of interference averaging in a DSSS system. It has been widely used in some existing wireless networks. However, a DSSS system using orthogonal spreading codes, may suffer severely from the loss of orthogonally in a broadband environment due to multi-path propagation effects, which results in low spectral efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In broadband wireless communications, Multi-Carrier (MC) technology is drawing more and more attention because of its capability. An MC system such as an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system is capable of supporting broadband applications with higher spectral efficiency. An MC system mitigates the adverse effects of multi-path propagation in wireless environments by using cyclic prefixes to extend the signal period as the data is multiplexed on orthogonal sub-carriers. In effect, it converts a frequency selective channel into a number of parallel flat fading channels which can be easily equalized with simple one-tap equalizers. The modulator and the demodulator can be executed efficiently via the fast Fourier transform (FFT) with much lower cost. However, MC systems are vulnerable while operating in multi-user and multi-cell environments.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">A broadband wireless communication system where both the Multi-Carrier (MC) and direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) signals are intentionally overlaid together in both time and frequency domains is described. The system takes advantage of both MC and DSSS techniques to mitigate their weaknesses. The MC signal is used to carry broadband data signal for its high spectral efficiency, while the DSSS signal is used for special purpose processing, such as initial random access, channel probing, and short messaging, in which signal properties such as simplicity, self synchronization, and performance under severe interference are of concern. In the embodiments of this invention both the MC and the DSSS signals are distinguishable in normal operations and the interference between the overlaid signals is insufficient to degrade the expected performance of either signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Unlike a typical CDMA system where the signals are designed to be orthogonal in the code domain or an OFDM system where the signals are designed to be orthogonal in frequency domain, the embodiments of this invention overlay the MC signal, which is transmitted without or with very low spreading, and the DSSS signal, which is transmitted at a power level lower than that of the MC signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with aspects of certain embodiments of this invention, the MC signal is modulated on subcarriers in the frequency domain while the DSSS signal is modulated by the information bits or symbols in the time domain. In some cases the information bits modulating the DSSS sequence are always one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">This invention further provides apparatus and means to implement the mentioned processes and methods in a broadband wireless multi-access and/or multi-cell network, using advanced techniques such as transmit power control, spreading signal design, and iterative cancellation.</div>

The presented methods and apparatus can be applied to downlink, uplink, or both, where the duplexing technique can be either Time Division Duplexing (TDD) or Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Various embodiments of the invention are described to provide specific details for thorough understanding and enablement; however, the aspects of the invention may be practiced without such details. In some instances, well-known structures and functions have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the essential matters.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">Detailed Description of a MC and DSSS Overlay System</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the overlay of the MC and DSSS signals, where the DSSS signal overlaps with the MC signal in the time domain. The overlaid signal can be aligned at the boundary of MC slot or MC symbol when they are synchronized (for example, DSSS signal # k in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). It can also be not aligned when they are not synchronized (for example, DSSS signal # j in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In one embodiment, the DSSS signal is placed at the period of cyclic prefix of the OFDM symbol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an illustration of MC signals overlaid with DSSS signals in the frequency domain where the power level of the DSSS signal is much lower than that of the MC signal. The subcarriers in a subchannel are not necessarily adjacent to each other in the frequency domain. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> wherein not all MC subchannels are occupied. It illustrates a scenario where some MC subchannels are not energized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In another embodiment, the MC signal is modulated on subcarriers in the frequency domain while the DSSS signal is modulated in either the time domain or the frequency domain. In one embodiment the modulation symbol on the DSSS sequence is one and the sequence is unmodulated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a transmitter structure <b>800</b> of an MC and DSSS overlay system, wherein the MC signal and DSSS signal are added together prior to Digital to Analog (D/A) conversion <b>830</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the top branch <b>810</b> is an OFDM transmitter and the bottom branch <b>820</b> is the spread spectrum transmitter. In the MC transmitter, the S/P buffer converts the sequential inputs into parallel outputs, which are in turn inputted to the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT). The outputs from the IDFT are the time domain signals, which are converted from parallel to sequential signals after a cyclic prefix is added. Adding the prefix can also be performed after the P/S conversion. In the spread spectrum transmitter, the DSSS sequence is modulated by the information bits or symbols and the modulated signals will undergo pulse-shaping filtering so that the signal spectrum meets specified criteria.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">A digital attenuator (G1) is used for the DSSS signal to adjust its transmitted signal level relative to the MC signal. The two signals are overlaid in the digital domain before converting to a composite analog signal. A second analog variable gain (G2) is used subsequent to the D/A converter <b>830</b> to further control the power level of the transmitted signal. When the MC signal is not present, both G1 and G2 will be applied to the DSSS signal to provide sufficient transmission dynamic range. G2 can be realized in multiple circuit stages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a receiver structure <b>900</b> of an MC and DSSS overlay system. A composite signal is processed by a MC receiver <b>910</b> and DSSS receiver <b>920</b>. At the receiver side, after automatic gain control (AGC), an Analog-to-Digital (ND) converter <b>930</b> converts the received analog signal to digital signal. The MC receiver basically performs a reverse process of the MC transmitter. The MC synchronization circuit carries out the synchronization in both time and frequency for the receiver to function properly. The outputs of the P/S are information bits or symbols. To detect whether a DSSS signal is present, the signal is despread with a matched filter or a correlator, using the access sequence, to check if the correlation peak exceeds a predefined threshold. The information from the DSSS receiver <b>920</b> will then be used to decode the mobile station's signature in the case of initial random access; to derive the channel information in the case of channel probing; or to decode the information bit in the case of short messaging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment a rake receiver is used in the DSSS receiver <b>920</b> to improve its performance in a multi-path environment. In another embodiment, the MC signal is processed as if no DSSS signal is present. In yet another embodiment, advanced interference cancellation techniques can be applied to the composite signal to cancel the DSSS signal from the composite signal thus maintaining almost the same MC performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The transmitted composite signal for user i can be represented by:

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">C<sub>1 </sub>(in dB) is set to a proper value so that the SINR of the MC as specified in equation (4) meets its requirement. C<sub>2 </sub>(in dB) is an adjustment to compensate for the power control inaccuracy. Open loop power control inaccuracy is mainly caused by a discrepancy between an estimated path loss by the mobile station and the actual path loss.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, C<sub>1 </sub>is set to 9 dB for MC using QPSK modulation with ½ error control coding or 15 dB for MC using 16QAM modulation with ½ error control coding. C<sub>2 </sub>is set to 10 dB or 2 dB depending on whether the mobile station is under open loop power control or closed loop power control. Power control for the DSSS signal also eases the spectrum mask requirement for the DSSS signal because the DSSS signal level is much lower than that of the MC signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">With total power offset of C<sub>1</sub>+C<sub>2 </sub>subtracted from an initial transmission power of the DSSS signal, the spreading factor of the DSSS signal needs to be set high enough (e.g., 512 (27 dB) or higher) so that the DSSS signal can be detected in normal conditions. This requires a sufficient number of bits of the A/D converter at the base station, for example, 12 bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In one embodiment, the D/A converter at the mobile station uses 12 bits, among which 8 bits are targeted for the MC signal (assuming 3 bits are reserved for MC peak to average consideration). Thus, there are enough bits left for the DSSS signal even with significant attenuation relative to the MC signal.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">Canceling the Interference of DSSS Signal to the MC Signal</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the base station employs interference cancellation techniques to cancel the DSSS interference to the MC signal. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a system for using an interference cancellation technique to cancel an interfering DSSS signal in a composite signal to obtain a clearer MC signal. First, a DSSS signal is detected by the DSSS receiver <b>1220</b>; then it is subtracted (decision directed) from the total received signal to obtain a cleaner MC data signal in the MC receiver <b>1210</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In another embodiment, multiple step iterative cancellation can be applied to further improve the effectiveness of the interference cancellation. The MC receiver basically performs a reverse process of the MC transmitter mentioned above. The MC synchronization circuit carries out the synchronization in both time and frequency for the receiver to function properly. The outputs of the P/S are information bits or symbols.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">DSSS sequences are chosen to have good autocorrelation and cross-correlation properties (i.e., with high peak to sidelobe ratio). In one embodiment, pulse-shaping is applied to restrict the spectrum mask of DSSS signals and to reduce impacts on the MC signals in the frequency domain.

The sequence used to spread the DSSS signal has to be designed to avoid cases where the DSSS signal may have a high Peak to Average ratio (PAR) in the frequency domain and its spikes may cause severe interference with some MC subcarriers, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In one embodiment, the DSSS sequence is designed so that, in partial or in full, it has low PAR in the frequency domain using signal processing techniques, such as a PAR reduction algorithm. Either binary or non binary sequences can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In another embodiment, Golay complementary sequences, Reed-Muller codes, or the codes designed with similar construction methods may be used to control the PAR of DSSS sequences in the frequency domain, thereby limiting the interference of DSSS signals to MC signals, which are demodulated in the frequency domain. In one embodiment, guard periods are added to the DSSS signal which overlaps with one MC symbol, as shown by DSSS signal # p <b>1308</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The guard periods ensure that a well-designed DSSS sequence (with low PAR in frequency domain) causes little interference with the MC subcarriers even when there is time misalignment in a DSSS signal relative to the OFDM symbol period.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Within MC subcarriers, the control subcarriers are more important than the data subcarriers and may need to have a better protection in the overlay system.</div>

One such scheme is to use sub-sampling such that the chip rate of the DSSS signal is ½ or ⅔ of the system sampling rate, which means the DSSS spectrum will only occupy the center portion with a width of 5.76 MHz or 7.68 MHz out of the 10 MHz available spectrum <b>1506</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a DSSS signal used as initial random access by the mobile station MS<sub>j </sub> <b>1004</b>, in an overlay system. In the mean time, MS<sub>l </sub>and MS<sub>k </sub>are transmitting MC signals to the base station BS<sub>i </sub> <b>1002</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, the DSSS signal is used for initial random access and the MC signal is used by multiple mobile stations to transmit high rate data and related control information, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this arrangement the mobile station MS<sub>j </sub>is transmitting its initial access DSSS signal simultaneously with the MC signals from other mobile stations (in this case, MS<sub>I </sub>and MS<sub>K</sub>) to the base station BS<sub>i</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In the initial random access of a multi-carrier multiple access system, a mobile station cannot transmit directly onto the control subchannel because its transmission time and power have not been aligned with other mobile stations. When this mobile station powers up or wakes up from a sleep mode, it first listens to a base station broadcasting channel and finds an available random access DSSS channel. It then sends an initial random access signal over the DSSS channel with a certain signature code or sequence that is designated to the corresponding base station and is broadcasted to all the mobile stations by each base station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The initial access DSSS signal arrives at the base station together with MC signals from other mobile stations, each carrying data and control information. The initial power level of the DSSS signal is based on the open power loop control settings. A sufficient guard period is reserved in the DSSS signal to account for initial time alignment uncertainty, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">If the base station successfully detects the DSSS signal, it sends the acknowledgement (ACK) carrying information such as a signature or other unique mobile station identifier and power and time adjustments of the mobile on the downlink control channel in the next available timeslot. The mobile station whose transmission signature matches that of the acknowledgement then moves to the designated uplink MC control channel using the assigned time and power values and further completes the message transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">If no feedback is received at the mobile station after a pre-defined number of slots, it assumes that the access slot was not detected by the base station, and will ramp up the transmission power of the DSSS signal by one step and re-transmit it, until it reaches the maximum allowable transmit signal power or the maximum retry times. In one embodiment, the power ramping step of the mobile station is set to be 1 dB or 2 dB which is configured by the base station on the downlink broadcasting channel. The maximum allowable transmit signal power and the retry times are also controlled by the base station depending on the uplink modulation/coding scheme and available access channels. During the initial random access, the DSSS signal can also be used for channel probing and short messaging.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment of the invention, the DSSS signal is used to assist estimation of channel characteristics. In this case, the mobile station is already synchronized in time and frequency with the base station, and its transmission of the MC signal is under closed-loop power control with the base station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates examples of communications between a base station <b>1702</b> and multiple mobile stations <b>1704</b> transmitting both DSSS and MC signals.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a typical channel response in the time domain <b>1802</b> and the frequency domain <b>1804</b>. By estimating the peaks of a channel response in the time domain <b>1802</b>, the channel profile in the frequency domain <b>1804</b> can be obtained. A typical channel response in the time domain and frequency domain for a broadband wireless system is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Using a matched filter in the DSSS receiver at the base station, the peaks of a channel response in time can be detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">When closed loop power control is used, the initial power settings will be much more accurate than by using open loop power control alone. Thus, the margin reserved for power control inaccuracy can be reduced to a much smaller value. Furthermore, a bigger spreading factor can be used since no data information needs to be conveyed in the DSSS signal. This leaves a dynamic range large enough for detecting multi-path peaks from the output of the match filter or correlator, thereby generating a better channel profile. When and how often a mobile station should send the DSSS signal for channel probing is configurable by the network or the mobile station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In one embodiment, the base station dictates the mobile station to transmit the channel probing DSSS when it needs an update of the mobile station's channel characteristics. In another embodiment, the base station polls the mobile station during its silent period and gets an update of the mobile station's information such as transmission timing and power from the probing DSSS signal. In yet another embodiment, the channel profile information is used by the base station to determine the proper modulation/coding and pilot pattern. In yet another embodiment, the channel profile information is used for advanced antenna techniques such as beamforming. In one embodiment, channel probing with the DSSS signaling is performed without close loop power control or time synchronization.</div>
