The invention, however, is not limited to these exemplary embodiments and applications or to the manner in which the exemplary embodiments and applications operate or are described herein. Moreover, the figures may show simplified or partial views, and the dimensions of elements in the figures may be exaggerated or otherwise not in proportion. In addition, as the terms “on,” “attached to,” “connected to,” “coupled to,” or similar words are used herein, one element (e.g., a material, a layer, a substrate, etc.) can be “on,” “attached to,” “connected to,” or “coupled to” another element regardless of whether the one element is directly on, attached to, connected to, or coupled to the other element or there are one or more intervening elements between the one element and the other element. In addition, where reference is made to a list of elements (e.g., elements a, b, c), such reference is intended to include any one of the listed elements by itself, any combination of less than all of the listed elements, and/or a combination of all of the listed elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Section divisions in the specification are for ease of review only and do not limit any combination of elements discussed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">As used herein, “substantially” means sufficient to work for the intended purpose. The term “substantially” thus allows for minor, insignificant variations from an absolute or perfect state, dimension, measurement, result, or the like such as would be expected by a person of ordinary skill in the field but that do not appreciably affect overall performance. When used with respect to numerical values or parameters or characteristics that can be expressed as numerical values, “substantially” means within ten percent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">As used herein, the term “ones” means more than one. As used herein, the term “plurality” can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more.</div>

It is noted that a flow channel may have a variety of different spatial configurations in a microfluidic device, and thus is not restricted to a perfectly linear element. For example, a flow channel may be, or include one or more sections having, the following configurations: curve, bend, spiral, incline, decline, fork (e.g., multiple different flow paths), and any combination thereof. In addition, a flow channel may have different cross-sectional areas along its path, widening and constricting to provide a desired fluid flow therein.</div>

The two different regions/circuit elements can be, for example, a microfluidic sequestration pen and a microfluidic channel, or a connection region and an isolation region of a microfluidic sequestration pen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">As used herein, the term “constriction” refers generally to a narrowing of a width of a circuit element (or an interface between two circuit elements) in a microfluidic device. The constriction can be located, for example, at the interface between a microfluidic sequestration pen and a microfluidic channel, or at the interface between an isolation region and a connection region of a microfluidic sequestration pen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein, the term “transparent” refers to a material which allows visible light to pass through without substantially altering the light as is passes through.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">As used herein, the term “micro-object” refers generally to any microscopic object that may be isolated and collected in accordance with the present invention. Non-limiting examples of micro-objects include: inanimate micro-objects such as microparticles; microbeads (e.g., polystyrene beads, Luminex™ beads, or the like); magnetic beads; microrods; microwires; quantum dots, and the like; biological micro-objects such as cells (e.g., embryos, oocytes, sperm cells, cells dissociated from a tissue, eukaryotic cells, protist cells, animal cells, mammalian cells, human cells, immunological cells, hybridomas, cultured cells, cells from a cell line, cancer cells, infected cells, transfected and/or transformed cells, reporter cells, prokaryotic cell, and the like); biological organelles; vesicles, or complexes; synthetic vesicles; liposomes (e.g., synthetic or derived from membrane preparations); lipid nanorafts (as described in Ritchie et al. (2009) “Reconstitution of Membrane Proteins in Phospholipid Bilayer Nanodiscs,” Methods Enzymol., 464:211-231), and the like; or a combination of inanimate micro-objects and biological micro-objects (e.g., microbeads attached to cells, liposome-coated micro-beads, liposome-coated magnetic beads, or the like). Beads may further have other moieties/molecules covalently or non-covalently attached, such as fluorescent labels, proteins, small molecule signaling moieties, antigens, or chemical/biological species capable of use in an assay.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">As used herein, the term “maintaining (a) cell(s)” refers to providing an environment comprising both fluidic and gaseous components and, optionally a surface, that provides the conditions necessary to keep the cells viable and/or expanding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">A “component” of a fluidic medium is any chemical or biochemical molecule present in the medium, including solvent molecules, ions, small molecules, antibiotics, nucleotides and nucleosides, nucleic acids, amino acids, peptides, proteins, sugars, carbohydrates, lipids, fatty acids, cholesterol, metabolites, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">As used herein in reference to a fluidic medium, “diffuse” and “diffusion” refer to thermodynamic movement of a component of the fluidic medium down a concentration gradient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The phrase “flow of a medium” means bulk movement of a fluidic medium primarily due to any mechanism other than diffusion. For example, flow of a medium can involve movement of the fluidic medium from one point to another point due to a pressure differential between the points. Such flow can include a continuous, pulsed, periodic, random, intermittent, or reciprocating flow of the liquid, or any combination thereof. When one fluidic medium flows into another fluidic medium, turbulence and mixing of the media can result.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The phrase “substantially no flow” refers to a rate of flow of a fluidic medium that, averaged over time, is less than the rate of diffusion of components of a material (e.g., an analyte of interest) into or within the fluidic medium. The rate of diffusion of components of such a material can depend on, for example, temperature, the size of the components, and the strength of interactions between the components and the fluidic medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">As used herein in reference to different regions within a microfluidic device, the phrase “fluidically connected” means that, when the different regions are substantially filled with fluid, such as fluidic media, the fluid in each of the regions is connected so as to form a single body of fluid. This does not mean that the fluids (or fluidic media) in the different regions are necessarily identical in composition. Rather, the fluids in different fluidically connected regions of a microfluidic device can have different compositions (e.g., different concentrations of solutes, such as proteins, carbohydrates, ions, or other molecules) which are in flux as solutes move down their respective concentration gradients and/or fluids flow through the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">A microfluidic (or nanofluidic) device can comprise “swept” regions and “unswept” regions. As used herein, a “swept” region is comprised of one or more fluidically interconnected circuit elements of a microfluidic circuit, each of which experiences a flow of medium when fluid is flowing through the microfluidic circuit. The circuit elements of a swept region can include, for example, regions, channels, and all or parts of chambers. As used herein, an “unswept” region is comprised of one or more fluidically interconnected circuit element of a microfluidic circuit, each of which experiences substantially no flux of fluid when fluid is flowing through the microfluidic circuit. An unswept region can be fluidically connected to a swept region, provided the fluidic connections are structured to enable diffusion but substantially no flow of media between the swept region and the unswept region. The microfluidic device can thus be structured to substantially isolate an unswept region from a flow of medium in a swept region, while enabling substantially only diffusive fluidic communication between the swept region and the unswept region. For example, a flow channel of a micro-fluidic device is an example of a swept region while an isolation region (described in further detail below) of a microfluidic device is an example of an unswept region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, a “flow path” refers to one or more fluidically connected circuit elements (e.g. channel(s), region(s), chamber(s) and the like) that define, and are subject to, the trajectory of a flow of medium. A flow path is thus an example of a swept region of a microfluidic device. Other circuit elements (e.g., unswept regions) may be fluidically connected with the circuit elements that comprise the flow path without being subject to the flow of medium in the flow path.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The capability of biological micro-objects (e.g., biological cells) to produce specific biological materials (e.g., proteins, such as antibodies) can be assayed in such a microfluidic device. In a specific embodiment of an assay, sample material comprising biological micro-objects (e.g., cells) to be assayed for production of an analyte of interest can be loaded into a swept region of the microfluidic device. Ones of the biological micro-objects (e.g., mammalian cells, such as human cells) can be selected for particular characteristics and disposed in unswept regions. The remaining sample material can then be flowed out of the swept region and an assay material flowed into the swept region. Because the selected biological micro-objects are in unswept regions, the selected biological micro-objects are not substantially affected by the flowing out of the remaining sample material or the flowing in of the assay material. The selected biological micro-objects can be allowed to produce the analyte of interest, which can diffuse from the unswept regions into the swept region, where the analyte of interest can react with the assay material to produce localized detectable reactions, each of which can be correlated to a particular unswept region. Any unswept region associated with a detected reaction can be analyzed to determine which, if any, of the biological micro-objects in the unswept region are sufficient producers of the analyte of interest.</div>

A perspective view of the microfluidic device <b>100</b> is shown having a partial cut-away of its cover <b>110</b> to provide a partial view into the microfluidic device <b>100</b>. The microfluidic device <b>100</b> generally comprises a microfluidic circuit <b>120</b> comprising a flow path <b>106</b> through which a fluidic medium <b>180</b> can flow, optionally carrying one or more micro-objects (not shown) into and/or through the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b>. Although a single microfluidic circuit <b>120</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, suitable microfluidic devices can include a plurality (e.g., 2 or 3) of such microfluidic circuits. Regardless, the microfluidic device <b>100</b> can be configured to be a nanofluidic device. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b> comprises a plurality of microfluidic sequestration pens <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, and <b>130</b>, each having one or more openings in fluidic communication with flow path <b>106</b>. As discussed further below, the microfluidic sequestration pens comprise various features and structures that have been optimized for retaining micro-objects in the microfluidic device, such as microfluidic device <b>100</b>, even when a medium <b>180</b> is flowing through the flow path <b>106</b>. Before turning to the foregoing, however, a brief description of microfluidic device <b>100</b> and system <b>150</b> is provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">As generally illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b> is defined by an enclosure <b>102</b>. Although the enclosure <b>102</b> can be physically structured in different configurations, in the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the enclosure <b>102</b> is depicted as comprising a support structure <b>104</b> (e.g., a base), a microfluidic circuit structure <b>108</b>, and a cover <b>110</b>. The support structure <b>104</b>, microfluidic circuit structure <b>108</b>, and cover <b>110</b> can be attached to each other. For example, the microfluidic circuit structure <b>108</b> can be disposed on an inner surface <b>109</b> of the support structure <b>104</b>, and the cover <b>110</b> can be disposed over the microfluidic circuit structure <b>108</b>. Together with the support structure <b>104</b> and cover <b>110</b>, the microfluidic circuit structure <b>108</b> can define the elements of the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The support structure <b>104</b> can be at the bottom and the cover <b>110</b> at the top of the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, the support structure <b>104</b> and the cover <b>110</b> can be configured in other orientations. For example, the support structure <b>104</b> can be at the top and the cover <b>110</b> at the bottom of the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b>. Regardless, there can be one or more ports <b>107</b> each comprising a passage into or out of the enclosure <b>102</b>. Examples of a passage include a valve, a gate, a pass-through hole, or the like. As illustrated, port <b>107</b> is a pass-through hole created by a gap in the microfluidic circuit structure <b>108</b>. However, the port <b>107</b> can be situated in other components of the enclosure <b>102</b>, such as the cover <b>110</b>. Only one port <b>107</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> but the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b> can have two or more ports <b>107</b>. For example, there can be a first port <b>107</b> that functions as an inlet for fluid entering the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b>, and there can be a second port <b>107</b> that functions as an outlet for fluid exiting the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b>. Whether a port <b>107</b> function as an inlet or an outlet can depend upon the direction that fluid flows through flow path <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The support structure <b>104</b> can comprise one or more electrodes (not shown) and a substrate or a plurality of interconnected substrates.

The support structure <b>104</b> can further comprise a printed circuit board assembly (“PCBA”). For example, the semiconductor substrate(s) can be mounted on a PCBA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The microfluidic circuit structure <b>108</b> can define circuit elements of the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b>.

In the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the microfluidic circuit structure <b>108</b> comprises a frame <b>114</b> and a microfluidic circuit material <b>116</b>. The frame <b>114</b> can partially or completely enclose the microfluidic circuit material <b>116</b>. The frame <b>114</b> can be, for example, a relatively rigid structure substantially surrounding the microfluidic circuit material <b>116</b>.

Other examples of materials that can compose microfluidic circuit material <b>116</b> include molded glass, an etchable material such as silicone (e.g. photo-patternable silicone or “PPS”), photo-resist (e.g., SU8), or the like. In some embodiments, such materials—and thus the microfluidic circuit material <b>116</b>—can be rigid and/or substantially impermeable to gas.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The cover <b>110</b> can be an integral part of the frame <b>114</b> and/or the microfluidic circuit material <b>116</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the cover <b>110</b> can comprise a rigid material. The rigid material may be glass or a material with similar properties. In some embodiments, the cover <b>110</b> can comprise a deformable material.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">System <b>150</b> further comprises a tilting device <b>190</b> configured to rotate a microfluidic device <b>100</b> about one or more axes of rotation. In some embodiments, the tilting device <b>190</b> is configured to support and/or hold the enclosure <b>102</b> comprising the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b> about at least one axis such that the microfluidic device <b>100</b> (and thus the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b>) can be held in a level orientation (i.e. at 0° relative to x- and y-axes), a vertical orientation (i.e. at 90° relative to the x-axis and/or the y-axis), or any orientation therebetween. The orientation of the microfluidic device <b>100</b> (and the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b>) relative to an axis is referred to herein as the “tilt” of the microfluidic device <b>100</b> (and the microfluidic circuit <b>120</b>).

Furthermore, the microfluidic device <b>200</b> may include other fluidic circuit elements. For example, the microfluidic device <b>200</b> can include a plurality of growth chambers or sequestration pens and/or one or more flow regions or flow channels, such as those described herein with respect to microfluidic device <b>100</b>. A DEP configuration may be incorporated into any such fluidic circuit elements of the microfluidic device <b>200</b>, or select portions thereof. It should be further appreciated that any of the above or below described microfluidic device components and system components may be incorporated in and/or used in combination with the microfluidic device <b>200</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the microfluidic device <b>200</b> includes a support structure <b>104</b> having a bottom electrode <b>204</b> and an electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> overlying the bottom electrode <b>204</b>, and a cover <b>110</b> having a top electrode <b>210</b>, with the top electrode <b>210</b> spaced apart from the bottom electrode <b>204</b>. The top electrode <b>210</b> and the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> define opposing surfaces of the region/chamber <b>202</b>.

(Hereinafter the regions <b>214</b> of a microfluidic device having a DEP configuration are referred to as “DEP electrode regions.”) As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a light pattern <b>222</b> directed onto the inner surface <b>208</b> of the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can illuminate select DEP electrode regions <b>214</b> <i>a </i>(shown in white) in a pattern, such as a square. The non-illuminated DEP electrode regions <b>214</b> (cross-hatched) are hereinafter referred to as “dark” DEP electrode regions <b>214</b>. The relative electrical impedance through the DEP electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> (i.e., from the bottom electrode <b>204</b> up to the inner surface <b>208</b> of the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> which interfaces with the medium <b>180</b> in the flow region <b>106</b>) is greater than the relative electrical impedance through the medium <b>180</b> in the region/chamber <b>202</b> (i.e., from the inner surface <b>208</b> of the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> to the top electrode <b>210</b> of the cover <b>110</b>) at each dark DEP electrode region <b>214</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">With the power source <b>212</b> activated, the foregoing DEP configuration creates an electric field gradient in the fluidic medium <b>180</b> between illuminated DEP electrode regions <b>214</b> <i>a </i>and adjacent dark DEP electrode regions <b>214</b>, which in turn creates local DEP forces that attract or repel nearby micro-objects (not shown) in the fluidic medium <b>180</b>. DEP electrodes that attract or repel micro-objects in the fluidic medium <b>180</b> can thus be selectively activated and deactivated at many different such DEP electrode regions <b>214</b> at the inner surface <b>208</b> of the region/chamber <b>202</b> by changing light patterns <b>222</b> projected from a light source <b>220</b> into the microfluidic device <b>200</b>. Whether the DEP forces attract or repel nearby micro-objects can depend on such parameters as the frequency of the power source <b>212</b> and the dielectric properties of the medium <b>180</b> and/or micro-objects (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The square pattern <b>224</b> of illuminated DEP electrode regions <b>214</b> <i>a </i>illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is an example only.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In some embodiments, the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can comprise or consist of a photoconductive material. In such embodiments, the inner surface <b>208</b> of the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can be featureless. For example, the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can comprise or consist of a layer of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The a-Si:H can comprise, for example, about 8% to 40% hydrogen (calculated as 100*(the number of hydrogen atoms)/(the total number of hydrogen and silicon atoms)). The layer of a-Si:H can have a thickness of about 500 nm to about 2.0 In such embodiments, the DEP electrode regions <b>214</b> can be created anywhere and in any pattern on the inner surface <b>208</b> of the electrode activation substrate <b>208</b>, in accordance with the light pattern <b>222</b>. The number and pattern of the DEP electrode regions <b>214</b> thus need not be fixed, but can correspond to the light pattern <b>222</b>.

Alternatively, the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can comprise electrodes (e.g., conductive metal electrodes) controlled by phototransistor switches, with each such electrode corresponding to a DEP electrode region <b>214</b>. The electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can include a pattern of such phototransistors or phototransistor-controlled electrodes. The pattern, for example, can be an array of substantially square phototransistors or phototransistor-controlled electrodes arranged in rows and columns, such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Alternatively, the pattern can be an array of substantially hexagonal phototransistors or phototransistor-controlled electrodes that form a hexagonal lattice. Regardless of the pattern, electric circuit elements can form electrical connections between the DEP electrode regions <b>214</b> at the inner surface <b>208</b> of the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> and the bottom electrode <b>210</b>, and those electrical connections (i.e., phototransistors or electrodes) can be selectively activated and deactivated by the light pattern <b>222</b>. When not activated, each electrical connection can have high impedance such that the relative impedance through the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> (i.e., from the bottom electrode <b>204</b> to the inner surface <b>208</b> of the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> which interfaces with the medium <b>180</b> in the region/chamber <b>202</b>) is greater than the relative impedance through the medium <b>180</b> (i.e., from the inner surface <b>208</b> of the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> to the top electrode <b>210</b> of the cover <b>110</b>) at the corresponding DEP electrode region <b>214</b>. When activated by light in the light pattern <b>222</b>, however, the relative impedance through the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> is less than the relative impedance through the medium <b>180</b> at each illuminated DEP electrode region <b>214</b>, thereby activating the DEP electrode at the corresponding DEP electrode region <b>214</b> as discussed above.

Microfluidic devices having a DEP configuration that includes selectively addressable and energizable electrodes are known in the art and have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,294,063 (Becker et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,942,776 (Medoro), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">As yet another example, the microfluidic device <b>200</b> can have an electrowetting (EW) configuration, which can be in place of the DEP configuration or can be located in a portion of the microfluidic device <b>200</b> that is separate from the portion which has the DEP configuration. The EW configuration can be an opto-electrowetting configuration or an electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) configuration, both of which are known in the art. In some EW configurations, the support structure <b>104</b> has an electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> sandwiched between a dielectric layer (not shown) and the bottom electrode <b>204</b>. The dielectric layer can comprise a hydrophobic material and/or can be coated with a hydrophobic material. For microfluidic devices <b>200</b> that have an EW configuration, the inner surface <b>208</b> of the support structure <b>104</b> is the inner surface of the dielectric layer or its hydrophobic coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">The dielectric layer (not shown) can comprise one or more oxide layers, and can have a thickness of about 50 nm to about 250 nm (e.g., about 125 nm to about 175 nm). In certain embodiments, the dielectric layer may comprise a layer of oxide, such as a metal oxide (e.g., aluminum oxide or hafnium oxide). In certain embodiments, the dielectric layer can comprise a dielectric material other than a metal oxide, such as silicon oxide or a nitride. Regardless of the exact composition and thickness, the dielectric layer can have an impedance of about 10 kOhms to about 50 kOhms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">In some embodiments, the surface of the dielectric layer that faces inward toward region/chamber <b>202</b> is coated with a hydrophobic material. The hydrophobic material can comprise, for example, fluorinated carbon molecules. Examples of fluorinated carbon molecules include perfluoro-polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (e.g., TEFLON®) or poly(2,3-difluoromethylenyl-perfluorotetrahydrofuran) (e.g., CYTOP™). Molecules that make up the hydrophobic material can be covalently bonded to the surface of the dielectric layer. For example, molecules of the hydrophobic material can be covalently bound to the surface of the dielectric layer by means of a linker, such as a siloxane group, a phosphonic acid group, or a thiol group. Thus, in some embodiments, the hydrophobic material can comprise alkyl-terminated siloxane, alkyl-termination phosphonic acid, or alkyl-terminated thiol. The alkyl group can be long-chain hydrocarbons (e.g., having a chain of at least 10 carbons, or at least 16, 18, 20, 22, or more carbons). Alternatively, fluorinated (or perfluorinated) carbon chains can be used in place of the alkyl groups. Thus, for example, the hydrophobic material can comprise fluoroalkyl-terminated siloxane, fluoroalkyl-terminated phosphonic acid, or fluoroalkyl-terminated thiol. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic coating has a thickness of about 10 nm to about 50 nm. In other embodiments, the hydrophobic coating has a thickness of less than 10 nm (e.g., less than 5 nm, or about 1.5 to 3.0 nm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, the cover <b>110</b> of a microfluidic device <b>200</b> having an electrowetting configuration is coated with a hydrophobic material (not shown) as well. The hydrophobic material can be the same hydrophobic material used to coat the dielectric layer of the support structure <b>104</b>, and the hydrophobic coating can have a thickness that is substantially the same as the thickness of the hydrophobic coating on the dielectric layer of the support structure <b>104</b>. Moreover, the cover <b>110</b> can comprise an electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> sandwiched between a dielectric layer and the top electrode <b>210</b>, in the manner of the support structure <b>104</b>. The electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> and the dielectric layer of the cover <b>110</b> can have the same composition and/or dimensions as the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> and the dielectric layer of the support structure <b>104</b>. Thus, the microfluidic device <b>200</b> can have two eletrowetting surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can comprise a photoconductive material, such as described above. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can comprise or consist of a layer of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The a-Si:H can comprise, for example, about 8% to 40% hydrogen (calculated as 100*(the number of hydrogen atoms)/(the total number of hydrogen and silicon atoms)). The layer of a-Si:H can have a thickness of about 500 nm to about 2.0 μm. Alternatively, the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can comprise electrodes (e.g., conductive metal electrodes) controlled by phototransistor switches, as described above. Microfluidic devices having an opto-electrowetting configuration are known in the art and/or can be constructed with electrode activation substrates known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,132 (Chiou et al.), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, discloses opto-electrowetting configurations having a photoconductive material such as a-Si:H, while U.S. Patent Publication No. 2014/0124370 (Short et al.), referenced above, discloses electrode activation substrates having electrodes controlled by phototransistor switches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The microfluidic device <b>200</b> thus can have an opto-electrowetting configuration, and light patterns <b>222</b> can be used to activate photoconductive EW regions or photoresponsive EW electrodes in the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b>. Such activated EW regions or EW electrodes of the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can generate an electrowetting force at the inner surface <b>208</b> of the support structure <b>104</b> (i.e., the inner surface of the overlaying dielectric layer or its hydrophobic coating). By changing the light patterns <b>222</b> (or moving microfluidic device <b>200</b> relative to the light source <b>220</b>) incident on the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b>, droplets (e.g., containing an aqueous medium, solution, or solvent) contacting the inner surface <b>208</b> of the support structure <b>104</b> can be moved through an immiscible fluid (e.g., an oil medium) present in the region/chamber <b>202</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">In other embodiments, microfluidic devices <b>200</b> can have an EWOD configuration, and the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> can comprise selectively addressable and energizable electrodes that do not rely upon light for activation. The electrode activation substrate <b>206</b> thus can include a pattern of such electrowetting (EW) electrodes. The pattern, for example, can be an array of substantially square EW electrodes arranged in rows and columns, such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Alternatively, the pattern can be an array of substantially hexagonal EW electrodes that form a hexagonal lattice. Regardless of the pattern, the EW electrodes can be selectively activated (or deactivated) by electrical switches (e.g., transistor switches in a semiconductor substrate). By selectively activating and deactivating EW electrodes in the electrode activation substrate <b>206</b>, droplets (not shown) contacting the inner surface <b>208</b> of the overlaying dielectric layer or its hydrophobic coating can be moved within the region/chamber <b>202</b>. The motive module <b>162</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can control such switches and thus activate and deactivate individual EW electrodes to select and move particular droplets around region/chamber <b>202</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">Regardless of the configuration of the microfluidic device <b>200</b>, a power source <b>212</b> can be used to provide a potential (e.g., an AC voltage potential) that powers the electrical circuits of the microfluidic device <b>200</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Sequestration Pens.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Non-limiting examples of generic sequestration pens <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, and <b>248</b> are shown within the microfluidic device <b>240</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2D</figref>. Each sequestration pen <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, and <b>248</b> can comprise an isolation structure <b>250</b> defining an isolation region <b>258</b> and a connection region <b>254</b> fluidically connecting the isolation region <b>258</b> to a channel <b>122</b>. The connection region <b>254</b> can comprise a proximal opening <b>252</b> to the channel <b>122</b> and a distal opening <b>256</b> to the isolation region <b>258</b>. The connection region <b>254</b> can be configured so that the maximum penetration depth of a flow of a fluidic medium (not shown) flowing from the channel <b>122</b> into the sequestration pen <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> does not extend into the isolation region <b>258</b>. Thus, due to the connection region <b>254</b>, a micro-object (not shown) or other material (not shown) disposed in an isolation region <b>258</b> of a sequestration pen <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> can thus be isolated from, and not substantially affected by, a flow of medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">The channel <b>122</b> can thus be an example of a swept region, and the isolation regions <b>258</b> of the sequestration pens <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> can be examples of unswept regions. As noted, the channel <b>122</b> and sequestration pens <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> can be configured to contain one or more fluidic media <b>180</b>. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C-2D</figref>, the ports <b>242</b> are connected to the channel <b>122</b> and allow a fluidic medium <b>180</b> to be introduced into or removed from the microfluidic device <b>240</b>. Once the microfluidic device <b>240</b> contains the fluidic medium <b>180</b>, the flow <b>260</b> of fluidic medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b> can be selectively generated and stopped. For example, as shown, the ports <b>242</b> can be disposed at different locations (e.g., opposite ends) of the channel <b>122</b>, and a flow <b>260</b> of medium can be created from one port <b>242</b> functioning as an inlet to another port <b>242</b> functioning as an outlet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> illustrates a detailed view of an example of a sequestration pen <b>244</b> according to the present invention. Examples of micro-objects <b>270</b> are also shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">As is known, a flow <b>260</b> of fluidic medium <b>180</b> in a microfluidic channel <b>122</b> past a proximal opening <b>252</b> of sequestration pen <b>244</b> can cause a secondary flow <b>262</b> of the medium <b>180</b> into and/or out of the sequestration pen <b>244</b>. To isolate micro-objects <b>270</b> in the isolation region <b>258</b> of a sequestration pen <b>244</b> from the secondary flow <b>262</b>, the length L<sub>con </sub>of the connection region <b>254</b> of the sequestration pen <b>244</b> (i.e., from the proximal opening <b>252</b> to the distal opening <b>256</b>) should be greater than the penetration depth D<sub>p </sub>of the secondary flow <b>262</b> into the connection region <b>254</b>. The penetration depth D<sub>p </sub>of the secondary flow <b>262</b> depends upon the velocity of the fluidic medium <b>180</b> flowing in the channel <b>122</b> and various parameters relating to the configuration of the channel <b>122</b> and the proximal opening <b>252</b> of the connection region <b>254</b> to the channel <b>122</b>. For a given microfluidic device, the configurations of the channel <b>122</b> and the opening <b>252</b> will be fixed, whereas the rate of flow <b>260</b> of fluidic medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b> will be variable. Accordingly, for each sequestration pen <b>244</b>, a maximal velocity V<sub>max </sub>for the flow <b>260</b> of fluidic medium <b>180</b> in channel <b>122</b> can be identified that ensures that the penetration depth D<sub>p </sub>of the secondary flow <b>262</b> does not exceed the length L<sub>con </sub>of the connection region <b>254</b>. As long as the rate of the flow <b>260</b> of fluidic medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b> does not exceed the maximum velocity V<sub>max</sub>, the resulting secondary flow <b>262</b> can be limited to the channel <b>122</b> and the connection region <b>254</b> and kept out of the isolation region <b>258</b>. The flow <b>260</b> of medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b> will thus not draw micro-objects <b>270</b> out of the isolation region <b>258</b>. Rather, micro-objects <b>270</b> located in the isolation region <b>258</b> will stay in the isolation region <b>258</b> regardless of the flow <b>260</b> of fluidic medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Moreover, as long as the rate of flow <b>260</b> of medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b> does not exceed V<sub>max</sub>, the flow <b>260</b> of fluidic medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b> will not move miscellaneous particles (e.g., microparticles and/or nanoparticles) from the channel <b>122</b> into the isolation region <b>258</b> of a sequestration pen <b>244</b>. Having the length L<sub>con </sub>of the connection region <b>254</b> be greater than the maximum penetration depth D<sub>p </sub>of the secondary flow <b>262</b> can thus prevent contamination of one sequestration pen <b>244</b> with miscellaneous particles from the channel <b>122</b> or another sequestration pen (e.g., sequestration pens <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Because the channel <b>122</b> and the connection regions <b>254</b> of the sequestration pens <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> can be affected by the flow <b>260</b> of medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b>, the channel <b>122</b> and connection regions <b>254</b> can be deemed swept (or flow) regions of the microfluidic device <b>240</b>. The isolation regions <b>258</b> of the sequestration pens <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, on the other hand, can be deemed unswept (or non-flow) regions. For example, components (not shown) in a first fluidic medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b> can mix with a second fluidic medium <b>280</b> in the isolation region <b>258</b> substantially only by diffusion of components of the first medium <b>180</b> from the channel <b>122</b> through the connection region <b>254</b> and into the second fluidic medium <b>280</b> in the isolation region <b>258</b>. Similarly, components (not shown) of the second medium <b>280</b> in the isolation region <b>258</b> can mix with the first medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b> substantially only by diffusion of components of the second medium <b>280</b> from the isolation region <b>258</b> through the connection region <b>254</b> and into the first medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b>. The first medium <b>180</b> can be the same medium or a different medium than the second medium <b>280</b>. Moreover, the first medium <b>180</b> and the second medium <b>280</b> can start out being the same, then become different (e.g., through conditioning of the second medium <b>280</b> by one or more cells in the isolation region <b>258</b>, or by changing the medium <b>180</b> flowing through the channel <b>122</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">The maximum penetration depth D<sub>p </sub>of the secondary flow <b>262</b> caused by the flow <b>260</b> of fluidic medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b> can depend on a number of parameters, as mentioned above. Examples of such parameters include: the shape of the channel <b>122</b> (e.g., the channel can direct medium into the connection region <b>254</b>, divert medium away from the connection region <b>254</b>, or direct medium in a direction substantially perpendicular to the proximal opening <b>252</b> of the connection region <b>254</b> to the channel <b>122</b>); a width W<sub>ch </sub>(or cross-sectional area) of the channel <b>122</b> at the proximal opening <b>252</b>; and a width W<sub>con </sub>(or cross-sectional area) of the connection region <b>254</b> at the proximal opening <b>252</b>; the velocity V of the flow <b>260</b> of fluidic medium <b>180</b> in the channel <b>122</b>; the viscosity of the first medium <b>180</b> and/or the second medium <b>280</b>, or the like.</div>

The nest <b>300</b> can further include an integrated electrical signal generation subsystem <b>304</b>. The electrical signal generation subsystem <b>304</b> can be configured to supply a biasing voltage to socket <b>302</b> such that the biasing voltage is applied across a pair of electrodes in the microfluidic device <b>360</b> when it is being held by socket <b>302</b>. Thus, the electrical signal generation subsystem <b>304</b> can be part of power source <b>192</b>. The ability to apply a biasing voltage to microfluidic device <b>360</b> does not mean that a biasing voltage will be applied at all times when the microfluidic device <b>360</b> is held by the socket <b>302</b>. Rather, in most cases, the biasing voltage will be applied intermittently, e.g., only as needed to facilitate the generation of electrokinetic forces, such as dielectrophoresis or electro-wetting, in the microfluidic device <b>360</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the nest <b>300</b> can include a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) <b>320</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">Typically, the electrical signal generation subsystem <b>304</b> will include a waveform generator (not shown).

In certain embodiments, the oscilloscope measures the waveform at a location proximal to the microfluidic device <b>360</b> (and distal to the waveform generator), thus ensuring greater accuracy in measuring the waveform actually applied to the device. Data obtained from the oscilloscope measurement can be, for example, provided as feedback to the waveform generator, and the waveform generator can be configured to adjust its output based on such feedback. An example of a suitable combined waveform generator and oscilloscope is the Red Pitaya™.</div>

In some embodiments, the Red Pitaya™ unit is configured to measure the amplified voltage at the microfluidic device <b>360</b> and then adjust its own output voltage as needed such that the measured voltage at the microfluidic device <b>360</b> is the desired value. In some embodiments, the waveform amplification circuit can have a +6.5V to −6.5V power supply generated by a pair of DC-DC converters mounted on the PCBA <b>320</b>, resulting in a signal of up to 13 Vpp at the microfluidic device <b>360</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the nest <b>300</b> can further include a thermal control subsystem <b>306</b>.

For example, the thermal control subsystem <b>306</b> can include a Peltier thermoelectric device (not shown) and a cooling unit (not shown). The Peltier thermoelectric device can have a first surface configured to interface with at least one surface of the microfluidic device <b>360</b>.

In some embodiments, the Peltier thermoelectric device, the cooling unit, and/or the fluidic path <b>330</b> can be mounted on a casing <b>340</b> of the support structure <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, the thermal control subsystem <b>306</b> is configured to regulate the temperature of the Peltier thermoelectric device so as to achieve a target temperature for the microfluidic device <b>360</b>. Temperature regulation of the Peltier thermoelectric device can be achieved, for example, by a thermoelectric power supply, such as a Pololu™ thermoelectric power supply (Pololu Robotics and Electronics Corp.). The thermal control subsystem <b>306</b> can include a feedback circuit, such as a temperature value provided by an analog circuit. Alternatively, the feedback circuit can be provided by a digital circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">In some embodiments, the nest <b>300</b> can include a thermal control subsystem <b>306</b> with a feedback circuit that is an analog voltage divider circuit (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) which includes a resistor (e.g., with resistance 1 kOhm+/−0.1%, temperature coefficient +/−0.02 ppm/C0) and a NTC thermistor (e.g., with nominal resistance 1 kOhm+/−0.01%). In some instances, the thermal control subsystem <b>306</b> measures the voltage from the feedback circuit and then uses the calculated temperature value as input to an on-board PID control loop algorithm. Output from the PID control loop algorithm can drive, for example, both a directional and a pulse-width-modulated signal pin on a Pololu™ motor drive (not shown) to actuate the thermoelectric power supply, thereby controlling the Peltier thermoelectric device.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">In some embodiments, the second light source <b>432</b> emits blue light. With an appropriate dichroic filter <b>424</b>, blue light reflected from the sample plane <b>412</b> is able to pass through dichroic filter <b>424</b> and reach the detector <b>422</b>. In contrast, structured light coming from the light modulating subsystem <b>404</b> gets reflected from the sample plane <b>412</b>, but does not pass through the dichroic filter <b>424</b>. In this example, the dichroic filter <b>424</b> is filtering out visible light having a wavelength longer than 495 nm. Such filtering out of the light from the light modulating subsystem <b>404</b> would only be complete (as shown) if the light emitted from the light modulating subsystem did not include any wavelengths shorter than 495 nm. In practice, if the light coming from the light modulating subsystem <b>404</b> includes wavelengths shorter than 495 nm (e.g., blue wavelengths), then some of the light from the light modulating subsystem would pass through filter <b>424</b> to reach the detector <b>422</b>. In such an embodiment, the filter <b>424</b> acts to change the balance between the amount of light that reaches the detector <b>422</b> from the first light source <b>402</b> and the second light source <b>432</b>. This can be beneficial if the first light source <b>402</b> is significantly stronger than the second light source <b>432</b>. In other embodiments, the second light source <b>432</b> can emit red light, and the dichroic filter <b>424</b> can filter out visible light other than red light (e.g., visible light having a wavelength shorter than 650 nm).</div>

As discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the light modulating subsystem <b>404</b> may comprise an electrically-addressed spatial light modulator and/or an optically-addressed spatial light modulator. Electrically-addressed spatial light modulators comprise an array of individually-addressable spatial light modulators (i.e. spatial light modulating elements) that are controlled by electrodes. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the light modulating subsystem <b>404</b> is a Digital Mirror Device (DMD) <b>460</b> comprising an array of individually-addressable micro-mirrors <b>464</b> that are controlled by an electrodes. However, in other embodiments, the light modulating subsystem <b>404</b> can be a Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) device comprising an array of individually-addressable electrodes that correspond to pixels in a liquid crystal display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the light modulating subsystem <b>404</b> uses a separate light source <b>440</b> to receive and modulate light.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the motive module <b>162</b> transmits information <b>450</b> specifying a specific pattern of light (“pattern information”) to the light modulating subsystem <b>404</b>. In some embodiments, the pattern information <b>450</b> can comprise a bitmap (or similar pixel-based data structure), vector data, or any combination thereof. For purposes of illustration, the pattern information <b>450</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> is illustrated as a bitmap comprising an array of pixels <b>454</b> and including a square pattern <b>452</b> of pixels. Depending on the embodiment, the pattern information <b>450</b> can be binary (i.e. specify whether or not to project a pattern of light) or contain values indicating an intensity of light to project. In instances where the spatial light modulators are micro-mirrors <b>464</b>, the micro-mirrors <b>464</b> may create different intensities of light by rapidly switching the mirrors between an “on” and “off” state (i.e. “dithering” the micro-mirrors).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">The light modulating subsystem <b>404</b> receives the pattern information <b>450</b> from the motive module <b>162</b> and uses the pattern information <b>450</b> to direct the projection of a pattern of light <b>468</b> onto DEP electrode regions <b>474</b> on the microfluidic device <b>470</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, a DMD <b>460</b> rotates a plurality <b>462</b> of individually-addressable micro-mirrors <b>464</b> corresponding to the square pattern information <b>450</b> into an “on state.” The square pattern of individual-addressable micro-mirrors <b>462</b> modulates the light from the light source <b>440</b> to project a pattern of light <b>468</b> onto the microfluidic device <b>470</b> that illuminates a square pattern of DEP electrode regions <b>472</b> in the array of DEP electrode regions <b>474</b> in the microfluidic device <b>470</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">In some embodiments, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the array of individually-addressable spatial light modulating elements <b>464</b> that project light onto the microfluidic device <b>470</b> and the array of DEP electrode regions <b>474</b> in the microfluidic device <b>470</b>. In this way, each individually-addressable spatial light modulating element <b>464</b> can project light to generate light-actuated DEP force at a corresponding DEP electrode region <b>474</b>. In these embodiments, the motive module <b>162</b> can send pattern information <b>450</b> to the light modulating subsystem <b>404</b> that specifies the DEP electrode regions <b>474</b> to project light onto. For example, instead of sending bitmap and or vector data to the light modulating subsystem <b>404</b>, the motive module <b>162</b> can communicate directly with the individually-addressable spatial light modulators to control which of the DEP electrode regions <b>474</b> are illuminated on the microfluidic device <b>470</b>.

In some embodiments, the pattern information <b>450</b> may specify a gradation of light that decreases in intensity over adjacent DEP electrode regions <b>474</b>. For example, the pattern information <b>450</b> may specify that about 100% of the maximum light intensity is to be projected at a first DEP electrode region <b>474</b>, that 70% of the maximum light intensity is to be projected at a second DEP electrode region <b>474</b> adjacent to the first DEP electrode region <b>474</b>, and that 10% of the maximum light intensity is to be projected at a third DEP electrode region <b>474</b> adjacent to the second DEP electrode region <b>474</b>. Various combinations of light intensities may be used to project a gradation over various numbers of DEP electrode regions <b>474</b> (e.g. any decreasing combination of about 100%, about 90%, about 80%, about 70%, about 60%, about 50%, about 40%, about 30%, about 20%, and about 10%, and any values therebetween, of the maximum light intensity over any number of DEP electrode regions <b>474</b> and).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">In one aspect, the invention provides methods for the automated detection of a micro-object of interest disposed within a microfluidic device. The micro-object of interest can be a cell, such as a mammalian cell (e.g., a blood cell, a hybridoma, a cancer cell, a transformed cell, or the like). Alternatively, the micro-object of interest can be a bead, such as might be used in an assay (e.g., a microbead, a magnetic bead, or the like).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">More specifically, the invention provides methods of automatically detecting a micro-object of interest that has similar morphology to features of the microfluidic device. In some instances, detection of micro-objects disposed within a microfluidic device can be complicated by other features of the microfluidic device that have similar morphology to the micro-object of interest. For example, in instances where cells have a diameter of 10 microns, it may be difficult to distinguish the cells from a phototransistor array that is a 10 micron by 10 micro grid. In addition, micro-objects such as cells can be relatively translucent compared to various features of the microfluidic device. Accordingly, it is necessary to identify and remove unwanted features of the microfluidic device (e.g. photo transistor arrays, walls or circuit elements of the microfluidic device) prior to identifying micro-objects of interest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">The invention provides methods of generating differential and filtered images that substantially remove features of the microfluidic device (also referred to herein as “microfluidic device features”), but maintain the micro-objects of interest. In some embodiments, a differential image is used to remove features of the microfluidic device. In these embodiments, a first and second image of the microfluidic device are taken and used to create a differential image. In certain embodiments, the first and second images are digital images. For example, the first and second images can be captured using a digital imaging device, such as a digital camera or a CCD device. Alternatively, the first and second images can be obtained in a non-digitized format and then converted into digital images. After being captured (and digitized, if necessary), the first and second images can be stored in a digital memory device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">In certain instances, actions may be taken to induce movement of the fluid in the microfluidic device after creating the first image and prior to creating the second image. In these instances, inducing movement of the fluid present in the region can involve inducing a small, controlled flow of fluid into or out of the microfluidic device. For example, a pump can be used to introduce a discrete volume of fluid (e.g., 30 pL, 60 pL, 90 pL, or the like) into the flow path of the microfluidic device, thereby causing all of the fluid in the flow path (and any micro-objects contained within the fluid) to shift a small distance (e.g., 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 microns, etc.) in the direction of the fluid flow. Alternatively, a pump can be used to suck a discrete volume of fluid (e.g., 30 pL, 60 pL, 90 pL, etc.) from the flow path of the microfluidic device, thereby causing all of the fluid in the flow path (and any micro-objects contained within the fluid) to shift a small distance (e.g., 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 microns, etc.) in the direction of the fluid flow. In another alternative, the valves that connect the microfluidic device to a source of fluid can be opened. This typically results in a slight movement of fluid within the microfluidic device, causing fluid in the flow path (and any micro-objects contained within the fluid) to shift a small distance. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that this slight movement is caused by a change in surface tension.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">In other instances, the position of the microfluidic device is shifted relative to the imaging device <b>194</b> after creating the first image and prior to creating the second image. In certain embodiments, shifting the position of the microfluidic device can involve moving a stage that is holding the microfluidic device. The stage can be part of the imaging device <b>194</b>, such as a conventional microscope (e.g., a light microscope or fluorescence microscope) or a system suitable for operating electrokinetic microfluidic devices. In certain embodiments, the microfluidic device can be shifted by at least 1, 2, 3 microns, or more. Typically, the shift will be in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis of the imaging device <b>194</b>. For example, if the optical axis corresponds to the z-axis, the shift of the microfluidic device can be in the x,y plane. However, in some embodiments, the shift can include (or even be limited to) movement along the z-axis. In certain embodiments, a piezoelectric device is used to shift the microfluidic device or a stage that is holding the microfluidic device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">After the first image and the second image have been created, various methods can be used to further analyze and process the first and second images. For example, the light intensity value L<sub>i </sub>of each pixel P<sub>i </sub>(i=1 to n) in the image can be evaluated and/or recorded, where n is the number of pixels in the image. The light intensity value L<sub>i </sub>can be the actual observed light intensity value L<sub>i,obs </sub>for pixel P<sub>i</sub>. Alternatively, the light intensity values can be smoothed. For example, L<sub>i </sub>can be an average of the L<sub>i,obs </sub>for pixel P<sub>i </sub>and some or all of the pixels that contact (i.e., immediately surround) pixel P<sub>i</sub>. In another alternative, the light intensity value L<sub>i </sub>can be the actual observed light intensity value L<sub>i,obs </sub>for pixel P<sub>i </sub>minus a background light intensity value L<sub>bkgd</sub>. In certain embodiments, the light intensity value L<sub>i </sub>of each pixel P<sub>i </sub>is represented using 0-8 bits, 0-10 bits, 0-12 bits, or 0-14 bits. Using a larger number of bits to represent the light intensity values L<sub>i </sub>provides for superior analysis of weak signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">In some embodiments, the differential image is generated by subtracting the first image from the second image. In other embodiments, the differential image is generated by subtracting the second image from the first image. In some embodiments, a negative light intensity value L<sub>i </sub>may be assigned to some or all of the pixels P<sub>i </sub>from one of the images and a positive light intensity value L<sub>i </sub>may be assigned to some or all of the pixels P<sub>i </sub>from the other image. In these embodiments, the light intensity values L<sub>i </sub>for the pixels P<sub>i </sub>in the two images may be added to subtract one image from the other image. By subtracting the same pixels present in the first image and the second image, static features of the microfluidic device, as opposed to mobile micro-objects of interest, can be removed prior to analyzing the image to identify the micro-objects of interest. For example, the phototransistor array and/or microfluidic circuit elements (e.g. walls) can be removed by creating a differential image that subtracts out pixels that represent such features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Prior to subtracting one image from the other, the first and second images can be aligned computationally and regions of the first and second images that can't be aligned can optionally be discard. Such alignment can involve the use of one or more identifiable reference points, such as circuit elements within the microfluidic device (e.g. a channel or a sequestration pen within the microfluidic device). The differential image can be generated computationally and then stored in a digital memory device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">After a differential image has been created, various methods can be used to further analyze and process the differential image prior to identifying micro-objects of interest. In certain embodiments, analyzing the differential image further comprises identifying each pixel P<sub>i </sub>that has a positive light intensity value L<sub>i </sub>as being a positive-value pixel and identifying each pixel P<sub>i </sub>that has a negative light intensity value L<sub>i </sub>as a negative-value pixel. In other embodiments, analyzing the differential image further comprises: comparing the light intensity value L<sub>i </sub>of each pixel P<sub>i </sub>to a predetermined threshold light intensity value L<sup>0</sup>; and identifying each pixel P<sub>i </sub>having an L<sub>i </sub>greater than L<sup>0 </sup>as a positive-value pixel and each pixel Pi having an L<sub>i </sub>less than −1*L<sup>0 </sup>as a negative-value pixel. In certain embodiments, L<sup>0 </sup>can be based on the average light intensity value L<sub>avg </sub>of the set of light intensity values L<sub>i </sub>obtained from the set of pixels P<sub>i </sub>(i=1 to n). For the calculation of L<sub>avg</sub>, any pixel P<sub>i </sub>having a light intensity value L<sub>i </sub>that is negative can be multiplied by the factor −1 prior to the calculation. Thus, for example, L<sup>0 </sup>can be equal to L<sub>avg</sub>. In certain related embodiments, L<sup>0 </sup>can be based on the average light intensity value L<sub>avg </sub>and the standard deviation σ of the set of light intensity values L<sub>i </sub>obtained from the set of pixels P<sub>i </sub>(i=1 to n). For example, L<sup>0 </sup>can equal L<sub>avg </sub>plus some multiple of a (e.g., L<sup>0 </sup>can equal L<sub>avg</sub>+1.6σ, L<sub>avg</sub>+2.0σ, L<sub>avg</sub>+3.0σ, etc.). In certain embodiments, an optimum value for L<sup>0 </sup>is determined empirically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">In alternate embodiments, computational transforms may be used to identify and remove microfluidic device features from one or more images of the microfluidic device. For example, a Fourier transform may be used to identify features of the microfluidic device that are periodic, such as a phototransistor array, periodic circuit elements (e.g. walls) and filter out the periodic features. In a specific embodiment, a Discrete Fourier Transform (“DFT”) is applied to an image of the microfluidic device and pixels corresponding to the frequency domain of the DFT are filtered out of the image. After the pixels corresponding to the frequency domain are filtered out, an inverse DFT is applied to produce a filtered image. In embodiments where a filtered image is created, some or all pixels P<sub>i </sub>in the image have positive light intensity values L<sub>i </sub>and can be processed and/or analyzed as discussed above with the respect to differential images.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">In certain embodiments, a single pixel can corresponds to an area in the microfluidic device that is substantially similar to the cross-sectional area of a micro-object of interest. Each pixel can, for example, correspond to an area in the microfluidic device of substantially 5 microns<sup>2 </sup>(or 4 microns<sup>2</sup>, 3 microns<sup>2</sup>, 2 microns<sup>2</sup>, 1 microns<sup>2</sup>, etc.) and the cross-sectional area of a micro-object can be substantially 5 microns<sup>2 </sup>(or 4 microns<sup>2</sup>, 3 microns<sup>2</sup>, 2 microns<sup>2</sup>, 1 microns<sup>2</sup>, etc.). In such embodiments, a single positive-value (or negative value) pixel can represent the location of a micro-object. Thus, in embodiments that use a differential image to identify micro-objects of interest, pixels identified as positive-value pixels can represent the current location of a micro-object (i.e., the position after movement of the fluid), and pixels identified as negative-value pixels can represent the former location of a micro-object (i.e., the position before movement of the fluid). However, if the differential image is generated by subtracting the second image from the first image, then pixels identified as positive-value pixels can represent the former location of a micro-object and pixels identified as negative-value pixels can represent the current location of the micro-object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">In other embodiments, a single pixel can correspond to an area in the microfluidic device that is substantially smaller than the cross-sectional area of a micro-object of interest. For example, the micro-object may have a cross-sectional area of about 80 microns<sup>2</sup>, whereas a pixel may correspond to an area of about 2 microns<sup>2</sup>. In such embodiments, one or more clusters of pixels will be required to cover the cross-sectional area of the micro-object (e.g., in the foregoing example, it would take substantially 40 pixels to cover the cross-section area of the micro-object, or 24 pixels to cover the cross-sectional area of the circumference of the micro-object). Accordingly, in certain embodiments, analyzing the differential and/or filtered image further comprises determining whether a set of positive-value (or negative-value) pixels form one or more clusters of pixels (i.e. pixel clusters) aggregated proximal to each other and whether the area represented by the set of pixel cluster(s) is sufficiently large in comparison to the micro-object being detected. For example, a set of pixel clusters that correspond to an area that is at least 50% of (or 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or substantially similar to) the cross-sectional area of a micro-object of interest can be identified as representing the location of the micro-object. Alternatively, a set of pixel clusters that correspond to an area that is at least 70% of (or 80%, 90%, or substantially similar to) the cross-sectional circumference of a micro-object of interest can be identified as representing the location of the micro-object. In instances, where the images include multiple micro-objects, multiple sets of pixel clusters can be identified and analyzed to determine whether each set of pixel clusters corresponds to a micro-object of interest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">The analysis of a set of pixel clusters can further comprise a number of other features aside from the area and circumference of the pixel clusters. The set of pixel clusters may be analyzed according to global morphology (i.e. the size and shape of the set of one or more pixel clusters), local morphology (i.e. the size and shape of the individual pixel clusters), positive and negative light intensity values L<sub>i</sub>, and other features based on a combination of these elements (e.g. light intensity as a function of size). Various methods may be used to analyze the set of pixel clusters including traditional machine learning techniques where the above-discussed features are computed for a set of images of micro-objects and used to train a classifier to identify micro-objects of interest in new images based on the same features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">In certain embodiments, the differential image can be analyzed for pairs of positive-value and negative-value pixels (or sets of pixel clusters), and the identification of a micro-object can be limited to instances in which the differential image contains corresponding positive-value and a negative-value pixel (or sets of pixel clusters). In certain related embodiments, the identification of a micro-object can be limited to instances in which the differential image contains a pair of positive-value and negative-value pixels (or sets of pixel clusters) and the difference in the relative positions of the positive-value and negative-value pixels (or sets of pixel clusters) is consistent with the magnitude of movement of fluid induced in the region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">In addition to information specifying whether a micro-object is present, micro-object identification can provide various additional information. As discussed above, the differential and/or filtered image may be analyzed with respect to the size and shape of the potential micro-object. In doing so, various information regarding the micro-object may be produced including the radius of the micro-object, the perimeter of the micro-object and a centroid associated with the micro-object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">Once the micro-objects have been identified, various operations can be performed on the micro-objects. In some embodiments, the cell identification will be used to count micro-objects in the microfluidic circuit. In some embodiments, the identified micro-objects will be associated with various circuit elements of the microfluidic circuit (e.g. channel, a sequestration pen, a trap, or any combination thereof) and/or spatial locations on the microfluidic circuit. In these embodiments, the density of micro-objects in a specific area of the microfluidic circuit (e.g. a channel, a sequestration pen, a trap, or any combination thereof) may be calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">Micro-object identification may also be used in conjunction with manipulating or repositioning the micro-objects using force, such as OET or DEP force. In some embodiments, micro-objects that are identified in a specific circuit element (e.g. channel or sequestration pen) or location of the microfluidic circuit may be moved to (i.e. repositioned in) another type of circuit element or location of the microfluidic circuit. For example, micro-objects may be identified in a channel in the microfluidic circuit and repositioned in sequestration pens in the microfluidic circuit (referred to herein as “penning” a micro-object). Conversely, micro-objects identified in sequestration pens in the microfluidic circuit may be moved to in channels in the microfluidic circuit. Alternately, one or more micro-objects may identified in one sequestration pen and repositioned in an empty sequestration pen (referred to herein as “re-penning” a micro-object). According to the embodiment, the micro-objects may be moved using various mechanisms, including OET and DEP force. Similarly, micro-objects may be repositioned sequentially (i.e. one micro-object at a time), in parallel, or any combination thereof (e.g. sequentially repositioning groups of multiple cells in parallel).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">In instances where micro-objects are repositioned from the channel to individual sequestration pens (or re-penning from an individual sequestration pen to another sequestration pen), different algorithms may be used to assign micro-objects to empty sequestration pens. In some embodiments, an algorithm will be used to assign micro-objects to empty sequestration pens such that distance between the micro-objects and the pens (i.e. the trajectory or path that the micro-objects have to travel during repositioning) is minimized. In these embodiments, the use of force (e.g. OET or DEP force) to move the micro-objects is also minimized because the micro-objects are only required to travel a minimum distance to be repositioned in an empty sequestration pen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">In these embodiments, a local micro-object density in a channel (i.e. number of micro-objects within a specific spatial area of the channel) may be used to determine a suitable algorithm to assign specific micro-objects in the channel to empty sequestration pens. Local micro-object density may be computed in a number of ways. In some embodiments, local micro-object density may be computed based on a fixed size area (e.g. 200 microns, or an area of the channel 100 microns long and extending the width of the channel) or using approaches that use various sizes of areas. In other embodiments, local micro-object density may calculated based on clusters of identified micro-objects or the distance between identified micro-objects. Local micro-object density also may be computed by subdividing the channel into a grid or using a “sliding window” approach to compute density for overlapping areas of the channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">If the local micro-object density is above a threshold value T1<sub>density</sub>, then micro-objects may be assigned to the nearest empty sequestration pens such that the distance between the micro-objects and sequestration pens is minimized. If the local micro-object density is below a specific threshold value T1<sub>density</sub>, then the empty sequestration pens may be assigned to the micro-objects that are closest to the empty sequestration pens, such that the distance between the micro-objects and the sequestration pens is minimized. In some instances, local T1<sub>density</sub>, may be computed based on the number of empty pens as well as the density of micro-objects within the channel in a predefined neighborhood area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">Different methods of computing the distance between a micro-object and an empty sequestration pen (i.e. the trajectory the micro-object or path needs to be moved during penning) may be used to assign specific micro-objects to empty sequestration pens. In some embodiments, the distance between the micro-object and a potential sequestration pen may be computed based only on the optimal trajectory using OET and/or DEP force. In some instances, the optimal trajectory using OET or DEP force involves a combination of orthogonal motion paths (e.g. combination of distinct movement only along a y-axis and an x-axis) to move the micro-objects. In other instances, the distance may be based on the shortest possible path between the micro-object and the sequestration pen, without constraint (i.e. the micro-objects may travel along any path to reach the sequestration pens). In most embodiments, the micro-objects will be re-positioned (i.e. “penned” or “re-penned”) using the same trajectory as determined by the algorithm used to calculate the distance (trajectory).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Similarly, in instances where a large number of micro-objects are assigned to sequestration pens (or vice versa), different algorithms may be used to compute the optimal assignment of micro-objects to pens (or vice versa). These algorithms can use different computational methods of determining a micro-object-to-sequestration pen assignment that minimizes the overall distance (i.e. length of the trajectory) that the micro-objects need to be moved in order to reposition the micro-objects into sequestration pens. For example, the algorithms may use the sum of the lengths of all the trajectories as a heuristic to minimize the distance that the micro-objects need to travel. In some embodiments, constraints such as a maximum distance that a micro-object can be moved during repositioning may be introduced into the computation of the optimal assignment. Various combinatorial algorithms may be used to compute the optimal assignment between micro-objects and sequestration pens. Suitable algorithms include: greedy algorithms, nonlinear optimization, heuristic-based algorithms and constrained search. Other similar algorithms are known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">Once the optimal assignment and trajectory has been computed for the micro-objects, a force, such as OET and/or DEP, may be used to move the micro-objects to their assigned pens. The micro-objects may be repositioned using patterns of light, such as a “light cage”, that surround the micro-objects and subject the micro-objects to OET and/or DEP force or by using bars or similar structures to apply OET and/or DEP force to the micro-objects. Typically, a light cage will be a structure that substantially encloses the micro-object (e.g. a square, a circle or a polygon). However, in some instances, a light cage may contain a break or an opening such that the micro-object is not fully enclosed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">As discussed above, in most embodiments, the micro-objects will be moved according to the distance (trajectory) used to compute the optimal assignment of micro-objects to pens. According to the embodiment, micro-objects may be moved sequentially or in parallel any combination thereof (e.g. sequentially moving groups of cells in parallel). In embodiments where the micro-objects are moved in parallel, the algorithm used to compute the optimal assignment or trajectory may compare the trajectories and ensure that the micro-objects do not collide when they are moved in parallel by modifying the trajectory and assignments of the micro-objects to pens. In a specific embodiment, the algorithm may “swap” micro-object assignments to pens when a potential collision is identified. In this embodiment, when the optimal trajectory for a first micro-objects intersects with the optimal trajectory for a second micro-objects, the optimal trajectory for the first micro-object is assigned to the second micro-object and the optimal trajectory for the second micro-object is assigned to the first micro-object. In another specific embodiment, the algorithm delays the repositioning of the first micro-object until such a time that the first and second micro-objects can move along their respective trajectories without colliding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">In some instances, the micro-object density may be so high that the micro-objects need to be separated from one another prior to assigning the micro-objects to sequestration pens and repositioning (i.e. “penning” or “re-penning”) the micro-objects. For example, the micro-object density may be so high that the micro-objects cannot be penned using OET and/or DEP force because the light cage used to reposition objects using OET and/or DEP force cannot be used on a single micro-object without interfering with other micro-objects. This interference is of particular concern in instances where it is important to minimize the amount of OET and/or DEP force applied to the micro-object. For examples, instances where the micro-objects could be harmed by OET and/or DEP force or by-products of OET force (e.g. electrolysis associated with OET and/or DEP force). In these instances, information produced during micro-object identification (e.g. the radius, the centroid, the perimeter and the location of a micro-object) may be used to move the micro-objects such the micro-objects may be penned or re-penned without interfering with other cells (herein referred to as “separating” the micro-objects).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">In order to identify instances where the micro-objects need to be separated prior to penning, a local micro-object density may be computed based on a defined spatial region and compared to a second threshold value T2<sub>density</sub>. Alternately, the distance between the micro-objects may be computed (e.g. the distance between centroids of micro-objects, the distance between the perimeters of the micro-objects) and used to determine whether the micro-objects need to be separated. However, as can appreciated, in some instances, the distance between micro-objects may be too small to identify the micro-objects as separate micro-objects and micro-objects. In these instances, the micro-objects may be re-identified after repositioning (i.e. “penning”) the micro-objects to ensure that each sequestration pen contains a single micro-object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">In some embodiments, a modified light box is used to separate the micro-objects prior to, or during, penning (or re-penning). In these embodiments, a division algorithm is used to compute a set of vertices that partition each identified micro-object in the spatial region of the microfluidic device (e.g. the portion of the channel or the sequestration pen) from the other micro-objects in the same spatial region. However, as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the set of vertices may be drawn such that only a subset of the micro-objects in the spatial region of the microfluidic device are separated from the other micro-objects. For example, the set of vertices may only separate the subset of micro-objects in the spatial region that need to be repositioned due to their close proximity to other micro-objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">In a specific embodiment, a Delaunay triangulation is computed using the centroids of each micro-object. The Delaunay triangulation produces a set of triangles that connect the centroids of the micro-objects. A Voronoi diagram is then computed based on the circumcircles of the triangles computed using the Delaunay Triangulation. The Voronoi diagram is a set of vertices that divide the spatial area into a sub-areas such that the distance between the set of vertices and the centroid of the micro-object is maximized. Other methods of computing a set of vertices that partition each cell from the other cells in the spatial region are known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">Once the set of vertices has been computed, the set of vertices can be used in combination with OET and/or DEP forces to move the micro-objects. In one embodiment, one or more “modified light cages” are generated using the intersection of set of the vertices and the light cage shape typically used to move a micro-object (e.g. a square or circle). Because the intersection of the vertices and the light cages defines an area where the light cages do not intersect or overlap, the light cage can be re-drawn as a modified light cage surrounding the intersection (or a subset of the intersection) such that the modified light cage does not interfere with other micro-objects. The modified light cages can then be used to separate micro-objects by repositioning the micro-object by moving the micro-objects away from each other. In some instances, modified light cage may be re-drawn as the micro-objects are repositioned such that the original light cages are drawn when the micro-objects are in the final position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">Modified light cages may be used to reposition the micro-objects in a variety of embodiments. Depending on the embodiment, the modified light cages for two proximate micro-objects are used to reposition the micro-objects prior to, or after, computing and selecting the trajectory and assignment to a sequestration pen for each micro-object. In some embodiments, modified light cages are used to reposition micro-objects iteratively or sequentially. In addition, modified light cages may be used to pen micro-objects in their assigned sequestration pens. In some embodiments, micro-objects that are closest to the perimeter of the spatial area or closest together in space may be re-positioned or penned prior to repositioning or penning other micro-objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">In moving the micro-objects, the speed at which OET and/or DEP is used to move the cells may be gradually accelerated in order to “ramp up” motion of the micro-objects and ensure that the micro-objects are not lost from their light cages. For example, in a specific embodiment, the initial velocity of the micro-objects may be gradually accelerated from a low initial velocity to a higher travelling velocity. This gradual acceleration may be applied both in instances where the micro-objects are automatically repositioned (e.g. penning, re-penning and export) and in instances where the micro-objects are manually repositioned (e.g. manually selecting and moving a cell). Similarly, the high travelling velocity may be “ramped down” to a final velocity of zero when the micro-objects reach the end of their trajectory and are at their final position.</div>
