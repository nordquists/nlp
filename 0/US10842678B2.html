<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to apparatus and a medical wound dressing for aspirating, irrigating and/or cleansing wounds, and a method of treating wounds using such apparatus for aspirating, irrigating and/or cleansing wounds. It relates in particular to such an apparatus, wound dressing and method that can be easily applied to a wide variety of, but in particular chronic, wounds, to cleanse them of materials that are deleterious to wound healing, whilst retaining materials that are beneficial in some therapeutic aspect, in particular to wound healing.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Before the present invention, aspirating and/or irrigating apparatus therefor were known, and tended to be used to remove wound exudate during wound therapy. In known forms of such wound therapy, the offtake from the wound, especially when in a highly exuding state, is voided to waste, e.g. to a collection bag, as illustrated in DE-A-4 012 232.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Materials deleterious to wound healing are removed in this way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing, such as growth factors, cell matrix components, and other physiologically active components of the exudate from a wound are lost to the site where they can be potentially of most benefit, i.e. the wound bed, when such therapy is applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Such known forms of wound dressing and aspiration and/or irrigation therapy systems often create a wound environment under the dressing that thus may result in the loss of optimum performance of the body's own tissue healing processes, and slow healing and/or in weak new tissue growth that does not have a strong three-dimensional structure adhering well to and growing from the wound bed. This is a significant disadvantage, in particular in chronic wounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">It thus would be desirable to provide a system of therapy which can remove materials deleterious to wound healing from wound exudate, whilst retaining materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing in contact with the wound bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Dialysis is a known method of treating bodily fluids such as blood ex vivo, to cleanse them of materials that are deleterious to the body systemically. Removal of such materials by contact with the dialysate is the prime purpose of dialysis, whilst also retaining materials such as blood, cells and proteins. Other materials that may have an additional positive therapeutic action are potentially lost to the system through the dialysis membrane, which is also permeable to them. The balance of such materials in the bodily fluid in recirculation may thus be further depleted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">It would be desirable to provide a system of therapy which can remove materials deleterious to wound healing from wound exudate, without substantially diluting materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing in contact with the wound bed, and which can continuously supply and recirculate such materials to the wound simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Dialysis for treating bodily fluids is also a systemic therapy, since the treated fluid is returned to within the body. This is in contrast to a topical therapy in which the treated fluid is recycled outside the body, e.g. to a wound. Most dialysis also requires large amounts of bodily fluids such as blood, and consequently the relevant devices tend not to be portable. Even when in a highly exuding state, chronic wounds produce relatively little fluid to be treated compared with internal bodily systems and relatively little materials that are beneficial in some therapeutic aspect to be retained in the wound and/or its environment.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">It is therefore desirable
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">a) to obviate at least some of the abovementioned disadvantages of known aspiration and/or irrigation therapy systems, and</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">b) to provide a system of therapy which can remove materials deleterious to wound healing from wound exudate, whilst retaining materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing in contact with the wound bed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0022">Vascular supply to, and circulation in, tissue underlying and surrounding the wound is often compromised. It is therefore desirable to provide a system of therapy that retains and supplies therapeutically active amounts of materials that are beneficial in reversing this effect whilst removing deleterious materials, thereby promoting wound healing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0023">Thus, according to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for aspirating, irrigating and/or cleansing wounds, characterized in that it comprises
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0024">a) a fluid flow path, comprising
        <ul> <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0025">i) a conformable wound dressing, having
            <ul> <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0026">a backing layer which is capable of forming a relatively fluid-tight seal or closure over a wound and</li> <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0027">at least one inlet pipe for-connection to a fluid supply tube, which passes through and/or under the wound-facing face, and</li> <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0028">and at least one outlet pipe for connection to a fluid offtake tube, which passes through and/or under the wound-facing face,</li> <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0029">the point at which the or each inlet pipe and the or each outlet pipe passes through and/or under the wound-facing face forming a relatively fluid-tight seal or closure over the wound,</li> <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0030">at least one inlet pipe being connected to a fluid recirculation tube, and at least one outlet pipe being connected to a fluid offtake tube: and</li> </ul>
</li> <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0031">ii) a means for fluid cleansing having at least one inlet port connected to a fluid offtake tube and at least one outlet port connected to a fluid recirculation tube;</li> </ul>
</li> <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0032">b) a fluid reservoir connected by a second fluid supply tube to an integer of the flow path (optionally or as necessary via means for flow switching between supply and recirculation);</li> <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0033">c) a device for moving fluid through the wound dressing and means for fluid cleansing, and optionally or as necessary the fluid supply tube; and</li> <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0034">d) optionally means for bleeding the flowpath,
<br/>
such that fluid may be supplied to fill the flowpath from the fluid reservoir via the fluid supply tube (optionally or as necessary via the means for flow switching) and recirculated by the device through the flow path.
</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0035">The means for flow switching between supply and recirculation may take any form that enables the wound simultaneously to be
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0036">a) put into communication with the fluid reservoir but</li> <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0037">b) closed to the fluid recirculation tube, and</li> <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0038">c) vice versa.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0039">Thus, if there is only one inlet pipe that passes through and/or under the wound-facing face of the wound dressing, the fluid reservoir is connected by the fluid supply tube to the flow path via means for flow switching as desired the into a fluid recirculation tube or a fluid offtake tube.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0040">In this case, the means for flow switching between supply and recirculation may be a regulator, such as a T-valve. This is connected in turn to two parts of a fluid recirculation tube or a fluid offtake tube and the fluid supply tube, such that the desired flow switching between supply and recirculation is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0041">If there are two or more inlet pipes, these may be connected respectively to a fluid supply tube or fluid recirculation tube, respectively having a first regulator and a second regulator, such as a valve or other control device for admitting fluids into the wound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0042">The desired flow switching between supply and recirculation is achieved by respectively having the first regulator open when the second regulator is shut, and vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0043">The means for bleeding the flowpath may be situated in any appropriate part of the apparatus that is in contact with the irrigant and/or wound exudate, but is usually within the offtake and/or recirculation tubes. However, it is often as far downstream of and away from the reservoir and the fluid supply tube as possible, so that it may be used to prime the whole of the flowpath from the fluid reservoir via the fluid supply tube.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0044">It may be a regulator, such as a valve or other control device, e.g. a T-valve that is turned to switch between bleed and recirculation, for bleeding fluids from the apparatus, e.g. to a waste reservoir, such as a collection bag.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0045">Alternatively, flow switching between supply and recirculation may not be desired, but rather concomitant bleeding and/or recirculation is desired. The latter may occur when the volume of irrigant and/or wound exudate in recirculation is increased by continuing addition to it of
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0046">a) wound exudate, and/or</li> <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0047">b) fluid passing from a cleansing fluid through a selectively permeable integer, for example in a system such as a dialysis unit.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0048">The means for bleeding the offtake and/or recirculation tubes may then be provided in the form of a regulator, such as a simple valve or other control device for admitting or blocking the passage of irrigant and/or exudate through a bleed line branching from the recirculation path.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0049">The means for fluid cleansing may as desired be a ‘single-phase system.’</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0050">In this, the circulating fluid from the wound and the fluid reservoir passes through a self-contained system in which materials deleterious to wound healing are removed and the cleansed fluid, still containing materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing, is returned via the recirculation tube to the Wound bed. Such systems are described in further detail hereinafter in connection with the means for fluid cleansing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0051">Alternatively, where appropriate it may be provided in the form of a two-phase system, such as a dialysis unit, or a biphasic liquid extraction unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0052">In this, the circulating fluid from the wound and the fluid reservoir passes through a system in which the fluid recirculates in indirect or (less usually, direct) contact with a second fluid (dialysate) phase, more usually a liquid, in which materials deleterious to wound healing are removed and the cleansed fluid, still containing materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing, is returned via the recirculation tube to the wound bed. Such systems are described in further detail hereinafter in connection with the means for fluid cleansing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0053">In use, typically, the means for flow switching between supply and recirculation tubes is set to admit fluid into the wound from the fluid reservoir but to close the wound to the fluid recirculation tube.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0054">Then, any means for bleeding the offtake and/or recirculation tubes are is opened and the device for moving fluid through the wound and means for fluid cleansing is started.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0055">The capacity of the apparatus flow path and the flow rate of irrigant and/or wound exudate from the wound will largely determine whether it is appropriate to run the device to prime the apparatus throughout the whole length of the apparatus flow path, i.e. to displace any existing fluid reservoir (often air) from the fluid recirculation path, and for how long it should be run. Typically, there is a preponderance of irrigant from the fluid reservoir over wound exudate in recirculation, so that use of the device for moving fluid through the wound is appropriate for this purpose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0056">It is allowed to run until the apparatus is primed throughout the whole length of the apparatus flow path.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0057">Then, typically the means for bleeding the offtake and/or recirculation tubes is closed, and the means for flow switching between supply and recirculation tubes is set to close the wound to the fluid reservoir but to admit fluid into the wound from the fluid recirculation tube.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0058">If the means for fluid cleansing is a two-phase system, such as a dialysis unit, or a biphasic extraction unit, the cleansing fluid is typically set in motion in contact with the surface of the selectively permeable integer, for example the polymer film, sheet or membrane. Of course, the cleansing fluid may less usually be static, and then this step is omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0059">As noted below in more detail, the volume of irrigant and/or wound exudate from the wound in recirculation may be increased by continuing addition to it of
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0060">a) wound exudate, and/or</li> <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0061">b) fluid passing from a cleansing fluid through a selectively permeable integer, for example the polymer film, sheet or membrane of a two-phase system, such as an dialysis unit.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0062">Additionally or alternatively, it may be desired to apply a negative pressure to the wound by means of a device for moving fluid through the wound and means for fluid cleansing applied to the fluid in recirculation in the fluid recirculation tube downstream of and away from the wound dressing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0063">In such case, it may be desirable to provide a system in which concomitant bleeding and/or recirculation is possible, and to make the necessary adjustments to maintain the desired balance of fluid in recirculation by means of the means for bleeding the offtake and/or recirculation tubes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0064">The volume of irrigant and/or wound exudate from the wound in recirculation may be decreased by continuing loss from it of fluid passing from a cleansing fluid through a selectively permeable integer, for example in a system such as a dialysis unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0065">Additionally or alternatively, it may be desired to apply a positive pressure to the wound by means of a device for moving fluid through the wound and means for fluid cleansing applied to the fluid in recirculation in the fluid recirculation tube upstream of and towards the wound dressing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0066">The means for flow switching between supply and recirculation may be similarly provided in a form in which concomitant supply and/or recirculation is possible, and to make the necessary adjustments to maintain the desired balance of fluid in recirculation by means of the means for flow switching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0067">It will be appreciated that where a positive or negative pressure is to be applied to the wound, at least one hollow body in the recirculation flow path to and from the wound bed should have sufficient resilience against the pressure to allow any significant compression or decompression of the irrigant fluid to occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0068">In all embodiments of the apparatus, the type and material of such bodies (which are defined by a film, sheet or membrane) that are described by way of example herein to be suitable for use in the present invention will be largely capable of this function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0069">Thus, examples of suitable materials for bodies defined by a film, sheet or membrane, such as inlet or offtake and/or recirculation tubes and structures such as bags, chambers and pouches, filled with irrigant fluid, e.g. the backing layer of the wound dressing are suitably elastically resilient thermoplastic materials that are potentially capable of this function when pressure is applied in this way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0070">The present invention in this aspect provides several advantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0071">One is that application of a positive pressure to the wound under the backing layer may make it possible to flood the tissue underlying the wound with one or more physiologically active components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0072">This may be effected in therapeutically active amounts, to promote greater wound healing than by treatment with the fluid physiologically active component(s) alone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0073">Such physiologically active components of the exudate that are beneficial to wound healing may be e.g. be enzymes or other species and may be supplied from the dialysate of a dialytic means for fluid cleansing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0074">It is believed that using the apparatus for aspirating, irrigating and/or cleansing wounds of the present invention cyclically the effects may be further enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0075">Circulating wound fluid aids in movement of biological signalling molecules involved in wound healing to locations in the wound bed that are favourable to the wound healing process and/or to cells that would otherwise not be exposed to them, e.g. in a highly exuding wound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0076">This is especially the case in those embodiments of the apparatus of this first aspect of the present invention for aspirating, irrigating and/or cleansing wounds where there is an inlet or outlet manifold from which tubules radiate and run to the wound bed to end in openings that deliver and collect the fluid directly from the wound bed over an extended area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0077">Such materials include cytokines, enzymes, nutrients for wound cells to aid proliferation, oxygen, and other molecules that are beneficially involved in wound healing, such as growth factors, and others having beneficial effects (which may be further enhanced) in causing chemotaxis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0078">In all embodiments of the apparatus of this first aspect of the present invention for aspirating, irrigating and/or cleansing wounds, a particular advantage is the tendency of the wound dressing to conform to the shape of the bodily part to which it is applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0079">The wound dressing comprises a backing layer with a wound-facing face which is capable of forming a relatively fluid-tight seal or closure over a wound and
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0080">at least one inlet pipe for connection to a fluid supply tube or recirculation tube, which passes through and/or under the wound-facing face, and</li> <li id="ul0018-0002" num="0081">and at least one outlet pipe for connection to a fluid offtake tube, which passes through and/or under the wound-facing face,</li> <li id="ul0018-0003" num="0082">the point at which the or each inlet pipe and the or each outlet pipe passes through and/or under the wound-facing face forming a relatively fluid-tight seal or closure.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0083">The term ‘relatively fluid-tight seal or closure’ is used herein to indicate one which is fluid- and microbe-impermeable and permits a positive or negative pressure of up to 50% atm., more usually up to 15% atm. to be applied to the wound. The term ‘fluid’ is used herein to include gels, e.g. thick exudate, liquids, e.g. water, and gases, such as air, nitrogen, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0084">The shape of the backing layer that is applied may be any that is appropriate to aspirating, irrigating and/or cleansing the wound across the area of the wound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0085">Examples of such include a substantially flat film, sheet or membrane, or a bag, chamber, pouch or other structure of the backing layer, e.g. of polymer film, which can contain the fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0086">The backing layer may be a film, sheet or membrane, often with a (generally uniform) thickness of up to 100 micron, preferably up to 50 micron, more preferably up to 25 micron, and of 10 micron minimum thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0087">Its largest cross-dimension may be up to 500 mm (for example for large torso wounds), up to 100 mm (for example for axillary and inguinal wounds), and up to 200 mm for limb wounds (for example for chronic wounds, such as venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0088">Desirably the dressing is resiliently deformable, since this may result in increased patient comfort, and lessen the risk of inflammation of a wound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0089">Suitable materials for it include synthetic polymeric materials that do not absorb aqueous fluids, such as polyolefins, such as polyethylene e.g. high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, copolymers thereof, for example with vinyl acetate and polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof; polysiloxanes; polyesters, such as polycarbonates; polyamides, e.g. 6-6 and 6-10, and hydrophobic polyurethanes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0090">They may be hydrophilic, and thus also include hydrophilic polyurethanes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0091">They also include thermoplastic elastomers and elastomer blends, for example copolymers, such as ethyl vinyl acetate, optionally or as necessary blended with high-impact polystyrene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0092">They further include elastomeric polyurethane, particularly polyurethane formed by solution casting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0093">Preferred materials for the present wound dressing include thermoplastic elastomers and curable systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0094">The backing layer is capable of forming a relatively fluid-tight seal or closure over the wound and/or around the inlet and outlet pipe(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0095">However, in particular around the periphery of the wound dressing, outside the relatively fluid-tight seal, it is preferably of a material that has a high moisture vapour permeability, to prevent maceration of the skin around the wound. It may also be a switchable material that has a higher moisture vapour permeability when in contact with liquids, e.g. water, blood or wound exudate. This may, e.g. be a material that is used in Smith &amp; Nephew's Allevyn™, IV3000™ and OpSite™ dressings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0096">The periphery of the wound-facing face of the backing layer may bear an adhesive film, for example, to attach it to the skin around the wound.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0132">However, this may not provide a system to distribute irrigant over a sufficient functional surface area to irrigate the wound at a practical rate. To be suitable for use, in particular in chronic wound dialysis, with relatively high concentrations of materials that are deleterious to wound healing, it may be advantageous to provide a system where wound irrigant and/or wound exudate may be distributed more evenly, or pass in a more convoluted path under the dressing over the wound bed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0189">The tube walls should suitably thick enough to withstand any positive or negative pressure on them, in particular if the volume of irrigant and/or wound exudate from the wound in recirculation is increased by continuing addition to it of wound exudate, and/or fluid passing from a cleansing fluid through a selectively permeable integer, for example the polymer film, sheet or membrane of a two-phase system, such as an dialysis unit. However, as noted below with regard to pumps, the prime purpose of such tubes is to convey fluid irrigant and exudate through the length of the apparatus flow path, rather than to act as pressure vessels. The tube walls may suitably be at least 25 micron thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0190">The bore or any perforations, apertures, holes, openings, orifices, slits or slots along the pipes, etc. or in the hollow body or each of the hollow bodies may be of small cross-dimension.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0200">It may be desirable that the interior of the wound dressing, the rest of the system in which the fluid recirculates, and/or the wound bed, even for a wound in a highly exuding state, are kept sterile after the fluid is sterilised in the fluid reservoir, or that at least naturally occurring microbial growth is inhibited.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0203">Amongst those that are suitable are, for example triclosan, iodine, metronidazole, cetrimide, chlorhexidine acetate, sodium undecylenate, chlorhexidine and iodine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0204">Buffering agents, such as potassium dihydrogen phosphate/disodium hydrogen phosphate may be added to adjust the pH, as may local analgesics/anaesthetics, such as lidocaine/lignocaine hydrochloride, xylocaine (adrenaline, lidocaine) and/or anti-inflammatories, to reduce wound pain or inflammation or pain associated with the dressing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0205">It is also desirable to provide a system in which physiologically active components of the exudate that are beneficial to wound healing are not removed before or after the application of fluid cleansing.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0216">The fluid reservoir may be of any conventional type, e.g. a tube, bag (such as a bag typically used for blood or blood products, e.g. plasma, or for infusion feeds, e.g. of nutrients), chamber, pouch or other structure, e.g. of polymer film, which can contain the irrigant fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0217">The reservoir may be made of a film, sheet or membrane, often with a (generally uniform) thickness similar to that of films or sheets used in conventional wound dressing backing layers, i.e. up to 100 micron, preferably up to 50 micron, more preferably up to 25 micron, and of 10 micron minimum thickness, and is often a resiliently flexible, e.g. elastomeric, and preferably soft, hollow body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0218">In all embodiments of the apparatus the type and material of the tubes throughout the apparatus of the invention for aspirating, irrigating and/or cleansing wounds and the fluid reservoir will be largely determined by their function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0219">To be suitable for use, in particular on chronic timescales, the material should be non-toxic and biocompatible, inert to any active components, as appropriate of the irrigant from the fluid reservoir and/or wound exudate in the apparatus flow path, and, in any use of a two-phase system dialysis unit, of the dialysate that moves into the circulating fluid in the apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0220">When in contact with irrigant fluid, it should not allow any significant amounts of extractables to diffuse freely out of it in use of the apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0221">It should be sterilisable by ultraviolet, gamma or electron beam irradiation and/or with fluid antiseptics, such as solutions of chemicals, fluid- and microbe-impermeable once in use, and flexible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0222">Examples of suitable materials for the fluid reservoir include synthetic polymeric materials, such as polyolefins, such as polyethylene, e.g. high-density polyethylene and polypropylene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0223">Suitable materials for the present purpose also include copolymers thereof, for example with vinyl acetate and mixtures thereof. Suitable materials for the present purpose further include medical grade poly(vinyl chloride).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0224">Notwithstanding such polymeric materials, the fluid reservoir will often have a stiff area to resist any substantial play between it and components that are not mutually integral, such as the fluid supply tube towards the wound dressing, and may be stiffened, reinforced or otherwise strengthened, e.g. by a projecting boss.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0225">The device for moving fluid through the wound and means for fluid cleansing may be any appropriate for this purpose, and may act at any appropriate point for this purpose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0226">It may apply a positive or negative pressure to the wound, although its prime purpose is to move fluid (irrigant from the fluid reservoir and/or wound exudate through the length of the apparatus flow path, rather than to apply a positive or negative pressure to the wound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0227">If applied to the fluid in recirculation in the fluid recirculation tube upstream of and towards the wound dressing and/or the fluid in the fluid supply tube towards the wound dressing (optionally or as necessary via means for flow switching between supply and recirculation), it will usually apply positive pressure (i.e. above-atmospheric pressure) to the wound bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0228">Often the means for fluid cleansing is (most appropriately for its purpose) downstream of the wound dressing, and provides the highest resistance in the flow path. This is especially the case where the means for fluid cleansing is a single-phase system, e.g. with ultrafiltration through microapertures or micropores, thus enhancing applied positive pressure to the wound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0229">Where the device is applied to the fluid in recirculation in the fluid recirculation tube and/or the fluid in the fluid offtake tube downstream of and away from the wound dressing, it will usually apply negative pressure (i.e. below-atmospheric pressure or vacuum) to the wound bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0230">Again, often the means for fluid cleansing is (most appropriately for its purpose) downstream of the wound dressing, and provides the highest resistance in the flow path, thus enhancing applied negative pressure to the wound.</div>

</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0244">The type and/or capacity of the device will be largely determined by
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0035-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0036-0001" num="0245">a) the appropriate or desired fluid volume flow rate of irrigant and/or wound exudate from the wound, and</li> <li id="ul0036-0002" num="0246">b) whether it is appropriate or desired to apply a positive or negative pressure to the wound bed, and the level of such pressure to the wound bed
<br/>
for optimum performance of the wound healing process, and by factors such as portability, power consumption and isolation from contamination.
</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0247">Such a device may also suitably be one that is capable of pulsed, continuous, variable, reversible and/or automated and/or programmable fluid movement. It may in particular be a pump of any of these types.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0248">In practice, even from a wound in a highly exuding state, such a rate of exudate flow is only of the order of up to 75 microlitres/cm<sup>2</sup>/hr (where cm<sup>2 </sup>refers to the wound area), and the fluid can be highly mobile (owing to the proteases present). Exudate levels drop and consistency changes as the wound heals, e.g. to a level for the same wound that equates to 12.5-25 microlitres/cm<sup>2</sup>/hr.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0249">Where materials deleterious to wound healing are removed by a two-phase system (see below), such as a dialysis unit, fluid is also potentially lost to the system through the means for fluid cleansing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0250">This may occur, e.g. through a dialysis polymer film, sheet or membrane which is also permeable to water, in addition to materials deleterious to wound healing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0251">The balance of fluid in recirculation may thus further decrease, but may be adjusted to minimise this undesired loss in a routine manner as described hereinbefore.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0252">Hence, it will be seen that the circulating fluid from the wound will typically contain a preponderance of irrigant over wound exudate in recirculation from the fluid reservoir.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0253">The type and/or capacity of the device will thus be largely determined in this respect by the appropriate or desired fluid volume flow rate of irrigant, rather than that of exudate, from the wound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0254">In practice, such a rate of flow of total irrigant and/or wound exudate will be of the order of 1 to 1000, e.g. 3 to 300, and less preferably 1 to 10 ml/cm<sup>2</sup>/24 hour, where the cm<sup>2 </sup>refers to the wound area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0255">The volume of irrigant and/or wound exudate in recirculation may vary over a wide range, but will typically be e.g. 1 to 8 l. (for example for large torso wounds), 200 to 1500 ml (for example for axillary and inguinal wounds), and 0.3 to 300 ml for limb wounds when the therapy is applied in this way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0256">In practice, suitable pressures are of the order of up to 25% atm such as up to 10% atm. positive or negative pressure on the wound bed, the apparatus being operated as a closed recirculating system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0257">The higher end of these ranges are potentially more suitable for hospital use, where relatively high % pressures and/or vacua may be used safely under professional supervision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0258">The lower end is potentially more suitable for home use, where relatively high % pressures and/or vacua cannot be used safely without professional supervision, or for field hospital use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0259">The device may be a peristaltic pump or diaphragm pump, e.g. preferably a small portable diaphragm or peristaltic pump. These are preferred types of pump, in order in particular to reduce or eliminate contact of internal surfaces and moving parts of the pump with (chronic) wound exudate, and for ease of cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0260">It may suitably be one that applies positive pressure to the wound and/or the means for fluid cleansing. A preferred pump when the applied pressure is positive is a peristaltic pump, e.g. a small, portable peristaltic pump, mounted upstream of the means for fluid cleansing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0261">Where the pump is a peristaltic pump, this may be e.g. an Instech Model P720 miniature peristaltic pump, with a flow rate: of 0.2-180 ml/hr and a weight of &lt;0.5 k. This is potentially useful for home and field hospital use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0262">The pump may suitably be one that applies negative pressure to the wound and/or the means for fluid cleansing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0263">A preferred pump when the applied pressure is negative is a diaphragm pump, e.g. a small, portable diaphragm pump, mounted downstream of the dressing or the means for fluid cleansing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0264">Where the pump is a diaphragm pump, and preferably a small portable diaphragm pump, the one or two flexible diaphragms that displace liquid may each be, for example a polymer film, sheet or membrane, that is connected to means for creating the pulsations. This may be provided in any form that is convenient, inter alia as a piezoelectric transducer, a core of a solenoid or a ferromagnetic integer and coil in which the direction of current flow alternates, a rotary cam and follower, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0265">The outlet from the dressing passes to the means for fluid cleansing for removal of materials deleterious to wound healing from wound exudate, and in turn to the fluid recirculation tube(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0266">The apparatus of the invention for aspirating, irrigating and/or cleansing wounds is provided with means for fluid cleansing, which may be

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0271">Examples of the means for fluid cleansing in such a system include a macro- or microfiltration unit, which appropriately comprises one or more macroscopic and/or microscopic filters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0272">These are to retain particulates, e.g. cell debris and micro-organisms, allowing proteins and nutrients to pass through.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0273">Alternatively, they also include an ultrafiltration unit, such as a one in which the cleansing integer is a filter for materials deleterious to wound healing, for example a high throughput, low protein-binding polymer film, sheet or membrane which is selectively impermeable to materials deleterious to wound healing, which are removed and the cleansed fluid, still containing materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing is passed by it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0274">The membrane may preferably be of a hydrophilic polymeric material, such as a cellulose acetate-nitrate mixture, polyvinylidene chloride, and, for example hydrophilic polyurethane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0275">Examples of less preferred materials include hydrophobic materials also including polyesters, such as polycarbonates, PTFE, and polyamides, e.g. 6-6 and 6-10, and hydrophobic polyurethanes, and quartz and glass fibre.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0276">It has microapertures or micropores, the maximum cross-dimension of which will largely depend on the species that are to be selectively removed in this way and those to which it is to be permeable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0277">The former may be removed with microapertures or micropores, e.g. typically with a maximum cross-dimension in the range of 20 to 700 micron, e.g. 20 to 50 nm (for example for undesired proteins), 50 to 100 nm, 100 to 250 nm, 250 to 500 nm and 500 to 700 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0278">The filter integer may be a flat sheet or a membrane of a polymeric material in a more convoluted form, e.g. in the form of elongate structure, such as pipes, tubules, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0279">The system may be a chemical adsorption unit, for example one in which a particulate, such as a zeolite, or a layer, e.g. of a functionalised polymer has sites on its surface that are capable of removing materials deleterious to wound healing on passing the circulating fluid from the wound and the fluid reservoir over them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0280">The materials may be removed, e.g. by destroying or binding the materials that are deleterious to wound healing, by, for example chelators and/or ion exchangers, degraders, which may be enzymes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0281">Examples of such also include less specific chemical absorption and/or adsorption units, for example one in which a physical absorbent, such as activated carbon or a zeolite, has non-specific sites on its surface that are capable of removing materials deleterious to wound healing on passing the circulating fluid from the wound and the fluid reservoir over them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0282">The cleansing integer, for example the polymer film, sheet or other chemical absorption and/or adsorption means, etc should of course be capable of removing materials deleterious to wound healing at a practical rate for a given capacity of the apparatus flow path and the flow rate of irrigant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0283">In the two-phase system, circulating fluid from the wound and the fluid reservoir in indirect or (less usually, direct) contact with a second fluid (dialysate) phase, more usually a liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0284">Thus, in one form, a biphasic liquid extraction unit, the second fluid phase is (usually) a liquid that is immiscible with the circulating fluid from the dressing, over a surface of which the circulating fluid passes in direct contact with the cleansing fluid. Materials deleterious to wound healing are removed into the dialysate, and the cleansed fluid, still containing materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing, is returned via the recirculation tube to the wound bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0285">Examples of such means for fluid cleansing include those wherein the second fluid (dialysate) phase is perfluorodecalin and like materials</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0287">Again, materials deleterious to wound healing are removed into the dialysate, and the cleansed fluid, still containing materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing, is returned via the recirculation tube to the wound bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0288">In either form in which the two-phase system, such as a dialysis unit, is provided, in use typically the dialysate moves past the circulating fluid in the apparatus in a co- or preferably counter-current direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0289">Pumps, such as peristaltic pumps, and/or valves control the direction of the two fluid flows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0290">However, the cleansing fluid may less usually be static, although this may not provide a system with sufficient (dynamic) surface area to remove materials deleterious to wound healing from wound exudate at a practical rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0291">Typical dialysate flow rates in a dialytic means for fluid cleansing in the present apparatus for aspirating, irrigating and/or cleansing wounds are those used in the conventional type of two-phase system, such as a dialysis unit for systemic therapy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0292">The integer may be a film, sheet or membrane, often of the same type, and of the same (generally uniform) thickness, as those used in conventional two-phase system, such as a dialysis unit for systemic therapy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0293">The film, sheet or membrane may be substantially flat, and depending on any pressure differential across it may require other materials on or in it to stiffen, reinforce or otherwise strengthen it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0294">However, this may not provide a system with sufficient functional surface area to remove materials deleterious to wound healing from wound exudate at a practical rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0295">To be suitable for use, in particular in chronic wound dialysis, with relatively high concentrations of materials that are deleterious to wound healing, it may be advantageous to provide a system in which the film, sheet or membrane of a polymeric material is in a more convoluted form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0296">This may be in the form of elongate structures, such as pipes, tubes hollow fibres or filaments or tubules of a round cross-section, e.g. elliptical or circular, e.g. in a parallel array with spaces therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0297">The wound irrigant and/or wound exudate may recirculate through the inside and the cleansing fluid may pass into the spaces between adjacent pipes, tubes or tubules in a co- or preferably counter-current direction, or vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0298">Again, materials deleterious to wound healing are removed into the dialysate, and the cleansed fluid, still containing materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing, is returned via the recirculation tube to the wound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0299">Where the means for fluid cleansing is a two-phase system, e.g. in the form of a dialysis unit, or a biphasic extraction unit, the circulating fluid from the wound and the fluid reservoir passes across one surfaces of a significantly two-dimensional integer, for example a polymer film, sheet or membrane which is selectively permeable to materials deleterious to wound healing.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0472" num="0657">The results indicate that for the elastase+Tris solution there is a 60-70% drop in activity. This can be explained as a dilution effect as the 2 ml of elastase mix with the 1 ml TRIS in the outer chamber (⅔). This indicates that the system is inert to elastase and the complete mixing/diffusion across the membrane occurs within 3 h.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0475" num="0660">The cassette was loaded with one of the following:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0079-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0080-0001" num="0661">a) 5 ml of phosphate buffer saline (PBS),</li> <li id="ul0080-0002" num="0662">b) starch control (40, 120 and 200 mg/ml) or</li> <li id="ul0080-0003" num="0663">c) starch-desferrioxamine (DFO) conjugate (supplied by Biomedical Frontiers Inc.) in solution (40, 120 and 200 mg/ml).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0477" num="0665">Transferrin (10 mg/ml, 35 ml volume) was injected into the sample port and circulated around the flow system by a Masterflex pump (Model No. 7523-37) at different flow rates (0.54, 0.82, 1.08 and 1.35 ml/min) for 8 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0478" num="0666">Samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0479" num="0667">The iron content of the samples was measured using a ferrozine assay as follows: The sample was mixed with 50 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.8 to liberate iron from transferrin. Ascorbate (30 mM) was added to the sample to reduce released Fe (III) ions to Fe (II) ions. Ferrozine (5 mM) was mixed with the sample forming a coloured complex with Fe (II) ion. The absorbance was measured using UNICAM UV4-100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer V3.32 (serial no. 022405).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0480" num="0668">Starch-DFO picked up iron from transferrin in a dose dependent manner over 8 hours. Approximately 20-25% iron removal occurred in the presence of 200 mg/ml of starch-DFO after 8 hours recirculation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0481" num="0669">In the presence of different concentrations of starch control or PBS the iron content of transferrin dropped slightly due to a dilution effect but then slowly returned to normal, suggesting that iron pick-up by starch-DFO was mediated by DFO alone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0482" num="0670">The iron pick-up profile for transferrin was similar at different flow rates suggesting that flow had no effect on iron transfer across the dialysis membrane.</div>
<heading id="h-0014">Example 4—Infusion of Antibiotic from the Second Phase of a Two-Phase System (Moving Second Phase)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0483" num="0671">A two-phase circulation system essentially as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the second (dialysate) circuit essentially as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> was used. The pumps were peristaltic acting on silicone tubing. The second circuit was provided with a reservoir of dialysate with which to modify the wound fluid (50 ml Falcon centrifuge tube). The wound circuit was connected into the ends of a luer-fitting hollow fibre tangential membrane dialysis unit (Spectrum® MicroKros® X14S-100-04N, 8 cm2 surface area, 400 KD Mol. Wt. cut off). The dialysate circuit was connected to the side ports of the same dialysis unit so that flow between the wound circuit and the dialysate circuit were in a counter current direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0484" num="0672">The wound circuit was flushed first with ethanol and then with sterile water as per the manufacturers' instruction. The wound reservoir was filled with 20 ml of sterile water. The wound pump was run at a speed setting of 100, which generated a measured flow rate of 2.09 ml<sup>−1 </sup>in the wound circuit. The dialysate circuit was flushed first with ethanol and then with sterile water as per the manufacturers instruction. The dialysate reservoir was filled with 20 ml of sterile water. The dialysate pump was run at a speed setting of 100, which generated a measured flow rate of 1.93 ml min<sup>−1 </sup>in the dialysate circuit. Samples (1 ml) were removed from the wound and the dialysate reservoirs by means of a length of silicone tube with a luer fitting attached to a 2 ml syringe</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0485" num="0673">At the start of the experiment, 5 ml of sterile water was removed from the dialysate reservoir and 5 ml of a 5 mg ml<sup>−1 </sup>solution of gentamycin sulphate was added (EP standard gentamycin sulphate, CRS; (activity 616 IU mg<sup>−1</sup>)). Both the wound and the dialysate pumps were started at the same time. Samples were removed from the dialysate circuit and the wound circuit at intervals over 230 minutes. No volumes were replaced during the experiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0486" num="0674">Samples (1 ml) were diluted with 2 ml of sterile water and the UV absorbance at 190 nm was checked to get an approximate measure of the movement of gentamycin from the dialysate circuit to the wound circuit using a previously generated standard curve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0487" num="0675">Samples were subsequently analysed with a quantitative zone of inhibition assay for gentamycin activity according to an assay that uses <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis </i>as the indicator bacteria.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">Results and Conclusions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0488" num="0676">The results of the antimicrobial activity-zone of inhibition assays of the fluid show that the level of gentamycin in the wound circuit increases steadily over 230 min with the rate of increase slowing as the levels of drug in the two circuits approach each other. The gentamycin levels in the dialysate circuit show a steady decrease as expected if drug is moving from the dialysate circuit to the wound circuit. At the pressure and flow rates useful in clinical practice, drugs for wound healing can be delivered in acceptable quantities and on an acceptable timescale.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0490" num="0678">Into the internal cavity of separate 15 ml capacity Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes was injected 5 ml of each stock solution:

This was circulated around the first phase circuit. The latter was sampled (1 ml) every hour for 6 h in total into 1.5 ml capacity disposable UV cuvettes. At the end of this period, each aliquot was assayed using a Glutathione Assay Kit (from Calbiochem). Triplicates were averaged and SD determined for each data point. These data were plotted as GSSG concentration versus time for each of the three control systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0017" num="0000">Results &amp; Conclusions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0492" num="0683">GSSG was depleted by the combination of GR and its cofactor NADP to a significantly greater extent than by GR or NADP alone. Thus depletion is not attributable to non-specific binding. Approximately 40% of GSSG was depleted in 6 h at the stated enzyme and cofactor concentrations.</div>
<heading id="h-0018">Example 6—Degradative Removal of Bacterial Autoinducers from a Single-Phase System</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0493" num="0684">The exchange of extra cellular signalling molecules called auto-inducers is used by bacteria and is essential to the co-ordinatation of the expression of key bacterial virulence genes activated at a critical bacterial cell density, and thus to achieving successful bacterial colonization and invasion of tissue. The system is called Quorum Sensing. Conversely, (usually enzymic) degradation or sequestration of the autoinducer species is one way to disrupt the essential communication and aid the prevention of infection in wounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0494" num="0685">The AiiA enzyme is a degrader of the 3-oxododecylhomoserine lactone signal molecule which is used by <i>S. aureus </i>as an autoinducer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0498" num="0689">The AiiA enzyme solution (approx. 1 mg/ml) was added to the polymer support beads and allowed to stand at 4° C. overnight. The coupled beads were washed with pH 8.5 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>/NaCl and stored as a slurry.
