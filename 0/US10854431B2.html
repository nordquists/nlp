<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relate to a plasma processing apparatus, plasma processing method, and computer readable storage medium, used for performing a plasma process on a target substrate, such as a semiconductor substrate.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, in manufacturing semiconductor devices, plasma etching processes, which utilize plasma to etch a layer through a resist mask, are often used for forming a predetermined pattern on a predetermined layer disposed on a target substrate or semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">There are various plasma etching apparatuses for performing such plasma etching, but parallel-plate plasma processing apparatuses of the capacitive coupling type are the ones in mainstream use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a parallel-plate plasma etching apparatus of the capacitive coupling type includes a chamber with parallel-plate electrodes (upper and lower electrodes) disposed therein. While a process gas is supplied into the chamber, an RF (radio frequency) is applied to one of the electrodes to form an electric field between the electrodes. The process gas is turned into plasma by the RF electric field, thereby performing plasma etching on a predetermined layer disposed on a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">More specifically, there is known a plasma etching apparatus in which an RF for plasma generation is applied to the upper electrode to generate plasma, while an RF for ion attraction is applied to the lower electrode (for example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2000-173993 (Patent publication 1)). This plasma etching apparatus can form a suitable plasma state and realize an etching process with high selectivity and high reproducibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, owing to the demands of increased micro-fabrication, the thickness of photo-resist films used as masks is reduced, while the type of photo-resist is shifted from KrF photo-resist (i.e., a photo-resist to be exposed with a laser beam emitted from KrF gas) to ArF photo-resist (i.e., a photo-resist to be exposed with a shorter-wavelength laser beam emitted from ArF gas), which allows formation of pattern opening portions of about 0.13 μm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">However, since the ArF photo-resist has poor plasma resistance properties, its surface becomes rough during etching, which is scarcely caused in the KrF resist. Accordingly, problems arise in that vertical lines (striation) are formed on the inner wall of opening portions, or opening portions are expanded (increase in CD). These problems prevent, along with a small thickness of the photo-resist, etching holes from being formed with good etching selectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, in etching apparatuses of this kind, if the power level of an RF power for plasma generation applied to the upper electrode is too low, deposited substances (deposition) may remain on the upper electrode after etching, thereby varying process characteristics or producing particles. By contrast, if the power level is too high, the electrode may be etched, thereby bringing about process characteristics different from those obtained by a lower power level. The suitable range of power from the RF power supply depends on the process, and the process should not be fluctuated by the power. Further, in serial etching processes, deposition sticking to the chamber wall causes a memory effect in that a previous process leaves some effect that affects a subsequent process. Accordingly, it is preferable to reduce deposition on the chamber wall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, in parallel-plate etching apparatuses of the capacitive coupling type, where the pressure in the chamber is high and the etching gas in use is a negative gas (for example, CxFy or O<sub>2</sub>), the plasma density becomes low at the chamber central portion, which makes it difficult to control the plasma density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">On the other hand, owing to the demands of increased miniaturization and higher speed through interconnection lines in semiconductor devices, use of inter-level insulating films having a low dielectric constant proceeds to reduce the parasitic capacitance of interconnection lines. Of the low dielectric constant films (Low-k films) of this kind, SiOC family films have attracted particularly attention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Where plasma etching is performed on an organic Low-k film, such as an SiOC family film, it is important to ensure a sufficient selectivity between the organic Low-k film and a mask layer or an underlying film of, e.g., silicon nitride. In general, a mixture gas based on a fluorocarbon gas is used as a process gas to provide a relatively high selectivity relative to an underlying film, but it is insufficient as regards selectivity. For this reason, an etching method described below has been proposed in etching an SiOC family film to improve the selectivity relative to a silicon nitride film (for example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2002-270586 (Patent publication 2)). Specifically, plasma etching is performed on an SiOC family inter-level insulating film while a nitride film used as a barrier layer of a Cu interconnection line is utilized as an underlying etching-stopper layer. In this method, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>/Ar/N<sub>2 </sub>is used as a process gas with the flow-rate ratio of Ar set to be 80% or more, thereby improving the selectivity relative to the underlying film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, similarly to Patent publication 2, an etching method described below has been proposed (for example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2004-87875 (Patent publication 3)). Specifically, plasma etching is performed on an SiOC family inter-level insulating film while a silicon nitride film is utilized as an underlying etching-stopper layer. This method comprises a first etching step of using CHF<sub>3</sub>/Ar/N<sub>2 </sub>as a process gas and a second etching step of using C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>/Ar/N<sub>2 </sub>as a process gas, thereby improving the selectivity relative to both of the mask and silicon nitride film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">However, as described above, silicon nitride used for a barrier layer of a Cu interconnection line has good barrier properties, but has a high dielectric constant of 7.0. Accordingly, in order to sufficiently utilize the low dielectric constant property of a Low-k film, such as an SiOC family film, a barrier layer having a still lower dielectric constant is required, the representative of which is silicon carbide (SiC) having a dielectric constant of 3.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Where an SiC barrier layer having a low dielectric constant is used as an underlying etching-stopper layer, it is also necessary to ensure a sufficient etching selectivity to etch a Low-k film or etching target layer disposed thereon. However, according to plasma etching using a fluorocarbon family process gas, as described in Patent publication 2 and Patent publication 3, it is difficult to ensure a sufficient etching selectivity between the Low-k film and SiC layer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the first, second, fourth to sixth, eighth to tenth, twelfth, and thirteenth aspects of the present invention, it is possible to exercise at least one of (1) the effect of increasing the absolute value of a self-bias voltage to the first electrode to sputter the first electrode surface, (2) the effect of expanding the plasma sheath on the first electrode side to press the plasma, (3) the effect of irradiating the target substrate with electrons generated near the first electrode, (4) the effect of controlling the plasma potential, (5) the effect of increasing the electron (plasma) density, and (6) the effect of increasing the plasma density at the central portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">With the effect (1) described above, even if polymers derived from a process gas and a photo-resist are deposited on the surface of the first electrode, the polymers are sputtered, thereby cleaning up the surface of the first electrode. Further, an optimum quantity of polymers can be supplied onto the substrate, thereby canceling the surface roughness of the photo-resist film. Further, since the body of the electrode is sputtered, the electrode material can be supplied onto the substrate, thereby reinforcing an organic mask made of, e.g., a photo-resist film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">With the effect (2) described above, the effective residence time above the target substrate is decreased, and the plasma concentrates above the target substrate with less diffusion, thereby reducing the dissociation space. In this case, dissociation of a fluorocarbon family process gas is suppressed for an organic mask made of, e.g., a photo-resist film to be less etched. Further, with the effect (3) described above, the composition of a mask on the target substrate is reformed and the roughness of the photo-resist film is cancelled. Further, since the target substrate is irradiated with electrons at a high velocity, the shading effect is suppressed and micro-fabrication is thereby improved on the target substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">With the effect (4) described above, the plasma potential can be suitably controlled to prevent etching by-products from being deposited on members inside the process chamber, such as the electrodes, chamber wall (e.g., deposition shield), and insulating members.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">With the effect (5) described above, the etching rate (etching speed) on the target substrate is improved. With the effect (6) described above, even where the pressure inside the process chamber is high and the etching gas employed is a negative gas, the plasma density is prevented from being lower at the central portion than at the peripheral portion within the process chamber (suppressing generation of negative ions), so as to control the plasma density to be more uniform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">As a consequence, the plasma resistance property of an organic mask layer made of, e.g., a resist layer remains high, so that the etching can be performed with high selectivity. Alternatively, the electrodes can be effectively free from deposited substances. Alternatively, the etching can be performed on the target substrate at a high rate or uniformly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">According to the third, seventh, and eleventh aspects of the present invention, it is possible to obtain the effect of controlling the plasma potential. As a consequence, the plasma potential call be suitably controlled to prevent etching by-products from being deposited on members inside the process chamber, such as the electrodes, chamber wall (e.g., deposition shield), and insulating members.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out hereinafter.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">An embodiment 1 will be explained first. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view schematically showing a plasma etching apparatus according to the embodiment 1 of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">This plasma etching apparatus is structured as a parallel-plate plasma etching apparatus of the capacitive coupling type. The apparatus includes a cylindrical chamber (process chamber) <b>10</b>, which is made of, e.g., aluminum with an anodization-processed surface. The chamber <b>10</b> is protectively grounded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">A columnar susceptor pedestal <b>14</b> is disposed on the bottom of the chamber <b>10</b> through an insulating plate <b>12</b> made of, e.g., a ceramic. A susceptor <b>16</b> made of, e.g., aluminum is disposed on the susceptor pedestal <b>14</b>. The susceptor <b>16</b> is used as a lower electrode, on which a target substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer W, is placed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">The susceptor <b>16</b> is provided with an electrostatic chuck <b>18</b> on the top, for holding the semiconductor wafer W by an electrostatic attraction force. The electrostatic chuck <b>18</b> comprises an electrode <b>20</b> made of a conductive film, and a pair of insulating layers or insulating sheets sandwiching the electrode <b>20</b>. The electrode <b>20</b> is electrically connected to a direct current (DC) power supply <b>22</b>. The semiconductor wafer W is attracted and held on the electrostatic chuck <b>18</b> by an electrostatic attraction force, e.g., a Coulomb force, generated by a DC voltage applied from the DC power supply <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">A conductive focus ring (correction ring) <b>24</b> made of, e.g., silicon is disposed on the top of the susceptor <b>16</b> to surround the electrostatic chuck <b>18</b> (and the semiconductor wafer W) to improve etching uniformity. A cylindrical inner wall member <b>26</b> made of, e.g., quartz is attached to the side of the susceptor <b>16</b> and susceptor pedestal <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">The susceptor pedestal <b>14</b> is provided with a cooling medium space <b>28</b> formed therein and annularly extending therethrough. A cooling medium set at a predetermined temperature, such as cooling water, is circulated within the cooling medium space <b>28</b> from a chiller unit (not shown) through lines <b>30</b> <i>a </i>and <b>30</b> <i>b</i>. The temperature of the cooling medium is set to control the process temperature of the semiconductor wafer W placed on the susceptor <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">Further, a heat transmission gas, such as He gas, is supplied from a heat transmission gas supply unit (not shown), through a gas supply line <b>32</b>, into the interstice between the top surface of the electrostatic chuck <b>18</b> and the bottom surface of the semiconductor wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">An upper electrode <b>34</b> is disposed above the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b> in parallel with the susceptor. The space between the electrodes <b>16</b> and <b>34</b> is used as a plasma generation space. The upper electrode <b>34</b> defines a surface facing the semiconductor wafer W placed on the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b>, and thus this facing surface is in contact with the plasma generation space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">The upper electrode <b>34</b> is supported at the top of the chamber <b>10</b> by an insulating shield member <b>42</b>. The upper electrode <b>34</b> includes an electrode plate <b>36</b> defining the facing surface opposite the susceptor <b>16</b> and having a number of gas delivery holes <b>37</b>, and an electrode support <b>38</b> detachably supporting the electrode plate <b>36</b>. The electrode support <b>38</b> is made of a conductive material, such as aluminum with an anodization-processed surface, and has a water-cooling structure. The electrode plate <b>36</b> is preferably made of a conductor or semiconductor having a low resistivity and thus generating less Joule heat. Further, in order to reinforce a resist film, as described later, the electrode plate <b>36</b> is preferably made of a silicon-containing substance. In light of these factors, the electrode plate <b>36</b> is preferably made of silicon or SiC. The electrode support <b>38</b> has a as diffusion cell <b>40</b> formed therein, which is connected to the gas delivery holes <b>37</b> through a number of gas flow channels <b>41</b> extending downward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Further, the electrode support <b>38</b> has a gas feed port <b>62</b> formed therein for feeding a process gas into the gas diffusion cell <b>40</b>. The gas feed port <b>62</b> is connected to a process gas supply source <b>66</b> through a gas supply line <b>64</b>. The gas supply line <b>64</b> is provided with a mass-flow controller (MFC) <b>68</b> and a switching valve <b>70</b> disposed thereon in this order from the upstream (an FCN may be used in place of the MFC). A process gas for etching, such as a fluorocarbon gas (CxFy), e.g., C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>gas, is supplied from the process gas supply source <b>66</b> through the gas supply line <b>64</b> into the gas diffusion cell <b>40</b>. Then, the process gas flows through the gas flow channels <b>41</b> and is delivered from the gas delivery holes <b>37</b> into the plasma generation space, as in a shower device. Accordingly, in other words, the upper electrode <b>34</b> functions as a showerhead for supplying a process gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">The upper electrode <b>34</b> is electrically connected to a first RF power supply <b>48</b> through a matching unit <b>46</b> and a feed rod <b>44</b>. The first RF power supply <b>48</b> outputs an RF power with a frequency of 13.56 MHz or more, such as 60 MHz. The matching unit <b>46</b> is arranged to match the load impedance with the internal (or output) impedance of the first RF power supply <b>48</b>. When plasma is generated within the chamber <b>10</b>, the matching unit <b>44</b> performs control for the load impedance and the output impedance of the first RF power supply <b>48</b> to apparently agree with each other. The output terminal of the matching unit <b>46</b> is connected to the top of the feed rod <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Further, the upper electrode <b>34</b> is electrically connected to a variable DC power supply <b>50</b> in addition to the first RF power supply <b>48</b>. The variable DC power supply <b>50</b> may be formed of a bipolar power supply.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">When an etching process is performed in the plasma etching apparatus described above, the gate valve <b>86</b> is first opened, and a semiconductor wafer W to be etched is transferred into the chamber <b>10</b> and placed on the susceptor <b>16</b>. Then, a process gas for etching is supplied from the process gas supply source <b>66</b> into the gas diffusion cell <b>40</b> at a predetermined flow rate, and then supplied into the chamber <b>10</b> through the gas flow channels <b>41</b> and gas delivery holes <b>37</b>. At the same time, the interior of the chamber <b>10</b> is exhausted by the exhaust unit <b>84</b> to set the pressure inside the chamber <b>10</b> to be a predetermined value within a range of, e.g., 0.1 to 150 Pa. The process gas may be selected from various gases conventionally employed, and preferably is a gas containing a halogen element, a representative of which is a fluorocarbon gas (CxFy), such as C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>gas. Further, the process gas may contain another gas, such as Ar gas or O<sub>2 </sub>gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">While the etching gas is supplied into the chamber <b>10</b>, an RF power for plasma generation is applied from the first RF power supply <b>48</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b> at a predetermined power level. At the same time, an RF for ion attraction is applied from the second RF power supply <b>90</b> to the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b> at a predetermined power level. Also, a predetermined DC voltage is applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to upper electrode <b>34</b>. Further, a DC voltage is applied from the DC power supply <b>22</b> to the electrode <b>20</b> of the electrostatic chuck <b>18</b> to fix the semiconductor wafer W on the susceptor <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">The process gas delivered from the gas delivery holes <b>37</b> formed in the electrode plate <b>36</b> of the upper electrode <b>34</b> is turned into plasma by glow discharge caused by the RF power applied across the upper electrode <b>34</b> and the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b>. Radicals and ions generated in this plasma are used to etch the target surface of the semiconductor wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">As described above, a first RF power for plasma generation is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> to adjust the plasma density. At the same time, a second RF power for ion attraction is applied to the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b> to adjust the voltage. As a consequence, the plasma control margin can be set broader.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">In this embodiment, when plasma is generated, the upper electrode <b>34</b> is supplied with an RF power within a range covering high frequencies (for example, 10 MHz or more). As a consequence, the plasma density is increased with a preferable state, so that high density plasma is generated even under a low pressure condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">When the plasma is thus generated, a DC voltage with a predetermined polarity and value is applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b>. At this time, the application electrode or upper electrode <b>34</b> is preferably set to have a self bias voltage V<sub>dc </sub>on the surface, at a level for obtaining a predetermined (moderate) sputtering effect onto the surface, i.e., the surface of the electrode plate <b>36</b>. In other words, the application voltage from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is preferably controlled by the controller <b>51</b> to increase the absolute value of V<sub>dc </sub>on the surface of the upper electrode <b>34</b>. Where the RF power applied from the first RF power supply <b>48</b> is low, polymers are deposited on the upper electrode <b>34</b>. However, since a suitable DC voltage is applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b>, polymers deposited on the upper electrode <b>34</b> are sputtered, thereby cleaning up the surface of the upper electrode <b>34</b>. Further, an optimum quantity of polymers can be supplied onto the semiconductor wafer W, thereby canceling the surface roughness of the photo-resist film. Where the voltage applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is adjusted to sputter the body of the upper electrode <b>34</b>, the electrode material can be supplied onto the surface of the semiconductor wafer W. In this case, the photo-resist film is provided with carbide formed on the surface, and is thereby reinforced. Further, the sputtered electrode material reacts with F contained in a fluorocarbon family process gas and is exhausted, thereby reducing the F ratio in plasma for the photo-resist film to be less etched. Particularly, where the electrode plate <b>36</b> is made of a silicon-containing material, such as silicon or SiC, sputtered silicon from the surface of the electrode plate <b>36</b> reacts with polymers, so the photo-resist film is provided with SiC formed on the surface, and is thereby remarkably reinforced. In addition to this, Si is highly reactive with F, and the effects described above are enhanced. Accordingly, a silicon-containing material is preferably used as a material of the electrode plate <b>36</b>. It should be noted that, in this case, the application current or application power may be controlled in place of the application voltage from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">The DC voltage thus applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> to make a deep self bias voltage V<sub>dc</sub>, as described above, increases the length of a plasma sheath formed on the upper electrode <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As the length of the plasma sheath is increased, the plasma is further pressed by that much. For example, where no DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, V<sub>dc </sub>on the upper electrode side becomes, e.g., −300V. In this case, the plasma sheath has a small length d<sub>0</sub>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. On the other hand, where a DC voltage of −900V is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, V<sub>dc </sub>on the upper electrode side becomes −900V. In this case, since the length of the plasma sheath is in proportion to ¾ of the absolute value of V<sub>dc</sub>, the plasma sheath has a larger length d<sub>1</sub>, and the plasma is pressed by that much, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Where the length of the plasma sheath is thus increased to suitably press the plasma, the effective residence time above the semiconductor wafer W is decreased. Further, the plasma concentrates above the wafer W with less diffusion, thereby reducing the dissociation space. In this case, dissociation of a fluorocarbon family process gas is suppressed for the photo-resist film to be less etched. Accordingly, the application voltage from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is preferably controlled by the controller <b>51</b>, such that the length of the plasma sheath on the upper electrode <b>34</b> is increased to a level for forming desired pressed plasma. It should be noted that, also in this case, the application current or application power may be controlled in place of the application voltage from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Further, when the plasma is formed, electrons are generated near the upper electrode <b>34</b>. When a DC voltage is applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, electrons are accelerated in the vertical direction within the process space due to the potential difference between the applied DC voltage value and plasma potential. In other words, the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> can be set at a desired polarity, voltage value, and current value, to irradiate the semiconductor wafer W with electrons. The radiated electrons reform the composition of the mask or photo-resist film to reinforce the film. Accordingly, the application voltage value and application current value from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> can be used to control the quantity of electrons generated near the upper electrode <b>34</b> and the acceleration voltage for accelerating the electrons toward the wafer W, so that the photo-resist film is reinforced in a predetermined manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">Particularly, where the photo-resist film on the semiconductor wafer W is a photo-resist film (which will be referred to as an ArF resist film) for an ArF excimer laser (with a wavelength of 193 nm), the ArF resist film changes its polymer structure through reactions shown in the following chemical formulas (1) and (2), and is then irradiated with electrons, thereby arriving at the structure shown on the right side of the following chemical formula (3). In this case, by the irradiation with electrons, the composition of the ArF resist film is reformed (resist cross-linkage reaction), as shown in a portion d of the chemical formula (3). Since this portion d has a function of greatly enhancing the etching resistance property (plasma resistance property), the etching resistance property of the ArF resist film remarkably increases. As a consequence, the surface roughness of the ArF resist film is suppressed, and the etching selectivity of an etching target layer relative to the ArF resist film is increased.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">Accordingly, the application voltage value or current value from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is preferably controlled by the controller <b>51</b> to enhance the etching resistance property of the photo-resist film (particularly, ArF resist film) by irradiation with electrons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">Further, as described above, when a DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, electrons generated near the upper electrode <b>34</b> in plasma generation are accelerated in the vertical direction within the process space. The polarity, voltage value, and current value of the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> can be set at predetermined conditions, so that electrons reach into holes formed on the semiconductor wafer W. As a consequence, the shading effect is suppressed to obtain a good processed shape without bowing, while improving the uniformity of the processed shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">It is assumed that electron current amount I<sub>DC </sub>due to the DC voltage is used as the quantity of electrons incident on the wafer W, where the acceleration voltage of electrons is controlled. In this case, where I<sub>ion </sub>is ion current amount incident on the wafer from plasma, it is preferable to satisfy I<sub>DC</sub>&gt;(½)I<sub>ion</sub>. Since I<sub>ion</sub>=Zρv<sub>ion</sub>e (where, Z is charge number, ρ is current velocity density, v<sub>ion </sub>is ion velocity, and e is electron charge amount 1.6×10<sup>−19</sup>C), and ρ is in proportion to electron density Ne, I<sub>ion </sub>is in proportion to Ne.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">As described above, the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> can be controlled, so as to exercise the sputtering function onto the upper electrode <b>34</b> and the plasma pressing function, as well as the supply function of supplying a large quantity of electrons generated at the upper electrode <b>34</b> to the semiconductor wafer W, as described above. This arrangement makes it possible to reinforce the photo-resist film, supply optimum polymers, and suppress dissociation of the process gas. As a consequence, the surface roughness of the photo-resist is suppressed, and the etching selectivity of an etching target layer relative to the photo-resist film is increased. Further, the CD of an opening portion formed in the photo-resist film is prevented from expanding, thereby realizing pattern formation with high accuracy. Particularly, these effects are more enhanced by controlling the DC voltage to suitably exercise the three functions described above, i.e., the sputtering function, plasma pressing function, and electron supply function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">It should be noted that, it depends on process conditions or the like to determine which one of the functions described above is predominant. The voltage applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is preferably controlled by the controller <b>51</b> to exercise one or more of the functions to effectively obtain the corresponding effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">Next, an explanation will be give of the result of a case where the functions described above were utilized to improve the selectivity of an SiO<sub>2 </sub>film disposed as an etching target film relative to a photo-resist film. In this case, the electrode plate <b>36</b> of the upper electrode <b>34</b> was made of silicon, an RF power with a frequency of 60 MHz was applied at 100 to 3,000W from the first RF power supply <b>48</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, an RF power with a frequency of 2 MHz was applied at 4,500W from the second RF power supply <b>90</b> to the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b>, and the etching gas was C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>6</sub>/Ar/O<sub>2</sub>. Under these conditions, the application voltage from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> was set at different values to measure change in etching rates for the photo-resist film and SiO<sub>2 </sub>film and change in selectivity of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film relative to the photo-resist film. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the results. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as the absolute value of the negative DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> increases, the selectivity of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film relative to the photo-resist film becomes higher. Where the absolute value is larger than that of −600V, the selectivity rapidly increases. Accordingly, it has been confirmed that the selectivity of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>film relative to the photo-resist film is remarkably improved where a negative DC voltage with an absolute value larger than that of −600V is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">The DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> can be adjusted to control the plasma potential. In this case, etching by-products can be prevented from being deposited on the upper electrode <b>34</b>, the deposition shield <b>11</b> forming a part of the chamber wall, the inner wall member <b>26</b>, and the insulating shield member <b>42</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">If etching by-products are deposited on the upper electrode <b>34</b> or the deposition shield <b>11</b> forming the chamber wall, a problem may arise in that the process characteristics change or particles are generated. Particularly, there is involving sequentially etching a multi-layered film, such as that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in which an Si-organic film (SiOC) <b>101</b>, SiN film <b>102</b>, SiO<sub>2 </sub>film <b>103</b>, and photo-resist <b>104</b> are laminated on a semiconductor wafer W in this order. In this case, since suitable etching conditions are different for the respective films, a memory effect may occur in that a previous process leaves some effect that affects a subsequent process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">The amount of deposition of etching by-products described above depends on the potential difference between the plasma and the upper electrode <b>34</b>, chamber wall, or the like. Accordingly, deposition of etching products can be suppressed by controlling the plasma potential.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view showing change in plasma potential waveforms where a DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a view showing the relationship between the DC voltage value applied to the upper electrode and the maximum value of the plasma potential. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, where a negative DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, the maximum value of the plasma potential becomes lower with increase in the absolute value of the voltage. Accordingly, the plasma potential can be controlled by the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>. This is so, because, where the upper electrode <b>34</b> is supplied with a DC voltage with an absolute value larger than a self bias (V<sub>dc</sub>) obtained by an RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, the absolute value of V<sub>dc </sub>becomes larger, thereby lowering the plasma potential. More specifically, the value of the plasma potential has been determined by raise given by the upper electrode to the plasma potential. However, where a negative voltage with a high absolute value is applied to the upper electrode, the entire voltage amplitude on the upper electrode comes into the negative potential side. In this case, the plasma potential is determined by the potential of the wall, and thus becomes lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">As described above, the voltage applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b> can be controlled to lower the plasma potential. As a consequence, etching by-products can be prevented from being deposited on the upper electrode <b>34</b>, the deposition shield <b>11</b> forming a part of the chamber wall, and the insulating members (members <b>26</b> and <b>42</b>) inside the chamber <b>10</b>. The plasma potential Vp is preferably set at a value within a range of 80V≤Vp≤200V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">Further, the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> can be controlled to effectively exercise the plasma potential control function, in addition to the sputtering function onto upper electrode <b>34</b>, plasma pressing function, and electron supply function, as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">Further, the applied DC voltage contributes to formation of plasma, as another effect obtained by the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>. In this case, the plasma density can be higher and the etching rate is thereby increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">This is so, because, the negative DC voltage applied to the upper electrode hinders electrons from entering the upper electrode and thus suppresses extinction of electrons. Further, where the negative DC voltage accelerates ions onto the upper electrode, electrons are emitted from the electrode. These electrons are accelerated at a high velocity due to the difference between the plasma potential and application voltage value, and ionize neutral gas (turn the gas into plasma), thereby increasing the electron density (plasma density).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">Further, when plasma is generated, the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> relatively increases the plasma density at the central portion due to plasma diffusion. Where the pressure inside the chamber <b>10</b> is high and the etching gas is a negative gas, the plasma density tends to be lower at the central portion of the chamber <b>10</b>. However, since the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> increases the plasma density at the central portion, the plasma density can be controlled to perform uniform etching. It should be noted that, since the etching characteristics cannot be defined only by the plasma density, a plasma density with higher uniformity does not necessarily improve the etching uniformity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">The reason for this will be explained, with reference to experiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">In the apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a semiconductor wafer was loaded into the chamber and placed on the susceptor, and a BARC (organic anti-reflection film) and an etching target film were etched. When the BARC was etched, the first RF power was set at 2,500W, the second RF power was set at 2,000W, and the process gas employed was CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, CHF<sub>3</sub>, Ar, and O<sub>2</sub>. When the etching target film was etched to form a hole, the first RF power was set at 1,500W, the second RF power was set at 4,500W, and the process gas employed was CH<sub>4</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, Ar, and O<sub>2</sub>. At this time, the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode was set at different values of −800V, −1,000V, and −1,200V. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows distributions of electron density (plasma density) in the radial direction obtained in this case. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, as the absolute value of the DC voltage increases from −800V to −1,200V, the electron density increases at the center, which improves the plasma density uniformity. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10C</figref> schematically show etched shapes at the center and edge obtained in this case. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10C</figref>, as the DC voltage changes from −800V to −1,000V, the etching uniformity is improved. On the other hand, as the DC voltage changes from −1,000V to −1,200V, although the electron density uniformity is improved, the etching performance becomes too high at the center and thus the etching uniformity is deteriorated. Accordingly, it has been confirmed that the etching uniformity is the best at −1,000V. In any case, the DC voltage can be adjusted to perform uniform etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">As described above, the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> can be controlled to effectively exercise at least one of the above-described sputtering function onto the upper electrode <b>34</b>, plasma pressing function, electron supply function, plasma potential control function, electron density (plasma density) increase function, and plasma density control function.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">An explanation will be given of an experiment performed to confirm this matter. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a graph showing the relationship between the self-bias voltage V<sub>dc </sub>generated on the surface of the upper electrode <b>34</b> and the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, where the RF power for plasma generation (60 MHz) applied from the first RF power supply <b>48</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b> is set at different power values. In this case, the self-bias voltage V<sub>dc </sub>generated on the surface of the upper electrode <b>34</b> was measured while plasma was generated under the following conditions. Specifically, the pressure inside the chamber was set at 2.7 Pa, the RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> at different values of 650W, 1,100W, and 2,200W, the RF power applied to the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b> at 2,100W, the process gas flow rates of C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>6</sub>/Ar/O<sub>2 </sub>at 25/700/26 mL/min, the distance between the upper and lower electrodes at 25 mm, the back pressure (central portion/edge portion) at 1,333/4,666 Pa, the temperature of the upper electrode <b>34</b> at 60° C., the sidewall temperature of the chamber <b>10</b> at 50° C., and the temperature of the susceptor <b>16</b> at 0° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">As shown in the graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the application DC voltage is effective where it is higher than the self-bias voltage V<sub>dc </sub>on the upper electrode <b>34</b>, and, as the RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> is higher, the generated negative self-bias voltage V<sub>dc </sub>is larger. Accordingly, the application DC voltage is required to be a negative voltage with an absolute value larger than the self-bias voltage V<sub>dc </sub>generated by the RF power. To reiterate, it has been confirmed that the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> is preferably set to have an absolute value at least larger than the self-bias voltage V<sub>dc </sub>generated on the upper electrode.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">Incidentally, where a DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, electrons may accumulate on the upper electrode <b>34</b> and thereby cause abnormal electric discharge between the upper electrode <b>34</b> and the inner wall of the chamber <b>10</b>. In order to suppress such abnormal electric discharge, this embodiment includes the GND block (conductive member) <b>91</b> as a part grounded in the sense of DC, which is disposed on the deposition shield <b>11</b> that constitutes the chamber wall. The GND block <b>91</b> is exposed to plasma, and is electrically connected to a conductive portion in the deposition shield <b>11</b>. The DC voltage current applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b> flows through the process space to the GND block <b>91</b>, and is then grounded through the deposition shield <b>11</b>. The GND block <b>91</b> is made of a conductor, and preferably a silicon-containing substance, such as Si or SiC. The GND block <b>91</b> may be preferably made of C. The GND block <b>91</b> allows electrons accumulated in the upper electrode <b>34</b> to be released, thereby preventing abnormal electric discharge. The GND block <b>91</b> preferably has a protruding length of 10 mm or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Further, in order to prevent abnormal electric discharge, it may be effective to use a method of superposing very short periodic pulses of the opposite polarity, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, by a suitable means, with the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, so as to neutralize electrons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">The position of the GND block <b>91</b> is not limited to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as long as it is disposed in the plasma generation area. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the GND block <b>91</b> may be disposed on the susceptor <b>16</b> side, e.g., around the susceptor <b>16</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the GND block <b>91</b> may be disposed near the upper electrode <b>34</b>, e.g., as a ring disposed outside the upper electrode <b>34</b>. However, when plasma is generated, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or a polymer that covers the deposition shield <b>11</b> or the like flies out and may be deposited on the GND block <b>91</b>. In this case, the GND block <b>91</b> cannot maintain the grounding performance any more in the sense of DC, and thus hardly exercises the effect of preventing abnormal electric discharge. Accordingly, it is important to prevent such deposition. For this reason, the GND block <b>91</b> is preferably located at a position remote from members covered with Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or the like, but preferably near parts made of an Si-containing substance, such as Si or quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>). For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, an Si-containing member <b>93</b> is preferably disposed near the GND block <b>91</b>. In this case, the length L of a portion of the Si-containing member <b>93</b> below the GND block <b>91</b> is preferably set to be equal to or longer than the protruding length M of the GND block <b>91</b>. Further, in order to prevent the function from being deteriorated due to deposition of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or a polymer, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, it is effective to form a recess <b>91</b> <i>a </i>in the GND block <b>91</b> where flying substances are hardly deposited. It is also effective to increase the surface are of the GND block <b>91</b>, so that it cannot be entirely covered with Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or a polymer. Further, in order to suppress deposition, it is effective to increase the temperature. In this respect, the upper electrode <b>34</b> is supplied with an RF power for plasma generation, and thus increases the temperature around it. Accordingly, the GND block <b>91</b> is preferably disposed near the upper electrode <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, to increase the temperature and thereby prevent deposition. Particularly in this case, the GND block <b>91</b> is preferably disposed as a ring outside the upper electrode <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">In order to more effectively remove the influence of deposition on the GND block <b>91</b>, due to Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or a polymer flying out from the deposition shield <b>11</b> and so forth, it is effective to make a negative DC voltage applicable to the GND block <b>91</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Specifically, where a negative DC voltage is applied to the GND block <b>91</b>, deposition sticking thereto is sputtered or etched, so as to clean the surface of the GND block <b>91</b>.

Further, a grounded conductive auxiliary member <b>91</b> <i>b </i>is disposed to receive flow of a DC electron current generated by a negative DC voltage applied to the GND block <b>91</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">Accordingly, cleaning is then performed to remove this deposition.

As a consequence, a DC electron current flows from the GND block <b>91</b> into the conductive auxiliary member <b>91</b> <i>b</i>. On the other hand, positive ions flow into the GND block <b>91</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the second switch <b>53</b> <i>b </i>may be set in the OFF state during a partial period of plasma etching, so that the GND block <b>91</b> is in a floating state.

Specifically, the arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> may be adopted, in which the GND block <b>91</b> is set to have a relatively large area, and the surface of the GND block <b>91</b> to be in contact with plasma is partly covered with a mask member <b>111</b> movable in the arrow direction. This cover plate <b>111</b> is movable, so that a portion to be exposed to plasma can be changed on the surface of the GND block <b>91</b>. In this case, although a driving mechanism disposed in the chamber <b>10</b> may cause a problem about particle generation, it cannot be serious because the frequency of use of the driving mechanism is as low as once in 100 hours. Further, for example, the arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> may be effective, in which a columnar GND block <b>191</b> is rotatably disposed, and the outer periphery surface of the GND block <b>191</b> is covered with a mask member <b>112</b>, so that it is partially exposed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">In practical use, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, it is preferable to use a cover film <b>113</b> <i>a </i>in which a number of thin layers <b>114</b> are stacked while the layers are gradually shifted.

The number of layers <b>114</b> is preferably set to make the service life of the GND block <b>91</b> longer than the frequency of maintenance. Further, in order to improve the maintenance performance, one layer <b>114</b> <i>a </i>is provided with a different color from the others, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, so that it is possible to know the time to replace the GND block <b>91</b> with a new one, by this film <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, for example, when the surface area of this film <b>114</b> <i>a </i>exceeds a certain value.</div>

For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, three GND blocks <b>91</b> are disposed and only one of them is selectively grounded by a shift switch <b>115</b>. Further, a current sensor <b>117</b> is disposed on a common ground line <b>116</b> to monitor a DC current flowing therethrough. The current sensor <b>117</b> is used to monitor a current flowing through a grounded GND block <b>91</b>, and when the current value becomes lower than a predetermined value, it is determined that this GND block <b>91</b> cannot exercise the grounding performance, and thus the connection is switched from this one to another GND block <b>91</b>. The number of GND blocks <b>91</b> is suitably selected from a range of about 3 to 10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">In the example described above, a GND block not grounded is in an electrically floating state, but such a GND block may be supplied with an electric potential for protection to protect a GND block in an idle state, in place of use of the shift switch <b>115</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows an example designed in this aspect. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, each of ground lines <b>118</b> respectively connected to GND blocks <b>91</b> is provided with a variable DC power supply <b>119</b>. In this case, the voltage of a GND block <b>91</b> to exercise a grounding performance is set at 0V by controlling the voltage of the corresponding variable DC power supply <b>119</b>. Further, the voltage of each of the other GND blocks <b>91</b> is set at, e.g., 100V to prevent an electric current from flowing therethrough by controlling the voltage of the corresponding variable DC power supply <b>119</b>. When the current value detected thereby becomes lower than a predetermined value at the current sensor <b>117</b> on the ground line <b>118</b> connected to a GND block <b>91</b> to exercise a grounding performance, it is determined that this GND block <b>91</b> cannot exercise the grounding performance. Accordingly, the voltage of the variable DC power supply <b>119</b> corresponding to another GND block <b>91</b> is controlled to be a value for this GND block <b>91</b> to exercise a grounding performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">As described above, where the application voltage from a DC power supply <b>119</b> is set at a negative value of about −1 kV, the GND block <b>91</b> connected thereto can function as an electrode to apply a DC voltage to plasma. However, if this value is too large, the plasma is affected. Further, the voltage applied to the GND block <b>91</b> can be controlled to obtain a cleaning effect on the GND block <b>91</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">Next, a detailed explanation will be given of plasma obtained by superposing the RF power and DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, according to this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is a view showing the electron temperature distribution of plasma, where the horizontal axis denotes the electron temperature and the vertical axis denotes the plasma intensity. In order to obtain high density plasma, it is effective to use an RF power with a relatively high frequency that ions cannot follow, such as 13.56 MHz or more, as described above. However, in the case of the electron temperature distribution of plasma (RF plasma) obtained by an RF power application, an intensity peak appears within an excitation domain having lower electron temperature, as indicated by a line A (case A) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. As the power is increased to obtain a higher plasma density, the intensity becomes higher within a dissociation domain having middle electron temperature. As a consequence, dissociation of a fluorocarbon gas (CxFy), such as C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>gas, used as the etching process gas, proceeds, thereby deteriorating etching characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">On the other hand, the electron temperature distribution of plasma (DC plasma) obtained by a DC voltage application is indicated by a line B (case B) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. In this case, the plasma density is almost equal to that corresponding to the line A (case A), but an intensity peak appears within an ionization domain having higher electron temperature, while essentially no distribution part is present within the excitation domain or dissociation domain. Where a DC voltage is superposed on an RF power of 13.56 MHz or more, a high plasma density can be obtained without increasing the power level of the RF power. Further, the plasma thus formed is polarized such that the electron temperature has intensity peaks within the excitation domain and ionization domain. This brings about ideal plasma that can reduce dissociation of the process gas with the same plasma density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">This arrangement will be specifically explained further with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is a view showing the electron temperature distribution of plasma obtained by solely using an RF power, in comparison with that obtained by superposing a DC voltage on an RF power. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, a line C shows a case where an RF power with a frequency of 60 MHz was applied at 2,400W to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, while an RF power with a frequency of 2 MHz for attracting ions was applied at 1,000W to the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b>. On the other hand, a line D shows a case where RF powers of 60 MHz and 2 MHz were also respectively applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> and susceptor <b>16</b>, and a DC voltage was further applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>. In the case of the line D, the RF power and DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> were respectively set at 300W and −900V to obtain the same plasma density as that of the case of the line C. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, where the DC voltage is superposed, high density plasma is formed at this same density while being polarized with almost no part of the electron temperature distribution within the dissociation domain. In this case, the electron temperature distribution can be controlled to obtain a more suitable plasma state by changing the frequency and power level of the RF power and the value of the DC voltage, both of which are applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">As described above, as the frequency of the RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> is lower, the plasma has a higher energy and V<sub>dc </sub>is increased. In this case, dissociation of the process gas is promoted, thus the control margin concerning the DC voltage application becomes narrower. However, where the frequency of the RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> is set at 40 MHz or more, e.g., 60 MHz, the plasma has a lower energy, and thus the control margin concerning the DC voltage application becomes broader. Accordingly, the frequency of the RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> is preferably set at 40 MHz or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">Next, an explanation will be given of a bias RF power for attracting ions, applied to the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b>. The RF power applied from second RF power supply <b>90</b> to the susceptor <b>16</b> is a bias RF power for attracting ions, which can provide different effects depending on whether the frequency (RF application frequency) is less than 10 MHz or 10 MHz or more. Specifically, where the RF application frequency is less than 10 MHz, e.g., 2 MHz, ions can follow the RF application frequency, in general. In this case, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref>, the ion energy incident on the wafer corresponds to the wafer potential, which varies in accordance with the RF power voltage waveform. On the other hand, where the bias RF frequency is 10 MHz or more, e.g., 13.56 MHz, ions cannot follow the RF application frequency, in general. In this case, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref>, the ion energy incident on the wafer depends not on the wafer potential, but on V<sub>dc</sub>. In the case of a frequency (e.g., 2 MHz) that ions can follow, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref>, the ion maximum energy corresponds to Vpp. Further, at a portion where the difference between the plasma potential and wafer potential is smaller, the ion energy becomes smaller. In this case, as indicated by a line E in the ion energy distribution shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the ion energy on the wafer is polarized and broader. On the other hand, in the case of a frequency (e.g., 13.56 MHz) that ions cannot follow, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref>, the ion energy corresponds to V<sub>dc </sub>without reference to the wafer potential. In this case, as indicated by a line F in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the ion energy on the wafer takes on the maximum value near a portion corresponding to V<sub>dc</sub>, while almost no ions have a higher energy than V<sub>dc</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">Accordingly, a frequency of less than 10 MHz that ions can follow is suitable where higher ion energy is required to increase productivity. On the other hand, a frequency of 10 MHz or more that ions cannot follow is suitable where lower ion energy is required, such as a case where the surface roughness of a mask is critical. Accordingly, the frequency of the bias RF power is preferably selected in accordance with the intended purpose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">In the examples described above, a DC voltage is applied to exercise the sputtering function on the upper electrode <b>34</b>, plasma pressing function, electron supply function, and so forth, but an AC voltage can provide the same effects. However, the frequency of the AC voltage is set to be smaller than the frequency of an RF power for plasma generation. In either of the cases using the DC voltage and AC voltage, the voltage may be pulsed or modulated, such as AM modulation or FM modulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">Incidentally, there is a case where a low dielectric constant barrier layer made of SiC is used as an underlying etching-stopper layer to etch a Low-k film or etching target layer on the upper side. According to the prior art, it is difficult to ensure a sufficient etching selectivity at this time. In this respect, the plasma etching apparatus according to this embodiment is used to perform etching, while a DC voltage is superposed with a first RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, so as to effectively exercise the functions described above. As a consequence, a Low-k film, such as an SiOC film, used as an insulating film can be etched at a high etching selectivity relative to an underlying etching-stopper layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A and 32B</figref> show a wafer sectional structure used as a typical etching target in this etching. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A</figref>, this wafer W includes an underlying film or SiC layer <b>201</b>, an insulating film or SiOC family film <b>202</b>, an SiO<sub>2 </sub>film <b>203</b>, and an anti-reflection film or BARC <b>204</b> stacked from the under side in this order. Further, an etching mask or ArF resist <b>205</b> patterned in a predetermined shape is disposed on the anti-reflection film <b>204</b>. The SiOC family film <b>202</b> is a Low-k film containing Si, O, C, and H as components, the representatives of which are, e.g., SiLK (Trade name; Dow Chemical Ltd.), MSQ of SOD-SiOCH (methyl-silsesqui-siloxane), CORAL of CVD-SiOCH (Trade name; Novellus Systems Ltd.), and Black Diamond (Trade name; Applied Materials Ltd.). In place of the SiOC family film <b>202</b>, the etching target may be another Low-k film, such as an organic Low-k film, e.g., a PAE family film, HSQ family film, PCB family film, or CF family film; or an inorganic Low-k film, e.g., an SiOF family film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">The underlying film or SiC layer <b>101</b> may be formed of, e.g., BLOk (Trade name; Applied Materials Ltd.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32B</figref>, this wafer W is etched by plasma of a fluorocarbon (CF family) gas to form a recess (trench or hole) <b>211</b> in accordance with the mask pattern of the ArF resist <b>205</b>. In this plasma etching, a DC voltage is superposed to the upper electrode <b>34</b> to ensure a sufficient selectivity between the underlying layer or SiC layer <b>201</b> and the etching target layer or SiOC family film <b>202</b>. In this case, the DC voltage applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b> is preferably set to be 0 to −1,500V. Further, the etching conditions are preferably set as follows: for example, the pressure inside the chamber=1.3 to 26.7 Pa; RF power (upper electrode/lower electrode)=0 to 3,000W/100 to 5,000W the process gas=a mixture gas of C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, and Ar; the flow-rate ratio of C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>/Ar=4 to 20/100 to 500/500 to 1,500 mL/min.</div>

By contrast, it has been confirmed that the application of a DC voltage described above can realize both of them.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0239">Further, it has also been confirmed from comparison between the conditions 1 and conditions 2 in this Table 1, that the effect of improving the selectivity relative to SiC obtained by superposing a DC voltage to the upper electrode <b>34</b> can be enhanced where the RF power (upper electrode/lower electrode) is smaller.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0240">Then, using the etching conditions 1 or etching conditions 2 as references, some of the conditions were changed and etching characteristics thus obtained were examined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0241">Table 2 shows etching characteristics obtained by changing the RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> with reference to the etching conditions 1. As shown in this Table 2, the etching rate was improved while the selectivity relative to SiC became smaller, with increase in the RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>. On the other hand, under these conditions, change in the RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> less affected the CD, and the selectivity relative to resist was prominently excellent when the RF power was 400W. Judging from the result described above, it has been confirmed that the RF power applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> is preferably set at a value within a range of about 200 to 800W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0242">Table 3 shows etching characteristics obtained by changing the RF power applied to the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b> with reference to the etching conditions 2.

On the other hand, under these conditions, change in the RF power applied to the lower electrode less affected the CD, and the selectivity relative to resist was improved with increase in the RF power.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0243">Table 4 shows etching characteristics obtained by changing the process pressure with reference to the etching conditions 2. As shown in this Table 4, the etching rate decreased and the etching was thereby stopped where the process pressure was set to be too high under the etching conditions 2 in which the RF power (upper electrode/lower electrode) was as relatively large as 800/2,500W. Accordingly, it has been confirmed that the process pressure is preferably set at a value within a range of about 4 to 20 Pa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0244">Further, in light of the result shown in Table 4 as well as the results shown in Tables 2 and 3, it is thought preferable that the etching rate and the selectivity relative to SiC obtained by superposing a DC voltage are controlled by adjusting the RF power.</div>

The gas supply line <b>64</b> is provided with a mass-flow controller (WC) <b>68</b> and a switching valve <b>70</b> disposed thereon, as in the embodiment 1. The flow-rate ratio of the process gas supplied into the central gas diffusion cell <b>40</b> <i>a </i>and peripheral gas diffusion cell <b>40</b> <i>b </i>is thus adjusted. As a consequence, the ratio (FC/FE) between the gas flow rate FC from the central showerhead and the gas flow rate FE from the peripheral showerhead is arbitrarily adjusted. The flow rates per unit area may be set different, for the process gas delivered from the central showerhead and peripheral showerhead. Further, gas types or gas mixture ratios may be independently or respectively selected, for the process gas delivered from the central showerhead and peripheral showerhead.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0286">In this plasma etching apparatus, the upper electrode <b>34</b>′ is supplied with an RF power within a range covering higher frequencies (form 5 to 10 MHz or more at which ions cannot follow). As a consequence, the plasma density is increased with a preferable dissociation state, so that high density plasma is generated even under a low pressure condition, as in the embodiment 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0287">In the upper electrode <b>34</b>′, the inner upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>b </i>is also used as a showerhead directly across the semiconductor wafer W, such that the flow-rate ratio of the gas delivered from the central showerhead and peripheral showerhead can be arbitrarily adjusted. As a consequence, the spatial distribution of gas molecular or radical density can be controlled in the radial direction, so as to arbitrarily control the spatial distribution of an etching characteristic on the basis of radicals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0288">Further, as described later, the upper electrode <b>34</b>′ is operated as an RF electrode for plasma generation, such that the outer upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>a </i>mainly works for it, and the inner upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>b </i>assists it. The ratio of electric field intensity applied to electrons directly below the RF electrodes <b>34</b> <i>a </i>and <b>34</b> <i>b </i>can be adjusted by these electrodes. As a consequence, the spatial distribution of plasma density can be controlled in the radial direction, so as to arbitrarily and finely control the spatial property of a reactive ion etching characteristic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0289">The control over the spatial distribution of plasma density has substantially no influence on the control over the spatial distribution of radical density. The control over the spatial distribution of plasma density is performed by varying the ratio of electric field intensity or input power between the outer upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>a </i>and inner upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>b</i>. On the other hand, the control over the spatial distribution of radical density is performed by varying the ratio of process gas flow rate, gas density, or gas mixture between the central showerhead and peripheral showerhead. The process gas delivered from the central showerhead and peripheral showerhead is dissociated in an area directly below the inner upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>b</i>. Accordingly, even if the balance of electric field intensity between the inner upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>b </i>and outer upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>a </i>is changed, it does not have a large influence on the balance of radical generation amount or density between the central showerhead and peripheral showerhead, because both showerheads belong to the inner upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>b </i>(within the same area). Thus, the spatial distribution of plasma density and the spatial distribution of radical density can be controlled substantially independently of each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0290">Further, the plasma etching apparatus according to this embodiment is arranged such that most or the majority of plasma is generated directly below the outer upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>a</i>, which mainly works for plasma generation, and then diffuses to the position directly below the inner upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>b</i>. Accordingly, the showerhead or inner upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>b </i>is less attacked by ions from the plasma. This effectively prevents the gas delivery holes <b>37</b> <i>b </i>of the electrode plate <b>36</b> <i>b </i>from being progressively sputtered, thereby remarkably prolonging the service life of the electrode plate <b>36</b> <i>b</i>, which is a replacement part. On the other hand, the outer upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>a </i>for generating most or the majority of plasma has no gas delivery holes at which electric field concentration occurs. As a consequence, the outer upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>a </i>is less attacked by ions, and thus there arises no such a problem in that the outer upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>a </i>shortens the service life.</div>

As a consequence, in the load circuit extending from the connector <b>98</b> toward the side opposite to the matching unit <b>46</b>, RF is transmitted more easily through the outer waveguide J<sub>0 </sub>having a lower impedance (a smaller voltage drop). The outer upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>a </i>is thereby supplied with a larger RF power P<sub>0</sub>, so the electric field intensity E<sub>0 </sub>obtained at the bottom surface (plasma contact surface) of the outer upper electrode <b>34</b> <i>a </i>becomes higher.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0316" num="0339">When an etching process is performed in the plasma etching apparatus described above, the gate valve <b>86</b> is first opened, and a semiconductor wafer W to be etched is transferred into the chamber <b>10</b> and placed on the susceptor <b>16</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0317" num="0340">While the etching gas is supplied into the chamber <b>10</b>, an RF power for plasma generation is applied from the first RF power supply <b>88</b> to the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b> at a predetermined power level.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0342">In this plasma etching apparatus, the lower electrode or susceptor <b>16</b> is supplied with an RF power within a range covering high frequencies (for example, 10 MHz or more) from the first RF power supply. As a consequence, the plasma density is increased with a preferable state, so that high density plasma is generated even under a low pressure condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0343">In this embodiment, when the plasma is thus generated, a DC voltage with a predetermined polarity and value is applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b>. At this time, the application electrode or upper electrode <b>34</b> is preferably set to have a self bias voltage V<sub>dc </sub>on the surface, at a level for obtaining a predetermined (moderate) sputtering effect onto the surface, i.e., the surface of the electrode plate <b>36</b>. In other words, the application voltage from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is preferably controlled by the controller <b>51</b> to increase the absolute value of V<sub>dc </sub>on the surface of the upper electrode <b>34</b>. Where an RF is applied from the first RF power supply <b>88</b> to generate plasma, polymers may be deposited on the upper electrode <b>34</b>. However, since a suitable DC voltage is applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b>, polymers deposited on the upper electrode <b>34</b> are sputtered, thereby cleaning up the surface of the upper electrode <b>34</b>. Further, an optimum quantity of polymers can be supplied onto the semiconductor wafer W, thereby canceling the surface roughness of the photo-resist film. Where the voltage applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is adjusted to sputter the body of the upper electrode <b>34</b>, the electrode material can be supplied onto the surface of the semiconductor wafer W. In this case, the photo-resist film is provided with carbide formed on the surface, and is thereby reinforced. Further, the sputtered electrode material reacts with F contained in a fluorocarbon family process gas and is exhausted, thereby reducing the F ratio in plasma for the photo-resist film to be less etched. Particularly, where the electrode plate <b>36</b> is made of a silicon-containing material, such as silicon or SiC, sputtered silicon from the surface of the electrode plate <b>36</b> reacts with polymers, so the photo-resist film is provided with SiC formed on the surface, and is thereby remarkably reinforced. In addition to this, Si is highly reactive with F, and the effects described above are enhanced. Accordingly, a silicon-containing material is preferably used as a material of the electrode plate <b>36</b>. It should be noted that, in this case, the application current or application power may be controlled in place of the application voltage from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0321" num="0344">The DC voltage thus applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> to make a deep self bias voltage V<sub>dc</sub>, as described above, increases the length of a plasma sheath formed on the upper electrode <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A and 42B</figref>. As the length of the plasma sheath is increased, the plasma is further pressed by that much. For example, where no DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, V<sub>dc </sub>on the upper electrode side becomes, e.g., −100V. In this case, the plasma sheath has a small length d<sub>0</sub>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>. On the other hand, where a DC voltage of −900V is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, V<sub>dc </sub>on the upper electrode side becomes −900V. In this case, since the length of the plasma sheath is in proportion to ¾ of the absolute value of V<sub>dc</sub>, the plasma sheath has a larger length d<sub>1</sub>, and the plasma is pressed by that much, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref>. Where the length of the plasma sheath is thus increased to suitably press the plasma, the effective residence time above the semiconductor wafer W is decreased. Further, the plasma concentrates above the wafer W with less diffusion, thereby reducing the dissociation space. In this case, dissociation of a fluorocarbon family process gas is suppressed for the photo-resist film to be less etched. Accordingly, the application voltage from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is preferably controlled by the controller <b>51</b>, such that the length of the plasma sheath on the upper electrode <b>34</b> is increased to a level for forming desired pressed plasma. It should be noted that, also in this case, the application current or application power may be controlled in place of the application voltage from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0322" num="0345">Further, when the plasma is formed, electrons are generated near the upper electrode <b>34</b>. When a DC voltage is applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, electrons are accelerated in the vertical direction within the process space due to the potential difference between the applied DC voltage value and plasma potential. In other words, the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> can be set at a desired polarity, voltage value, and current value, to irradiate the semiconductor wafer W with electrons. The radiated electrons reform the composition of the mask or photo-resist film to reinforce the film. Accordingly, the application voltage value and application current value from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> can be used to control the quantity of electrons generated near the upper electrode <b>34</b> and the acceleration voltage for accelerating the electrons toward the wafer W, so that the photo-resist film is reinforced in a predetermined manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0323" num="0346">Particularly, where the photo-resist film on the semiconductor wafer W is a photo-resist film (which will be referred to as an ArF resist film) for an ArF excimer laser (with a wavelength of 193 nm), the ArF resist film changes its polymer structure through reactions shown in the chemical formulas (1) and (2) described with reference to the embodiment 1, and is then irradiated with electrons, thereby arriving at the structure shown on the right side of the chemical formula (3) described with reference to the embodiment 1. In this case, by the irradiation with electrons, the composition of the ArF resist film is reformed (resist cross-linkage reaction), as shown in a portion d of the chemical formula (3). Since this portion d has a function of greatly enhancing the etching resistance property (plasma resistance property), the etching resistance property of the ArF resist film remarkably increases. As a consequence, the surface roughness of the ArF resist film is suppressed, and the etching selectivity of an etching target layer relative to the ArF resist film is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0324" num="0347">Accordingly, the application voltage value or current value from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is preferably controlled by the controller <b>51</b> to enhance the etching resistance property of the photo-resist film (particularly, ArF resist film) by irradiation with electrons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0325" num="0348">Further, as described above, when a DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, electrons generated near the upper electrode <b>34</b> in plasma generation are accelerated in the vertical direction within the process space. The polarity, voltage value, and current value of the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> can be set at predetermined conditions, so that electrons reach into holes formed on the semiconductor wafer W. As a consequence, the shading effect is suppressed to obtain a good processed shape without bowing, while improving the uniformity of the processed shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0326" num="0349">It is assumed that electron current amount I<sub>DC </sub>due to the DC voltage is used as the quantity of electrons incident on the wafer W, where the acceleration voltage of electrons is controlled. In this case, where I<sub>ion </sub>is ion current amount incident on the wafer from plasma, it is preferable to satisfy I<sub>DC</sub>&gt;(½)I<sub>ion</sub>. Since I<sub>ion</sub>=Zρv<sub>ion</sub>e (where, Z is charge number, ρ is current velocity density, v<sub>ion </sub>is ion velocity, and e is electron charge amount 1.6×10<sup>−19</sup>C), and ρ is in proportion to electron density Ne, I<sub>ion </sub>is in proportion to Ne.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0327" num="0350">As described above, the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> can be controlled, so as to exercise the sputtering function onto the upper electrode <b>34</b> and the plasma pressing function, as well as the supply function of supplying a large quantity of electrons generated at the upper electrode <b>34</b> to the semiconductor wafer W, as described above. This arrangement makes it possible to reinforce the photo-resist film, supply optimum polymers, and suppress dissociation of the process gas. As a consequence, the surface roughness of the photo-resist is suppressed, and the etching selectivity of an etching target layer relative to the photo-resist film is increased. Further, the CD of an opening portion formed in the photo-resist film is prevented from expanding, thereby realizing pattern formation with high accuracy. Particularly, these effects are more enhanced by controlling the DC voltage to suitably exercise the three functions described above, i.e., the sputtering function, plasma pressing function, and electron supply function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0328" num="0351">It should be noted that, it depends on process conditions or the like to determine which one of the functions described above is predominant. The voltage applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is preferably controlled by the controller <b>51</b> to exercise one or more of the functions to effectively obtain the corresponding effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0352">The DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> can be adjusted to control the plasma potential.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0330" num="0353">If etching by-products are deposited on the upper electrode <b>34</b> or the deposition shield <b>11</b> forming the chamber wall, a problem may arise in that the process characteristics change or particles are generated. Particularly, there is involving sequentially etching a multi-layered film, in which an Si-organic film (SiOC). SiN film, SiO<sub>2 </sub>film, and photo-resist are laminated on a semiconductor wafer W in this order. In this case, since suitable etching conditions are different for the respective films, a memory effect may occur in that a previous process leaves some effect that affects a subsequent process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0331" num="0354">The amount of deposition of etching by-products described above depends on the potential difference between the plasma and the upper electrode <b>34</b>, chamber wall, or the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0332" num="0355">As described above, the voltage applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b> can be controlled to lower the plasma potential.

The plasma potential Vp is preferably set at a value within a range of 80V≤Vp≤200V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0333" num="0356">Further, the applied DC voltage contributes to formation of plasma, as another effect obtained by the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>. In this case, the plasma density can be higher and the etching rate is thereby increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0334" num="0357">This is so, because, the negative DC voltage applied to the upper electrode hinders electrons from entering the upper electrode and thus suppresses extinction of electrons. Further, where the negative DC voltage accelerates ions onto the upper electrode, electrons are emitted from the electrode. These electrons are accelerated at a high velocity due to the difference between the plasma potential and application voltage value, and ionize neutral gas (turn the gas into plasma), thereby increasing the electron density (plasma density).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0336" num="0359">Further, when plasma is generated, the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b> from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> increases the plasma density particularly at the central portion in trench etching.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0340" num="0363">As described above, an explanation has been given of functions and effects of the direct current (DC) voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0341" num="0364">Incidentally, in this embodiment, a DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode of a plasma etching apparatus in which a first radio frequency (RF) power for plasma generation and a second radio frequency (RF) power for ion attraction are applied to the lower electrode, i.e., an apparatus of the type that applies two RF powers with different frequencies to the lower side. Plasma etching apparatuses of the type that applies two RF powers with different frequencies to the lower side have the following advantages, as compared to the other plasma etching apparatus of the capacitive coupling type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0342" num="0365">First, as in this embodiment, where an RF power for plasma generation is applied to the lower electrode, plasma is generated near the wafer, and dissociation of the process gas is suppressed because plasma is prevented from widely diffusing. As a consequence, even where the pressure inside the process chamber is high and the plasma density is low, the etching rate on the wafer can be increased. Further, even where the RF power for plasma generation has a high frequency, it is possible to ensure relatively large ion energy and thus attain a high efficiency. By contrast, in apparatuses of the type that applies an RF power for plasma generation to the upper electrode, plasma is generated near the upper electrode. In this case, it is difficult to increase the etching rate on the wafer, if the pressure inside the process chamber is high and the plasma density is low.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0343" num="0366">In addition, as in this embodiment, where an RF power for plasma generation and an RF power for ion attraction are independently applied to the lower electrode, the function of generating plasma and the function of attracting ions, both necessary for plasma etching, can be independently controlled. By contrast, in apparatuses of the type that applies an RF power with one frequency to the lower electrode, the function of generating plasma and the function of attracting ions cannot be independently controlled. In this case, it is difficult to satisfy etching conditions where high micro-fabrication is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0344" num="0367">As described above, according to a plasma etching apparatus of the type that applies two RF powers with different frequencies to the lower side, plasma is generated near the wafer and is prevented from widely diffusing, and the function of generating plasma and the function of attracting ions can be independently controlled. Further, where a DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode in this etching apparatus, the apparatus can also exercise at least one of the upper electrode sputtering function, plasma pressing function, electron supply (to a wafer) function, plasma potential control function, plasma density increase function, and plasma density control function. As a consequence, it is possible to provide a plasma etching apparatus with high performance, which is more suitable for recent etching micro-fabrication.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0346" num="0369">Further, if the upper electrode <b>34</b> is grounded when a DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, the DC voltage application has no effect.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0373">As regards a plasma etching apparatus of the type that applies two RF powers with different frequencies to the lower side, and further applies a DC voltage to the upper electrode, where the apparatus is used to etch an insulating film (for example, Low-k film) disposed on a wafer W, the following combination of gases is particularly preferably used as a process gas.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0356" num="0379">Incidentally, where a DC voltage is applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, electrons may accumulate on the upper electrode <b>34</b> and thereby cause abnormal electric discharge between the upper electrode <b>34</b> and the inner wall of the chamber <b>10</b>. In order to suppress such abnormal electric discharge, this embodiment includes the GND block (conductive member) <b>91</b> as a part grounded in the sense of DC, which is disposed on the deposition shield <b>11</b> that constitutes the chamber wall. The GND block <b>91</b> is exposed to plasma, and is electrically connected to a conductive portion in the deposition shield <b>11</b>. The DC voltage current applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to the upper electrode <b>34</b> flows through the process space to the GND block <b>91</b>, and is then grounded through the deposition shield <b>11</b>. The GND block <b>91</b> is made of a conductor, and preferably a silicon-containing substance, such as Si or SiC. The GND block <b>91</b> may be preferably made of C. The GND block <b>91</b> allows electrons accumulated in the upper electrode <b>34</b> to be released, thereby preventing abnormal electric discharge. The GND block <b>91</b> preferably has a protruding length of 10 mm or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0357" num="0380">Further, in order to prevent abnormal electric discharge, it may be effective to use a method of superposing very short periodic pulses of the opposite polarity, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, by a suitable means, with the DC voltage applied to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, so as to neutralize electrons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0358" num="0381">The position of the GND block <b>91</b> is not limited to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, as long as it is disposed in the plasma generation area. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, the GND block <b>91</b> may be disposed on the susceptor <b>16</b> side, e.g., around the susceptor <b>16</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, the GND block <b>91</b> may be disposed near the upper electrode <b>34</b>, e.g., as a ring disposed outside the upper electrode <b>34</b>. However, when plasma is generated, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or a polymer that covers the deposition shield <b>11</b> or the like flies out and may be deposited on the GND block <b>91</b>. In this case, the GND block <b>91</b> cannot maintain the grounding performance any more in the sense of DC, and thus hardly exercises the effect of preventing abnormal electric discharge. Accordingly, it is important to prevent such deposition. For this reason, the GND block <b>91</b> is preferably located at a position remote from members covered with Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or the like, but preferably near parts made of an Si-containing substance, such as Si or quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>). For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> according to the embodiment 1, an Si-containing member <b>93</b> is preferably disposed near the GND block <b>91</b>. In this case, the length L of a portion of the Si-containing member <b>93</b> below the GND block <b>91</b> is preferably set to be equal to or longer than the protruding length M of the GND block <b>91</b>. Further, in order to prevent the function from being deteriorated due to deposition of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or a polymer, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, it is effective to form a recess <b>91</b> <i>a </i>in the GND block <b>91</b> where flying substances are hardly deposited. It is also effective to increase the surface are of the GND block <b>91</b>, so that it cannot be entirely covered with Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or a polymer. Further, in order to suppress deposition, it is effective to increase the temperature. In this respect, the upper electrode <b>34</b> is supplied with an RF power for plasma generation, and thus increases the temperature around it. Accordingly, the GND block <b>91</b> is preferably disposed near the upper electrode <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, to increase the temperature and thereby prevent deposition. Particularly in this case, the GND block <b>91</b> is preferably disposed as a ring outside the upper electrode <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0382">In order to more effectively remove the influence of deposition on the GND block <b>91</b>, due to Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or a polymer flying out from the deposition shield <b>11</b> and so forth, it is effective to make a negative DC voltage applicable to the GNU block <b>91</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>. Specifically, where a negative DC voltage is applied to the GND block <b>91</b>, deposition sticking thereto is sputtered or etched, so as to clean the surface of the GND block <b>91</b>. In the structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, a switching mechanism <b>53</b> is configured to switch the connection of the GND block <b>91</b> between the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> and a ground line, so that a voltage can be applied to the GND block <b>91</b> from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b>. Further, a grounded conductive auxiliary member <b>91</b> <i>b </i>is disposed to receive flow of a DC electron current generated by a negative DC voltage applied to the GND block <b>91</b>. The switching mechanism <b>53</b> includes a first switch <b>53</b> <i>a </i>to switch the connection of the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> between the matching unit <b>46</b> and GND block <b>91</b>, and a second switch <b>53</b> <i>b </i>to turn on/off the connection of the GND block <b>91</b> to the ground line. In the structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, the GND block <b>91</b> is disposed as a ring outside the upper electrode <b>34</b>, while the conductive auxiliary member <b>91</b> <i>b </i>is disposed around the susceptor <b>16</b>. Although this arrangement is preferable, another arrangement may be adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0360" num="0383">During plasma etching, the structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> is typically set as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54A</figref>, in which the first switch <b>53</b> <i>a </i>of the switching mechanism <b>53</b> is connected to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, so the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> is connected to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, while the second switch <b>53</b> <i>b </i>is in the ON-state, so the GND block <b>91</b> is connected to the ground line.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0361" num="0384">Accordingly, cleaning is then performed to remove this deposition. For this cleaning, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54B</figref>, the first switch <b>53</b> <i>a </i>of the switching mechanism <b>53</b> is switched to the GND block <b>91</b>, and the second switch <b>53</b> <i>b </i>is turned off. In this state, the first RF power supply <b>48</b> is electrically connected to the upper electrode <b>34</b>, and cleaning plasma is thereby generated, while a negative DC voltage is applied from the variable DC power supply <b>50</b> to the GND block <b>91</b>. As a consequence, a DC electron current flows from the GND block <b>91</b> into the conductive auxiliary member <b>91</b> <i>b</i>. On the other hand, positive ions flow into the GND block <b>91</b>. Accordingly, the DC voltage can be adjusted to control the energy of positive ions incident on the GND block <b>91</b>, so that the surface of the GND block <b>91</b> is sputtered by ions to remove deposition sticking to the surface of the GND block <b>91</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0362" num="0385">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, the second switch <b>53</b> <i>b </i>may be set in the OFF state during a partial period of plasma etching, so that the GND block <b>91</b> is in a floating state.

In this case, the GND block <b>91</b> is given a self bias voltage, which provides energy for positive ions to be incident on the GND block <b>91</b>, thereby cleaning the GND block <b>91</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0363" num="0386">During the cleaning described above, the application DC voltage can be small, and thus the DC electron current is also small at this time.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0370" num="0393">In order to simply prevent the GND block <b>91</b> from losing the grounding performance in the sense of DC, due to deposition of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or a polymer on the GND block <b>91</b> in plasma generation, it is effective to partly cover the GND block <b>91</b> with another member, and to move them relative to each other so as to expose a new surface of the GND block <b>91</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> according to the embodiment 1, it may be adopted that the GND block <b>91</b> is set to have a relatively large area, and the surface of the GND block <b>91</b> to be in contact with plasma is partly covered with a mask member <b>111</b> movable in the arrow direction. This cover plate <b>111</b> is movable, so that a portion to be exposed to plasma can be changed on the surface of the GND block <b>91</b>. In this case, although a driving mechanism disposed in the chamber <b>10</b> may cause a problem about particle generation, it cannot be serious because the frequency of use of the driving mechanism is as low as once in 100 hours. Further, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> according to the embodiment 1, it may be effective that a columnar GND block <b>191</b> is rotatably disposed, and the outer periphery surface of the GND block <b>191</b> is covered with a mask member <b>112</b>, so that it is partially exposed. Where the GND block <b>191</b> is rotated, the portion to be exposed to plasma can be changed. In this case, a driving mechanism may be disposed outside the chamber <b>10</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0371" num="0394">In order to simply prevent the GND block <b>91</b> from losing the grounding performance in the sense of DC due to deposition, it is also effective to partly cover the GND block <b>91</b> with another member, which is to be gradually etched by plasma, so that a part of the surface of the GND block <b>91</b>, which has not lost conductivity, is always exposed. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> according to the embodiment 1, it may be adopted that the surface of the GND block <b>91</b> is partly covered with a stepped cover film <b>113</b> disposed to leave an initially exposed surface <b>91</b> <i>c </i>that provides a grounding performance. In this case, after a plasma process is performed for, e.g., 200 hours, the initially exposed surface <b>91</b> <i>c </i>of the GND block <b>91</b> loses conductivity, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> according to the embodiment 1. However, the stepped cover film <b>113</b> is designed to have a thin portion such that it has been etched by this time, so that a new exposed surface <b>91</b> <i>d </i>of the GND block <b>91</b> appears. The new exposed surface <b>91</b> <i>d </i>provides a grounding performance. This cover film <b>113</b> has the effect of preventing a wall surface material from being deposited on the GND block <b>91</b>, as well as the effect of reducing ions incident on the GND block <b>91</b> to prevent contamination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0372" num="0395">In practical use, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> according to the embodiment 1, it is preferable to use a cover film <b>113</b> <i>a </i>in which a number of thin layers <b>114</b> are stacked while the layers are gradually shifted. In this case, where one layer <b>114</b> disappears due to etching by plasma in a time Te, and an exposed surface of the GND block <b>91</b> loses conductivity due to contamination in a time Tp, the thickness of the layer <b>114</b> is set to satisfy Te&lt;Tp, so that a conductive surface is always ensured on the GND block <b>91</b>. The number of layers <b>114</b> is preferably set to make the service life of the GND block <b>91</b> longer than the frequency of maintenance. Further, in order to improve the maintenance performance, one layer <b>114</b> <i>a </i>is provided with a different color from the others, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, so that it is possible to know the time to replace the GND block <b>91</b> with a new one, by this film <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, for example, when the surface area of this film <b>114</b> <i>a </i>exceeds a certain value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0373" num="0396">Each of the cover films <b>113</b> and <b>113</b> <i>a </i>is preferably formed of a film to be suitably etched by plasma, such as a photo-resist film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0374" num="0397">In order to simply prevent the GND block <b>91</b> from losing the grounding performance in the sense of DC due to deposition, it may be also adopted to dispose a plurality of GND blocks <b>91</b>, so that they are switched in turn to exercise a grounding performance. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> according to the embodiment 1, three GND blocks <b>91</b> are disposed and only one of them is selectively grounded by a shift switch <b>115</b>. Further, a current sensor <b>117</b> is disposed on a common ground line <b>116</b> to monitor a DC current flowing therethrough. The current sensor <b>117</b> is used to monitor a current flowing through a grounded GND block <b>91</b>, and when the current value becomes lower than a predetermined value, it is determined that this GND block <b>91</b> cannot exercise the grounding performance, and thus the connection is switched from this one to another GND block <b>91</b>. The number of GND blocks <b>91</b> is suitably selected from a range of about 3 to 10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0375" num="0398">In the example described above, a GND block not grounded is in an electrically floating state, but such a GND block may be supplied with an electric potential for protection to protect a GND block in an idle state, in place of use of the shift switch <b>115</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> according to the embodiment 1 shows an example designed in this aspect. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, each of ground lines <b>118</b> respectively connected to GND blocks <b>91</b> is provided with a variable DC power supply <b>119</b>. In this case, the voltage of a GND block <b>91</b> to exercise a grounding performance is set at 0V by controlling the voltage of the corresponding variable DC power supply <b>119</b>. Further, the voltage of each of the other GND blocks <b>91</b> is set at, e.g., 100V to prevent an electric current from flowing therethrough by controlling the voltage of the corresponding variable DC power supply <b>119</b>. When the current value detected thereby becomes lower than a predetermined value at the current sensor <b>117</b> on the ground line <b>118</b> connected to a GND block <b>91</b> to exercise a grounding performance, it is determined that this GND block <b>91</b> cannot exercise the grounding performance. Accordingly, the voltage of the variable DC power supply <b>119</b> corresponding to another GND block <b>91</b> is controlled to be a value for this GND block <b>91</b> to exercise a grounding performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0376" num="0399">As described above, where the application voltage from a DC power supply <b>119</b> is set at a negative value of about −1 kV, the GND block <b>91</b> connected thereto can function as an electrode to apply a DC voltage to plasma. However, if this value is too large, the plasma is affected. Further, the voltage applied to the GND block <b>91</b> can be controlled to obtain a cleaning effect on the GND block <b>91</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0429" num="0452">In this embodiment, a cooling ring <b>166</b> is disposed between a correction ring or focus ring <b>24</b> and an electrostatic chuck <b>18</b>, at a position adjacent to a wafer W. A variable DC power supply <b>167</b> is connected to the focus ring <b>24</b> and the wall of a chamber <b>10</b>. Specifically, in the variable DC power supply <b>167</b>, one of the terminals is connected to the focus ring <b>24</b> and the other terminal is connected to the wall of the chamber <b>10</b>. A low-pass filter (LPF) <b>169</b> is disposed on a feed line connecting the power supply <b>167</b> to the focus ring <b>24</b>. A switch <b>168</b> is connected in parallel with the variable DC power supply <b>167</b>. The cooling ring <b>166</b> is cooled by a cooling mechanism <b>170</b>. The temperature of the cooling ring <b>166</b> and focus ring <b>24</b> is measured by a temperature measuring system <b>171</b>. A temperature control section <b>172</b> is configured to receive a signal from the temperature measuring system <b>171</b>, and to output control signals to the cooling mechanism <b>170</b>, variable DC power supply <b>167</b>, and switch <b>168</b>. As a consequence, the temperature of the cooling ring <b>166</b> and focus ring <b>24</b> can be controlled. For example, the cooling mechanism may have a structure in which a heat transfer gas, such as He gas, is supplied to a position between the cooling ring <b>166</b> and susceptor. In this case, the supply pressure of the heat transfer gas is adjusted to change the transfer rate of cold from a cooling medium circulating within the susceptor <b>16</b>, so as to control the temperature of the cooling ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0430" num="0453">When plasma is generated in the plasma etching apparatus with this structure, as in the embodiment 1, the edge portion of the wafer W is cooled by the cooling ring <b>166</b>, so that the edge portion suffers less deposition. Further, a DC voltage is applied to the focus ring <b>24</b>, so that the etching characteristics are prevented from being deteriorated due to decrease in the temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0431" num="0454">A detailed explanation will be given of this structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0432" num="0455">In general, plasma processing apparatuses include a focus ring <b>24</b> and adjacent to a wafer W, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>. During a plasma process, the temperature of the focus ring <b>24</b> increases, and deposition <b>173</b> sticks to the edge portion and bottom of the wafer W. Where the focus ring <b>24</b> is cooled to prevent deposition from sticking, some etching characteristics (particularly, resist etching rate) are deteriorated, in spite of decrease in deposition, i.e., there is a trade-off relationship between the deposition and etching characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0433" num="0456">In this respect, according to this embodiment, the cooling ring <b>166</b> is cooled to a temperature lower than the wafer W, and thus deposition sticks to the cooling ring <b>166</b> in place of the edge portion of the wafer W, so that the edge portion and bottom of the wafer W can suffer less deposition. On the other hand, a DC voltage is applied to the focus ring <b>24</b>, and thus the temperature of the focus ring <b>24</b> increases. As a consequence, the temperature of the space near the wafer edge is prevented from being lowered by the cooling ring <b>166</b>, so that the etching characteristics are prevented from being deteriorated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0434" num="0457">In this embodiment, the temperature control is not necessarily required, as long as the temperature of the cooling ring <b>166</b> is lower than that of the edge portion of the wafer W. Alternatively, only the temperature of the focus ring <b>24</b> may be measured and controlled. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref>, a body with high thermal conductivity, such as a silicone rubber member <b>174</b>, may be disposed between the cooling ring <b>166</b> and susceptor <b>16</b> for the cooling member <b>166</b> to be more easily cooled. If possible, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref>, this structure is preferably arranged such that silicone rubber members <b>174</b> are disposed to sandwich a member <b>174</b> <i>a </i>made of a dielectric body, such as AlN, that does not easily transmit an RF power but easily transmits heat. In this case, the cooling ring <b>166</b> is least affected by heating due to an RF power to perform the cooling better.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0435" num="0458">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>, the focus ring <b>24</b> and susceptor <b>16</b> may be insulated from each other by an insulating member <b>175</b>, so that a DC voltage is applied to the focus ring <b>24</b> without being affected by an RF power. In this case, time low-pass filter (LPF) <b>169</b> may be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0436" num="0459">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, a DC voltage may be applied to the focus ring <b>24</b> through the susceptor <b>16</b>. In this case, the focus ring <b>24</b> is electrically connected to the susceptor <b>16</b> by, e.g., contact pins <b>176</b>, so that a DC voltage is applied to the susceptor <b>16</b> through the feed line of the RF power supply <b>90</b>. If a temperature increase due to an RF power applied through the susceptor <b>16</b> is not negligible, a dielectric body member <b>17</b> may be disposed between the cooling ring <b>166</b> and susceptor <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>. In this case, an RF power to the cooling ring <b>166</b> is cut off, and thus the temperature thereof is prevented from increasing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0437" num="0460">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>, a focus ring <b>24</b> may be disposed above a cooling ring <b>166</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0438" num="0461">In this embodiment, the polarity of the DC voltage applied to the focus ring <b>24</b> may be reversed. In place of the DC voltage, an AC voltage may be applied. The voltages may be pulsed or modulated, such as AM modulation or FM modulation. Further, if deterioration in etching characteristics is acceptable, the cooling ring <b>166</b> may be disposed without any voltage application to the focus ring <b>24</b> to obtain some of the effects described above.</div>
