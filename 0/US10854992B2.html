<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a radar device.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Recent studies have been made on a radar device using a radar transmission signal of a short wavelength including microwave or milliwave with which a high resolution is achieved. Development is required on a radar device (wide-angle radar device) that detects objects (targets) including a pedestrian as well as a vehicle in a wide-angle range in order to improve outdoor safety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A known example of such a radar device is a pulse radar device that repeatedly emits pulsed waves. A wide-angle pulse radar that detects a vehicle and a pedestrian in a wide-angle range receives a mixture of multiple reflected waves from a target (for example, a vehicle) at a short distance and a target (for example, a pedestrian) at a long distance. This requires (1) a radar transmitter to have a configuration to transmit pulsed waves or pulse-modulated waves having an auto-correlation characteristic (hereinafter, referred to as a low range sidelobe characteristic) that achieves low range sidelobes, and (2) a radar receiver to have a configuration with a wide reception dynamic range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of the configuration of the wide-angle radar device include the following two configurations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The first configuration transmits pulsed waves or modulated waves as radar waves by mechanical or electrical scanning using a directional beam of a narrow angle (beam width of a few degrees), and receives reflected waves using a narrow-angle directional beam. With this configuration, the scanning needs to be performed a large number of times to obtain a high resolution, which leads to a degradation in the performance of following a fast moving target.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The second configuration uses a method (direction of arrival (DOA) estimation) of receiving reflected waves through an array antenna including multiple antennas (antenna elements), and estimating the arrival angle of the reflected waves using a signal processing algorithm based on a reception phase difference corresponding to an antenna spacing. This configuration allows the radar receiver to estimate the arrival angle even when a frequency of scanning of a transmission beam on the radar transmitter is reduced, thereby achieving a shortened scanning time and an improved following performance as compared to the first configuration. Examples of DOA estimation methods include a Fourier transform based on matrix calculation, a Capon method and a linear prediction (LP) method based on inverse matrix calculation, and a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and an estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) based on eigenvalue calculation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed is a radar device (also referred to as a MIMO radar) that includes multiple antennas (array antennas) on the radar transmitter as well as the radar receiver and performs beam scanning by signal processing using transmitting and receiving array antennas (see Jian Li, Stoica, Petre, “MIMO Radar with Colocated Antennas,” Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE Vol. 24, Issue: 5, pp. 106-114, 2007, for example).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve a high directional gain of an array antenna, antenna elements (hereinafter, referred to as array elements) included in the array antenna are each formed of a subarray antenna including multiple antenna elements in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">As for the element spacing of the array antenna, it is difficult to arrange the array elements at spacings smaller than the size of the array element. However, the dimension of the array element having a subarray antenna configuration is large, and accordingly a large spacing is needed between subarray antennas, which may generate a grating lobe on a directivity pattern of the array antenna.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">One non-limiting and exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure provides a radar device that can prevent generation of an unnecessary grating lobe and achieve a desired directivity pattern even when arranged in the subarray antenna configuration.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">[Underlying Knowledge Forming Basis of the Present Disclosure]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates an exemplary subarray configuration (hereinafter, also referred to as a subarray element) including an antenna element. The subarray element illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes four antenna elements in a 2×2 matrix. In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the subarray element has a dimension of 0.8 wavelength in both the horizontal and vertical directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates an exemplary array antenna including a linear arrangement of the four subarray elements illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Since each subarray element has a dimension of 0.8 wavelength (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a spacing between the subarray elements needs to be about 1 wavelength or larger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, an array element spacing (predetermined element spacing) for preventing generation of a grating lobe in a range of ±90° of a main lobe is 0.5 wavelength. In the array antenna illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the subarray elements have an element spacing of about 1 wavelength or larger, and thus it is difficult to obtain a predetermined element spacing. This results in generation of a grating lobe in the range of ±90° of the main lobe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">As described above, when the dimension of the subarray element is 0.5 wavelength or larger, it may be difficult to set the element spacing of the array antenna to be 0.5 wavelength. Thus, an unnecessary grating lobe occurs in the range of ±90° of the main lobe, which generates a virtual image at angle determination, thereby leading to a false detection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Published Japanese Translation of PCT International Application No. 2011-526370 (hereinafter, referred to as Patent Document 1) discloses an array antenna configuration including a subarray element having a width d equal to 1 wavelength approximately. In Patent Document 1, transmitting antennas Tx0 and Tx1 has an element spacing of 6 wavelengths, and receiving antennas RX0, RX1, RX2, and RX3 has an element spacing of 1.5 wavelengths ±(λ/8) (where X represents 1 wavelength). With the array antenna configuration disclosed in Patent Document 1, time-divisional transmission of a radar transmission signal is performed through the transmitting antennas Tx0 and Tx1, and a reception signal for the radar transmission signal transmitted from each of the transmitting antennas Tx0 and Tx1 is acquired through the receiving antennas RX0, RX1, RX2, and RX3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">With this configuration, a phase difference due to the difference of the positions of the transmitting antennas is superimposed on the reception signal acquired by a receiving array antenna. This achieves a virtually increased opening length of the receiving antennas. Hereinafter, a virtual receiving array antenna having an increased effective opening length due to antenna element arrangements of transmitting and receiving array antennas is referred to as a “virtual receiving array.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In Patent Document 1, however, the receiving array antennas have an element spacing of 1.5 wavelengths ±λ/8, which leads to generation of a grating lobe in a direction shifted from a main beam direction by 40° approximately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">An aspect according to the present disclosure prevents generation of an unnecessary grating lobe and achieves a desired directivity pattern even when array elements having a subarray configuration are arranged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Hereinafter, embodiments according to the aspect of the present disclosure are described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In this expression, CI<sub>(z)</sub>(k, m) represents the sum (hereinafter, also referred to as the correlation sum) of the correlation calculated values, where Np is an integer equal to or larger than one, and m is an integer equal to or larger than one as an ordinal number of the number of additions in units of the number Np of additions at the adder <b>212</b>. The value z is z=1, . . . , Nt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The adder <b>212</b> performs Np additions in units of the output from the correlation calculator <b>211</b> obtained per the radar transmission period Tr. Specifically, the adder <b>212</b> calculates the correlation value CI<sub>(z)</sub>(k, m) as the sum of the correlation calculated values AC<sub>(z)</sub>(k, Np(m−1)+1) to AC<sub>(z)</sub>(k, Np×m) for each discrete time k. Thus, the adder <b>212</b> can achieve an improved SNR of the reflected wave signal through the Np additions of the correlation calculated value in a range in which the reflected wave signals from the target have a high correlation. This then achieves an improved measurement performance related to estimation of an arrival distance of the target.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In order to obtain an ideal addition gain, a condition for having a phase component of each correlation calculated value within a certain range needs to be satisfied in an addition time period for the number Np of additions of the correlation calculated value. Thus, the number Np of additions is preferably set based on an expected maximum moving speed of the target as a measurement target. This is because a larger expected maximum speed of the target results in a larger amount of change of a Doppler frequency included in a reflected wave from the target, and thus a shorter time duration in which a high correlation is obtained. In this case, the number Np of additions is small, which leads to a small gain improvement effect of the addition by the adder <b>212</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The Doppler frequency analyzer <b>213</b> performs the coherent integration for the same discrete time k in units of CI<sub>(z)</sub>(k, Nc(w−1)+1) to CI<sub>(z)</sub>(k, Nc×w) as Nc outputs obtained at each discrete time k from the adder <b>212</b>. For example, the Doppler frequency analyzer <b>213</b> corrects a phase variation ϕ(fs)=2πfs(Tr×Np)Δϕ in accordance with 2Nf different Doppler frequencies fsΔϕ as expressed in an expression below, and then performs the coherent integration.</div>
