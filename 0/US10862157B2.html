<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The research described herein was supported in part by finds from the U.S. Government (Department of Defense), and the U.S. Government may, therefore, have certain rights in the invention(s) described herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention provides a protective layer for use in a secondary or rechargeable alkali metal-sulfur battery, including the lithium-sulfur battery, sodium-sulfur battery, and potassium-sulfur battery.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium metal batteries (including Li-sulfur and Li metal-air batteries) are considered promising power sources for electric vehicle (EV), hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), and portable electronic devices, such as lap-top computers and mobile phones. Lithium as a metal element has the highest capacity (3,861 mAh/g) compared to any other metal or metal-intercalated compound as an anode active material (except Li<sub>4.4</sub>Si, which has a specific capacity of 4,200 mAh/g). Hence, in general, Li metal batteries have a significantly higher energy density than lithium ion batteries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the most promising energy storage devices is the lithium-sulfur (Li—S) cell since the theoretical capacity of Li is 3,861 mAh/g and that of S is 1,675 mAh/g. In its simplest form, a Li—S cell consists of elemental sulfur as the positive electrode and lithium as the negative electrode. The lithium-sulfur cell operates with a redox couple, described by the reaction S<sub>8</sub>+16Li↔8Li<sub>2</sub>S that lies near 2.2 V with respect to Li<sup>+</sup>/Li<sup>0</sup>. This electrochemical potential is approximately ⅔ of that exhibited by conventional positive electrodes (e.g. LiMnO<sub>4</sub>). However, this shortcoming is offset by the very high theoretical capacities of both Li and S. Thus, compared with conventional intercalation-based Li-ion batteries, Li—S cells have the opportunity to provide a significantly higher energy density (a product of capacity and voltage). Assuming complete reaction to Li<sub>2</sub>S, energy densities values can approach 2,500 Wh/kg and 2,800 Wh/l, respectively, based on the combined Li and S weight or volume. If based on the total cell weight or volume, the energy densities of optimally designed Li—S cell configurations can reach approximately 1,000 Wh/kg and 1,100 Wh/l, respectively. However, the current Li-sulfur cells reported by industry leaders in sulfur cathode technology have a maximum cell specific energy of 250-400 Wh/kg (based on the total cell weight), which is far below what is possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In summary, despite its considerable advantages, the Li—S cell is plagued with several major technical:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">(1) Conventional lithium metal cells still have dendrite formation and related internal shorting issues.</li> <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0007">(2) Sulfur or sulfur-containing organic compounds are highly insulating, both electrically and ionically. To enable a reversible electrochemical reaction at high current densities or charge/discharge rates, the sulfur must maintain intimate contact with an electrically conductive additive. Various carbon-sulfur composites have been utilized for this purpose, but only with limited success owing to the limited scale of the contact area. Typical reported capacities are between 300 and 550 mAh/g (based on the cathode carbon-sulfur composite weight) at moderate rates.</li> <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0008">(3) The cell tends to exhibit significant capacity decay during discharge-charge cycling. This is mainly due to the high solubility of the lithium polysulfide anions formed as reaction intermediates during both discharge and charge processes in the polar organic solvents used in electrolytes. During cycling, the lithium polysulfide anions can migrate through the separator to the Li negative electrode whereupon they are reduced to solid precipitates (Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2 </sub>and/or Li<sub>2</sub>S), causing active mass loss. In addition, the solid product that precipitates on the surface of the positive electrode during discharge becomes electrochemically irreversible, which also contributes to active mass loss.</li> <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0009">(4) More generally speaking, a significant drawback with cells containing cathodes comprising elemental sulfur, organosulfur and carbon-sulfur materials relates to the dissolution and excessive out-diffusion of soluble sulfides, polysulfides, organo-sulfides, carbon-sulfides and/or carbon-polysulfides (hereinafter referred to as anionic reduction products) from the cathode into the rest of the cell. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the Shuttle Effect. This process leads to several problems: high self-discharge rates, loss of cathode capacity, corrosion of current collectors and electrical leads leading to loss of electrical contact to active cell components, fouling of the anode surface giving rise to malfunction of the anode, and clogging of the pores in the cell membrane separator which leads to loss of ion transport and large increases in internal resistance in the cell.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0010">In response to these challenges, new electrolytes, protective films for the lithium anode, and solid electrolytes have been developed. Some interesting cathode developments have been reported recently to contain lithium polysulfides; but, their performance still fall short of what is required for practical applications. Despite the various approaches proposed for the fabrication of high energy density Li—S cells, there remains a need for cathode materials, production processes, and cell operation methods that retard the out-diffusion of S or lithium polysulfide from the cathode compartments into other components in these cells, improve the utilization of electro-active cathode materials (S utilization efficiency), and provide rechargeable Li—S cells with high capacities over a large number of cycles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0011">Most significantly, lithium metal (including pure lithium, lithium alloys of high lithium content with other metal elements, or lithium-containing compounds with a high lithium content; e.g. &gt;80% or preferably &gt;90% by weight Li) still provides the highest anode specific capacity as compared to essentially all other anode active materials (except pure silicon, but silicon has pulverization issues). Lithium metal would be an ideal anode material in a lithium-sulfur secondary battery if dendrite related issues could be addressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0012">Sodium metal (Na) and potassium metal (K) have similar chemical characteristics to Li and the sulfur cathode in room temperature sodium-sulfur cells (RT Na—S batteries) or potassium-sulfur cells (K—S) face the same issues observed in Li—S batteries, such as: (i) low active material utilization rate, (ii) poor cycle life, and (iii) low Coulombic efficiency. Again, these drawbacks arise mainly from insulating nature of S, dissolution of S and Na or K polysulfide intermediates in liquid electrolytes (and related Shuttle effect), and large volume change during charge/discharge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0013">Hence, an object of the present invention is to provide a rechargeable alkali metal battery (e.g., Li—S, Na—S, and K—S battery) that exhibits an exceptionally high specific energy or high energy density. One particular technical goal of the present invention is to provide an alkali metal-sulfur or alkali ion-sulfur cell with a cell specific energy greater than 400 Wh/kg, preferably greater than 500 Wh/kg, and more preferably greater than 600 Wh/kg (all based on the total cell weight).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0014">Another object of the present invention is to provide an alkali metal-sulfur cell that exhibits a high cathode specific capacity (higher than 1,200 mAh/g based on the sulfur weight, or higher than 1,000 mAh/g based on the cathode composite weight, including sulfur, conducting additive or substrate, and binder weights combined, but excluding the weight of cathode current collector). The specific capacity is preferably higher than 1,400 mAh/g based on the sulfur weight alone or higher than 1,200 mAh/g based on the cathode composite weight. This must be accompanied by a high specific energy, good resistance to dendrite formation, and a long and stable cycle life.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0015">It may be noted that in most of the open literature reports (scientific papers) and patent documents, scientists or inventors choose to express the cathode specific capacity based on the sulfur or lithium polysulfide weight alone (not the total cathode composite weight), but unfortunately a large proportion of non-active materials (those not capable of storing lithium, such as conductive additive and binder) is typically used in their Li—S cells. For practical use purposes, it is more meaningful to use the cathode composite weight-based capacity value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0016">A specific object of the present invention is to provide a rechargeable alkali metal-sulfur cell based on rational materials and battery designs that overcome or significantly reduce the following issues commonly associated with conventional Li—S and room temperature Na—S cells: (a) dendrite formation (internal shorting); (b) extremely low electric and ionic conductivities of sulfur, requiring large proportion (typically 30-55%) of non-active conductive fillers and having significant proportion of non-accessible or non-reachable sulfur or alkali metal polysulfides); (c) poor sulfur utilization efficiency; (d) dissolution of S and alkali metal polysulfide in electrolyte; (e) migration of alkali metal polysulfides from the cathode to the anode (which irreversibly react with Li, Na, or K at the anode), resulting in active material loss and capacity decay (the shuttle effect); and (f) short cycle life.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0047">The cathode-protecting layer is implemented mainly for the purpose of reducing or eliminating the shuttling effect by preventing S or polysulfide from migrating out of the cathode zone and into the anode zone.

This effectively reduces or eliminates the shuttling effect. This cathode-protecting layer, being highly elastic, also acts to maintain a good contact between the separator (if liquid or gel electrolyte is used) or the solid-state electrolyte and the cathode active material layer. Due to the large volume expansion/shrinkage of the S cathode, this elastic layer expands and shrinks congruently or conformably with the cathode active material layer, thereby preventing the formation of a gap between the separator (or solid-state electrolyte) and the cathode active material layer.</div>

Examples are presented for Li—S cells, room-temperature Na—S cells, and K—S cells.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">A. Alkali Metal-Sulfur Cells (Using Lithium-Sulfur Cells as an Example)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0060">The specific capacity and specific energy of a Li—S cell (or Na—S, or K—S cell) are dictated by the actual amount of sulfur that can be implemented in the cathode active layer (relative to other non-active ingredients, such as the binder resin and conductive filler) and the utilization rate of this sulfur amount (i.e. the utilization efficiency of the cathode active material or the actual proportion of S that actively participates in storing and releasing lithium ions). Using Li—S cell as an illustrative example, a high-capacity and high-energy Li—S cell requires a high amount of S in the cathode active layer (i.e. relative to the amounts of non-active materials, such as the binder resin, conductive additive, and other modifying or supporting materials) and a high S utilization efficiency). The present invention provides such a cathode active layer, its constituent powder mass product, the resulting Li—S cell, and a method of producing such a cathode active layer and battery.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0073">A sulfonated elastomer is a high-elasticity material, which exhibits an elastic deformation that is at least 2% when measured under uniaxial tension (without an additive or reinforcement in the polymer, but can contain a lithium salt and/or liquid solvent dispersed in the polymer). In the field of materials science and engineering, the “elastic deformation” is defined as a deformation of a material (when being mechanically stressed) that is essentially fully recoverable and the recovery is essentially instantaneous upon release of the load.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0074">In some embodiments, a conductive sulfonated elastomer composite is implemented between an anode active layer and the porous separator layer (wherein a liquid electrolyte, polymer gel electrolyte, quasi-solid electrolyte, or other liquid-containing electrolyte is used). This anode-protecting layer is disposed between the anode active layer and a solid-state electrolyte zone or layer if no liquid is included in the electrolyte phase of the battery. This anode-protecting layer may be preimpregnated with a liquid electrolyte; any kind of electrolyte commonly used in an alkali metal-sulfur battery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0075">Not to be bound by theory, but the applicants believe that the anode-protecting layer is capable of performing at least the following three functions:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0076">1) Being highly elastic, the sulfonated elastomer composite layer helps to maintain a good contact between an alkali metal layer (e.g. lithium metal foil, as the anode active material) and an electrolyte phase (e.g. an electrolyte/separator assembly or a solid-state electrolyte phase) when the alkali metal layer decreases in thickness (e.g. due to dissolution of Li in the electrolyte when the battery is discharged) or increases in thickness (e.g. due to re-deposition of lithium metal back to the Cu foil or lithium metal when the battery is recharged). The same function also works for the alkali metal-sulfur cell containing lithiated Si particles as an anode active material, as an example. Si particles and the entire anode active material layer can shrink and expand when the battery is discharged or charged. The sulfonated elastomer composite can expand and shrink responsive to the shrinkage and expansion of the anode active material layer. Such a conformal or congruent expansion/shrinkage of the sulfonated elastomer composite helps to eliminate the potential gap between the anode active material layer and the electrolyte or separator, thereby maintaining the lithium ion migration paths required of an operational Li—S battery.</li> <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0077">2) The sulfonated elastomer matrix, infiltrated with a liquid electrolyte (before, during, or after the cell is fabricated) and coupled with its high-elasticity nature (good electrode-electrolyte contact), enables the returning alkali metal ions (e.g. Li<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> ions) to uniformly and successfully deposit back to the alkali metal surface, reducing the formation of dead lithium particles (or dead sodium particles), which otherwise become inactive. The uniform deposition of alkali metal also reduces the tendency to form the dangerous Li or Na dendrite.</li> <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0078">3) The presence of the conductive reinforcement material (graphene sheets, CNTs, CNFs, etc.) are high strength materials, capable of stopping or deflecting the growth of dendrites (if initiated), preventing the dendrite from penetrating the separator and reaching the cathode side to induce internal shorting, which otherwise is a fire and explosion hazard.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0079">Not to be bound by theory, but the applicants further believe that the cathode-protecting layer is capable of performing at least the following two functions:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0080">1) Sulfur and lithium polysulfide, and the entire cathode active material layer, can expand and shrink when the battery is discharged or charged. The sulfonated elastomer composite layer implemented between the cathode active material layer and the separator layer (or the solid-state electrolyte phase) can shrink and expand responsive to the expansion and shrinkage of the cathode active material layer. Such a conformal or congruent expansion/shrinkage of the sulfonated elastomer composite helps to eliminate the potential gap between the cathode active material layer and the electrolyte or separator, thereby maintaining the lithium ion migration paths required of an operational Li—S battery.</li> <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0081">2) The conductive material-reinforced sulfonated elastomer also acts to trap and block the sulfur or metal polysulfide species dissolved in the electrolyte, prevents continuing migration of these species to the anode side where they react with lithium (or sodium, or potassium) and are unable to return to the cathode (the shuttle effect). This shuttle effect is mainly responsible for continued and rapid capacity decay in a conventional Li—S, room-temperature Na—S, or K—S cell.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0082">Alternatively, referring to the lower portion of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, lithium sulfide is used as the cathode active material. A layer of sulfonated elastomer composite may encapsulate around the lithium polysulfide particle to form a core-shell structure. When the Li—S battery is charged and lithium ions are released from the cathode, the cathode active material particle contracts. However, the sulfonated elastomer composite is capable of elastically shrinking in a conformal manner; hence, leaving behind no gap between the protective shell and the sulfur. Such a configuration is amenable to subsequent lithium reaction with sulfur. The sulfonated elastomer composite shell expands and shrinks congruently with the expansion and shrinkage of the encapsulated core cathode active material particle, enabling long-term cycling stability of a Li—S or Na—S battery.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0083">Preferably and typically, the sulfonated elastomer composite has a lithium ion conductivity no less than 10<sup>−6 </sup>S/cm, more preferably no less than 10<sup>−4 </sup>S/cm, further preferably no less than 10<sup>−3 </sup>S/cm, and most preferably no less than 10<sup>−2 </sup>S/cm. In some embodiments, the sulfonated elastomer composite contains no other additive or filler dispersed therein (other than the conductive reinforcement material, such as graphene sheets, CNTs, CNFs, carbon fibers). In others, the sulfonated elastomer composite contains from 0.1% to 50% (preferably 1% to 35%) by weight of a lithium ion-conducting additive dispersed in a sulfonated elastomer matrix material. The sulfonated elastomer composite must have a high elasticity (elastic deformation strain value &gt;2%). An elastic deformation is a deformation that is fully recoverable and the recovery process is essentially instantaneous (no significant time delay). The sulfonated elastomer composite can exhibit an elastic deformation from 5% up to 800% (8 times of its original length), more typically from 10% to 500%, and further more typically from 30% to 300%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0084">It may be noted that although a metal or a plastic typically has a high ductility (i.e. can be extended to a large strain without breakage), the majority of the deformation is plastic deformation (non-recoverable) and only a small amount of elastic deformation (typically &lt;1% and more typically &lt;0.2%). Thus, a metal or a plastic does not qualify as a high-elasticity material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0085">Further, we have unexpectedly discovered that the presence of an amount of a lithium salt or sodium salt (1-35% by weight) and a liquid solvent (0-50%) can significantly increase the lithium-ion or sodium ion conductivity of the sulfonated elastomer matrix.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0086">The first step for producing a sulfonated elastomer composite layer is to dissolve an elastomer or its precursor (e.g. uncured oligomer or polymer) in a solvent to form a polymer solution. Subsequently, the conductive reinforcement material and other additive are dispersed in this polymer solution to form a suspension (dispersion or slurry). This suspension can then be subjected to a film-forming procedure (e.g. spraying, printing, casting, coating, etc.) and a solvent removal treatment. The elastomer precursor is then cured or polymerized.</div>

Alternatively, one may dispense and deposit a layer of a first sulfonated elastomer composite onto a primary surface of a separator layer and/or a layer of a second sulfonated elastomer composite to the other (opposing) primary surface of the separator layer. Further alternatively, one may prepare separate free-standing discrete layers of the first or second sulfonated elastomer composite first.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0092">Some elastomers are saturated rubbers that cannot be cured by sulfur vulcanization; they are made into a rubbery or elastomeric material via different means: e.g. by having a copolymer domain that holds other linear chains together. Each of these elastomers can be used to encapsulate particles of an anode active material by one of several means: melt mixing (followed by pelletizing and ball-milling, for instance), solution mixing (dissolving the anode active material particles in an uncured polymer, monomer, or oligomer, with or without an organic solvent) followed by drying (e.g. spray drying), interfacial polymerization, or in situ polymerization of elastomer in the presence of anode active material particles.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0095">Sulfonation of an elastomer or rubber may be conducted before, during, or after curing of the elastomer or rubber. Further, sulfonation of the elastomer or rubber may be conducted before or after the particles of an electrode active material are embraced or encapsulated by the elastomer/rubber or its precursor (monomer or oligomer). Sulfonation of an elastomer or rubber may be accomplished by exposing the elastomer/rubber to a sulfonation agent in a solution state or melt state, in a batch manner or in a continuous process. The sulfonating agent may be selected from sulfuric acid, sulfonic acid, sulfur trioxide, chlorosulfonic acid, a bisulfate, a sulfate (e.g. zinc sulfate, acetyl sulfate, etc.), a mixture thereof, or a mixture thereof with another chemical species (e.g. acetic anhydride, thiolacetic acid, or other types of acids, etc.). In addition to zinc sulfate, there are a wide variety of metal sulfates that may be used as a sulfonating agent; e.g. those sulfates containing Mg, Ca, Co, Li, Ba, Na, Pb, Ni, Fe, Mn, K, Hg, Cr, and other transition metals, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0096">For instance, a triblock copolymer, poly(styrene-isobutylene-styrene) or SIBS, may be sulfonated to several different levels ranging from 0.36 to 2.04 mequiv./g (13 to 82 mol % of styrene; styrene being 19 mol % of the unsulfonated block copolymer). Sulfonation of SIBS may be performed in solution with acetyl sulfate as the sulfonating agent. First, acetic anhydride reacts with sulfuric acid to form acetyl sulfate (a sulfonating agent) and acetic acid (a by-product). Then, excess water is removed since anhydrous conditions are required for sulfonation of SIBS. The SIBS is then mixed with the mixture of acetyl sulfate and acetic acid. Such a sulfonation reaction produces sulfonic acid substituted to the para-position of the aromatic ring in the styrene block of the polymer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0102">The ionic liquid is composed of ions only. Ionic liquids are low melting temperature salts that are in a molten or liquid state when above a desired temperature. For instance, a salt is considered as an ionic liquid if its melting point is below 100° C. If the melting temperature is equal to or lower than room temperature (25° C.), the salt is referred to as a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL). The IL salts are characterized by weak interactions, due to the combination of a large cation and a charge-delocalized anion. This results in a low tendency to crystallize due to flexibility (anion) and asymmetry (cation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0103">A typical and well-known ionic liquid is formed by the combination of a 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMI) cation and an N,N-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide (TFSI) anion.

This implies a generally low volatility and non-flammability and, hence, a much safer electrolyte for batteries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0104">Ionic liquids are basically composed of organic ions that come in an essentially unlimited number of structural variations owing to the preparation ease of a large variety of their components. Thus, various kinds of salts can be used to design the ionic liquid that has the desired properties for a given application. These include, among others, imidazolium, pyrrolidinium and quaternary ammonium salts as cations and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide, bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, and hexafluorophosphate as anions. Based on their compositions, ionic liquids come in different classes that basically include aprotic, protic and zwitterionic types, each one suitable for a specific application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0105">Common cations of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) include, but not limited to, tetraalkylammonium, di-, tri-, and tetra-alkylimidazolium, alkylpyridinium, dialkyl-pyrrolidinium, dialkylpiperidinium, tetraalkylphosphonium, and trialkylsulfonium.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0106">RTILs can possess archetypical properties such as high intrinsic ionic conductivity, high thermal stability, low volatility, low (practically zero) vapor pressure, non-flammability, the ability to remain liquid at a wide range of temperatures above and below room temperature, high polarity, high viscosity, and wide electrochemical windows. These properties, except for the high viscosity, are desirable attributes when it comes to using an RTIL as an electrolyte ingredient (a salt and/or a solvent) in a Li—S cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0107">In the presently invented alkali metal-sulfur cell, the cathode active layer comprises sulfur or a sulfur-containing compound preferably supported by or embedded in a conducting material, forming a sulfur-carbon hybrid, sulfur-graphite hybrid, sulfur-graphene hybrid, conducting polymer-sulfur hybrid, metal sulfide, sulfur compound, etc. These hybrid or compound materials are produced in the form of particles that contain a mixture, blend, composite, or bonded entity of sulfur or sulfide with a carbon, graphite, graphene, or conducting polymer material. Metal sulfides (e.g. lithium polysulfide, sodium polysulfide, etc.) and sulfur compounds are readily available in a fine particle form. Sulfur can be combined with a conducting material (carbon, graphite, graphene, and/or conducting polymer) to form a composite, mixture, or bonded entity (e.g. sulfur bonded on graphene oxide surface).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0108">There are many well-known procedures that can be used to make the aforementioned sulfur-containing materials into particles. For instance, one may mix solid sulfur with a carbon or graphite material to form composite particles using ball-milling. The resulting particles are typically ellipsoidal or potato-like in shape having a size from 1 to 20 am. Also, one may infiltrate S or sulfide into the pores of porous carbon or graphite particles (e.g. activated carbon, mesoporous carbon, activated carbon fibers, etc.) using vapor phase infiltration, solution infiltration, chemical infiltration, or electrochemical infiltration. Alternatively, one may deposit sulfur onto surfaces of graphene sheets, CNTs, carbon nanofibers, etc. and then form these S-coated nanomaterials into a spherical or ellipsoidal shape using high-intensity ball-milling, spray-drying (of their suspensions), aerosol formation, etc. These particles are then encapsulated with a sulfonated elastomer composite using the micro-encapsulation processes discussed above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0109">The cathode in a conventional Li—S cell typically has less than 70% by weight of sulfur in a composite cathode composed of sulfur and the conductive additive/support. Even when the sulfur content in the prior art composite cathode reaches or exceeds 70% by weight, the specific capacity of the composite cathode is typically significantly lower than what is expected based on theoretical predictions. For instance, the theoretical specific capacity of sulfur is 1,675 mAh/g. A composite cathode composed of 70% sulfur (S) and 30% carbon black (CB), without any binder, should be capable of storing up to 1,675×70%=1,172 mAh/g. Unfortunately, the observed specific capacity is typically less than 75% or 879 mAh/g (often less than 50% or 586 mAh/g in this example) of what could be achieved. In other words, the active material (S) utilization rate is typically less than 75% (or even &lt;50%). This has been a major issue in the art of Li—S cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0110">Thus, it is highly advantageous to obtain a high sulfur loading and yet, concurrently, maintaining an ultra-thin/small thickness/diameter of sulfur for significantly enhanced sulfur utilization efficiency, energy density and power density. For instance, one can deposit nanoscaled sulfur (1-5 nm thick) on graphene surfaces using chemical, electrochemical, or vapor deposition to form S-coated or S-bonded graphene sheets. These S-coated or S-bonded graphene sheets are then aggregated together using a tumbling mixing, ball-milling, or spraying procedure. These steps enable the preparation of S-conducting material hybrids that contain 85%-99% by weight sulfur, yet maintaining a coating thickness or particle diameter from 1 nm to 5 nm. This ultra-small dimension enables fast lithium diffusion and lithium-sulfur reactions, leading to high S utilization efficiency (hence, high energy density) even at high charge-discharge rates. Several procedures of producing such small S particles or coating are illustrated in examples of this specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0111">Again, the shuttling effect is related to the tendency for sulfur or alkali metal polysulfide that forms at the cathode to get dissolved in the solvent and for the dissolved lithium polysulfide species to migrate from the cathode to the anode, where they irreversibly react with lithium to form species that prevent sulfide from returning back to the cathode during the subsequent discharge operation of the Li—S cell (the detrimental shuttling effect). It appears that by implementing a cathode-protecting layer of a sulfonated elastomer composite, we have significantly reduced and even eliminated the shuttling effect, resulting in an alkali metal battery that has an exceptionally long cycle-life. We have addressed a critical, long-standing issue of alkali metal-sulfur batteries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0112">In all versions of the above-discussed alkali metal-sulfur cells, the anode active material may contain, as an example, lithium metal foil (or powder) or a high-capacity Si, Sn, Al, or SnO<sub>2 </sub>capable of storing a great amount of lithium. The cathode active material may contain pure sulfur (if the anode active material contains lithium), lithium polysulfide, or any sulfur containing compound, molecule, or polymer. If the cathode active material includes lithium-containing species (e.g. lithium polysulfide) when the cell is made, the anode active material can be any material capable of storing a large amount of lithium (e.g. Si, Ge, Sn, Al, SnO<sub>2</sub>, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0113">At the anode side, when lithium metal is used as the sole anode active material in a Li—S cell, there is concern about the formation of lithium dendrites, which could lead to internal shorting and thermal runaway. Herein, we have used two approaches, separately or in combination, to address this dendrite formation issue: one involving the use of a protecting layer containing a sulfonated elastomer composite discussed above and the other the use of a nanostructure composed of conductive nanofilaments as an extended anode current collector. For the latter, multiple conductive nanofilaments are processed to form an integrated aggregate structure, preferably in the form of a closely packed web, mat, or paper, characterized in that these filaments are intersected, overlapped, or somehow bonded (e.g., using a binder material) to one another to form a network of electron-conducting paths. The integrated structure has substantially interconnected pores to accommodate electrolyte. The nanofilament may be selected from, as examples, a carbon nanofiber (CNF), graphite nanofiber (GNF), carbon nanotube (CNT), metal nanowire (MNW), conductive nanofibers obtained by electrospinning, conductive electrospun composite nanofibers, nanoscaled graphene platelet (NGP), or a combination thereof. The nanofilaments may be bonded by a binder material selected from a polymer, coal tar pitch, petroleum pitch, mesophase pitch, coke, or a derivative thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0114">Nanofibers may be selected from the group consisting of an electrically conductive electrospun polymer fiber, electrospun polymer nanocomposite fiber comprising a conductive filler, nanocarbon fiber obtained from carbonization of an electrospun polymer fiber, electrospun pitch fiber, and combinations thereof. For instance, a nanostructured electrode can be obtained by electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) into polymer nanofibers, followed by carbonization of PAN.

This thin layer of graphene was then exposed to sublimation-generated physical vapor deposition. Sublimation of solid sulfur occurs at a temperature greater than 40° C., but a significant and practically useful sublimation rate typically does not occur until the temperature is above 100° C.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0127">In a typical procedure, a metal polysulfide (M<sub>x</sub>S<sub>y</sub>) was dissolved in a solvent (e.g. mixture of DOL/DME in a volume ratio from 1:3 to 3:1) to form an electrolyte solution. An amount of a lithium salt may be optionally added, but this is not required for external electrochemical deposition. A wide variety of solvents can be utilized for this purpose and there is no theoretical limit to what type of solvents can be used; any solvent can be used provided that there is some solubility of the metal polysulfide in this desired solvent. A greater solubility would mean a larger amount of sulfur can be derived from the electrolyte solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0128">The electrolyte solution was then poured into a chamber or reactor under a dry and controlled atmosphere condition (e.g. He or nitrogen gas). A metal foil was used as the anode and a layer of the porous structure as the cathode; both being immersed in the electrolyte solution. This configuration constitutes an electrochemical impregnation and deposition system. The step of electrochemically impregnating sulfur into pores was conducted at a current density in the range from 1 mA/g to 10 A/g, based on the layer weight of the porous carbon/graphite particles/fibers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0129">The chemical reactions that occur in this reactor may be represented by the following equation: M<sub>x</sub>S<sub>y</sub>→M<sub>x</sub>S<sub>y-z</sub>+zS (typically z=1-4). The sulfur coating thickness or particle diameter and the amount of S coating/particles impregnated may be controlled by the electrochemical reaction current density, temperature and time. In general, a lower current density and lower reaction temperature lead to a more uniform impregnation of S and the reactions are easier to control. A longer reaction time leads to a larger amount of S saturated in the pores. Additionally, the electrochemical method is capable of rapidly converting the impregnated S into metal polysulfide (lithium polysulfide, sodium polysulfide, and potassium polysulfide, etc.).</div>

Then, 0.72 g elemental S was suspended in the Na<sub>2</sub>S solution and stirred with a magnetic stirrer for about 2 hours at room temperature. The color of the solution changed slowly to orange-yellow as the sulfur dissolved.

Subsequently, the Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>x </sub>solution was added to the above-prepared dispersions in the presence of 5 wt % surfactant cetyl trimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB), the as-prepared carbon fiber/Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>x </sub>blended solution was sonicated for another 2 hours and then titrated into 100 ml of 2 mol/L HCOOH solution at a rate of 30-40 drops/min and stirred for 2 hours.
