<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to implants, and more particularly to flexible chain implants for augmenting or supporting bones or other structures, such as, for example vertebral discs.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Vertebral compression fractures, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, represent a generally common spinal injury and may result in prolonged disability. These fractures involve collapsing of one or more vertebral bodies <b>12</b> in the spine <b>10</b>. Compression fractures of the spine usually occur in the lower vertebrae of the thoracic spine or the upper vertebra of the lumbar spine. They generally involve fracture of the anterior portion <b>18</b> of the affected vertebra <b>12</b> (as opposed to the posterior side <b>16</b>). Spinal compression fractures can result in deformation of the normal alignment or curvature, e.g., lordosis, of vertebral bodies in the affected area of the spine. Spinal compression fractures and/or related spinal deformities can result, for example, from metastatic diseases of the spine, from trauma or can be associated with osteoporosis. Until recently, doctors were limited in how they could treat such compression fractures and related deformities. Pain medications, bed rest, bracing or invasive spinal surgery were the only options available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">More recently, minimally invasive surgical procedures for treating vertebral compression fractures have been developed. These procedures generally involve the use of a cannula or other access tool inserted into the posterior of the effected vertebral body, usually through the pedicles. The most basic of these procedures is vertebroplasty, which literally means fixing the vertebral body, and may be done without first repositioning the bone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Briefly, a cannula or special bone needle is passed slowly through the soft tissues of the back. Image guided x-ray, along with a small amount of x-ray dye, allows the position of the needle to be seen at all times. A small amount of polyrnethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or other orthopedic cement is pushed through the needle into the vertebral body. PMMA is a medical grade substance that has been used for many years in a variety of orthopedic procedures. Generally, the cement is mixed with an antibiotic to reduce the risk of infection, and a powder containing barium ortantalum, which allows it to be seen on the X-ray.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Vertebroplasty can be effective in the reduction or elimination of fracture pain, prevention of further collapse, and a return to mobility in patients. However, this procedure may not reposition the fractured bone and therefore may not address the problem of spinal deformity due to the fracture. It generally is not performed except in situations where the kyphosis between adjacent vertebral bodies in the affected area is less than 10 percent. Moreover, this procedure requires high-pressure cement injection using low-viscosity cement, and may lead to cement leaks in 30-80% of procedures, according to recent studies. In most cases, the cement leakage does no harm. In rare cases, however, polymethyrnethacrylate or other cement leaks into the spinal canal or the perivertebral venous system and causes pulmonary embolism, resulting in death of the patient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">More advanced treatments for vertebral compression fractures generally involve two phases: (1) reposition, or restoration of the original height of the vertebral body and consequent lordotic correction of the spinal curvature; and (2) augmentation, or addition of material to support or strengthen the fractured or collapsed bone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">One such treatment, balloon kyphoplasty (Kyphon, Inc.), is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,423,083, 6,248,110, and 6,235,043 to Riley et al., each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. A catheter having an expandable balloon tip is inserted through a cannula, sheath or other introducer into a central portion of a fractured vertebral body comprising relatively soft cancellous bone surrounded by fractured cortical bone. Kyphoplasty then achieves the reconstruction of the lordosis, or normal curvature, by inflating the balloon, which expands within the vertebral body restoring it to its original height. The balloon is removed, leaving a void within the vertebral body, and PMMA or other filler material is then injected through the cannula into the void as described above with respect to vertebroplasty. The cannula is removed and the cement cures to augment, fill or fix the bone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Disadvantages of this procedure include the high cost, the repositioning of the endplates of the vertebral body may be lost after the removal of the balloon catheter, and the possible perforation of the vertebral endplates during the procedure. As with vertebroplasty, perhaps the most feared, albeit remote, complications concerning kyphoplasty are related to leakage of bone cement. For example, a neurologic deficit may occur through leakage of bone cement into the spinal canal. Such a cement leak may occur through the low resistance veins of the vertebral body or through a crack in the bone which was not appreciated previously. Other complications include additional adjacent level vertebral fractures, infection and cement embolization. Cement embolization occurs by a similar mechanism to a cement leak. The cement may be forced into the low resistance venous system and travel to the lungs or brain resulting in a pulmonary embolism or stroke.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Another approach for treating vertebral compression fractures is the Optimesh system (Spineology, Inc., Stillwater, Minn.), which provides minimally invasive delivery of a cement or allograft or autograft bone using an expandable mesh graft balloon, or containment device, within the involved vertebral body. The balloon graft remains inside the vertebral body after its inflation, which prevents an intraoperative loss of reposition, such as can occur during a kyphoplasty procedure when the balloon is withdrawn. One drawback of this system, however, is that the mesh implant is not well integrated in the vertebral body. This can lead to relative motion between the implant and vertebral body, and consequently to a postoperative loss of reposition. Additional details regarding this procedure may be found, for example, in published U.S. Patent Publication Number 20040073308, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another procedure used in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures is an inflatable polymer augmentation mass known as a SKy Bone Expander. This device can be expanded up to a pre-designed size and (Cubic or Trapezoid) configuration in a controlled manner. Like the Kyphon balloon, once optimal vertebra height and void are achieved, the SKy Bone Expander is removed and PMMA cement or other filler is injected into the void. This procedure therefore entails many of the same drawbacks and deficiencies described above with respect to kyphoplasty.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In some cases of fractured or otherwise damaged bones, bone grafts are used to repair or otherwise treat the damaged area. In the United States alone, approximately half a million bone grafting procedures are performed annually, directed to a diverse array of medical interventions for complications such as fractures involving bone loss, injuries or other conditions necessitating immobilization by fusion (such as for the spine or joints), and other bone defects that may be present due to trauma. infection, or disease. Bone grafting involves the surgical transplantation of pieces of bone within the body, and generally is effectuated through the use of graft material acquired from a human source. This is primarily due to the limited applicability of xenografts, transplants from another species.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Orthopedic autografts or autogenous grafts involve source bone acquired from the same individual that will receive the transplantation. Thus, this type of transplant moves bony material from one location in a body to another location in the same body, and has the advantage of producing minimal immunological complications. It is not always possible or even desirable to use an autograft. The acquisition of bone material from the body of a patient typically requires a separate operation from the implantation procedure. Furthermore, the removal of material, oftentimes involving the use of healthy material from the pelvic area or ribs, has the tendency to result in additional patient discomfort during rehabilitation, particularly at the location of the material removal. Grafts formed from synthetic material have also been developed, but the difficulty in mimicking the properties of bone limits the efficacy of these implants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">As a result of the challenges posed by autografts and synthetic grafts, many orthopedic procedures alternatively involve the use of allografts, which are bone grafts from other human sources (normally cadavers). The bone grafts, for example, are placed in a host bone and serve as the substructure for supporting new bone tissue growth from the host bone. The grafts are sculpted to assume a shape that is appropriate for insertion at the fracture or defect area, and often require fixation to that area for example by screws, pins, cement, cages, membranes, etc. Due to the availability of allograft source material, and the widespread acceptance of this material in the medical community, the use of allograft tissues is likely to expand in the field of musculoskeletal surgery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Notably, the various bones of the body such as the femur (thigh), tibia and fibula (leg), humerus (upper arm), radius and ulna (lower arm) have geometries that vary considerably. In addition, the lengths of these bones vary; for example, in an adult the lengths may vary from 47 centimeters (femur) to 26 centimeters (radius). Furthermore, the shape of the cross section of each type of bone varies considerably, as does the shape of any given bone over its length. While a femur has a generally rounded outer shape, a tibia has a generally triangular outer shape. Also, the wall thickness varies in different areas of the cross-section of each bone. Thus, the use of any given bone to produce an implant component may be a function of the bone's dimensions and geometry. Machining of bones, however, may permit the production of implant components with standardized or custom dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">As a collagen-rich and mineralized tissue, bone is composed of about forty percent organic material (mainly collagen), with the remainder being inorganic material (mainly a near-hydroxyapatite composition resembling 3Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>). Structurally, the collagen assumes a fibril formation, with hydroxyapatite crystals disposed along the length of the fibril, and the individual fibrils are disposed parallel to each other forming fibers. Depending on the type of bone, the fibrils are either interwoven, or arranged in lamellae that are disposed perpendicular to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Bone tissues have a complex design, and there are substantial variations in the properties of bone tissues depending upon the type of bone (i.e., leg, arm, vertebra) as well as the overall structure. For example, when tested in the longitudinal direction, leg and arm bones have a modulus of elasticity of about 17 to 19 GPa, while vertebra tissue has a modulus of elasticity of less than 1 GPa. The tensile strength of leg and arm bones varies between about 120 MPa and about 150 MPa, while vertebra have a tensile strength of less than 4 MPa. Notably, the compressive strength ofbone varies, with the femur and humerus each having a maximum compressive strength of about 167 MPa and 132 MPa respectively. Again, the vertebra have a far lower compressive strength usually of no more than about 1 0 MPa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">With respect to the overall structure of a given bone, the mechanical properties vary throughout the bone. For example, a long bone (leg bone) such as the femur has both compact bone and spongy bone. Cortical bone, the compact and dense bone that surrounds the marrow cavity, is generally solid and thus carries the majority of the load in major bones. Cancellous bone, the spongy inner bone, is generally porous and ductile, and when compared to cortical bone is only about one-third to one-quarter as dense, one-tenth to one-twentieth as stiff, but five times as ductile. While cancellous bone has a tensile strength of about 10-20 MPa and a density of about 0.7 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, cortical bone has a tensile strength of about 100-200 MPa and a density of about 2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, the strain to failure of cancellous bone is about 5-7%, while cortical bone can only withstand 1-3% strain before failure. It should also be noted that these mechanical characteristics may degrade as a result of numerous factors such as any chemical treatment applied to the bone material, and the manner of storage after removal but prior to implantation (i.e. drying of the bone).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Notably, implants of cancellous bone incorporate more readily with the surrounding host bone, due to the superior osteoconductive nature of cancellous bone as compared to cortical bone. Furthermore, cancellous bone from different regions of the body is known to have a range of porosities. For example, cancellous bone in the iliac crest has a different porosity than cancellous bone in a femoral head. Thus, the design of an implant using cancellous bone may be tailored to specifically incorporate material of a desired porosity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">There remains a need in the art to provide safe and effective devices and methods for augmentation of fractured or otherwise damaged vertebrae and other bones, preferably devices that may be implanted utilizing minimally invasive methods of implantation.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">A flexible chain according to one embodiment comprises a series or other plurality of preferably solid, substantially non-flexible body portions (also referred to as bodies or beads) and a series of flexible link portions (also referred to as links or struts). The preferably solid, substantially non-flexible body portions preferably are capable of withstanding loads that are applied in any direction, and the flexible link portions of the implant preferably are disposed between the substantially non-flexible body portions and preferably are flexible in any direction, although they may be flexible in only selected or desired directions. The bodies may be substantially solid, semi-solid or hollow and preferable of sufficient strength to support the loads typical for the body location in which they are implanted. The link portions may be solid, semi-solid, or hollow and preferably of sufficient flexibility to allow the adjacent bodies to touch one another upon bending of the elongate member or chain. The material of both portions, the flexible link and non-flexible body portions, preferably is the same and form one single, flexible monolithic chain (FMC).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In one aspect of the invention, an apparatus for augmentation of body tissue, for example bone, comprises a flexible elongated member, or chain, having a longitudinal length substantially larger than its height or its width. The flexible elongated member comprises a plurality of substantially non-flexible bodies and a plurality of substantially flexible links interconnecting the bodies. The bodies and links are connected end-to-end to form the elongated member, wherein the elongated member is formed of a biocompatible material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The bodies may be different sizes and shapes than the links or they may be the same shape, same size, or both. In addition, each body and link may be a different size and shape than other bodies or links. In one embodiment, the beads can be shaped so that they can fit together to minimize interstial spaces. For example, the beads may be shaped as cubes or other polyhedrals that can be stacked together in such a way that there is little space between beads, or a predetermined percentage range of interstial space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The elongated member may be formed as an integral monolithic chain, which may be formed of bone, such as, for example, allograft bone. The flexible links may be formed of bone that has been demineralized to a greater extent than the bodies. Optionally, a coating may be applied to at least a portion of the elongated member, e.g. a coating comprising a therapeutic agent, a bone cement, an antibiotic, a bone growth stimulating substance, bone morphogenic protein (BMP) or any combination thereof. Therapeutic agents, or drug agents (e.g., antibodies), or biologics (e.g., one or more BMPs) can be coated, or attached via peptides, adsorbed, sorbed or in some other way perfused onto or into the elongated member; either the bodies, the links or both. In some embodiments, the coating may comprise a bone cement that may be activated upon insertion into the bone. In other embodiments, at least a portion of the bodies comprise an outer surface configured to promote bone in-growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In another aspect, a flexible chain implant may be impacted or inserted into a cavity, void or hollow space, e.g., through a small narrow opening. Such cavities may be, for example, voids in long bones, intervertebral disc spaces or vertebral bodies. Such voids may have occurred due to infections, disease, trauma fractures, degenerative disc disease process, tumors or osteotomies. In other embodiments, a void may be created by using a tool to compact or remove cancellous or cortical bone or other tissue prior to implantation. The chain may thereafter be implanted to fill the created void. Depending on the insertion or impaction force and depending on the amount or the length of chain devices inserted, the device will fill and/or support the tissue structure, preferably bone structure to a restored size and/or height. In an alternative embodiment, no void or cavity may be present, and even if a void or cavity is present the chain implant or elongated member may be inserted and/or implanted in a manner to compact the material and bone cells within the bone and to further fill the bone in a manner that it can better support a load and preferably fill the bone in a manner to restore its original and/or treated size and height.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In another aspect, one or more flexible monolithic chains may be implanted into diseased, damaged or otherwise abnormal bones to treat, for example, long bone infections, comminuted complex fractures, tumor resections and osteotomies. An FMC device may also be used to treat disease or abnormal pathology conditions in spinal applications, including, for example, degenerative disc disease, collapsed intervertebral discs, vertebral body tumor or fractures, and vertebral body resections. The elongated member or chain device can be used as a preventive measure to augment a bone, spinal disc or an implant, e.g., and intervertebral body implant to promote fusion. The elongated member may be used within a vertebra or between two vertebra. The elongated member or chain also may be used for example in an intervertebral body fusion procedure, for example, as an implant inserted into the disc space between two vertebra, as an implant inserted into and retained by the disc annulus, or in combination with an additional implant inserted in the disc space between two vertebra.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for augmenting adjacent vertebrae, the method comprising the steps of: creating a void in an intervertebral disc by removing tissue from the disc; inserting into the void an apparatus comprising a chain comprising at least one non-flexible body; and at least one flexible portion comprising a joint, wherein the at least one non-flexible body is adjacent to the at least one flexible portion, such that the chain fills the void created in the intervertebral disc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, a kit comprises various combinations of assemblies and components according to the present invention. A kit may include, for example, a package or container comprising an elongated member, for example an FMC device, and a cannula or other introducer or device for implanting the elongated member. In other embodiments, a kit may comprise instruments to create a cavity (e.g., balloon catheter), an FMC device and a cement or other filler material and/or a syringe or other apparatus for injecting a FMC device and/or such filler material into a vertebral body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In another aspect, the present invention provides a system suitable for insertion between two vertebral bodies to treat disease or abnormal pathology conditions in spinal applications, the system comprising: a chain of biocompatible material suitable for insertion into a disc space between two adjacent vertebral bodies in a patient's spinal column, wherein the spinal disc space has a transverse plane, the chain comprising: a plurality of adjacent bodies having a height configured to reside within the disc space between two adjacent vertebral bodies and a length configured to reside in the disc space between two adjacent vertebral bodies when the chain is curved in an orientation substantially along the transverse plane of the spinal disc space; and wherein the plurality of adjacent bodies are interconnected such that the adjacent bodies can angulate during insertion into the spinal disc space with respect to each other along the transverse plane of the spinal disc and into a curved orientation that allows the chain to reside within the spinal disc space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for augmenting adjacent vertebrae, the method comprising the steps of: creating a space in an intervertebral disc by removing tissue from the disc, wherein the intervertebral disc is located between two adjacent vertebral bodies in a patient's spinal column, wherein the space has a transverse plane; inserting through a cannula into the space an apparatus comprising a chain of biocompatible material suitable for insertion into the space, the chain comprising: a plurality of adjacent bodies having a height and length configured to reside within the space when the chain is curved in an orientation substantially along the transverse plane of the space; and wherein the plurality of adjacent bodies are interconnected such that the adjacent bodies can angulate during insertion into the space with respect to each other along the transverse plane of the disc and into a curved orientation that allows the chain to reside within the space.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a chain <b>200</b> (sometimes referred to as an elongated member) comprises one or more bodies <b>210</b> (sometimes referred to as beads). Chain <b>200</b> is preferably a monolithic chain, e.g., formed from a single, common material or type of material forming an integral structure. Bodies <b>210</b> are preferably substantially non-flexible, and may be solid, semi-solid, porous, non-porous, hollow, or any combination thereof.

The outer circumferential shape of the body may be the same as adjacent links. Alternatively or in addition, the outer circumferential shape of the body may be the same size as adjacent links. Bodies <b>210</b> may be of uniform or non-uniform size, shape and/or materials, and may be linked in series, for example by one or more flexible or semi-flexible linking portions <b>220</b>, which can form struts of any desired length between bodies <b>210</b>. Linking portions are preferably, although not necessarily, formed of the same material as bodies <b>210</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">A chain <b>200</b> may have any desired number of linked bodies <b>210</b>, and may have a first end <b>202</b> and a second end <b>204</b>. In other embodiments, chain <b>200</b> may be formed in a loop, ring, or other configuration having no ends, or may be configured to have multiple extensions and/or multiple ends, for example like branches of a tree.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The one or more linking portions <b>220</b> may be comprised of any biocompatible material having desired characteristics of flexibility, strength, and the like. In preferred embodiments, linking portions <b>220</b> may be formed, at least in part, of substantially the same material as bodies <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, chain <b>200</b>, including bodies <b>210</b> and/or linking portions <b>220</b>, may be resorbable. The bodies <b>210</b> may be of uniform or non-uniform size, and may be spaced by linking portions <b>220</b> at uniform or non-uniform increments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a close up cross-sectional view of chain <b>200</b>, taken at line B-B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In this example, chain <b>200</b> is a monolithic chain, with bodies <b>210</b> and flexible portions <b>220</b> formed from a uniform material, e.g., bone. Although bodies <b>210</b> are shown as substantially spherical, and linking portions <b>220</b> are shown as substantially cylindrical, numerous other shapes are contemplated. In fact, chains <b>200</b>, including body <b>210</b> and/or linking portion <b>220</b>, may be of any desired shape, such as for example, cylindrical, elliptical, spherical, rectangular, etc. Body <b>210</b> and/or linking portion <b>220</b> may also be of any particular cross sectional shape such as round hexagonal, square, etc. Bodies <b>210</b> and linking portions <b>220</b> may have the same or different shapes. In certain embodiments the configurations of bodies <b>210</b> may vary within a chain <b>200</b>, for example as described herein with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 10</figref>. Alternatively or in addition thereto, the configuration of links <b>220</b> may vary within a chain. In one embodiment, the bodies can be shaped so that they fit together to minimize interstitial spacing or provide a predetermined range of interstitial spacing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">All dimensional aspects of the chain <b>200</b> can be made to fit any particular anatomy or delivery device. For example, for applications of vertebral body augmentation, the diameter <b>230</b> of bodies <b>210</b>, e.g., as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, may be between about 1 mm and about 15 mm, preferably between about 2 mm and about 8 mm, or more preferably between about 4 mm and about 6 mm. Preferably, the non-flexible bodies <b>210</b> are larger in shape and size than the flexible struts <b>220</b>. For example, height <b>232</b> of struts <b>220</b> may be between about 0.5 mm and about 8 mm, preferably between about 0.8 mm and about 4 mm, and may depend in part upon the size of bodies <b>210</b>. Struts <b>220</b> may have any desired length <b>238</b>, e.g., between about 0.5 mm and about 5.0 mm, preferably between about 1.5 mm and 3.5 mm, or greater than 5 mm. Similarly, distance <b>234</b> between bodies <b>210</b> may be any desired distance, e.g., depending upon the size of bodies <b>210</b> and/or length <b>238</b> struts <b>220</b>. In some embodiments, for example, distance <b>234</b> may be between about 4 mm and about 15 mm, or between about 6 mm and about 10 mm. The junctions between bodies <b>210</b> and struts <b>220</b> may have a radius <b>236</b> of any desired dimension, e.g., less than 1.0 mm, between about 1.0 mm and about 2.0 mm, or greater than about 2.0 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, each of the bodies <b>210</b> and struts <b>220</b> of a chain may be of the same configuration and/or dimensions as other bodies <b>210</b> and struts within the chain <b>200</b>. In other embodiments, bodies <b>210</b> and/or struts <b>220</b> within a chain may have different configurations or dimensions. In still other embodiments, the non-flexible bodies <b>210</b> and flexible portions <b>220</b> may be of the same shape and size to form a relatively uniform structure, for example as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">A chain <b>200</b> may be made as long as practical for a particular application. For example, an exemplary chain <b>200</b> for implantation into a bone may be about 100 mm in length. In other embodiments, chain <b>200</b> may be of other lengths, for example less than about 1 mm, between about 1 mm and about 100 mm, or greater than 100 mm. In some embodiments, two or more chains <b>200</b> and/or other implants may be used in combination with each other. Chain <b>200</b> may be connected end to end to form larger chains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">While the present invention is preferably directed to the creation of implants from allograft material, the present invention may also be applied to implants that utilize other materials, including but not limited to the following: xenograft, autograft, metals, alloys, ceramics, polymers, composites, and encapsulated fluids or gels. Furthermore, the implants described herein may be formed of materials with varying levels of porosity, such as by combined bone sections from different bones or different types of tissues and/or materials having varying levels of porosity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Also, the implants described herein may be formed of bone materials with varying mineral content. For example, cancellous or cortical bone may be provided in natural, partially demineralized, or demineralized states. Demineralization is typically achieved with a variety of chemical processing techniques, including the use of an acid such as hydrochloric acid, chelating agents, electrolysis or other treatments. The demineralization treatment removes the minerals contained in the natural bone, leaving collagen fibers with bone growth factors including bone morphogenic protein (BMP). Variation in the mechanical properties of bone sections is obtainable through various amounts of demineralization. Advantageously, use of a demineralizing agent on bone, e.g., cortical or cancellous bone, transforms the properties of the bone from a stiff structure to a relatively pliable structure. Optionally, the flexibility or pliability of demineralized bone may be enhanced when the bone is hydrated. Any desired portions of bone components, e.g., ink portions <b>220</b> or any other desired portion, may be demineralized or partially demineralized in order to achieve a desired amount of malleability, elasticity, pliability or flexibility, generally referred to herein as โflexibilityโ. The amount of flexibility can be varied by varying in part the amount of demineralization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, flexibility of demineralized or partially demineralized regions may be further enhanced by varying the moisture content of the implant or portions thereof. Bone components initially may be provided with moisture content as follows: (a) bone in the natural state fresh out of the donor without freezing, (b) bone in the frozen state, typically at โ40ยฐ C., with moisture content intact, (c) bone with moisture removed such as freeze-dried bone, and (d) bone in the hydrated state, such as when submersed in water. Using the expansion and contraction properties that can be obtained during heating and cooling of the bone material, and the concomitant resorption of moisture along with swelling for some bone material, permits alternate approaches to achieving a desired flexibility of an implant within a bone or other region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The implants may be formed entirely from cortical bone, entirely from cancellous bone, or from a combination of cortical and cancellous bone. While the implants may be created entirely from all bone material, it is also anticipated that one or more components or materials may be formed of non-bone material, including synthetics or other materials. Thus, while the implants disclosed herein are typically described as being formed primarily from bone, the implants alternatively may be formed in whole or in part from other materials such as stainless steel, titanium or other metal, an alloy, hydroxyapatite, resorbable material, polymer, or ceramic, and may additionally incorporate bone chips, bone particulate, bone fibers, bone growth materials, and bone cement. Also, while solid structures are described herein, the structure optionally may include perforations or through bores extending from one outer surface to another outer surface, or recesses formed in outer surfaces that do not extend through inner surfaces (surface porosity), or recesses formed internally. Surface texture such as depressions and/or dimples may be formed on the outer surface. The depressions and/or dimples may be circular, diamond, rectangular, irregular or have other shapes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The flexible monolithic chain devices described herein may be used to treat disease and pathological conditions in general orthopedic applications such as long bone infections, comminuted complex fractures, tumor resections and osteotomies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Additionally the device can be used to treat disease and pathological conditions in spinal applications, such as, for example, degenerative disc disease, collapsed intervertebral discs, vertebral body tumor or fractures, vertebral body resections or generally unstable vertebral bodies. In other embodiments, a flexible monolithic chain device may be used in maxillofacial applications or in non-fusion nucleus replacement procedures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example of a method <b>300</b> for fabricating a monolithic chain device <b>200</b> out of bone material <b>310</b>. In this example, allograft femoral bone <b>310</b> is used as a base material, preferably, cortical allograft bone. Other bones may be used for forming implants, for example, radius, humerous, tibia, femur, fibula, ulna, ribs, pelvic, vertebrae or other bones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an initial step comprises machining a rough monolithic chain <b>200</b>โฒ, having a desired general shape, out of the raw material <b>310</b>, preferably bone. For example, conventional milling and/or other fabrication techniques may be used. Device <b>200</b>, may have any desired shape, for example including generally elliptical or spherical bodies <b>210</b> separated by cylindrical linking portions <b>220</b> as shown. Alternatively, chain <b>200</b> may be formed of a substantially uniform shape as shown, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">After machining the general desired shape in step A of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the rough monolithic device <b>200</b>โฒ may then be removed from the raw material <b>310</b>, as shown for example in step B. In this example, an upper side <b>312</b> of the rough device <b>200</b>โฒ has been fabricated to have a desired general shape as described above. An opposite side <b>314</b>, however, may include excess material that was not removed in step A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In step C of the exemplary method of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, opposite side <b>314</b> is machined to remove excess material, for example using conventional milling methods. Side <b>312</b> may also be further machined or shaped as desired, in order to form a monolithic chain device <b>200</b> having the desired shapes and configurations of bodies <b>210</b> and linking portions <b>220</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In step D, the shaped chain <b>200</b>, if formed of bone, may be demineralized, e.g., in container <b>320</b> containing a demineralizing solution <b>322</b> (e.g., hydrochloric acid) or using another method. Demineralization may be allowed to occur for a specified amount of time, for example to allow the smaller, lower volume portions <b>220</b> of the device <b>200</b> to become more flexible or elastic, while the larger bodies <b>210</b> of the device remain structurally intact and substantially rigid. The amount of time and/or the concentration or composition of the demineralizing solution may be varied to provide the desired amount of flexibility or elasticity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, this secondary process of demineralization can be applied to specific portions of the device <b>200</b>, e.g., by masking or shielding the portions that do not or should not be treated. For example, by masking the non flexible portions <b>210</b>, the flexible portions <b>220</b> can be partially or entirely demineralized, and the nonflexible portions <b>210</b> may retain their original mineralized state prior to the masking. Alternatively, an allograft device may be submerged entirely into demineralization acid without masking any portions of the device. Due to the relatively smaller shape and size of the flexible portions <b>220</b>, including the surface area exposed to the demineralized agent, and depending for example upon the amount of exposure to the demineralization acid, the flexible portions <b>220</b> may demineralize entirely, or at least substantially more than the larger portions <b>210</b>, which may undergo only surface demineralization. Therefore, the smaller portions <b>220</b> may become flexible and elastic while the larger portions <b>210</b> may remain relatively stiff and substantially non-flexible. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows regions <b>240</b> that are substantially demineralized and regions <b>242</b> that have substantially their natural or original composition and mineralization content.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The following Table 1 provides examples of demineralization times of four monolithic chains having different strut configurations. Each of the chains were formed of cortical allograft bone and had body portions <b>210</b> that were approximately 5 mm in diameter. Configurations and dimensions of the struts <b>220</b> differed between the samples. In all four samples, the struts were fully demineralized between about 3ยฝ and 4 hours, while the beads were demineralized to an extent, but were not fully demineralized across their entire thickness. Strut dimensions correspond to distance <b>238</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, while strut radius corresponds to radius <b>236</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Full flexibility is considered to be the condition when the chain can be bent until two adjacent beads contact each other without the chain cracking or breaking. While the foregoing is one manner to measure sufficient flexibility, other measures of flexibility are also contemplated and the invention should not be limited by such measure of flexibility. For example, less than full flexibility may be sufficient and desirable for insertion into vertebrae to augment and support the vertebral end plates.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, a minimally invasive method <b>600</b> of augmenting a damaged vertebral body <b>12</b>, e.g., following a vertebral compression fracture, may comprise implanting one or more chains <b>200</b> into an inner portion <b>612</b> of a vertebral body <b>12</b> between endplates <b>614</b> and <b>616</b>. Of course, one or more chains <b>200</b> may be implanted as a preventive measure to augment a vertebra before compression or a compression fracture. A hole may be formed in the outer coritcal shell of vertebral body <b>12</b> by a trocar, drill or other instrument. Chain <b>200</b> may then be implanted, for example, through a cannula <b>602</b> or other introducer inserted into vertebral body <b>12</b>. Suitable procedures and materials for inserting a cannula through which chain <b>200</b> may be introduced are known in the art, and may be similar to those described above for kyphoplasty and other procedures. For example, cannula <b>602</b> may be introduced through the posterior portion <b>16</b> of vertebral body <b>12</b>, e.g., through pedicle <b>14</b> (e.g., transpedicular approach). A chain <b>200</b> may be inserted and may compact the cancellous and osteoporotic bone inside the vertebral body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Prior to insertion of the cannula, a passageway may be formed into the interior of the vertebral body, for example using a drill or other instrument. The chain <b>200</b> may then be inserted through the passageway, and may compact or compress the bone material inside the vertebral body. Alternatively, after the passageway is formed in the vertebral body, instruments such as, for example, currettes or balloon catheter may be used to compress and compact the bone inside the vertebral body to create a cavity. The instruments may then be removed. Alternatively, the balloon portion of the catheter may remain within the vertebral body or may form a container for the implant. The cavity in the vertebral body also may be formed by removing bone material as opposed to compacting the bone. For example, a reamer or other apparatus could be used to remove bone material from the inside of the vertebral body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Whether a cavity is first formed in the bone structure or the chain(s) are inserted without first creating a cavity, as more linked bodies <b>21</b> <b>0</b> of chain <b>200</b> are inserted into vertebral body <b>12</b>, they may fill central portion <b>612</b> and provide structural support to stabilize a vertebral body. In a vertebra that has collapsed, as the chain implant <b>200</b> fills central portion <b>612</b> the implant, and particularly the linked bodies <b>210</b>, can push against the interior or inner sides of endplates <b>614</b> and <b>616</b>, thereby tending to restore vertebral body <b>12</b> from a collapsed height h<b>1</b> to its original or desired treated height h<b>2</b> and provide structural support to stabilize vertebral body <b>12</b>. Instead of using the insertion of the chain implant to restore the height of the vertebra, an instrument can be inserted through the passageway to restore the height of the vertebra and plates. For example, a balloon catheter can be inserted to restore vertebra end plates, or an elongated instrument that contacts the inside of the end plates and pushes on them may be utilized. Additionally, the flexibility of one or more portions <b>220</b> between bodies <b>210</b> may allow bending of chain within space <b>612</b>, e.g., in a uniform pattern or in a nonuniform or tortuous configuration, to aid in ensuring a thorough integration of the implant <b>200</b> within the bone <b>12</b>. The configuration of bodies <b>210</b> attached by flexible portions also may permit bending to substantially fill the cavity and/or vertebral bone so no large pockets or voids are created or remain which may result in weak spots or a weakened bone structure. The flexible links may also allow the chain to collapse and possibly become entangled so that it becomes larger than its insertion hole so that it cannon be easily ejected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">In other embodiments, chain <b>200</b> may be inserted into a bone such as a vertebral body <b>12</b>, e.g., through the lumen <b>604</b> of a cannula <b>602</b> or other sheath, and such sheath may be removed after implantation within the bone <b>12</b>. In such embodiments, chain <b>200</b>, or a portion thereof, may remain in vertebral body <b>12</b>, for example, to continue augmenting the vertebra and maintain proper lordosis. In other embodiments, PMMA or another bone cement or filler (for example bone chips) may be inserted sequentially or simultaneously into vertebral body <b>12</b>, e.g., through shaft and/or a cannula <b>602</b>, along with bodies <b>210</b> to further enhance fixation or repair of the damaged region. Alternatively, only a plug of bone cement may be inserted into the hole that was initially formed to insert chains <b>200</b> (e.g., plug <b>812</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). The plug may cover the insertion hole to prevent the implant (chains) from being removed or ejected. In other embodiments, some or all of bodies <b>210</b> of chain <b>200</b> may be removed after repositioning the bone, and PMMA or another bone cement or filler may be injected into a void created by chain <b>200</b>. Alternatively a bone growth promoting filler may be inserted into vertebral body <b>12</b> and a plug of bone cement utilized to hold the linked bodies and filler material in the vertebrae.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, flexible chain <b>200</b> may be coated with an adhesive, such that chain <b>200</b> may be inserted into vertebral body <b>12</b> in a flexible state and may become tangled and/or convoluted during or after insertion. After insertion, bodies <b>210</b> may become attached together by the adhesive so that the flexible chain becomes a mass that may be locked into the vertebral body, or otherwise secured such that chain <b>200</b> may not be easily removed through the insertion opening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In other embodiments, linked bodies <b>210</b> may be coated with an adhesive and chain may be inserted, with or without becoming tangled or convoluted, into a vertebral body. During or after insertion of some or all linking bodies <b>210</b> of a chain <b>200</b>, a portion of chain <b>200</b> may be exposed to an energy source (e.g., an ultraviolet light, ultrasonic radiation, radio waves, heat, electric filed, magnetic field), for example to activate the adhesive, such that the exposed portion of chain <b>200</b> becomes joined to form a mass, or becomes rigid, or both, thereby further augmenting the vertebral body <b>12</b> and/or preventing removal or ejection of chain <b>200</b> through the insertion opening.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Although the apparatus and methods described herein thus far have been described in the context of repositioning and augmenting vertebrae for example in the context of vertebral compression fractures and deformations in spinal curvature, various other uses and methods are envisioned. For example, in some embodiments, an implantable monolithic chain <b>200</b> may be used to augment vertebrae where a compression or a compression fracture has not yet occurred and thus can be preventative in nature. Also, in some embodiments the chain can be used in-between two vertebra. For example, the chain implant can be inserted in the annulus of a spinal disc, or the disc can be removed and the chain implant inserted in-between adjacent vertebra to promote fusion of adjacent vertebrae. The chain implant in some embodiments may be insertable in an additional implant, such as a cage implanted in-between adjacent vertebrae. The chain implant may also be used to reposition and/or augment other damaged bone regions such as a fractured or weakened proximal femur <b>1400</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In such embodiments, for example, one or more chains <b>200</b> may be inserted into a head <b>1410</b> of femur <b>1400</b>, e.g., through a cannula <b>1102</b> or other introducer as show in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Once inserted, chain <b>200</b> may compact material within head <b>1410</b> and provide solid support to augment the head <b>1410</b>. A bone cement or other filler may also be used to aid augmentation. In other embodiments, another implant <b>1420</b> may be inserted in addition to or instead of one or more chains <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">In some embodiments, the implants and methods described herein may be used in conjunction with other apparatus and methods to restore lordosis and augment the vertebral body. For example, one or more chains <b>200</b> may be used in conjunction with known procedures, e.g., a balloon kyphoplasty, that may be used to begin repositioning of a vertebral body and/or create a space within the body for chain <b>200</b>. In other embodiments, one or more chains <b>200</b> may be used in conjunction with other tools or external fixation apparatus for helping to manipulate or fix the vertebrae or other bones in a desired position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">In another embodiment, a kit comprises various combinations of assemblies and components. A kit may include, for example, a cannula or other introducer and one or more flexible monolithic chains <b>200</b>. The one or more chains <b>200</b> may be provided in different sizes, e.g., different lengths and/or diameters. In other embodiments, a kit may include an introducer, one or more chains, and a syringe or other apparatus for injecting a cement or other filler into a vertebral body or other space. In other embodiments, a kit may comprise one or more balloon catheters, curettes, and other instruments and may additionally include anchoring elements, tensioning members, fixation members, or any combination thereof, for example as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/1722,064, entitled โApparatus and Method for Vertebral Augmentation using Linked Bodiesโ, filed Sep. 28, 2005, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. One skilled in the art will appreciate that various other combinations of devices, components and assemblies can be made and are intended to fall within the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">In other embodiments, various minimally invasive implants and methods for alleviating discomfort associated with the spinal column may employ anchors and other implants described herein. For example, a monolithic chain implant within an expandable container (not shown), may be implanted between spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae to distract the processes and alleviate pain and other problems caused for example by spinal stenosis, facet arthropathy, and the like. For example, augmentation systems described herein may be used instead of or in addition to expandable interspinous process apparatus and methods described in U.S. Patent Publication number 2004/018128 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,676 to Zucherman et al. For example, a cannula may be inserted laterally between adjacent spinous processes to insert a container that may be filled with the flexible chains and expand the container and thus keep the adjacent spinous processes at the desired distance. Alternatively, a balloon container, with a deflatable balloon portion can be inserted laterally through adjacent spinous processes and filled with the flexible chains to expand the balloon to a desired size to hold adjacent spinous processes at a desired distances. The balloon can thereafter be sealed and detached from the catheter. Other materials may be inserted within the balloon volume to supplement flexible bodies.</div>
