<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Described herein generally are neuromodulation systems used with or on a mammal (e.g., a human) having a spinal cord with at least one selected dysfunctional spinal or neural circuit or other neurologically derived source of function or movement control in a portion of the subject's (e.g., mammal) body. The systems can be transcutaneous systems and can induce voluntary movement in a mammal with a spinal cord injury.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, the neuromodulation systems can include: a processor; a signal generator; and at least one electrode. The electrode(s) can be transcutaneous electrodes. In other embodiments, in addition to transcutaneous electrodes, one or more implantable electrodes can be included in the system. In some embodiments, the processor, in cooperation with the signal generator and the at least one electrode are configured to deliver a stimulation to a mammal, the stimulation including a monophasic or biphasic signal and an overlapping high frequency pulse thereby inducing voluntary movement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods of using the herein described systems are also disclosed. The methods can include: applying a stimulation including a biphasic signal and an overlapping high frequency pulse to a mammal using a transcutaneous neuromodulation system thereby inducing the voluntary movement. In some embodiments, the stimulation can be monopolar or bipolar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the voluntary movement is of a foot, a toe, a knee, a leg, a neck, a shoulder, an arm, a hand, a finger, a waist or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, the voluntary movement comprises at least one of standing, stepping, a walking motor pattern, sitting down, laying down, reaching, grasping, pulling and pushing, taking a breath, chewing or swallowing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the biphasic signal is a 0.5-100 Hz signal that can be delivered at 0.5-200 mA. The overlapping high frequency pulse can be a 10 kHz pulse or a 5 kHz pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The stimulation can be applied over a cervical portion of the spinal cord or the brainstem. The delivered signal can also be applied paraspinally over at least one of a cervical-thoracic portion, a thoracic portion, a thoracic-lumbar portion, lumbar portion, a lumbosacral portion and a sacral portion of the spinal cord. Further still, the delivered signal is applied to a T11-T12 vertebrae.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the systems can be used on or for mammals, such as humans, having a neurodegenerative brain injury or disease. The neurodegenerative brain injury or disease can be a brain injury associated with a condition selected from Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's, ischemia, stroke, dystonia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) or other neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the delivered stimulation can be referred to as transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (tESCS) or painless cutaneous enabling motor control (pcEmc) and are used interchangably herein. The stimulation can be applied in the region of the T11-T12 vertebrae with a frequency of 5-40 Hz and may elicit voluntary step-like movements in healthy subjects with their legs suspended in a gravity-neutral position. Amplitude of evoked step-like movements may increase with increasing tESCS or pcEmc frequency. Frequency of evoked step-like movements may not depend on the frequency of tESCS or pcEmc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, tESCS or pcEmc can be used as a noninvasive method in rehabilitation of spinal pathology. By way of non-limiting examples, application of tESCS or pcEmc activates spinal networks (SNs), in part via the dorsal roots and the gray matter of the spinal cord. When activated, the SNs may (a) enable voluntary movement of muscles involved in at least one of standing, stepping, reaching, grasping, voluntarily changing positions of one or both legs, breathing, swallowing, chewing, coughing, speech control, voiding the patient's bladder, voiding the patient's bowel, postural activity, and locomotor activity; (b) enable or improve autonomic control of at least one of cardiovascular function, body temperature, and metabolic processes; (c) help facilitate recovery of at least one of an autonomic function, sexual function, vasomotor function, and cognitive function; and/or (d) help to resolve and/or block pain and spasm, and improve or restore sensory function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The paralysis may be a motor complete paralysis or a motor incomplete paralysis. The paralysis may have been caused by a spinal cord injury classified as motor complete or motor incomplete. The paralysis may have been caused by an ischemic or traumatic brain injury. The paralysis may have been caused by an ischemic brain injury that resulted from a stroke or acute trauma. By way of another example, the paralysis may have been caused by a neurodegenerative brain injury. The neurodegenerative brain injury may be associated with at least one of Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's, dystonia, ischemia, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), and cerebral palsy. In another embodiment, the paralysis may have been caused or induced by a reaction to a drug, a prescribed or holistic medication, vitamin, or mineral supplement. In one example embodiment, the paralysis may have been caused or induced by a reaction to an anesthetic drug.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In one example embodiment, a neuromodulation system may be configured to apply electrical stimulation to a portion of a spinal cord of the subject. The electrical stimulation may be applied by at least one electrode that is applied to the skin surface of the subject. Such an electrode may be positioned on at least one of a thoracic region, a cervical region, a lumbosacral region, a sacral region of the spinal cord, and/or the brainstem. Electrical stimulation may be delivered at 1-40 Hz at 1-200 mA. The electrical stimulation may include at least one of tonic stimulation and intermittent stimulation. The electrical stimulation may include simultaneous or sequential stimulation of different regions of the spinal cord.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In one example embodiment, where the paralysis was caused by a spinal cord injury at a first location along the spinal cord, the electrical stimulation may be applied by an electrode that is on the spinal cord of the patient at a second location below the first location along the spinal cord relative to the patient's brain. In other words, the at least one electrode can be placed below a site of spinal injury.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the systems and methods described herein may include stimulation and/or recording of a second or multiple electrode(s) placed on or over a muscle, nerve, on or near a target end organ or bodily structure. In some embodiments, this second or multiple electrode(s) may be placed transcutaneously or can be implanted. The additional electrode(s) can be in communication with the first electrode through a connection to the first electrode control module by means of either a hardwire or wireless connection. In another embodiment, the second electrode or multiple electrode(s) may be implanted within the subject in various locations and to various depths on, over or near a muscle, nerve, or target end organ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, methods may include administering one or more active agents or drugs to the patient. In one embodiment, the active agent or drug can be a neuropharmaceutical agent. The neuropharmaceutical agent(s) may include at least one of a serotonergic drug, a dopaminergic drug, a noradrenergic drug, a monoaminergic drug, GABAergic drug, and glycinergic drugs. By way of non-limiting examples, the neuropharmaceutical agents may include at least one of 8-OHDPAT, Way 100.635, Quipazine, Ketanserin, SR 57227A, Ondanesetron, SB 269970, Buspirone, Methoxamine, Prazosin, Clonidine, Yohimbine, SKF-81297, SCH-23390, Quinpirole, and/or Eticlopride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The neuropharmaceutical agent may be administered orally, or by intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal injection. In other embodiments, the neuropharmaceutical agent may be administered rectally or topically such as a transdermal liquid, cream, or ointment. In embodiments, the agent can be administered via a drug pump and the administrative pump may be in communication and under control of the electric stimulator control module.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The electrical stimulation may be defined by a set of parameter values, and activation of the selected spinal circuit may generate a quantifiable result. In one example embodiment, the neuromodulation system is configured to repeat and use electrical stimulation having different sets of parameter values to obtain quantifiable results generated by each repetition. Thereafter, a machine learning method may be executed by at least one computing device. The machine learning method can build a model of a relationship between the electrical stimulation applied to the spinal cord and the quantifiable results generated by activation of the at least one spinal circuit. A new set of parameters may be selected based on the model. By way of a non-limiting example, the machine learning method may implement a Gaussian Process Optimization or a “Dueling Bandit” machine learning paradigm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In one example embodiment, the neuromodulation system can be configured to enable at least one function selected from a group consisting of postural and/or locomotor activity, voluntary movement of leg position, when not bearing weight, improved ventilation, swallowing, speech control, voluntary voiding of the bladder and/or bowel, return of sexual function, autonomic control of cardiovascular function, body temperature control, and normalized metabolic processes, in a human subject having a neurologically derived paralysis. In one embodiment, the neuromodulation system can be configured to enable voluntary movement or voluntary bodily functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Methods can include stimulating a subject's spinal cord using at least one surface electrode and may include simultaneously subjecting the subject to physical training that exposes the subject to relevant postural proprioceptive signals, locomotor proprioceptive signals, and supraspinal signals while being stimulated with tESCS or pcEmc. In other embodiments, the methods may also include the delivery of a drug. At least one of the stimulation and physical training modulates, provokes or incites in real time the electrophysiological properties of spinal circuits in the subject so the spinal circuits are activated by at least one of supraspinal information and proprioceptive information derived from the region of the subject where the selected one or more functions are facilitated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The region where the selected one or more functions are facilitated may include one or more regions of the spinal cord that control: (a) lower limbs; (b) upper limbs and brainstem for controlling speech; (c) the subject's bladder; and/or (d) the subject's bowel and/or other end organ. The physical training may include standing, stepping, sitting down, lying down, reaching, grasping, stabilizing sitting posture, stabilizing standing posture, practicing speech, swallowing, chewing, deep breathing, and coughing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The surface electrode may include an array of one or more electrodes stimulated in a monopolar biphasic configuration. Such a surface electrode may be placed over at least one of a lumbar, a lumbosacral or sacral portion of the spinal cord, a thoracic portion of the spinal cord, a cervical portion of the spinal cord, and/or the brainstem.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The stimulation may include continuous stimulation and/or intermittent stimulation. The stimulation may include simultaneous or sequential stimulation of different spinal cord regions. Optionally, the stimulation pattern may be under control of the subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The physical training may include inducing a load bearing positional change in the region of the subject where locomotor activity is to be facilitated. In other embodiments, the physical training may include inducing a load bearing positional change in the region of the subject where voluntary locomotor activity is to be facilitated. The load bearing positional change in the subject may include standing, stepping, reaching, and/or grasping. The physical training may include robotically guided training.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example embodiment, a method includes placing an electrode on the patient's spinal cord, positioning the patient in a training device configured to assist with physical training that is configured to induce neurological signals derived from the portion of the patient's body having motor dysfunction, and applying electrical stimulation to a portion of a spinal cord of the patient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Another exemplary embodiment is a system that includes a training device configured to assist with physically training the patient, at least one surface electrode array configured to be applied on the patient's spinal cord, and a stimulation generator connected to the electrode. When undertaken, the physical training induces neurological signals derived from the portion of the patient's body having the motor dysfunction. The stimulation generator is configured to apply electrical stimulation to the electrode. In some embodiments, the system can induce voluntary movements as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment, the stimulation or stimulator generator connected to the at least one electrode is also configured to communicate with an exercise device. The stimulation or stimulator generator can also be configured to receive, transmit and/or store data thereby creating a closed loop system. When undertaking physical training, the stimulator can auto adjust the stimulation parameters based on the interpretation of the data collected.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The present disclosure relates in general to the field of neurological treatment and rehabilitation for injury and disease including traumatic spinal cord injury, non-traumatic spinal cord injury, stroke, movement disorders, brain injury, and other diseases or injuries that result in paralysis and/or nervous system disorder. Systems and devices are provided to facilitate recovery of posture, locomotion, and voluntary movements such as those of the arms, trunk, and legs, and recovery of autonomic, sexual, vasomotor, speech, swallowing, chewing, respiratory and cognitive function, in a human subject having spinal cord injury, brain injury, or any other neurological disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Described herein generally are stimulation strategies and methods of pcEmc or tESCS and optionally a pharmacological enabling motor control (fEmc) strategy to neuromodulate the physiological state of the spinal cord in individuals with paralysis, for example, motor complete paralysis. The strategies can assist in regaining some voluntary locomotor-like leg movements after motor complete paralysis or other voluntary movements of body parts affected by spinal cord injury.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Systems for delivering stimulation are also described. The systems can electrically activate the spinal circuitry via electrodes placed on the skin overlying the spinal cord such as the lower thoracic and lumbosacral vertebrae.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The systems and methods can also include the administration of at least one drug. In some embodiments, the drug is a monoaminergic drug. In some embodiments, the monoaminergic drug can be administered in combination with stimulation (e.g., pcEmc+fEmc) to provide voluntarily movement, such as but not limited to step-like movements of the lower limbs. In some embodiments, the monoaminergic drug can be buspirone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the results provided herein demonstrate the presently described systems and methods' ability to bring about voluntary movement in a patient with motor complete paralysis. However, in some embodiments, there herein described systems and methods can bring about voluntary movement in a patient with motor incomplete paralysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">These systems and methods can transform brain-spinal neuronal networks from a dormant to a functional state sufficiently to enable recovery of voluntary movement. In some embodiments, the systems and methods facilitate voluntary control of locomotor-like stepping with pcEmc or tESCS and optionally fEmc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, in some embodiments, a single treatment session with pcEmc or tESCS and fEmc three minutes of passive movements can further facilitate voluntary outputs. Also, in some embodiments, spinally evoked motor potentials can be readily modulated voluntarily, providing functional and electrophysiological evidence of the re-establishment of connectivity among neural networks between the brain and the spinal cord.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The devices and methods described herein can re-engage descending input that projects to spinal locomotor networks after partial or complete motor paralysis. The present systems and methods can use pcEmc or tESCS and optionally fEmc. In some embodiments, pcEmc or tESCS and optionally fEmc are combined with training. When used with training, a re-engaging of descending input that projects to spinal locomotor networks can result. Thus, in some embodiments, inducement of voluntary movement of body parts can result.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The systems and methods can enable movement to occur voluntarily rather than being induced directly by stimulation. For example, pcEmc or tESCS optionally coupled with fEmc can enable the re-engagement of a progressively increasing complex neural network, providing the substrate for previously dormant circuitry to regain function. Although in some embodiments, some dysfunctional reorganization of the networks can occur after a spinal cord injury thereby limiting the recovery of coordinated movements, re-engagement may not be prevented. The quality of the recovered coordination reflects some aberrant and/or limited connectivity of the newly emerged descending control of the spinal networks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, when combining pcEmc or tESCS and optionally fEmc with training, both animal and human results can show more normal levels of coordination and/or recruitment of motor pools. In some embodiments, the training can be extensive training. In some embodiments, more normal levels of coordination and/or recruitment of motor pools can be realized at least during movements such as stepping can be recovered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, functional brain-to-spinal cord connectivity in completely paralyzed individuals can be facilitated with electrical and/or pharmacological neuromodulation when presented concomitantly with training of neural networks that control stepping-like movements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, when combining pcEmc or tESCS and/or fEmc with training, the systems and methods can provide improvements in functional measures of spinal cord injury converting subjects from motor complete (AIS B) to motor incomplete (AIS C), such as within a relatively short period of time. For example, as described herein, in 5/5 individuals assumed to be completely paralyzed, two noninvasive interventions can facilitate recovery of voluntarily controlled sensorimotor function. Also, given anatomical and physiological incompleteness of spinal cord injuries typically diagnosed otherwise as “completely paralyzed” places some sense of urgency in resolving the uncertainty of the diagnosis and treatment strategies that should be followed after paralysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The present systems and methods can improve postural, locomotor, and other functions that are directly defined by the individual's mobility. For example improvements can be attained in autonomic function of multiple physiological systems, such as improved cardiovascular and bladder control, sexual function, and temperature regulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The systems described herein may be readily realized in a network communications system.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">The term “motor complete” when used with respect to a spinal cord injury indicates that there is no motor function below the lesion, (e.g., no movement can be voluntarily induced in muscles innervated by spinal segments below the spinal lesion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">The term “monopolar stimulation” refers to stimulation between a local electrode and a common distant return electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">The term “autonomic function” refers to functions controlled by the nervous system that are controlled largely below the level of consciousness, and typically involve visceral functions. Illustrative autonomic functions include, but are not limited to control of bowel, bladder, and body temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The term “sexual function” refers to the ability to sustain a penile erection, have an orgasm (male or female), generate viable sperm, and/or undergo an observable physiological change associated with sexual arousal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">The term “cognitive function” refers to awareness of one's surrounding environment and the ability to function effectively, behaviorally, and mentally in a given environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments, transcutaneous electrical stimulation (tESCS) of the spinal cord can induce activation locomotor circuitry in a mammal (e.g., in a human or a non-human mammal). Further, tECS of the spinal cord can induce activation voluntary locomotor circuitry in a mammal (e.g., in a human or a non-human mammal).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Also, continuous tESCS at 5-40 Hz applied paraspinally over T11-T12 vertebrae at 40-70 mA can induce involuntary locomotor like stepping movements in subjects with their legs in a gravity-independent position. In other embodiments, continuous tESCS at 5-40 Hz applied paraspinally over T11-T12 vertebrae at 40-70 mA can induce voluntary locomotor like stepping movements in subjects with their legs in a gravity-independent position. An increase of frequency of tESCS from 5 to 30 Hz results in augmentation of the amplitude of evoked stepping movements. In chronic spinal cats (3 weeks after spinal cord transection at Th8) tESCS at L5 (a frequency of 5 Hz and intensity ranged from 3 to 10 mA) evoked EMG stepping pattern in hindlimb muscles in all (N=4) of tested animals, while locomotor-like movements produced by tESCS were not weight-bearing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">By non-limiting example, transcutaneous electrical stimulation can be applied to facilitate restoration of voluntary movement, locomotion, and other neurologic function in subjects suffering with spinal cord injury, as well as other neurological injury and illness. Successful application can provide a device for widespread use in rehabilitation of neurologic injury and disease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">The neuromodulation system may facilitate or induce voluntary movement in a mammalian subject (e.g., a human) having a spinal cord injury, brain injury, or other neurological disease or injury. In certain embodiments, the neuromodulation system is configured to stimulate the spinal cord of the subject using a surface electrode where the stimulation modulates the electrophysiological properties of selected spinal circuits in the subject so they can be activated by proprioceptive derived information and/or input from supraspinal. In some embodiments, stimulation may be accompanied by physical training (e.g., movement) of the region where the sensory-motor circuits of the spinal cord are located. In other embodiments, the stimulation includes a biphasic signal and an overlapping high frequency pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">In some embodiments, the neuromodulation system is configured to stimulate the spinal cord with electrodes that modulate the proprioceptive and supraspinal information which controls the lower limbs during standing and/or stepping and/or the upper limbs during reaching and/or grasping conditions. In some embodiments, proprioceptive and cutaneous sensory information can guide the activation of the muscles in a coordinated manner and in a manner that accommodates the external conditions, e.g., the amount of loading, speed, and direction of stepping or whether the load is equally dispersed on the two lower limbs, indicating a standing event, alternating loading indicating stepping, or sensing postural adjustments signifying the intent to reach and grasp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Unlike approaches that involve specific stimulation of motor neurons to directly induce a movement, the neuromodulation system described herein enables spinal circuitry to control the movements. More specifically, the neuromodulation system described herein can exploit the spinal circuitry and its ability to interpret proprioceptive information and to respond to that proprioceptive information in a functional way. In some embodiments, this is in contrast to other approaches where the actual movement is induced/controlled by direct stimulation (e.g., of particular motor neurons).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">In one example embodiment, a subject is fitted with one or more surface electrodes that afford selective stimulation and control capability to select sites, mode(s), and intensity of stimulation via electrodes placed superficially over, for example, the lumbosacral spinal cord and/or cervical spinal cord to facilitate movement of the arms and/or legs of individuals with a severely debilitating neuromotor disorder. The subject is provided the generator control unit and is fitted with an electrode(s) and then tested to identify the most effective subject specific stimulation paradigms for facilitation of movement (e.g., stepping and standing and/or arm and/or hand movement). Using these stimulation paradigms, the subject practices standing and stepping, reaching or grabbing, and/or breathing and speech therapy in an interactive rehabilitation program while being subject to spinal stimulation as described herein including a biphasic signal and an overlapping high frequency pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Depending on the site/type of injury and the locomotor activity it is desired to facilitate, particular spinal stimulation protocols include, but are not limited to, specific stimulation sites along the lumbosacral, thoracic, and/or cervical spinal cord; specific combinations of stimulation sites along the lumbosacral, thoracic, and/or cervical spinal cord and/or brainstem; specific stimulation amplitudes; specific stimulation polarities (e.g., monopolar and bipolar stimulation modalities); specific stimulation frequencies; and/or specific stimulation pulse widths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">In some embodiments, the neuromodulation system is designed so that the patient can use and control it in the home environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">In some embodiments, the approach is not to electrically induce a walking pattern or standing pattern of activation, but to enable/facilitate it so that when the subject manipulates their body position, the spinal cord can receive proprioceptive information from the legs (or arms) that can be readily recognized by the spinal circuitry. Then, the spinal cord knows whether to step or to stand or to do nothing. In other words, this enables the subject to begin stepping or to stand or to reach and grasp when they choose after the stimulation pattern has been initiated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Moreover, the neuromodulation system described herein is effective in a spinal cord injured subject that is clinically classified as motor complete; that is, there is no motor function below the lesion. In some embodiments, the specific combination of electrode(s) activated/stimulated and/or the desired stimulation of any one or more electrodes and/or the stimulation amplitude (strength) can be varied in real time, e.g., by the subject. Closed loop control can be embedded in the process by engaging the spinal circuitry as a source of feedback and feed-forward processing of proprioceptive input and by voluntarily imposing fine tuning modulation in stimulation parameters based on visual, and/or kinetic, and/or kinematic input from selected body segments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">In some embodiments, the neuromodulation system is designed so that a subject with no voluntary movement capacity can execute effective voluntary movements such as, but not limited to standing and/or stepping and/or reaching and/or grasping. In addition, the approach described herein can play an important role in facilitating recovery of individuals with severe although not complete injuries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, the neuromodulation system may provide some basic postural, locomotor and reaching and grasping patterns to a user. In some embodiments, the neuromodulation system may provide a building block for future recovery strategies. In some embodiments, a strategy of combining effective transcutaneous stimulation of the appropriate spinal circuits with physical rehabilitation and pharmacological intervention can provide practical therapies for complete SCI human patients. Such an approach may be enough to enable weight bearing standing, stepping and/or reaching or grasping or other movements. Such capability can give SCI patients with complete paralysis or other neuromotor dysfunctions the ability to participate in exercise, which is known to be highly beneficial for their physical and mental health. In some embodiments, the neuromodulation system may enable movement with the aid of assistive walkers. While far from complete recovery of all movements, even simple standing and short duration walking would increase these patients' autonomy and quality of life. The neuromodulation system described herein (e.g., transcutaneous electrical stimulation) can provide for a direct brain-to-spinal cord interface that could enable more lengthy and finer control of movements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">While the neuromodulation systems described herein are discussed with reference to complete spinal injury, it will be recognized that they can apply to subjects with partial spinal injury, subjects with brain injuries (e.g., ischemia, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and the like), and/or subjects with neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, dystonia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), cerebral palsy, and the like).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">In some embodiments, the neuromodulation system may be used in conjunction with physical training (e.g., rigorously monitored (robotic) physical training) and optionally in combination with pharmacological techniques or other drug delivery. The neuromodulation system enables the spinal cord circuitry to utilize sensory input as well as newly established functional connections from the brain to circuits below the spinal lesion as a source of control signals. The approach is thus designed to enable and facilitate the natural sensory input as well as supraspinal connections to the spinal cord in order to control movements, rather than induce the spinal cord to directly induce the movement. That is, the neuromodulation system facilitates and enhances the intrinsic neural control mechanisms of the spinal cord that exist post-SCI, rather than replace or ignore them.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">Processing of Sensory Input by the Lumbosacral Spinal Cord: Using Afferents as Source of Control</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">In some embodiments, the neuromodulation exploits spinal control of locomotor activity. For example, the human spinal cord may receive sensory input associated with a movement such as stepping, and this sensory information can be used to modulate the motor output to accommodate the appropriate speed of stepping and level of load that is imposed on lower limbs. Moreover, the human lumbosacral spinal cord has central-pattern-generation-like properties. Thus, oscillations of the lower limbs can be induced simply by vibrating the vastus lateralis muscle of the lower limb, by transcutaneous stimulation, and by stretching the hip. The neuromodulation system exploits the fact that the human spinal cord, in complete or incomplete SCI subjects, can receive and interpret proprioceptive and somatosensory information that can be used to control the patterns of neuromuscular activity among the motor pools necessary to generate particular movements (e.g., standing, stepping, reaching, grasping, and the like). The neuromodulation system described herein facilitates and adapts the operation of the existing spinal circuitry that generates, for example, cyclic step-like movements via a combined approach of transcutaneous stimulation, physical training, and, optionally, pharmacology.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Facilitating Stepping and Standing in Humans Following a Clinically Complete Lesion</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">Locomotion in mammals is attributed to intrinsic oscillating spinal neural networks capable of central pattern generation interacting with sensory information. These networks play critical roles in generating the timing of the complex postural and rhythmic motor patterns executed by motor neurons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">As indicated above, the neuromodulation system described herein can involve stimulation of one or more regions of the spinal cord in combination with locomotory activities. Spinal stimulation in combination with locomotor activity results in the modulation of the electrophysiological properties of spinal circuits in the subject so they are activated by Proprioceptive information derived from the region of the subject where locomotor activity is to be facilitated. Further, spinal stimulation in combination with pharmacological agents and locomotor activity results in the modulation of the electrophysiological properties of spinal circuits in the subject so they are activated by proprioceptive information derived from the region of the subject where locomotor activity is to be facilitated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">Locomotor activity of the region of interest can be accomplished by any of a number of methods known, for example, to physical therapists. By way of illustration, individuals after severe SCI can generate standing and stepping patterns when provided with body weight support on a treadmill and manual assistance. During both stand and step training of human subjects with SCI, the subjects can be placed on a treadmill in an upright position and suspended in a harness at the maximum load at which knee buckling and trunk collapse can be avoided. Trainers positioned, for example, behind the subject and at each leg assist as needed in maintaining proper limb kinematics and kinetics appropriate for each specific task. During bilateral standing, both legs can be loaded simultaneously and extension can be the predominant muscular activation pattern, although co-activation of flexors can also occur. Additionally, or alternatively, during stepping the legs are loaded in an alternating pattern and extensor and flexor activation patterns within each limb also alternated as the legs moved from stance through swing. Afferent input related to loading and stepping rate can influence these patterns, and training has been shown to improve these patterns and function in clinically complete SCI subjects.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Transcutaneous Stimulation of the Lumbosacral Spinal Cord</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">As indicated above, without being bound by a particular theory, it is believed that transcutaneous stimulation (e.g., over the thoracic spinal cord) in combination with physical training can facilitate recovery of stepping and standing in human subjects following a complete SCI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">Spinal cord electrical stimulation has been successfully used in humans for suppression of pain and spasticity. Recent efforts to optimize stimulation parameters have led to a number of research studies focusing on the benefits of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation. The location of the electrode and its stimulation parameters can be important in defining the motor response. Use of surface electrode(s), as described herein, can facilitate selection or alteration of particular stimulation sites as well as the application of a wide variety of stimulation parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">The following non-limiting examples are offered for illustrative purposes.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Example 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0009">Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation of the Spinal Cord: A Noninvasive Tool for the Activation of Stepping Pattern Generators in Humans</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">A noninvasive method for activating the SN by means of transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (tESCS) is demonstrated in this Example. The method is based on our research that showed that a single dermal electric stimulus applied in the region of the T11-T12 vertebrae caused monosynaptic reflexes in the proximal and distal leg muscles in healthy subjects and in patients with clinically complete (ASIA A) spinal cord injury. Taking into consideration that eESCS affects the SN through mono and polysynaptic reflexes, we suggested that noninvasive tESCS can be an effective way to neuromodulate the SN.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Experiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">We examined six healthy adult male subjects (students and staff of the Velikie Luki State Academy of Physical Education and Sports). They had given their informed written consent to participate in the experiment. The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of the academy and met the requirements of the Helsinki Declaration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">The subjects lay on a couch on their left side, with their feet placed on separate boards that were attached to a hook in the ceiling of the experimental room with ropes, like swings. The right (upper) leg was supported directly in the region of the shank. The left (lower) leg was placed in a rotating frame attached to a horizontal board. Under these conditions, the subjects could move their legs through maximum amplitude: According to the instructions, the subjects lay quietly and neither counteracted nor facilitated the movements caused by electrical stimulation of the spinal cord.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">The tESCS was performed using a KULON stimulator (St. Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation, St. Petersburg, Russia). The stimulation was administered using a 2.5 cm round electrode (Lead-Lok, Sandpoint, United States) placed midline on the skin between the spinous processes of T11 and T12 as a cathode and two 5.0×10.2 cm rectangular plates made of conductive plastic (Ambu, Ballerup, Germany) placed symmetrically on the skin over the iliac crests as anodes. The step-like movements were evoked by a bipolar rectangular stimulus with a duration of 0.5 ms, filled with a carrier frequency of 10 kHz; the intensity of stimulation ranged from 30 to 100 mA. The stimulation frequencies were 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 Hz; the duration of exposure ranged from 10 to 30 s. During the high-frequency stimulation within each stimulus, tESCS did not cause pain even when the amplitude was increased to 100 mA or more; allowing us to study in detail the dependence of the elicited movements on the amplitude and frequency of the stimulus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">The EMGs of the muscles of both legs (m. rectus femoris, m. biceps femoris, m. tibialis anterior, and m. gastrocnemius) were recorded by means of bipolar surface electrodes. EMG signals were recorded using an ME 6000 16-channel telemetric electroneuromyograph (Mega Wn, Finland). Flexion-extension movements in the knee joints were recorded using a goniometer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">The Qualisy video system (Sweden) was used to record the kinematic parameters of leg movements. Light-reflecting markers were attached to the pivot points of the body, which coincided with the rotational axis in the shoulder, hip, knee, and ankle joints. The angular movements in the hip joint were calculated from the location of markers on the lateral epicondyle of the humorous, trochanter, and lateral epicondyle of the femur. The markers that were attached to the trochanter, lateral epicondyle of the femur, and lateral ankle were used to describe the movements in the knee joint. The movements in the ankle joint were estimated by means of the markers located on the lateral epicondyle of the femur, lateral ankle, and the big toe. The reconstruction of movements in one whole step cycle was performed by means of special software. In order to record the movements of the foot tip, the marker was fixed on the big toe of the right foot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">The recording of EMG was synchronized with the recording of stepping kinematical parameters. The average cycle duration and the amplitudes of angular movements were calculated from 10-12 cycles. The duration of a step cycle was calculated on the basis of the interval between two maximum values of angular movements in the hip, knee, and ankle joints. The phase shift between the hip and knee joints was calculated from the interval between the maximum values of angular movements in these joints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">The statistical treatment of the data was performed using a standard software package.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Results</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation with a frequency of 5-40 Hz elicited involuntary leg movements in five out of six subjects. The threshold intensity of the stimulus that induced involuntary movements was 50-60 mA and was dependent on the frequency of stimulation. The tESCS at a frequency of 1 Hz caused reflex responses in the leg muscles with a threshold of 70-80 mA (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8<i>a</i> </figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">Original records of EMG responses in the muscles of the right leg to the tESCS at a frequency of 1 Hz and intensity of 75-100 mA are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Increasing stimulus intensity resulted in an increase in the amplitude of responses. First, the hip muscles (m. rectus femoris and m. biceps femoris) were involved in the motor response; then, the shank muscles (m. tibialis anterior and m. gastrocnemius) were involved (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8<i>b</i> </figref>). The response to each stimulus is composed of the early monosynaptic responses (the same is shown in Courtine, Harkema, Dy, Gerasimenko, and Dyhre-Poulsen, supra) with a latency period of about 12-15 ms. Increasing stimulus intensity evoked responses in the biceps femoris muscle (flexor) with a latent period of a few tens of milliseconds, which were, apparently, polysynaptic. Thus, tESCS with a low frequency (1 Hz) elicited reflex responses in the leg muscles that contained mono and polysynaptic components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">Transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation at frequencies in the entire range from 5 to 40 Hz caused step-like movements in five subjects (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). There was some variability in the ability of tESCS to evoke step-like movements at different frequencies of stimulation. In two subjects (R. and S.), step-like movements were evoked by tESCS at all the test frequencies in the range 5-40 Hz; in subjects K and G., they were recorded at frequencies of 5, 10, 20, and 30 Hz; and in subject B, they were recorded at frequencies of 5 and 30 Hz. The latent period of the starting of movements did not depend on the frequency of stimulation and was in the range of 0.2-2.5 s. The amplitude of movements in subjects S, G, and R at the beginning of stimulation gradually increased to the maximum, and after its termination it gradually decreased. In subjects K and V, the movements terminated against the background of ongoing tESCS, the duration of the stepping pattern was approximately 10-20 s. In subjects R and S, the movements continued during the whole period of stimulation and ended 2-4 s after its termination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">Pair wise comparison of the mean amplitudes of the movements of the hip, knee, and ankle joints calculated during the first and the last 15 s of stimulation at each of the frequencies used allowed us to determine the probability of the differences in the amplitudes of the induced movements at the beginning and at the end of the stimulation (see Table 1, below). Two rows of probabilities for subject C, calculated on the bases of two experiments show the different direction of the changes in the amplitudes at the beginning and end of stimulation. In the table, the cases when the amplitude of movements at the end of the stimulation was significantly greater than in the beginning are boldfaced; the cases when the amplitude of movements at the end of the stimulation was significantly lower than in the beginning are italicized. According to the data, the subjects were divided into two groups. In the first group (subjects R and S), step-like movements were evoked by the stimulation at the entire range of the frequencies studied (5-40 Hz), and the amplitude of movements, while growing at the beginning of stimulation, decayed after its termination. In the second group (subjects K and V), the movements were evoked with difficulty and with a limited set of frequencies. These differences could be related both to the individual characteristics of the electrical conductivity of the skin and to characteristics of the spinal connections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">The involuntary movements of the legs caused by tESCS fully complied with the characteristics of stepping movements (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Like voluntary stepping movements, the involuntary movements caused by tESCS surely contain the alternating contractions of the similar muscles of the left and right legs and the alternation of antagonist muscle activity in the hip and shin (rectus femoris and biceps femoris, gastrocnemius and tibial muscle of the shin). As clearly seen in the curves reflecting the motion of the hip and knee joints, the movements in these joints, both voluntary and evoked by tESCS, occurred with a phase shift (the motion in the knee ahead of the motion in the hip).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">Stepping cycles in three joints of the right leg during voluntary stepping movements (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11<i>a</i> </figref>) and movements elicited by tESCS reconstructed based on the kinematic analysis and the trajectory of the tip of the foot (the big toe) are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In step-like movements elicited by tESCS, as in voluntary stepping movements, the phase of carrying the leg forward and the phase of support during the backward leg movements were distinct (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11<i>a</i>, 11<i>b</i> </figref>). During voluntary movements, the patterns of the knee and ankle joints are more complex than during the elicited movements. The coordination between the joints during the evoked movements is very different from that observed during voluntary movements (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11<i>c</i>, 4<i>d</i> </figref>). The same is true for the movements of the distal region of the leg, resulting from the interaction of movements in all three joints, and recorded using a marker attached to the big toe (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11<i>f</i> </figref>). The trajectory of the terminal point in voluntary movements looked like an ellipse (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11<i>f</i> </figref>). The trajectory of the terminal point in the movements elicited by tESCS may be considered a confluent ellipse, with the leg moving forward and backward without significant vertical movements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">The frequency of step-like movements did not depend on the frequency of stimulation. The average periods of step-like movements in subjects R, S, K, B, and G were 2.72±0.14, 2.39±0.55, 2.42±0.15, 3.22±0.85, and 1.9±0.09 s, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">As mentioned above, the pair wise comparison of the mean amplitudes of the movements in the hip, knee, and ankle joints calculated in the first and the last 15 s of stimulation in different subjects, showed that, regardless of the stimulation frequency, the amplitude of movements may either increase or decrease significantly. At the beginning of stimulation, there was a tendency for the amplitude of movements to increase with increasing frequency of stimulation in all subjects for all joints (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). However, at the end of stimulation, the amplitude of movements was independent of the stimulation frequency. In all joints, minimum movements were observed at a stimulation frequency of 5 Hz (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12<i>b</i>, 12<i>d</i> </figref>). As an exception, only in one case, when subject S. was stimulated, the amplitude of movements in the hip joint increased with increasing stimulation frequency and the amplitude of movements in the knee and ankle joints decreased with increasing frequency [<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>; table 1, subject S. (1)]. The trajectory of movement of the big toe of this subject, reflecting the amplitude of the whole leg's movement, is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12<i>a</i> </figref>. In this case, the amplitude of movement of the tip of the foot at stimulation frequencies of 10, 20, 30, and 40 Hz was, respectively, 15.0, 19.9, 15.3, and 16.4 times greater than at 5 Hz. In the case shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12<i>b</i> </figref>, it was, respectively, 3.5, 9.4, 11.3, and 80.7 times greater than at 5 Hz. Thus, in this subject, with increasing frequency of stimulation, the amplitude of leg movements did not decrease in any of the cases; it was minimal at a frequency of 5 Hz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">Note that, in the cases shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12<i>b </i>and 12<i>d</i> </figref>, an increase in frequency resulted in a significant increase in the amplitude of movements in the ankle joint. The possibility to control the movements in the ankle joint via the frequency of stimulation was an advantage of tECS, unlike the ankle joint which was not modulated in vibration-induced step-like movements.

<heading id="h-0012">Discussion</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the lumbar enlargement may strengthen the patterns of EMG activity in leg muscles in patients with complete or partial spinal cord lesions during assisted walking movements on a moving treadmill. However, voluntary step-like movements were never successfully evoked by means of transcutaneous stimulation in this category of patients before. It was observed that transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied to the rostral segments of the lumbar enlargement (in the region of the T11-T12 vertebrae) elicited involuntary step-like movements in healthy subjects with their legs suspended in a gravity-neutral position. This phenomenon was observed in five out of the six subjects studied. tESCS did not cause discomfort and was easily tolerated by subjects when biphasic stimuli filled with a carrier frequency of 10 kHz which suppressed the sensitivity of pain receptors were used.</div>
<heading id="h-0013">Reflex Nature of the Responses Evoked by tESCS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">A single transcutaneous electrical stimulation in the region of the T11-T12 vertebrae causes responses in leg muscles with a latency period corresponding to monosynaptic reflexes. It was assumed that these responses are due to the activation of large-diameter dorsal root afferents. The monosynaptic nature of these responses is confirmed by the fact that vibration of muscle tendons or paired stimulation suppresses the responses. We have previously shown that the responses to the second stimulus were suppressed in rats during epidural stimulation and in healthy humans during paired tESCS with a delay between the stimuli of 50 ms. This refractory period excludes the possibility of direct activation of the motor neurons in the ventral horn or ventral root activation. The monosynaptic nature of the responses was also shown during vibration tests. It is well known that vibration suppresses monosynaptic reflex pathways in homologous muscles. The suppression of responses caused by tESCS in shin muscles during the vibration of the Achilles tendon directly shows the monosynaptic nature of these responses. The similarity of modulations of the classical monosynaptic H-reflex and reflex responses caused by tESCS during walking in healthy subjects and in patients with spinal cord injuries also supports the monosynaptic nature of the responses to transcutaneous stimulation. In both cases, the amplitude of modulation of the reflexes was proportional and phase-dependent on the activation level of each muscle. All of the above data indicate the identity of the H-reflex and reflex responses induced by tESCS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">In the flexor muscles affected by tESCS, polysynaptic reflexes were sometimes recorded in addition to the monosynaptic component (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Earlier, we recorded polysynaptic reflexes in the flexor the intact and spinal animals during the single epidural stimulation. Data suggests that tESCS can activate mono and polysynaptic neuronal networks.</div>
<heading id="h-0014">Characteristics of Transcutaneous Stimulation Eliciting Step-Like Movements</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">The previous experiments showed that the rostral segments of the lumbar spinal cord may play the role of triggers in initiating locomotor movements. In spinal patients and in spinal rats, step-like patterns of EMG activity were evoked by epidural stimulation of the L2 segment. In our experiments, we used transcutaneous electrical stimulation in the region of T11-T12 vertebrae, which corresponds to the cutaneous projection of the L2-L3 segments of the spinal cord. The electromagnetic stimulation of this region in healthy subjects with their legs supported externally can initiate walking movements. Data are consistent with the current concept on the structural and functional organization of the SN with distributed pacemaking and pattern-generating systems, in which the rostral lumbar segments of the spinal cord play the role of a trigger of the locomotor function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">The frequency of stimulation can be an important characteristic of the motor output. It was shown that step-like movements are evoked by stimulation frequencies in the range of 5-40 Hz. The amplitude of step-like movements induced by high-frequency stimulation (30-40 Hz) was usually higher than that of the movements induced by low frequency stimulation (5 Hz), although the duration of the stepping cycle varied slightly. The fact that a wide range of frequencies can effectively induce step-like movements is probably due to the functional state of the intact spinal cord and its pathways. For example, in spinal patients, the effective frequency range for the initiation of step-like movements using epidural stimulation was 30-40 Hz; in decerebrated cats, the frequency of 5 Hz was the most effective to elicit locomotion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">The intensity of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (50-80 mA) that causes step-like movements is approximately 10 times higher than the intensity of the epidural stimulation initiating walking movements in spinal patients. If the dorsal roots are the main target for both types of stimulation, the current may be strong to activate them by transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Thus, we conclude that the location, frequency, and intensity of stimulation can be the factors that determine the activation of the SN by tESCS.</div>
<heading id="h-0015">The Origin of the Stepping Rhythm Evoked by tESCS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">In most subjects, the involuntary step-like movements in the hip and knee joints were initiated by tESCS with a delay of 2-3 s after the start of stimulation. Typically, the amplitude of movements in the hip and knee joints increased smoothly and gradually with the subsequent involvement of the ankle joint (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). A similar character of the initiation of involuntary step-like movements with gradual involvement of different motor pools of the leg muscles was also observed during the vibration of muscles and the epidural spinal cord stimulation. This suggests that transcutaneous electrical stimulation, as well as the epidural stimulation, affects the SN through the activation of the dorsal root afferents entering the spinal cord. In addition to the dorsal roots and dorsal columns, the direct stimulation of the spinal cord may also activate the pyramidal and reticulospinal tracts, ventral roots, motor neurons, dorsal horn, and sympathetic tracts. During the tESCS, the electric current spreads perpendicular to the spinal column with a high density under the paravertebral electrode. This stimulation apparently activates the dorsal roots immersed in the cerebrospinal fluid, but not the spinal cord neurons, which have a much lower conductivity. In some embodiments, tESCS consequently involves in activity the afferents of groups Ia and Ib with the largest diameter and, thus, the lowest threshold, then the afferents of the group II, and the spinal interneurons mediating polysynaptic reflexes. The presence of polysynaptic components in the evoked potentials in the flexor muscles (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) confirms that they participate in the SPG. Thus, we can say that tESCS activates different spinal neuronal systems; however, the dorsal roots with their mono and polysynaptic projections to the motor nuclei are the main ones among them. The contribution of mono and polysynaptic components in the formation of the stepping rhythm caused by tESCS is not known.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">In our studies, single pulse stimulation resulted in monosynaptic reflexes in the majority of the leg muscles investigated. However, the electromyographic trains evoked by continuous tESCS that induced involuntary step-like movements were not formed by the amplitude modulation of monosynaptic reflexes, as it was in spinal rats and during the spinal epidural stimulation of patients. Our data showed that the activity within electromyographic trains was not stimulus-dependent; i.e., EMG trains did not consist of separate reflex responses. Similar stimulus-independent EMG trains were observed during involuntary movements caused by spinal cord electromagnetic stimulation. In contrast, the step-like movements evoked by the epidural spinal stimulation in rats and spinal patients were stimulus-dependent. In the extensor muscles, the EMG trains consisted mainly of monosynaptic reflexes; in the flexor muscles, polysynaptic reflexes dominated in the EMG trains. It is not clear why single cutaneous and, respectively, single epidural spinal cord stimulation causes the same monosynaptic reflexes in healthy subjects and spinal patients; however, continuous stimulation elicits their step-like movements through different mechanisms. In healthy subjects, tESCS can increase the excitability of the neuronal locomotor network, being a trigger for its activation, in the same way as in the case of vibration-induced step-like movements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">In this study, a new noninvasive access to locomotor spinal neural networks in humans by means of tESCS has been described. A special design of the stimulator, which generated bipolar pulses filled with high-frequency carrier, allowed us to stimulate the spinal cord relatively painlessly and elicit involuntary step-like movements. The fundamental importance of our study consists in the new data in favor of the existence of SN in humans that can coordinate stepping patterns and the evidence of the possibility to engage this SN using noninvasive effects on the structures of the spinal cord. This increases prospects for widespread use of transcutaneous techniques in electrical spinal cord stimulation to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the locomotor behavior in healthy subjects and for the rehabilitation and motor recovery of patients after spinal cord injuries and after other neuromotor dysfunctions.</div>

<heading id="h-0017">Voluntary Movements</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">We conducted a series of weekly training-testing sessions over a period of about 18 weeks (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Each session from t<sub>1</sub>-t<sub>4 </sub>consisted of stimulation at the level of T11, Co1, and the combination of the two sites with and without simultaneous voluntary effort to move the lower limb in a stepping motion. In addition, each session consisted of passively oscillating the limbs in a step-like fashion for three minutes without and three minutes with continuous stimulation. These passive perturbations conditioned each individual. From t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>4</sub>, the same procedures were followed but without the conditioning perturbations. This reduced level of perturbation was designed to maintain and sustain a plateau performance prior to the initiation of the drug phase of the intervention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">Over the 18-week period, six recording sessions (t<sub>1</sub>-t<sub>6</sub>; <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) were performed of detailed assessments reflecting quality of stepping-like motions. In the first four weeks (⅘), subjects performed all four training-testing sessions, whereas subject 5 only two training-testing sessions at three and four weeks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">To determine the effects of fEmc plus pcEmc the subjects were trained-tested weekly over a period of 4 weeks (t<sub>5</sub>-t<sub>6</sub>). To determine the potential for locomotor-like stepping all training and periodic testing (t<sub>1</sub>-t<sub>6</sub>) were performed in an apparatus designed to minimize gravitational effects (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">Experimental Design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">The subjects were tested while lying on their left side with the upper leg supported directly in the area of the shank and the lower leg placed on a rotating brace attached to a horizontal board supported by vertical ropes secured to hooks in the ceiling. This arrangement allowed for the suspended legs to move in an anterior-posterior plane in a gravity-neutral position. For electrical stimulation at T11 and/or Co1 a specific stimulation or stimulation waveform can be and was used that does not elicit pain, even when used at energies required to transcutaneously reach the spinal cord. This stimulation can include a biphasic signal and an overlapping high frequency pulse. Painless transcutaneous electrical stimulation (pcEmc) was delivered using a 2.5 cm round electrode (Lead Lok, Sandpoint, United States) placed midline on the skin between spinous processes T11-T12 (simply T11) or over coccyx 1 (Co1) as a cathode and two 5.0×10.2 cm<sup>2 </sup>rectangular plates made of conductive plastic (Ambu, Ballerup, Germany) placed symmetrically on the skin over the iliac crests as anodes.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">Leg movements were evoked by monopolar rectangular stimuli (1 ms duration) filled with a carrier frequency of 10 kHz and at an intensity ranging from 80 to 180 mA. The stimulation frequency was 30 Hz at T11 and 5 Hz at Co1. The duration of continuous exposure ranged from 10 to 180 s. Bipolar surface electrodes were placed bilaterally on the soleus, medial gastrocnemius (MG), tibialis anterior (TA), medial hamstring (HM), and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles. EMG signals were amplified differentially (bandwidth of 10 Hz to 10 kHz) and acquired at 10 KHz using a 16-channel hard-wired A/D board and customized LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Austin, Tex.) acquisition program. To minimize artifacts from the stimulation, the EMG signals were passed through a band-pass filter using a six-order band-pass Butterworth filter (30-200 Hz). The filtered EMG signals were analyzed off-line to compute the amplitude, duration, and timing of individual bursts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">Angular displacements at hip and knee joints in both legs were recorded with goniometers. Two procedural sequences were followed for each subject on a given day of testing. Each subject was tested weekly up to eighteen weeks. The subjects had access to visual feedback via a mirror placed so that movement of the legs could be observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">Conditioning Procedures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">The conditioning procedure consisted of imposing passive movement of the legs in an oscillatory pattern for three minutes (conditioning) and then imposing a passive movement plus stimulation at T11, Co1 or T11+Co1 simultaneously for three minutes. The total time for each testing session was about 45 minutes. The same protocol was followed once a week for the first and last four weeks. Whether the conditioning treatment only within a single training session could facilitate the ability to generate knee oscillations without and with stimulation at t<sub>6 </sub>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A-19D</figref>) was also tested.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Drug Treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">All subjects were informed that they would receive either a placebo or the serotoninergic agonist buspirone. All subjects were given buspirone 7.5 mg orally twice daily for the last 4 weeks (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">Clinical Statement of the Patients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">The University of California, Los Angeles Institutional Review Board approved all procedures. Subjects were enrolled based on the enrollment criteria of traumatic cervical or thoracic injury, AIS B, greater than 1 year from injury, and stable motor function as documented by sequential clinical exams. The clinical profiles of the subjects upon enrollment into this study are as follows: Subject 1 (S1) is a 42 year old male who suffered a T3-T4 SCI after a steer wrestling accident and was 24 months from initial injury. S2 is a 20 year old male who suffered a C5-C6 SCI sustained during a football game and was 36 months from initial injury; S3 is a 20 year old male who suffered a C6 SCI after a motor vehicle accident and was 36 months from initial injury; S4 is a 19 year old male who suffered a C7 SCI during a swimming accident and was 24 months from injury; and S5 is a 56 year old male who suffered a T3-T4 SCI after a bicycle accident and was 72 months from injury. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all subjects to confirm the location and extent of the injury (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">Electrophysiological Assessment of the Patients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">Transcranial magnetic motor evoked potential (MEP) tests and lower extremity somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) tests were obtained in all subjects. For MEP, all subjects demonstrated absence of lower extremity muscle activity upon stimulation at the cortical level and no conduction was observed through the level of impairment. For SEP, subjects demonstrated absence of cortical peaks bilaterally with no evidence of conduction across the known spinal cord injury.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">Additionally, the ability to control the leg muscles voluntarily was tested in all subjects while in a supine position. Flexor (TA) EMG was recorded during dorsiflexion and extensor (MG and soleus) EMG during plantarflexion and evoked potentials were recorded in the leg muscles in response to pcEmc at T11-T12 during attempts to maximally dorsiflex or plantarflex. In uninjured subjects, the amplitudes of the muscle evoked potentials were higher with a voluntary contraction compared to those recorded at rest (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>). In all SCI subjects there was minimal EMG activity during these attempts and the amplitude of the evoked potentials were similar to those recorded at rest (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21B-21F</figref>). In two subjects (S2 and S5) the intent to dorsiflex surprisingly led to an increase in the amplitude of the evoked potentials in the extensor, but not the flexor, muscles (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21C and 21F</figref>), indicating aberrant neuronal (or neuromuscular) connections. These electrophysiological results indicate that voluntary control of the leg muscles was absent in these patients. These electrophysiological assessments are consistent with the morphological assessments derived from MRI (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">Assessment of Voluntary Movements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">The ability to facilitate voluntarily generated locomotor-like movements during spinal cord pcEmc when the legs were placed in a gravity-neutral position was determined. After instructing each subject to oscillate the limbs as if stepping, the subject was asked to relax for a period of 15-20 sec before we initiated pcEmc with the cathode at the T11 and/or Co1 vertebral level. Then, the subject was asked to attempt to voluntarily oscillate the legs in the presence at T11, Co1, or T11+Co1. In the first Pre-Train session without pcEmc, initially none of the subjects could voluntarily initiate or influence rhythmic locomotor-like limb movements and rhythmic EMG activity of the leg muscles. After treatment with buspirone (Post-Drug), all subjects improved in generating oscillatory, locomotor-like movements with only a voluntary effort and the robustness of the movement was similar when voluntary effort was combined with pcEmc at T11+Co1 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">Statistical Analyses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">All statistics were performed in SPSS v. 19 (IBM) with base, regression, advanced models, and categories packages. Non-linear PCA (NL-PCA) was implemented using the CATPCA command with appropriate link functions to accommodate non-linear and non-normal distributional features for each variable. PC (object) scores were extracted across all endpoints, subjects, and levels of the repeated measures. PC retention was determined by the eigenvalue &gt;1 rule, and the face validity of PC loading patterns. PC1 scores then were carried forward as the principal outcomes for assessing the impact of the experimental manipulations by 3-way repeated measures ANOVA (GLM command), with each subject serving as their own control. Significant interactions were followed up by interaction graphing with assessment specific differences by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc. Significance was assessed at P&lt;0.05.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">PcEmc activation of locomotor neuronal networks was assessed. During the first testing session (t<sub>1</sub>) some rhythmic hip and knee movements and corresponding EMG activity were induced during pcEmc without any voluntary effort when the legs were placed in a gravity-neutral position (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>). Examples of the relative effects of spinal cord stimulation with the electrodes placed at T11 (30 Hz) or Co1 (5 Hz) vertebral levels and the combination of stimulation from both sites simultaneously on these leg movements in the same subject during Pre-Train (t<sub>1</sub>) and Post-Drug (t<sub>6</sub>) are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref> (same subject at t<sub>1 </sub>and t<sub>6 </sub>under each stimulation condition), respectively. The mean amplitudes of the angular movements at the hip and knee joints during voluntary efforts with and without stimulation were generally greater Post-Drug than Pre-Train (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>). In addition, the EMG bursts were generally more robust Post-Drug than Pre-Train (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref> vs. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">Also, voluntary control of leg movements enabled by pcEmc and training was assessed. Initially (t<sub>1</sub>) none of the subjects could voluntarily initiate rhythmic locomotor-like limb movements with any detectable rhythmic EMG activity of the leg muscles (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>). On the first day of testing (t<sub>1</sub>), there was more than a two-fold increase (P&lt;0.05) in the knee angle oscillatory range with a combination of voluntary effort and pcEmc compared to a voluntary effort alone or pcEmc alone (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>; t<sub>1</sub>). Some movement occurred at t<sub>1 </sub>with voluntary effort alone, but this was without any EMG oscillatory responses and occurred due to the subjects mechanically transferring trunk and hip motion to the lower limbs. At the end of the four weeks of training with pcEmc (t<sub>2</sub>), the subjects had not recovered a significant level of knee movement during a voluntary effort with or without stimulation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">Relative effectiveness of voluntary effort compared to voluntary effort plus pcEmc changed at the Post-Drug phase (t<sub>6</sub>). At the end of the drug phase, the overall performance during voluntary effort alone was as effective as voluntary effort plus stimulation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>). The average range of voluntary movement at the knee Post-Drug (t<sub>6</sub>) was two-fold greater than Pre-Drug (t<sub>2</sub>) and six-fold greater than at the initial test (t<sub>1</sub>) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>). These mean differences (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>) are even more impressive when considering the variation in the responsiveness to pcEmc as a function of subject specificity and the site of pcEmc in the response to fEmc treatment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A-16C</figref>). For example, the angular displacement for S1 was lower Post-Drug (t<sub>6</sub>) with the combination of voluntary effort plus stimulation at T11 vs. voluntary effort alone. This occurred at each of the stimulation sites for this subject. This also occurred with subject 4 with the stimulation sites involving T11 and T11 plus Co1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">Although the effects of pcEmc at different spinal levels and at different phases of the interventions varied among subjects, non-linear principal component analysis (NL-PCA) revealed a consistent linkage pattern between the hip and knee angular displacements (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16B-16C</figref>). Based on PC1 there was an emergence of organized oscillations in response to pcEmc, fEmc, and training.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">To determine whether there was an additive effect of fEmc to that observed with pcEmc and training further test were performed. An example of one subject's hip and knee displacements and the EMG of selected muscles at t<sub>1 </sub>vs. t<sub>5 </sub>is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>. Clear rhythmic EMG bursting and oscillatory movement of the hip and knee at t<sub>5 </sub>was compared to t<sub>1</sub>. After two weeks of pcEmc+fEmc treatment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>; t<sub>5</sub>), a significant facilitation in the mean voluntary performance (without pcEmc) of locomotor-like movements and this effect continued after two more weeks of pcEmc plus fEmc treatment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>; t<sub>6</sub>) was observed. These statistical comparisons suggest that 1) the magnitude of the range in knee oscillations was increased with voluntary effort plus pcEmc at t<sub>1 </sub>even within the first test session (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>), 2) there was a further increase in the range of these oscillations after four weeks of fEmc (t<sub>6</sub>) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>), and 3) there was notable subject-specificity for the stimulation site that evoked the greatest responses to the interventions at all phases (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A-16C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">Clinical assessment according to the ASIA impairment scale (AIS) is consistent with improvement of motor function after pcEmc+fEmc treatment in all five subjects (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>). No clinical movement (score of 0) was observed in any of the lower extremity joints at the Pre-Train phase (t<sub>1</sub>). An average improvement of 7 points was observed in this cohort during the Post-Drug (t<sub>6</sub>) condition. In the presence of these interventions this would be equivalent to the subjects being reclassified from AIS B to C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">Further, modulation of evoked potentials during voluntary efforts was assessed. While monitoring varying physiological states of the spinal circuits in vivo while performing motor tasks in animals and human subjects, we demonstrated electrophysiological evidence of supraspinally mediated neuromodulation of the spinal circuitry in the present subjects. To assess these interactions we recorded spinally evoked potentials generated in the TA and MG muscles when the subject was lying in the gravity-neutral apparatus. We asked the subject to swing the leg forward (flex) and backward (extend; shaded areas in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>) and then forward again in the presence of continuous stimulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18B and 18C</figref> show examples of the malleability of the brain-to-muscle connections in response to different pcEmc stimuli in the presence and absence of voluntary efforts to flex or extend the lower limbs. Also, by testing this brain-spinal connectivity when stimulating at the level of Co1 and/or T11, we observed clear inhibitory and excitatory patterns of responses in the TA and MG motor pools depending on the stimulation site. When stimulating at Co1 we observed a clear facilitation of the TA motor pool mediated by voluntary effort, whereas the MG motor pool was slightly suppressed with voluntary effort.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">In some embodiments, a consistent delay of the response of approximately 2 ms in the MG was observed when there was a voluntary effort to extend the lower limb (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>). The complexity of the functional brain-spinal connectivity is illustrated further by the suppression of any response in the MG when T11 and Co1 were stimulated simultaneously with or without voluntary effort and an evoked potential only occurring in the TA when there was a voluntary effort to extend (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>). These interactive effects of stimulation at different sites with and without voluntary efforts are summarized graphically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">In other embodiments, a combination of pcEmc, fEmc, and training can open new functional connections among brain-spinal cord networks and that these functional connections are highly dynamic and interactive. Given that significant improvements in motor function can continue to emerge three years after the implantation of epidural electrodes and the responses of individual motor pools to the newly emerged descending voluntary input to the spinal circuitry to pcEmc at different frequencies and at different sites along the spinal cord, interactions of each of these modulatory components are highly interdependent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">Further still, proprioceptive conditioning effects on voluntary leg movements were assessed. To show that the properties of these brain-spinal cord networks (e.g., circuitry plasticity over a period of weeks) could be modulated more acutely, at t<sub>6 </sub>we tested whether the proprioceptive-induced conditioning treatment within a single training session could facilitate the ability to generate knee oscillations with a voluntary effort alone or with a voluntary effort plus stimulation. The conditioning treatment consisted of imposing passive, continuous, anterior-posterior limb movements in an oscillatory step-like pattern (about 20 cycles/min) for three minutes without stimulation followed by three minutes with stimulation either at T11, Co1, or T11+Co1 with the subject's legs in a gravity-neutral apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">Changes in the EMG and kinematics output over the progression of a single three-minute conditioning session without pcEmc and then with pcEmc at T11 were followed. When we compared the EMG and kinematics responses during the first 30 seconds and the final 30 seconds of the three-minute conditioning bout, a gradual increase in EMG amplitude during the initial 30 seconds and remained elevated up to the final 30 seconds with little or no change in the kinematics with and without pcEmc (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>) was observed. An important difference was that the level of neuromodulation during conditioning combined with pcEmc was significantly greater than conditioning without pcEmc. Improved coordination of the motor pools for the knee and ankle flexors and extensors over these different 30-second time periods under each condition noted above also were evident (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">In some embodiments, the systems and methods described herein can after the completion of a three-minute conditioning period combined with T11 pcEmc increase the level of activation of the motor pools associated with the flexor and extensor muscles at the hip, knee, and ankle and the hip and knee displacement increased, e.g., significantly, with voluntary effort alone and with voluntary effort plus pcEmc beyond that observed prior to the procedure (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19C-D</figref>). This effect was greater, e.g., significantly, with voluntary effort plus pcEmc than with voluntary effort alone (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</figref>). Further, levels, e.g., significant, of reciprocal modulation in concert with elevated EMG amplitudes were observed in the presence of stimulation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>).</div>
