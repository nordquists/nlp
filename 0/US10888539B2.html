<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/477,034 filed Sep. 4, 2014, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">As the sixth-leading cause of cancer-related death globally, prostate cancer represents a significant risk for men. While the causes of prostate cancer are not fully understood, primary risk factors appear to include obesity, age and family history. Cardiovascular factors, diet, and sexual history may also play roles. Common treatments include surveillance, surgery, radiation, ultrasound, chemotherapy, and combinations thereof. However, many of the common treatments carry significant risks of complication. Studies probing links between diet and prevention of prostate cancer are tenuous and offer conflicting conclusions, although one recent study by T. M. Brasky, et al., has correlated high blood levels of EPA, DHA and DPA with an increased risk of prostate cancer. A need exists for improved treatments and preventatives for prostate cancer.</div>

For example, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C and fasting blood sugar can be sample from serum and analyzed using standard photometry techniques. VLDL-TG, LDL-C and VLDL-C can be calculated or determined using serum lipoprotein fractionation by preparative ultracentrifugation and subsequent quantitative analysis by refractometry or by analytic ultracentrifugal methodology. Apo A1, Apo B and hsCRP can be determined from serum using standard nephelometry techniques. Lipoprotein (a) can be determined from serum using standard turbidimetric immunoassay techniques. LDL particle number and particle size can be determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Remnants lipoproteins and LDL-phospholipase A2 can be determined from EDTA plasma or serum and serum, respectively, using enzymatic immunoseparation techniques. Oxidized LDL, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and interleukin-6 levels can be determined from serum using standard enzyme immunoassay techniques. These techniques are described in detail in standard textbooks, for example Tietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry, 6th Ed. (Burtis, Ashwood and Borter Eds.), WB Saunders Company.</div>

The statin was atorvostatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin. The dose of statin must have been stable for weeks prior to the LDL-C/TG baseline qualifying measurement for randomization. The statin dose was optimized such that the patients are at their LDL-C goal at the LDL-C/TG baseline qualifying measurements. The same statin at the same dose was continued until the study ended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0200">Patients taking any additional non-statin, lipid-altering medications (niacin &gt;200 mg/day, fibrates, fish oil, other products containing omega 3 fatty acids, or other herbal products or dietary supplements with potential lipid altering effects), either alone or in combination with statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe), must have been able to safely discontinue non-statin, lipid altering therapy at screening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0201">Patients at high risk for CVD, i.e., patients with clinical coronary heart disease (CHD) or clinical CHD risk equivalents (10-year risk &gt;20%) as defined in the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) Guidelines were eligible to participate in this study. Those included patients with any of the following criteria: (1) Known CVD, either clinical coronary heart disease (CHD), symptomatic carotid artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) or abdominal aortic aneurism; or (2) Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1 or 2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0202">Approximately 702 patients were randomized at approximately 80 centers in the U.S. The study was a 18- to 20-week, Phase 3, multi-center study consisting of 2 study periods: (1) A 6- to 8-week screening period that included a diet and lifestyle stabilization, a non-statin lipid-altering treatment washout, and an LDL-C and TG qualifying period and (2) A 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled treatment period.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0203">During the screening period and double-blind treatment period, all visits were within ±3 days of the scheduled time.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0204">The 6- to 8-week screening period included a diet and lifestyle stabilization, a non-statin lipid-altering treatment washout, and an LDL-C and TG qualifying period. The screening visit (Visit 1) occurred for all patients at either 6 weeks (for patients on stable statin therapy [with or without ezetimibe] at screening) or 8 weeks (for patients who will require washout of their current non-statin lipid altering therapy at screening) before randomization, as follows:

Eligible patients began a 6 week washout period at the screening visit (i.e. 6 weeks washout before the first LDL-C/TG qualifying visit). Patients received counselling regarding the NCEP TLC diet and received basic instructions on how to follow this diet. Site personnel contacted patients who did not qualify for participation based on screening laboratory test results to instruct them to resume their prior lipid altering medications.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0207">At the end of the 4-week diet and lifestyle stabilization period or the 6-week diet and stabilization and washout period, eligible patients entered the 2-week LDL-C and TG qualifying period and had their fasting LDL-C and TG levels measured at Visit 2 (Week −2) and Visit 3 (Week−1). Eligible patients must have had an average fasting LDL-C level ≤40 mg/dL and &lt;100 mg/dL and an average fasting TG level ≥200 mg/dL and &lt;500 mg/dL to enter the 12 week double blind treatment period. The LDL-C and TG levels for qualification were based on the average (arithmetic mean) of the Visit 2 (Week−2) and Visit 3 (Week−1) values. If a patient's average LDL-C and/or TG levels from Visit 2 and Visit 3 fell outside the required range for entry into the study, an additional fasting lipid profile was collected 1 week later at Visit 3.1. If a third sample was collected at Visit 3.1, entry into the study was based on the average (arithmetic mean) of the values from Visit 3 and Visit 3.1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0208">After confirmation of qualifying fasting LDL-C and TG values, eligible patients entered a 12-week, randomized, double-blind treatment period. At Visit 4 (Week 0), patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the following treatment groups:
