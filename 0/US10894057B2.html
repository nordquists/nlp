<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Described herein are preparations of glycan therapeutics and pharmaceutical compositions, medical foods and dietary supplements thereof, and related methods, which have been found to be effective to treat a number of diseases, disorders or pathological conditions.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Definitions</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">As used herein, the term “abundance” as it relates to a microbial taxa refers to the presence of one microbial taxa as compared to another microbial taxa in a defined microbial niche, such as the GI tract, or in the entire host organism (e.g. a human or a laboratory animal model of disease).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">“Acquire” or “acquiring” as the terms are used herein, refer to obtaining possession of a value, e.g., a numerical value, or image, or a physical entity (e.g., a sample), by “directly acquiring” or “indirectly acquiring” the value or physical entity. “Directly acquiring” means performing a process (e.g., performing a synthetic or analytical method or protocol) to obtain the value or physical entity. “Indirectly acquiring” refers to receiving the value or physical entity from another party or source (e.g., a third party laboratory that directly acquired the physical entity or value). Directly acquiring a value or physical entity includes performing a process that includes a physical change in a physical substance or the use of a machine or device. Examples of directly acquiring a value include obtaining a sample from a human subject. Directly acquiring a value includes performing a process that uses a machine or device, e.g., an NMR spectrometer to obtain an NMR spectrum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">As used herein, “antibody” is used in the broadest sense and includes monoclonal antibodies (including full length or intact monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multivalent antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">As used herein, the term “cancer” refers to a cell (or cells) that has an aberrant capacity for autonomous growth or replication and an abnormal state or condition (e.g. of a tissue or organ) characterized by proliferative cell growth. “Cancer” as used herein includes any solid or liquid, benign or malignant, non-invasive or invasive cancer or tumor, including hyperplasias, neoplasms, carcinoma, sarcoma, or a hematopoietic neoplastic disorder (e.g., a leukemia) and pre-cancerous or premalignant lesions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">As used herein, “colonization” of a host organism refers to the non-transitory residence of a bacterium or other microbial organism in a niche.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">As used herein, a “combination therapy” or “administered in combination” means that two (or more) different agents or treatments are administered to a subject as part of a defined treatment regimen for a particular disease or condition. The treatment regimen defines the doses and periodicity of administration of each agent such that the effects of the separate agents on the subject overlap. In some embodiments, the delivery of the two or more agents is simultaneous or concurrent and the agents may be co-formulated. In other embodiments, the two or more agents are not co-formulated and are administered in a sequential manner as part of a prescribed regimen. In some embodiments, administration of two or more agents or treatments in combination is such that the reduction in a symptom, or other parameter related to the disorder is greater than what would be observed with one agent or treatment delivered alone or in the absence of the other. The effect of the two treatments can be partially additive, wholly additive, or greater than additive (e.g., synergistic). Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination may be administered by intravenous injection while a second therapeutic agent of the combination may be administered orally.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">“Diversity of a microbial community” or “microbial diversity” as used herein refers to the diversity found in the microbiota of a within a given niche or host subject. Diversity can relate to the number of distinct microbial taxa and/or richness of the microbial taxa within the niche or host and can be expressed, e.g. using the Shannon Diversity index (Shannon entropy), alpha-beta diversity, total number of observed OTUs, or Chaol index, as described herein. In some embodiments, a microbiome regulator described herein modulates diversity within a microbial community, which may be expressed using Shannon entropy as a measure. For example, the more unequal the abundances of the bacterial taxa, the larger the weighted geometric mean of the p<sub>i </sub>values in Shannon's formula, and the smaller the corresponding Shannon entropy. If practically all abundance is concentrated to one taxa, and the other taxa are very rare (even if there are many of them), Shannon entropy approaches zero. When there is only one taxa Shannon entropy exactly equals zero.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">As used herein, a “dosage regimen”, “dosing regimen”, or “treatment regimen” is a modality of drug administration that achieves a therapeutic objective. A dosage regimen includes definition of one, two, three, or four of: a route of administration, a unit dose, a frequency of dosage, or a length of treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">As used herein, a “dysbiosis” refers to the state of the microbiota under conditions of host disease, predisposition to host disease, or other unwanted condition or symptom of the host. In an embodiment, dysbiosis refers to the state of the microbiota under conditions of disease. Dysbiosis can be contrasted with eubiosis, which refers to the state of the microbiota under healthy conditions of the host. The state of the microbiota may include the characteristics relating to either the structure or function of the microbiota. In an embodiment, a dysbiosis includes an imbalance in the state of the microbiota, wherein the normal diversity or relative abundance of a microbial taxa is affected, e.g., relative to a second bacterial taxa or relative to the abundance of said taxa under conditions of health. In an embodiment, a dysbiosis comprises an imbalance in the function of the microbiota, e.g., a change in level of gene expression, level of a gene product, or metabolic output (e.g., an immune function such as immune surveillance it the inflammation response). In some embodiments, a dysbiosis is an an undesired, e.g., unhealthy, state associated with unwanted symptoms in the host and that no longer promotes health. A “dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal microbiota” refers to an imbalanced state of the microbiota of the GI tract (e.g., in the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">As used herein, “ecological niche” or simply “niche” refers to the ecological space in which an organism or group of organisms occupies (such as the GI tract or one or more subsection of the GI-tract, such as, e.g., the stomach, the large and small intestine, the rectum, etc.). In some embodiments, niche specifically refers to a space that microorganisms occupy. Niche may describe how an organism or population of organisms responds to the distribution of resources, physical parameters (e.g., host tissue space) and competitors (e.g., by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (e.g., limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">An “effective amount” and “therapeutically effective amount” as used herein refers to an amount of a pharmaceutical composition or a drug agent that is sufficient to provide a desired effect. In some embodiments, a physician or other health professional decides the appropriate amount and dosage regimen. An effective amount also refers to an amount of a pharmaceutical composition or a drug agent that prevents the development or relapse of a medical condition.</div>

Purity may be measured by any appropriate standard method, for example, by column chromatography (e.g., size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)), thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or nuclear magnatic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Purified or purity may also define a degree of sterility that is safe for administration to a human subject, e.g., lacking viable infectious or toxic agents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">As used herein, “microbiome” refers to the genetic content of the communities of microbes that live in and on a subject (e.g. a human subject), both sustainably and transiently, including eukaryotes, archaea, bacteria, and viruses (including bacterial viruses (e.g., phage)), wherein “genetic content” includes genomic DNA, RNA such as ribosomal RNA and messenger RNA, the epigenome, plasmids, and all other types of genetic information. In some embodiments, microbiome specifically refers to genetic content of the communities of microorganisms in a niche.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">“Microbiota” as used herein refers to the community of microorganisms that occur (sustainably or transiently) in and on a subject (e.g. a human subject), including eukaryotes, archaea, bacteria, and viruses (including bacterial viruses, e.g. phage). In some embodiments, microbiota specifically refers to the microbial community in a niche.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">“Modulate the microbiota” or “modulating the microbiota” as used herein refers to changing the state of the microbiota. Changing the state of the microbiota may include changing the structure and/or function of the microbiota. A change in the structure of the microbiota is, e.g., a change in the relative composition of a taxa, e.g., in one or more region of the GI tract such as the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and/or rectum. In an embodiment, a change in the structure of the microbiota comprises a change in the abundance of a taxa, e.g., relative to another taxa or relative to what would be observed in the absence of the modulation. Modulation of the microbiota may also, or in addition, include a change in a function of the microbiota, such as a change in microbiota gene expression, level of a gene product (e.g., RNA or protein), or metabolic output of the microbiota. Functions of the microbiota may also include host pathogen protection, host nutrition, host metabolism and host immune modulation. Modulation of the structure or function of the microbiota may additionally induce a change in one or more functional pathway of the host (e.g., a change in gene expression, level of a gene product, and/or metabolic output of a host cell or host process) as a result of a change in the microbiota or its function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">As used herein, the term “oligosaccharide” refers to a molecule consisting of multiple (i.e., two or more) individual glycan units linked covalently.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">As used herein, a “pharmaceutical composition” or “pharmaceutical preparation” is a composition or preparation having pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or a finished dosage form or formulation thereof and is for human use. A pharmaceutical composition or pharmaceutical preparation is typically produced under good manufacturing practices (GMP) conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions or preparations may be sterile or non-sterile. If non-sterile, such pharmaceutical compositions meet the microbiological specifications and criteria for non-sterile pharmaceutical products as described in the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) or European Pharmacopoeia (EP). Pharmaceutical compositions may further comprise or may be co-administered with additional active agents, such as, e.g. additional therapeutic agents. Pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, solvents, carriers, fillers, or any combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">The term “phenotype” refers to a set of observable characteristics of an individual entity. For example, an individual subject may have a phenotype of “healthy” or “diseased.” A phenotype may describe the state of an entity, wherein all entities within a phenotype share the same set of characteristics that describe the phenotype. The phenotype of an individual results in part, or in whole, from the interaction of the entities genome and/or microbiome with the environment. As used herein, the term “polysaccharide” refers to a polymeric molecule consisting of multiple individual glycan units linked covalently. In some embodiments, a polysaccharide comprises at least 10 or more glycan units (e.g., at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, or at least 50, at least 100, at least 250, at least 500, or at least 1000 glycan units).

Methods to prepare the polymeric and solid-supported catalysts described herein can be found in WO 2014/031956, “POLYMERIC AND SOLID-SUPPORTED CATALYSTS, AND METHODS OF DIGESTING CELLULOSIC MATERIALS USING SUCH CATALYSTS.” The glycans generated, e.g., by using the catalyst, for example as described in WO 2016/007778, “OLIGOSACCHARIDE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR PRODUCING THEREOF” can be structurally much more diverse glycans than those produced by enzymatic reactions. All patent applications are incorporated herein by reference.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments, preparations of glycans (e.g. oligosaccharides) are polymolecular. In some embodiments, preparations of glycans (e.g. oligosaccharides) are polymolecular and polydisperse. For example, the glycan therapeutic preparations comprise a mixture of distinct oligosaccharide species (e.g. of different degree of polymerization and degree of branching and different alpha-to-beta glycosidic bond ratios). In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic preparations comprise a plurality of distinct species (e.g. oligosaccharides) and may consist of 1×10<sup>3</sup>, 1×10<sup>4</sup>, 1×10<sup>5</sup>, 1×10<sup>6</sup>, 1×10<sup>7</sup>, 1×10<sup>8</sup>, 1×10<sup>9</sup>, 1×10<sup>10</sup>, 1×10<sup>11</sup>, 1×10<sup>12</sup>, 1×10<sup>13</sup>, 1×10<sup>14</sup>, or more species in various proportions to each other.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">In certain embodiments, the starting material (comprising the glycan units) is contacted with a polymer catalyst under conditions that promote the formation of one or more glycosidic bond between glycan units, thereby producing a preparation of glycans. In one embodiment, the glycan unit is a monosaccharide. In one embodiment, the glycan unit is a disaccharide. Suitable polymer catalysts comprise acidic monomers and ionic monomers that are connected to form a polymeric backbone, wherein each acidic monomer has at least one Bronsted-Lowry acid, and each ionic monomer independently has at least one nitrogen-containing cationic group or phosphorous-containing cationic group. In some embodiments, each acidic monomer of the polymer catalyst may have one Bronsted-Lowry acid, and optionally the Bronsted-Lowry acids are distinct. In some embodiments, each ionic monomer of the polymer catalyst has one nitrogen-containing cationic group or phosphorous-containing cationic group. In some embodiments, at least one ionic monomer of the polymer catalyst has two nitrogen-containing cationic groups or phosphorous-containing cationic groups.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Generally, the polymeric catalyst and the glycan units are introduced into an interior chamber of a reactor, either concurrently or sequentially. Glycan (e.g. oligosaccharides) synthesis can be performed in a batch process or a continuous process. For example, in one embodiment, glycan synthesis is performed in a batch process, where the contents of the reactor are continuously mixed or blended, and all or a substantial amount of the products of the reaction are removed (e.g. isolated and/or recovered). In one variation, glycan synthesis is performed in a batch process, where the contents of the reactor are initially intermingled or mixed but no further physical mixing is performed. In another variation, glycan synthesis is performed in a batch process, wherein once further mixing of the contents, or periodic mixing of the contents of the reactor, is performed (e.g., at one or more times per hour), all or a substantial amount of the products of the reaction are removed (e.g. isolated and/or recovered) after a certain period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">In other embodiments, glycan (e.g. oligosaccharide) synthesis is performed in a continuous process, where the contents flow through the reactor with an average continuous flow rate but with no explicit mixing. After introduction of the polymeric catalyst and glycan units into the reactor, the contents of the reactor are continuously or periodically mixed or blended, and after a period of time, less than all of the products of the reaction are removed (e.g. isolated and/or recovered). In one variation, glycan synthesis is performed in a continuous process, where the mixture containing the catalyst and glycan units is not actively mixed. Additionally, mixing of catalyst and the glycan units may occur as a result of the redistribution of polymeric catalysts settling by gravity, or the non-active mixing that occurs as the material flows through a continuous reactor.</div>

In some embodiments, the degree of substitution varies between subunits, e.g., a certain percentage is not derivatized, exhibits a DS of 1, exhibits a DS of 2, or exhibits a DS of 3. Any desired mixture can be generated, e.g. 0-99% of subunits are not derivatized, 0-99% of subunits exhibit a DS of 1, 0-99% of subunits exhibit a DS of 2, and 0-99% of subunits exhibit a DS of 3, with the total making up 100%. The degree of substitution can be controlled by adjusting the average number of moles of substituent added to a glycosyl moiety (molar substitution (MS)). The distribution of substituents along the length of the glycan oligo- and polysaccharide chain can be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, reagent type, and extent of substitution. In some embodiments, the monomeric subunits are substituted with one or more of an acetate ester, sulfate half-ester, phosphate ester, or a pyruvyl cyclic acetal group.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">In some embodiments, the preparation of glycan therapeutics has a desired degree of sweetness. For example, sucrose (table sugar) is the prototype of a sweet substance. Sucrose in solution has a sweetness perception rating of 1, and other substances are rated relative to this (e.g., fructose, is rated at 1.7 times the sweetness of sucrose). In some embodiments, the sweetness of the preparation of glycan therapeutics ranges from 0.1 to 500,000 relative to sucrose. In some embodiments, the relative sweetness is 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 25000, 50000, 75000, 100000, 150000, 200000, 250000, 300000, 350000, 40000, 450000, 500000, or more than 500,000 relative to sucrose (with sucrose scored as one).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">In some embodiments, the preparation of glycan therapeutics, e.g. a preparation that is substantially DP2+ or DP3+(e.g. at least 80%, 90%, or at least 95%, or a fractionated preparation of DP2+ or DP3+), is substantially imperceptible as sweet and the relative sweetness is about 0, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, or about 0.9 relative to sucrose (with sucrose scored as one).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">Identification and Characterization of Glycan Therapeutic Preparations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">If desired, the glycan therapeutic preparations can be characterized by any method known in the art and by the methods described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">The molar percentage of species with a degree of polymerization (DP) of n (denoted here as DP(n)) in a population is determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), e.g., on an Agilent 1260 BioInert series instrument equipped with a refractive index (RI) detector and a variety of columns familiar to those skilled in the art using water as the mobile phase. The columns are selected from chemistries including HILIC, metal coordination, and aqueous size-exclusion chromatography that best isolate the species of interest. Molar % DP(n) is determined by the formula:
<br/>
% DP(<i>n</i>)=100*AUC[DP(<i>n</i>)]/AUC[DP(total)],
<br/>
where AUC is defined as the area under the curve for the species of interest as determined by calibration to known standards. The molar percentage of glycosidic bond isomers (% alpha and beta) are determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using a variety of 2D techniques familiar to those skilled in the art. Alpha- and beta-isomers may be distinguished, e.g., by their distinct shift on the NMR spectrum and the molar percentage is determined by the formula:
<br/>
% (glycosidic isomer <i>n</i>) of glycosidic bonds=100*AUC [shift (isomer <i>n</i>)]/AUC [shift (isomer alpha+isomer beta)],
<br/>
where AUC is defined as the area under the curve at a specific shift value known to represent the desired isomer n. The molar percentage of regiochemical isomers is determined in an analogous fashion using the formula:
<br/>
% (regioisomer <i>n</i>) of regioisomers=100*AUC [shift (regioisomer <i>n</i>)]/AUC [shift (all regioisomers)].
<br/>
The relative percentage of monomeric sugars making up the oligomeric population is determined, e.g., by total acidic digestion of the oligomeric sample followed by conversion to the alditol acetate followed by gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of the resultant monomeric solutions compared against GC of known standards. The molar percentage of monomer(n), where n can be any sugar, is determined by the formula:
<br/>
% (sugar <i>n</i>)=100*AUC [sugar <i>n</i>]/AUC [total of all monomeric sugars].
<br/>
In some embodiments, the solubility of the preparation of glycan therapeutics can be controlled, e.g. by selecting the charge, structure (e.g. DP, degree of branching), and/or derivatization of the glycan units.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">For glycan therapeutic preparations, the monomeric building blocks (e.g. the monosaccharide or glycan unit composition), the anomeric configuration of side chains, the presence and location of substituent groups, degree of polymerization/molecular weight and the linkage pattern can be identified by standard methods known in the art, such as, e.g. methylation analysis, reductive cleavage, hydrolysis, GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), MALDI-MS (Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry), ESI-MS (Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry), HPLC (High-Performance Liquid chromatography with ultraviolet or refractive index detection), HPAEC-PAD (High-Performance Anion-Exchange chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection), CE (capillary electrophoresis), IR (infra red)/Raman spectroscopy, and NMR (Nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy techniques. For polymers of crystalline consistency, the crystal structure can be solved using, e.g., solid-state NMR, FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), and WAXS (wide-angle X-ray scattering). The DP, DP distribution, and polydispersity can be determined by, e.g., viscosimetry and SEC (SEC-HPLC, high performance size-exclusion chromatography). Alien groups, end groups and substituents can be identified, e.g., using SEC with labeling, aqueous analytics, MALDI-MS, FT-IR, and NMR. To identify the monomeric components of the glycans methods such as, e.g. acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) or GLC (gas-liquid chromatography) (after conversion to alditol acetates) may be used. To determine the linkages present in the glycans, in one example, the polysaccharide is methylated with methyl iodide and strong base in DMSO, hydrolysis is performed, a reduction to partially methylated alditols is achieved, an acetylation to methylated alditol acetates is performed, and the analysis is carried out by GLC/MS (gas-liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry). In some embodiments, to determine the polysaccharide sequence a partial depolymerization is carried out using an acid or enzymes to determine the structures. Possible structures of the polysaccharide are compared to those of the hydrolytic oligomers, and it is determined which one of the possible structures could produce the oligomers. To identify the anomeric configuration, in one example, the intact polysaccharide or a preparation of oligosaccharides are subjected to enzymatic analysis, e.g. they are contacted with an enzyme that is specific for a particular type of linkage, e.g., β-galactosidase, or a-glucosidase, etc., and NMR may be used to analyze the products.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">For example, the distribution of (or average) degree of polymerization (DP) of a glycan therapeutic preparation may be measured by injecting a sample with a concentration of, e.g., 10-100 mg/mL onto an Agilent 1260 BioPure HPLC (or similar) equipped with a 7.8×300 mm BioRad Aminex HPX-42A column (or similar) and RI detector as described, e.g., in Gomez et al. (Purification, Characterization, and Prebiotic Properties of Pectic Oligosaccharides from Orange Peel Wastes, J Agric Food Chem, 2014, 62:9769). Alternatively, a sample with a concentration may be injected into a Dionex ICS5000 HPLC (or similar) equipped with a 4×250 mm Dionex CarboPac PA1 column (or similar) and PAD detector as described, e.g., in Holck et al., (Feruloylated and nonferuloylated arabino-oligosaccharides from sugar beet pectin selectively stimulate the growth of <i>bifidobacterium </i>spp. in human fecal in vitro fermentations, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 2011, 59(12), 6511-6519). Integration of the resulting spectrum compared against a standard solution of oligomers allows determination of the average DP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">Distribution of molecular weights can be measured, e.g., by MALDI mass spectrometry. Oligosaccharide concentration can be measured with a Mettler-Toledo sugar refractometer (or similar) with the final value adjusted against a standardized curve to account for refractive differences between monomers and oligomers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">Distribution of glycoside regiochemistry can be characterized, e.g., by a variety of 2D-NMR techniques including COSY, HMBC, HSQC, DEPT, and TOCSY analysis using standard pulse sequences and a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. Peaks can be assigned by correlation to the spectra of naturally occurring polysaccharides with known regiochemistry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">In some embodiments, the relative peak assignment of a sample is dependent on a number of factors including the concentration and purity of the sample, the identity and quality of the solvent (e.g., the isotopically labeled solvent), and the pulse sequence utilized. As such, in embodiments, the relative peak assignment of, for example, a glycan comprising glucose may vary (e.g., by about 0.01 ppm, about 0.02 ppm, or about 0.05 ppm) when the NMR spectrum is obtained in similar conditions due to said factors. In these instances as used herein, the terms “corresponding peak” or “corresponding peaks” refer to NMR peaks associated with the same sample but that vary (e.g., by about 0.01 ppm, about 0.02 ppm, or about 0.05 ppm) due to factors including, for example, the concentration and purity of the sample, the identity and quality of the isotopically labeled solvent, and the pulse sequence utilized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">Monomeric compositions of oligomers may be measured, e.g., by the complete hydrolysis method in which a known amount of oligomer is dissolved into a strong acid at elevated temperature and allowed sufficient time for total hydrolysis to occur. The concentration of individual monomers may then be measured by the HPLC or GC methods described herein and known in the art to achieve relative abundance measurements as in Holck et al. Absolute amounts can be measured by spiking the HPLC sample with a known amount of detector active standard selected to prevent overlap with any of the critical signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">The degree of branching in any given population may be measured by the methylation analysis method established, e.g., by Hakomori (J. Biochem. (Tokyo), 1964, 55, 205). With these data, identification of potential repeat units may be established by combining data from the total hydrolysis, average DP, and methylation analysis and comparing them against the DEPT NMR spectrum. Correlation of the number of anomeric carbon signals to these data indicates if a regular repeat unit is required to satisfy the collected data as demonstrated, e.g., in Harding, et al. (Carbohydr. Res. 2005, 340, 1107).</div>

The presence of both alpha- and beta-glycosidic bonds in the observed ratios (see Table 6, showing the presence of a large proportion of both alpha and beta bonds across the single and multi-sugar glycans tested) in glycan therapeutic preparation of some embodiments, is distinct from preparations of naturally occurring oligo- or polysaccharides which generally favor one primary glycosidic stereochemistry and optionally comprise only a relatively small portion of the opposing stereochemistry;</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0266">(iii) presence of at least one, two, three or four glycoside regiochemistries that may be identified either by a fingerprint NMR process or by the permethylation branching identification developed by Hakomori, et al.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0321" num="0325">The dosage forms described herein can be manufactured using processes that are known to those of skill in the art. For example, for the manufacture of tablets, an effective amount of a glycan therapeutic preparation can be dispersed uniformly in one or more excipients or additives, for example, using high shear granulation, low shear granulation, fluid bed granulation, or by blending for direct compression. Excipients and additives include diluents, binders, disintegrants, dispersants, lubricants, glidants, stabilizers, surfactants, antiadherents, sorbents, sweeteners, and colorants, or a combination thereof.

Non-limiting examples of suitable glidants include silicon dioxide, talc, and the like. Stabilizers can inhibit or retard drug decomposition reactions, including oxidative reactions. Surfactants can also include and can be anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic. Exemplary sweeteners may include <i>stevia </i>extract, aspartame, sucrose, alitame, saccharin, and the like. If desired, the tablets can also comprise nontoxic auxiliary substances such as pH buffering agents, preservatives, e.g., antioxidants, wetting or emulsifying agents, solubilizing agents, coating agents, flavoring agents (e.g., mint, cherry, anise, peach, apricot, licorice, raspberry, vanilla), and the like. Additional excipients and additives may include aluminum acetate, benzyl alcohol, butyl paraben, butylated hydroxy toluene, calcium disodium EDTA, calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, dibasic calcium phosphate, tribasic calcium phosphate, candelilla wax, carnuba wax, castor oil hydrogenated, cetylpyridine chloride, citric acid, colloidal silicone dioxide, copolyvidone, corn starch, cysteine HCl, dimethicone, disodium hydrogen phosphate, erythrosine sodium, ethyl cellulose, gelatin, glycerin, glyceryl monooleate, glyceryl monostearate, glycine, HPMC pthalate, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose, hypromellose, iron oxide red or ferric oxide, iron oxide yellow, iron oxide or ferric oxide, magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, magnesium stearate, methionine, methacrylic acid copolymer, methyl paraben, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, mineral oil, phosphoric acid, plain calcium phosphate, anhydrous calcium phosphate, polaxamer 407, polaxamer 188, plain polaxamer, polyethylene oxide, polyoxy 140 stearate, polysorbate 80, potassium bicarbonate, potassium sorbate, potato starch, povidone, propylene glycol, propylene paraben, propyl paraben, retinyl palmitate, saccharin sodium, selenium, silica, silica gel, fumed silica, sodium benzoate, sodium carbonate, sodium citrate dihydrate, sodium crossmellose, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium propionate, sodium starch, sodium starch glycolate, sodium stearyl fumarate, sorbic acid, sorbitol, sorbitan monooleate, pregelatinized starch, succinic acid, triacetin, triethyl citrate, vegetable stearin, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, or a combination thereof. The amounts of these excipients and additives can be properly selected based on their relation to other components and properties of the preparation and production method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0322" num="0326">Immediate-release formulations of an effective amount of a glycan therapeutic composition can comprise one or more combinations of excipients that allow for a rapid release of a pharmaceutically active agent (such as from 1 minute to 1 hour after administration). Controlled-release formulations (also referred to as sustained release (SR), extended-release (ER, XR, or XL), time-release or timed-release, controlled-release (CR), or continuous-release) refer to the release of a glycan therapeutic composition from a dosage form at a particular desired point in time after the dosage form is administered to a subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0323" num="0327">In one embodiment a controlled release dosage form begins its release and continues that release over an extended period of time. Release can occur beginning almost immediately or can be sustained. Release can be constant, can increase or decrease over time, can be pulsed, can be continuous or intermittent, and the like. In one embodiment, a controlled release dosage refers to the release of an agent from a composition or dosage form in which the agent is released according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. In one aspect, controlled-release refers to delayed release of an agent from a composition or dosage form in which the agent is released according to a desired profile in which the release occurs after a period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0324" num="0328">In some embodiments, the dosage form can be an effervescent dosage form. Effervescent means that the dosage form, when mixed with liquid, including water and saliva, evolves a gas. Some effervescent agents (or effervescent couple) evolve gas by means of a chemical reaction which takes place upon exposure of the effervescent disintegration agent to water or to saliva in the mouth. This reaction can be the result of the reaction of a soluble acid source and an alkali monocarbonate or carbonate source. The reaction of these two general compounds produces carbon dioxide gas upon contact with water or saliva. An effervescent couple (or the individual acid and base separately) can be coated with a solvent protective or enteric coating to prevent premature reaction. Such a couple can also be mixed with previously lyophilized particles (such as a glycan therapeutic). The acid sources can be any which are safe for human consumption and can generally include food acids, acid and hydrite antacids such as, for example: citric, tartaric, amalic, fumeric, adipic, and succinics. Carbonate sources include dry solid carbonate and bicarbonate salt such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate and potassium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and the like. Reactants which evolve oxygen or other gasses and which are safe for human consumption are also included. In one embodiment citric acid and sodium bicarbonate are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0325" num="0329">In another embodiment, the dosage form can be in a candy form (e.g., matrix), such as a lollipop or lozenge. In one embodiment an effective amount of a glycan therapeutic is dispersed within a candy matrix. In one embodiment the candy matrix comprises one or more sugars (such as dextrose or sucrose). In another embodiment the candy matrix is a sugar-free matrix. The choice of a particular candy matrix is subject to wide variation. Conventional sweeteners (e.g., sucrose), sugar alcohols suitable for use with diabetic patients (e.g., sorbitol or mannitol), or other sweeteners (e.g., sweeteners described herein) may be employed. The candy base can be very soft and fast dissolving, or can be hard and slower dissolving. Various forms will have advantages in different situations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0326" num="0330">A candy mass composition comprising an effective amount of the glycan therapeutic can be orally administered to a subject in need thereof so that an effective amount of the glycan therapeutic will be released into the subject's mouth as the candy mass dissolves and is swallowed. A subject in need thereof includes a human adult or child.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0327" num="0331">The dosage forms described herein can also take the form of pharmaceutical particles manufactured by a variety of methods, including high-pressure homogenization, wet or dry ball milling, or small particle precipitation. Other methods useful to make a suitable powder formulation are the preparation of a solution of active ingredients and excipients, followed by precipitation, filtration, and pulverization, or followed by removal of the solvent by freeze-drying, followed by pulverization of the powder to the desired particle size. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical particles have a final size of 3-1000 microns, such as at most 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000 microns. In another embodiment the pharmaceutical particles have a final size of 10-500 microns. In another embodiment the pharmaceutical particles have a final size of 50-600 microns. In another embodiment the pharmaceutical particles have a final size of 100-800 microns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0328" num="0332">In another embodiment, an oral dosage form is provided comprising a glycan therapeutic composition, wherein the oral dosage form is a syrup. The syrup can comprise about 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, or 85% solid. The syrup can comprise about 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% liquid, for example, water. The solid can comprise a glycan therapeutic composition. The solid can be, for example, about 1-96%, 10-96%, 20-96%, 30-96%, 40-96%, 50-96%, 60-96%, 70-96%, 80-96%, or 90-96% glycan therapeutic composition. In another embodiment, a glycan therapeutic composition is formulated as a viscous fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0333">In one embodiment, the composition comprises a foaming component, a neutralizing component, or a water-insoluble dietary fiber. A foaming component can be at least one member selected from the group consisting of sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, and calcium carbonate. In one embodiment a neutralizing component can be at least one member selected from the group consisting of citric acid, L-tartaric acid, fumaric acid, L-ascorbic acid, DL-malic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, and anhydrous citric acid. In one embodiment a water-insoluble dietary fiber can be at least one member selected from the group consisting of crystalline cellulose, wheat bran, oat bran, cone fiber, soy fiber, and beet fiber. The formulation can contain a sucrose fatty acid ester, powder sugar, fruit juice powder, and/or flavoring material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0330" num="0334">In some embodiments, the dosage forms are formulated to release the pharmaceutical compositions comprising glycan therapeutic preparations in a specific region(s) of the GI tract, such as the small or the large intestine. In some embodiments, the dosage forms are formulated to release the pharmaceutical compositions comprising therapeutic glycan preparations in a specific region(s) of the GI tract, such as the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and/or rectum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0331" num="0335">Solid formulations for oral use may comprise an enteric coating, which may control the location at which a glycan therapeutic composition is absorbed in the digestive system. For example, an enteric coating can be designed such that a glycan therapeutic composition does not dissolve in the stomach but rather travels to the small or the large intestine, cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and/or rectum, where it dissolves. An enteric coating can be stable at low pH (such as in the stomach) and can dissolve at higher pH (for example, in the small or large intestine or colon). Material that can be used in enteric coatings includes, for example, alginic acid, cellulose acetate phthalate, plastics, waxes, shellac, and fatty acids (e.g., stearic acid, palmitic acid).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0332" num="0336">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is an enzyme-responsive delivery system. For example, trypsin responsive polymers can be made using hydrogels that are crosslinked by peptides that are degraded by trypsin. Trypsin is active in the small intestine. Trypsin-responsive delivery systems can be used to target delivery of the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions to the small intestine. In another example, enzyme-digestible hydrogels consisting of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) crosslinked with albumin are degraded in the presence of pepsin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0333" num="0337">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is a delivery device that enables prolonged retention at a specific site in the GI tract. For example, a gastroretentive delivery system enables prolonged release of the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions to the stomach. Gastroretentive delivery may be used for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions that modulate bacteria in the stomach or in the upper small intestine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0334" num="0338">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is a mucoadhesive delivery system that adheres to the mucosal surfaces of the stomach. They are typically composed of polymers with numerous hydrogen-bonding groups, e.g., cross-linked polyacrylic acids, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, carrageenan, Carbopol 934P, or thiolated polycarbophil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0335" num="0339">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is an expanding delivery system that rapidly increases in size in the stomach, which slows its passage through the pylorus. Such systems include systems that unfold in the stomach. For example, geometric shapes such as tetrahedrons, rings, disks, etc. can be packed into a gelatin capsule. When the capsule dissolves, the shape unfolds. The systems can be composed of one or more erodible polymer (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose), one or more nonerodible polymer (e.g., polyolefins, polyamides, polyurethanes). The glycan therapeutic may then be dispersed within the polymer matrix. The retention times can be fine-tuned by the polymer blend. Alternatively, devices made out of elastic polymers that are stable in the acidic pH of the stomach but dissolve in the neutral/alkaline conditions further along the GI tract can be used. Such polymer formulations can prevent intestinal obstruction when the device exits the stomach. Supramolecular polymer gels crosslinked by hydrogen bonds between carboxyl groups may also be used, e.g. composed of poly(acryloyl 6-aminocaproic acid) (PA6ACA) and poly(methacrylic acid-co-ethyl acrylate) (EUDRAGIT L 100-55). Other systems include swellable excipients, such as collagen sponges. For example, a hydrogel matrix (e.g. a swellable core: polyvinyl pyrrolidone XL, Carbopol 934P, calcium carbonate) swells 2-50 times in the stomach. Superporous hydrogel composites swell to hundreds of times their original volume in a few minutes. Some systems exploit gas generation to achieve expansion, e.g. carbon dioxide-generating, expandable systems that are surrounded by a hydrophilic membrane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0336" num="0340">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is a density-controlled delivery system. These systems are designed to either float or sink in gastric fluids which delays their emptying from the stomach. For example, high-density systems enable the device to settle to the bottom of the stomach, below the pylorus, and thus avoid stomach emptying. Other systems are low-density/floating systems. Such devices may, e.g., comprise entrapped air in hollow chambers or may incorporate low-density materials like fats, oils, or foam powder. Low density may be achieved through swelling, e.g. hydrocolloid containing capsules dissolve upon contacting gastric fluid and the hydrocolloids swell to form a mucous body. Alternative polymers include: chitosans, sodium alginate, and glycerol monooleate matrix. Low density may be achieved through gas generation. For example, tablets loaded with carbonate and optionally citric acid generate carbon dioxide after contact with acidic aqueous media. The carbon dioxide generated is entrapped within the gelling hydrocolloid causing the system to float. Hydrocolloids include hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and Carbopol 934P.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0337" num="0341">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein employs a design to retain a device in the small or large intestine. The location-specific nature of the device is provided by a specific triggering method, e.g. pH, enzyme, etc. These include systems designed for mucoadhesion and also microneedle pills. Microneedle pills comprise a drug reservoir spiked with microneedles that is encapsulated in a pH-responsive coating. When the pill reaches the desired location in the GI tract and the coating dissolves, the microneedles enable the pill to become stuck to the lining of the GI tract. In other embodiments, the microneedle pills comprise a capsule that consists of two chemical compartments filled with citric acid and sodium bicarbonate, respectively. As the pill dissolves in the digestive system, barriers between the two substances erode, allowing them to mix and create a chemical reaction that pushes micro-needles of saccharides through the outer layer of the capsule and into the lining of the small intestine. The saccharide needles can be filled with drugs that are delivered into nearby blood vessels as the saccharide is absorbed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0338" num="0342">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein employs a pH sensitive polymer coating. For example, pH-dependent polymers (bi- or tri-phasic) can be insoluble at low pH levels (e.g. acid resistance in the stomach, pH 1-2) and become increasingly soluble as pH rises, e.g. to about 5.5-6.2 in the duodenum, to about pH 5.7 in the ascending colon, to about pH 6.4 in the cecum, to about pH 6.6 in the transverse colon, to about pH 7.0 in the descending colon, to about 7.2-7.5 in the ileum, or to about pH 7.5 in the distal small intestine. In one example, TARGIT™ technology may be used for site-specific delivery of the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The system employs pH-sensitive coatings onto injection-moulded starch capsules to target the terminal ileum and colon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0339" num="0343">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is a delayed release system or time controlled release system. Such systems usually employ enteric coatings that may be combined with pH sensitive and time release functions. For example, ETP (enteric coated time-release press coated) tablets may be used that are composed of three components: a glycan therapeutic-containing core tablet (rapid release function), a press-coated, swellable hydrophobic polymer layer (e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose layer (HPC), and a time release function. The duration of lag phase can be controlled either by weight or composition of polymer layer and an enteric coating layer (acid resistance function).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0340" num="0344">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein employs Eudragit® enteric coatings of tablets and capsules. Other suitable synthetic polymers include: Shellac, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polyvinyl acetate phthalate and poly glutamic acid coatings, such as poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA). These coatings combine both mucoadhesive and pH-dependent release strategies. To enhance colon targeted delivery Eudragits® are methacrylic co-polymers with varying side group compositions that alter the pH at which they are soluble. For example, for Eudragit®-coated systems no significant drug release occurs in the stomach (e.g. at pH 1.4) and in the small intestine (e.g. at pH 6.3), while significant drug release can be seen at pH 7.8 in the ileocaecal region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0341" num="0345">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is a microbial-triggered system, such as a polysaccharide based delivery system. Polysaccharide based delivery systems contain biodegradable and mucoadhesive polymer coatings, including coatings of chitosan and pectin. Other suitable natural polymers include, e.g., guar gum, inulin, cyclodextrin, dextran, amylase, chondrotin sulphate, and locust bean gum. These delivery systems can be used to target the glycan therapeutic to the small or the large intestine, cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon. Coatings with naturally occurring polysaccharides like guar gum, xanthan gum, chitosan, alginates, etc. are degraded by resident gut microbes, e.g. microbes comprising enzymes such as, xylosidase, arabinosidase, galactosidase, glucosidases, etc. In some embodiments, the microbes and associated enzyme activities are predominatly located in a specific region of the GI tract (e.g., Jain A. et al., Perspectives of Biodegradable Natural Polysaccharides for Site-Specific Drug Delivery to the Colon, J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci 10(1):86-128, 2007). For example, CODES™ technology may be used to deliver the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions. This system combines the polysaccharide coating with a pH-sensitive coating. In some embodiments, the system consists of a core tablet coated with three layers of polymer coatings: The outer coating is composed of Eudragit L. This coating gets dissolved in the duodenum and exposes the next coating. The next coating is composed of Eudragit E. This layer allows the release of lactulose present in the inner core. The lactulose gets metabolized into short chain fatty acids that lower the surrounding pH where the Eudragit E layer dissolves. The dissolving of Eudragit E results in the exposure of the glycan therapeutic. The bacteria present in the colon are responsible for the degradation of polysaccharides that are released from the core tablet. The degradation of polysaccharides may result in organic acids formation that lowers the pH of the contents surrounding the tablet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0342" num="0346">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is a pressure-controlled delivery system. The system employs the fact that higher pressures are encountered in the colon than in the small intestine. For example, for ethylcellulose systems that are insoluble in water, the release of glycan therapeutics occurs following disintegration of a water-insoluble polymer capsule as a result of pressure in the lumen of the colon. The release profile may be adjusted by varying the thickness of the ethylcellulose, the capsule size and/or density of the capsule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0343" num="0347">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is a pulsatile colon targeted delivery system. For example, the system can be a pulsincap system. The capsule which is employed comprises a plug that is placed in the capsule that controls the release of the glycan therapeutic. A swellable hydrogel (e.g. hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), poly methyl methacrylate or polyvinyl acetate) seals the drug content. When the capsule gets in contact with a fluid the plug is pushed off from the capsule and the glycan therapeutic is released. The release profile can be controlled by varying the length and/or point of intersection of the plug with the capsule body. Another system is a port system. The capsule body is enclosed in a semi-permeable membrane. The insoluble plug consists of an osmotically active agent and the glycan therapeutic. When the capsule gets in contact with a fluid the semi-permeable membrane permits inflow of the fluid which increases pressure in the capsule body. This leads to an expelling of the plug and release of the glycan therapeutic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0344" num="0348">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is an osmotically controlled colon targeted delivery system. An exemplary system, OROS-CT, consists of osmotic units (up to 5 or 6 push pull units) encapsulated in a hard gelatin capsule. The push pull units are bilayered with outer enteric impermeable membrane and inner semi-permeable membrane. The internal, central part of the push pull consists of the drug layer and push layer. The glycan therapeutic is released through the semi-permeable membrane. The capsule body enclosing the push pull units is dissolved immediately after administration. In the GI tract the enteric impermeable membrane prevents water absorption. The enteric coating is dissolved in small intestine (higher pH, &gt;7), water enters the unit through the semi-permeable membrane causing push layer to swell and force out the glycan therapeutic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0345" num="0349">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is “smart pill” which can be used to release the glycan therapeutic just before reaching the ileocecal valve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0346" num="0350">In some embodiments, the dosage form for the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic compositions described herein is a rectally administered formulation. For example, enemas introduce a pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition in liquid formulation into the rectum. The volume administered is typically less than 10 mL. Suppositories introduce a pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition into the rectum. Suppositories are solid dosage forms that melt or dissolve when inserted into the rectum, releasing the glycan therapeutics. Typical excipients for suppository formulations include cocoa butter, polyethylene glycols, and agar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0347" num="0351">Further provided herein are methods of making a unit-dosage form described herein, comprising providing a glycan therapeutic; formulating the glycan therapeutic into a unit-dosage form, packaging the unit-dosage form, labelling the packaged unit-dosage form, and/or selling or offering for sale the packaged and labeled unit-dosage form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0348" num="0352">The unit-dosage forms described herein may also be processed. In one embodiment, the processing comprises one or more of: processing the dosage form into a pharmaceutical composition, e.g., formulating, combining with a second component, e.g., an excipient or buffer or a second active compound or therapeutic agent; portioning into smaller or larger aliquots; disposing into a container, e.g., a gas or liquid tight container; packaging; associating with a label; shipping or moving to a different location. In one embodiment, the processing comprises one or more of: classifying, selecting, accepting or discarding, releasing or withholding, processing into a pharmaceutical composition, shipping, moving to a different location, formulating, labeling, packaging, releasing into commerce, or selling or offering for sale, depending on whether the predetermined threshold is met.

It is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition, such as, e.g. cancer. Medical foods as used herein do not include food that is merely recommended by a physician as part of an overall diet to manage the symptoms or reduce the risk of a disease or condition. Medical foods comprising a preparation of glycan therapeutics are administered to a subject who has a cancer or tumor under medical supervision (which may be active and ongoing) and usually, the subject receives instructions on the use of the medical food. Medical foods may comprise, in addition to a glycan therapeutic described herein, one or more food additives, color additives, GRAS excipients and other agents or substances suitable for medical foods. Medical food preparations may be nutritionally complete or incomplete formulas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0351" num="0355">Dietary Supplements</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0352" num="0356">Any glycan therapeutic preparation described herein may be formulated as a dietary supplement. Dietary supplements are regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994. A dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a “dietary ingredient” intended to supplement the diet. The “dietary ingredients” in these products may include, in addition to a glycan therapeutic described herein, one or more of: vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, glandulars, and metabolites. Dietary supplements can also be extracts or concentrates, and may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders. They can also be in other forms, such as a bar, but if they are, information on their label must not represent the product as a conventional food or a sole item of a meal or diet. DSHEA requires that every supplement be labeled a dietary supplement and not as a general food.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0353" num="0357">Kits</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0354" num="0358">Kits are also contemplated. For example, a kit can comprise unit dosage forms of the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition, and a package insert containing instructions for use of the glycan therapeutic in treatment of a disease, disorder or pathological condition, such as, e.g., cancer. The kits include a pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition in suitable packaging for use by a subject in need thereof. Any of the compositions described herein can be packaged in the form of a kit. A kit can contain an amount of a pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition (optionally additionally comprising a prebiotic substance, a probiotic bacterium, a micronutrient, and/or a second therapeutic agent, such as a drug) sufficient for an entire course of treatment, or for a portion of a course of treatment. Doses of a pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition can be individually packaged, or the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition can be provided in bulk, or combinations thereof. Thus, in one embodiment, a kit provides, in suitable packaging, individual doses of a glycan therapeutic composition that correspond to dosing points in a treatment regimen, wherein the doses are packaged in one or more packets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0355" num="0359">In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition can be provided in bulk in a single container, or in two, three, four, five, or more than five containers. For example, each container may contain enough of a pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition for a particular week of a treatment program that runs for a month. If more than one bulk container is provided, the bulk containers can be suitably packaged together to provide sufficient pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition for all or a portion of a treatment period. The container or containers can be labeled with a label indicating information useful to the subject in need thereof or the physician performing the treatment protocol, such as, e.g. dosing schedules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0356" num="0360">The pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition can be packaged with other suitable substances, e.g., a second active compound or therapeutic agent or a buffer/carrier. The other substance or substances can be packaged separately from the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition, or mixed with the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition, or combinations thereof. Thus, in one embodiment, kits include a dosage form containing all the ingredients intended to be used in a course of treatment or a portion of a course of treatment, e.g., a pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition and optionally a second active compound or therapeutic agent or a buffer/carrier. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition is packaged in one package or set of packages, and additional components, such as probiotic bacteria, prebiotics, and therapeutic agents (e.g., drugs, such as anti-cancer drugs) are packaged separately from the pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0357" num="0361">Provided herein are kits for treating cancer in a patient comprising a package comprising (a) a pharmaceutical composition or medical food or dietary supplement comprising a glycan therapeutic preparation described herein, and (b) instructions for using the pharmaceutical composition for treating cancer (e.g., a cancer described herein) in a patient. In some embodiments, the kit also includes a second agent which is a pharmaceutical composition, e.g., a chemotherapeutic drug or other anti-cancer drug described herein. In other examples, the kit also contains a probiotic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0358" num="0362">Kits can further include written materials, such as instructions, expected results, testimonials, explanations, warnings, clinical data, information for health professionals, and the like. In one embodiment, the kits contain a label or other information indicating that the kit is only for use under the direction of a health professional. The container can further include scoops, syringes, bottles, cups, applicators or other measuring or serving devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0363">Administration to a Subject</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0360" num="0364">The glycan therapeutic preparations, pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic agents described herein can be administered to a subject in need thereof by various routes (e.g., systemically or locally) including, for example, orally or parenterally, such as intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intraorbitally, intracapsularly, intraperitoneally, intrarectally, intracisternally, intratumorally, intravasally, intradermally or by passive or facilitated absorption through the skin. The therapeutic agents can be administered locally to the site of a pathologic condition, for example, intravenously or intra-arterially into a blood vessel supplying a tumor. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic composition is administered enterically. This preferentially includes oral administration, or by an oral or nasal tube (including nasogastric, nasojejunal, oral gastric, or oral jejunal). In other embodiments, administration includes rectal administration (including enema, suppository, or colonoscopy).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0361" num="0365">Active compounds and pharmaceutical agents, e.g., prebiotic substances, probiotic bacteria or drugs, may be administered separately, e.g., prior to, concurrent with or after administration of the glycan therapeutics and not as a part of the pharmaceutical composition or medical food or dietary supplement (e.g. as a co-formulation) of glycan therapeutics. In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions or medical foods comprising preparations of glycan therapeutics are administered in combination with a recommended or prescribed diet, e.g. a diet that is rich in probiotic and/or prebiotic-containing foods, such as it may be determined by a physician or other healthcare professional. Suitable sources of soluble and insoluble fibers are commercially available. Prebiotics can be found in certain foods, e.g. chicory root, Jerusalem artichoke, Dandelion greens, garlic, leek, onion, asparagus, wheat bran, wheat flour, banana, milk, yogurt, sorghum, burdock, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, kale, radish and rutabaga, and miso.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0362" num="0366">In some embodiments, the composition and metabolic activity of the intestinal bacterial community may be modified. Modification of the composition and metabolic activity of the intestinal bacterial community may be performed through the administration of i) a glycan therapeutic alone (such as in the absence of exogenously administered bacteria), ii) a glycan therapeutic and one or more beneficial microorganisms (probiotics), or iii) a combination of a glycan therapeutic, a probiotics, and another agent, such as, e.g. a prebiotic (e.g. a dietary fiber), or a therapeutic agent, such as, e.g. an antibacterial agent (e.g. antibiotic), an anti-inflammatory agent, an anti-cancer agent, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0363" num="0367">In some embodiments, glycan therapeutics (e.g. oligosaccharides) have a desired degree of digestibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0364" num="0368">Digestibility depends on many factors, including, e.g. the degree of polymerization, the degree of branching, the type of glycosidic linkages, position of the linkages, anomeric configuration (e.g. L- or D-configuration, alpha/beta configuration) of the glycan unit. For example, furanosides are generally more susceptible to hydrolysis than pyranosides. Deoxy sugars are generally more acid labile than non-deoxy sugars. Uronic acids are generally less susceptible to hydrolysis than non-uronic monosaccharides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0365" num="0369">Digestibility is a parameter that can be ascertained for the glycan therapeutics described herein. In some embodiments, glycan therapeutics disclosed herein are screened to assess their digestibility. Digestibility of glycan therapeutics can be assessed by any suitable method known in the art (e.g. by simulated gastric digestion half-life). In some embodiments, digestibility is assessed by a physiologically relevant in vitro digestion reaction, e.g. simulated gastric digestion and simulated intestinal digestion. To test glycan therapeutic's digestibility, they can be sequentially exposed to a simulated gastric fluid (SGF) for a desired period (e.g. the length of time it takes 90% of a meal to pass from the stomach to the small intestine) and then transferred to various GI-microbial cultures or samples. Samples at different stages of the digestion (e.g., 2, 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min) can be analyzed by standard glycan techniques known in the art and described herein. By monitoring the amount of intact glycan therapeutics observed over time, the half-life of digestion can be calculated. Suitable assays can be used to assess comparative digestibility (i.e., against a benchmark glycan such as, e.g. a prebiotic) or to assess absolute digestibility. In some embodiments, the digestibility (expressed as half-life) is 30 minutes or less, 20 minutes or less, 15 minutes or less, 10 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less, 4 minutes or less, 3 minutes or less, 2 minutes or less or 1 minute or less. In some embodiments, the digestibility (expressed as half-life) is 30 minutes or more, 45 minutes or more, 1 hour or more, 2 hours or more, 3 hours or more, 4 hours or more, 5 hours or more, or 10 hours or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0366" num="0370">In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic is digested at a constant rate and/or at a controlled rate. In such embodiments, the rate of digestion of the glycan therapeutic may not be optimized for the highest possible rate of digestion. In such embodiments the rate of absorption of the glycan therapeutic following ingestion by a mammal may be slower and the total time period over which absorption occurs following ingestion may be longer than for glycan therapeutic of similar glycan unit composition that are digested at a faster initial rate. In some embodiments the glycan therapeutic is completely or substantially completely digested. In some embodiments the glycan therapeutic is substantially not digested or not digested.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0367" num="0371">If so desired, the glycan therapeutic composition comprises non-digestible oligo- or polysaccharides. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic is indigestible or incompletely digestible by human digestive systems. Glycan therapeutics are, in some embodiments, selectively digested by gut microbiota constituents that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the commensal gut microbiota. In some embodiments, provided herein are glycan therapeutics that are non-digestible or incompletely digestible by humans in the absence of specific microbes in the gut. In these embodiments, only specific bacteria are capable of utilizing the glycan therapeutic as a carbon source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0368" num="0372">In some embodiments, provided herein are glycan therapeutics that are non-digestible and stimulate the growth or activity of bacteria in the digestive system that are beneficial to the health of the body. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic is resistant to gastric acidity. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic is resistant to hydrolysis by mammalian enzymes. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic is resistant to gastrointestinal absorption. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic is a substrate for fermentation by the intestinal microbiota. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic is a selective substrate for one or a limited number of potentially beneficial bacteria in the colon, stimulating their growth and/or metabolic activity. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic is capable of altering the composition of intestinal microbiota to a composition richer in specific bacteria. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic selectively stimulates the growth and/or selective activity of intestinal bacteria associated with health and well-being.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0369" num="0373">In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic capable of selectively stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria including <i>Bacteroides, Blautia, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacilli, Christensenella minuta</i>, or a <i>Christensenellaceae </i>in the large intestine. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic is digested by the gut microbiota, resulting, e.g., in the release of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas and short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, if desired. A glycan therapeutic preparation, in some embodiments, promotes the selective growth of beneficial colonic bacteria, including multiple species and strains of Bifidobacteria and <i>Lactobacilli</i>. Bifidobacteria carry out non hydrogen-producing lactose fermentation reactions in addition to inhibiting hydrogen producing bacteria, such as <i>Escherichia coli. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0370" num="0374">In some embodiments, provided herein are glycan therapeutics that affect the composition and/or activity of the intestinal microbiota. For example, administration of the glycan therapeutic to a subject may result in an increased prebiotic index. The prebiotic index (PI) relates to the sum of: (Bifidobacteria/total bacteria)+(<i>Lactobacilli</i>/total bacteria)−(<i>Bacteroides</i>/total bacteria)−(Clostridia/total bacteria), (see Palframan et al, 2003, Lett Appl Microbiol 37:281-284). Administration of a glycan therapeutic to a subject may result in an increase in: <i>Bacteroides, Blautia, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacilli, Christensenella minuta</i>, or a <i>Christensenellaceae. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0371" num="0375">In some embodiments, glycan therapeutics are provided that comprise beta glycosidic linkages. In some embodiments, the beta glycosidic linkages make the glycans substantially non-digestible and/or unabsorbable to a human host in the stomach and small intestine. However, certain probiotic and commensal microbes are able to metabolize the glycans.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0372" num="0376">In some embodiments, glycan therapeutics are provided that comprise alpha glycosidic linkages. In some embodiments, the alpha glycosidic linkages are not hydrolyzed by human salivary amylase, but can be metabolized by <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum </i>and <i>Clostridium butyricum. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0373" num="0377">In some embodiments, the therapeutic glycan is indigestible. Digestibility may differ between different enzymes or sets of enzymes, e.g. a therapeutic glycan may be digestible for certain microbes expressing certain enzymes, but may be indigestible to a mammal lacking the required enzyme(s) in the absence of hosting the microbes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0374" num="0378">In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic is an oligosaccharide that is optionally non-digestible by a human digestive system, contains at least one beta-glycosidic bond and/or at least one alpha-glycosidic bond that can be digested by a bacterium. In one embodiment the bacterium is a probiotic or an endogenous commensal bacterium such as, e.g. a <i>Lactobacilli </i>or a Bifidobacteria.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0375" num="0379">In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutics pass through the small intestine and into the large intestine (colon) mostly intact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0376" num="0380">In some embodiment, the glycan therapeutic comprises less than 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 12%, 14%, 16%, 18%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or less than 99% of bonds that are hydrolyzable by a mammalian amylase enzyme. One type of hydrolyzable bonds are recognized by a mammalian amylase enzyme. Other types of hydrolyzable bonds (e.g. alpha 1,4; alpha 1,6, alpha 1,2; and alpha 1,6 glycosidic linkages) are recognized by specific microbial enzymes (e.g. alpha-glucosidase, cyclomaltodextrinase, neopullunanase, glucanotransferase, trehalohydrolase, and the like). Bonds may also be hydrolyzable by hydrolases (e.g. Amylases, Cellulases, Mannanases, Pectinases, Pullulanases, Xylanases and the like), oxireductases (Catalases, Glucose oxidases, and the like), transferases (Fructosyltransferases, Glucosyltransferases), lyases, isomerases (Glucose isomerases), ligases, and the like. In some embodiments, glycosidic bonds are catalyzed by an enzyme and the rate of catalysis can be measure by any suitable means known in the art and the rate can be compared to that of another enzyme.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0377" num="0381">In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic exhibits a slow rate of fermentability by the microbiota. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic has a high degree of branching to resist digestion. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic has a DP of 10 or more, 12 or more, 14 or more, 16 or more, 18 or more, 20 or more, 25 or more, 30 or more to slow its digestibility. In some embodiments, the branching of the glycan therapeutic protects against digestion by human enzymes. In some embodiments, the size of the glycan therapeutic lessens the fermentation speed (digestibility speed by bacteria), e.g., in the colon. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic characteristics promote indigestibility by human glycosidases and promote selective digestion by the microbiota.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0378" num="0382">In some embodiments, provided herein are glycan therapeutics that can be digested by the microbiota (e.g. by carbohydrate fermentation) without certain side effects or with a substantial reduction of symptoms of fermentation, such as increased gas formation that may cause flatulence, discomfort, and/or bloating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0379" num="0383">In one embodiment, the glycan therapeutic composition comprises one or more mono-, oligo-, and/or polysaccharides which are non-digestible by a human digestive system. In another embodiment, the glycan therapeutic composition consists essentially of a mono-, oligo-, and/or polysaccharide which is non-digestible by a human digestive system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0380" num="0384">In another embodiment, the glycan therapeutic composition comprises a mixture of non-digestible oligosaccharides. In another embodiment, the glycan therapeutic composition comprises one or more digestible saccharides and one or more non-digestible oligosaccharides. In some embodiments, the glycan therapeutic composition comprises at least one non-digestible saccharide and optionally contains one or more digestible mono-saccharides, oligo- or polysaccharides. In one embodiment the glycan therapeutic composition comprises a mixture of one or more non-digestible oligosaccharides, non-digestible polysaccharides, free monosaccharides, non-digestible saccharides, starch, or non-starch polysaccharides.</div>

Other natural saccharides include inulin, fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), lactulose, galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS), raffinose, or stachyose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0383" num="0387">Digestible monosaccharides or oligosaccharides are carbohydrates that can be digested by the human digestive system, and include, e.g., lactose, galactose, or glucose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0384" num="0388">In one embodiment, a glycan therapeutic composition is a mixture of non-digestible oligosaccharides and lactose, glucose or galactose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0385" num="0389">In another embodiment, a prebiotic composition comprises a glycan therapeutic composition wherein the glycan therapeutic composition comprises about 1-90%, about 1-80%, about 1-70%, about 1-60%, about 1-50%, about 1-40%, about 40-90%, about 40-80%, about 40-70%, about 40-60%, about 40-50%, about 50-90%, about 50-80%, about 50-70%, about 50-60%, about 60-90%, about 60-80%, about 60-70%, about 70-90%, about 70-80%, about 70-90%, about 70-80%, about 80-90%, about 92-100%, about 93-99%, about 94-98%, about 92-96%, about 93-96%, or about 93-95% glycan therapeutic by weight with the remainder comprising digestible saccharides. In some embodiments, the digestible saccharides are less than about 10% (such as about 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or less than 1%). In one embodiment, a glycan therapeutic composition can comprise about 1-5% digestible saccharides, such as lactose, glucose or galactose. In one embodiment the digestible saccharides are byproducts of the glycan therapeutic synthesis process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0386" num="0390">In one embodiment, a glycan therapeutic composition comprises about 1-90%, about 1-80%, about 1-70%, about 1-60%, about 1-50%, about 1-40%, about 40-90%, about 40-80%, about 40-70%, about 40-60%, about 40-50%, about 50-90%, about 50-80%, about 50-70%, about 50-60%, about 60-90%, about 60-80%, about 60-70%, about 70-90%, about 70-80%, about 70-90%, about 70-80%, about 80-90%, about 90-96%, about 93-96%, about 93-95%, about 94-98%, about 93-99%, or about 92-100% glycan therapeutic by weight and no digestible saccharides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0387" num="0391">In one embodiment, the glycan therapeutic composition comprises one or more non-digestible or essentially non-digestible (by a human) prebiotics. This non-digestibility is because humans lack the enzymes to break down some or all of the prebiotic oligosaccharide as it travels through the digestive tract. When a prebiotic reaches the small intestine and colon, bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacteria and <i>Lactobacilli</i>) encoding an enzyme or enzymes capable of digesting the prebiotic can break down the prebiotic into simple sugars that the bacteria can use. Suitable prebiotics can include one or more of a carbohydrate, carbohydrate monomer, carbohydrate oligomer, or carbohydrate polymer. In one embodiment, the prebiotics are non-digestible saccharides, which include non-digestible monosaccharides, non-digestible oligosaccharides, or non-digestible polysaccharides.

Other prebiotics include various galactans and carbohydrate based gums, such as <i>psyllium</i>, guar, carrageen, gellan, and konjac. Other prebiotics include dietary fibers, such as, for example, resistant maltodextrin, fiber dextrin, polydextrose, inulin, IMOS, the linear and branched dextrans, pullalan, hemicellulose, and combinations thereof. Dietary fiber may consist of non-starch polysaccharides such as cellulose and many other plant components such as dextrins, inulin, lignin, chitins, pectins, beta-glucans, fructo-oligosaccharides, resistant starches, soluble corn (gluco) fiber, polydextrose, and gums such as guar, locust bean, xanthan or pullulan gum. Other fiber sources include oligo- or polysaccharides, selected from the group consisting of resistant maltodextrin, polydextrose, soluble corn (gluco) fiber, fiber dextrin, pullulan, resistant starch, inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, hemicellulose and fructose oligomer syrup or lactulose or any other prebiotic compounds (including prebiotic disaccharides such as lactulose and tagatose among others).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0389" num="0393">Additional substances can be given in conjunction with a glycan therapeutic composition. These substances can enhance the action of the increasing doses of glycan therapeutic by, e.g., encouraging the growth of bacteria in the gut that alleviate symptoms of GI diseases, increasing adhesion of probiotic or beneficial commensal bacteria, or allowing doses of probiotic bacteria to more readily pass through the stomach without being destroyed. These substances can be given prior to treatment with glycan therapeutic, during treatment with glycan therapeutic, after treatment with glycan therapeutic, or any combination thereof. If administered during glycan therapeutic treatment, they can be administered with the dose of glycan therapeutic being given, or before or after the dose of glycan therapeutic, or any combination thereof.</div>

The host response may be modulated a) via secreted or shed bacterial products (e.g., short-chain fatty acids), b) stimulation of the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), c) modulation (increasing or decreasing the production of) inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines including: interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-23, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5, also known as RANTES), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), or d) modulation of other innate or adaptive immune responses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0420" num="0424">The glycan therapeutics when administered to a subject in an effective amount may modulate one or more host pathways. In some embodiments, an inflammatory state, e.g. of the GI tract is modulated by administration of a glycan therapeutic. In some embodiments, production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may be modulated. For example, SCFAs produced by the gut microbiota may serve as energy sources for colonic epithelial cells and in some embodiments contribute to the maintenance of gut barrier function. In some instances, increased gut barrier function limits plasma endotoxin levels and prevents systemic inflammation (Cani et al., Changes in gut microbiota control inflammation in obese mice through a mechanism involving GLP-2-driven improvement of gut permeability, Gut, 2009, 58:1091). In some embodiments, SCFAs promote gut barrier function by affecting mucin production and gastrointestinal peptide LL-37. SCFAs modulate a number of human immunological factors. In some embodiments, SCFAs modulate inflammation by suppressing NF-kB and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α (Kim C H et al. 2014. Gut Microbiota-Derived Short-Chain Fatty Acids, T Cells, and Inflammation. Immune Network 14(6):277-288). In one embodiment, treatment with a glycan therapeutic described herein modulates (e.g., increases) that SCFA propionate. In some embodiments, propionate increases expression of Foxp3, a T cell regulatory factor, and/or IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, in colonic regulatory T cells. In some embodiments, SCFAs promote the generation of (e.g., colonic) regulatory T (Treg) cells and/or CD4+ T cells thereby limiting inflammatory responses (Arpaia et al., Metabolites produced by commensal bacteria promote peripheral regulatory T-cell generation, Nature, 2013, 504:451; Smith P M et al. 2013. The microbial metabolites, short chain fatty acids, regulate colonic Treg cell homeostasis. Science; 341(6145)).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0430" num="0434">In some embodiments, subjects are identified and selected that respond to a glycan therapeutic for initial and/or continued treatment. Responders may be identified using one or more suitable parameter as determined by a physician or other healthcare provider. The parameters include one or more of: a) a physiological treatment effect (e.g. reduction of a fever, increased well-being, increased energy, etc.), b) a desired change in a (host) biomarker (e.g. a cancer marker, an inflammatory marker, etc.), c) a microbial taxa shift (e.g., in relative abundance, change in diversity, etc.), d) a functional shift of the microbiota (e.g. a shift in metabolic output, microbial signaling, microbial gene expression, microbial protein expression), e) absence or presence of a desired bacterial taxa (in the host microbiota), etc. In some embodiments, non-responders are identified and selected. In one embodiment, treatment methods include rendering the non-responder responsive to the treatment. In some embodiments, this may include administering to the non-responder one or more bacterial taxa (e.g. one or more commensals) that are responsive to glycan (and/or second agent) treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0431" num="0435">In some embodiments, methods of evaluating a subject, e.g., to evaluate suitability for glycan treatment, responsiveness to glycan treatment, or glycan treatment progression, are provided. Optionally, the glycan treatment is in combination with another treatment or therapy (e.g., a drug treatment, such as an anti-cancer drug). Changes in a variety of suitable biomarkers may be assessed. In some embodiments, changes in the microbiota are assessed or corresponding values are acquired. In some embodiments, changes in microbial metabolism (e.g. metabolite input and/or output) are assessed or corresponding values are acquired. In some embodiments, changes in the microbiome (e.g. changes on the genome or transcriptome level) are assessed or corresponding values are acquired. In some embodiments, changes in the microbial proteome are assessed or corresponding values are acquired.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0454" num="0458">Provided herein are methods of treating an immune imbalance in a subject. Provided herein is a method of treating an immune imbalance in a human subject, comprising: administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition, a medical food or a dietary supplement comprising a glycan therapeutic preparation, in an effective amount to treat the subject. Optionally, a second agent may be administered. The methods also include methods for reducing an infection and/or an inflammation in a subject having an immune imbalance. Also provided are methods of modulating the composition and/or metabolic activity of the intestinal bacterial community of a subject having an immune imbalance, and methods of modulating one or more functional pathways in a subject having an immune imbalance. Further, methods of treating a dysbiosis in a subject having an immune imbalance are provided. In some embodiments, the immune imbalance results in or is associated with a cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0455" num="0459">In some embodiments, immune suppression and/or insufficient immune inflammatory activation is characterized by the overgrowth of pathogenic cells. Examples of pathogenic cells include intracellular pathogens, extracellular pathogens, viruses, and cancerous cells. Immune suppression and/or insufficient immune inflammatory activation, in some embodiments, is associated with tolerance, e.g., resulting from an imbalance in the ratio of tolerogenic cell subsets (e.g. regulatory T cells) or activities (e.g. tolerogenic cytokine secretion such IL-10, TGF-beta) to inflammatory cell subsets (e.g. Th1 cells) or activities (e.g. inflammatory cytokine secretion such as TNF-alpha, IL-17), with the tolerogenic functions displaying higher activity than the inflammatory functions. Immune suppression and/or insufficient immune inflammatory activation, in some embodiments, is associated with the immune system not recognizing the pathogenic cell as a pathogen, which frequently occurs in the case of cancerous cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0456" num="0460">Aberrant immune inflammatory activation, in some embodiments, is characterized by damage to or a decrease in the proliferation of non-pathogenic cells. Examples of non-pathogenic cells are any cells or cell-structures (including tissues and organs) that are not-targeted by the immune system for attack in a healthy individual. For example, the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract is not substantially damaged by the immune system in healthy individuals but is damaged by the immune system in individuals with inflammatory diseases such as, e.g., inflammatory bowel disease. For example, the pancreas is not substantially targeted by the inflammatory arm of the immune system in patients who do not have autoimmune diabetes, but is targeted in patients with type-1 diabetes. Aberrant immune inflammatory activation, in some embodiments, is associated with an imbalance in the ratio of tolerogenic cell subsets (e.g. regulatory T cells) or activities (e.g. tolerogenic cytokine secretion such IL-10, TGF-beta) to inflammatory cell subsets (e.g. Th1 cells) or activities (e.g. inflammatory cytokine secretion such as TNF-alpha, IL-17), with the inflammatory functions displaying higher activity than the tolerogenic functions.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0459" num="0463">Provided herein are methods of treating a nutritional imbalance in a subject. Provided herein is a method of treating a nutritional imbalance in a human subject, comprising: administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition, a medical food or a dietary supplement comprising a glycan therapeutic preparation, in an effective amount to treat the subject. Optionally, a second agent may be administered. The methods also include methods for reducing an infection and/or an inflammation in a subject having a nutritional imbalance. Also provided are methods of modulating the composition and/or metabolic activity of the intestinal bacterial community of a subject having a nutritional imbalance, and methods of modulating one or more functional pathways in a subject having a nutritional imbalance. Further, methods of treating a dysbiosis in a subject having a nutritional imbalance are provided. In some embodiments, the nutritional imbalance results in or is associated with a cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0460" num="0464">In some embodiments, the nutritional imbalances is associated with an aberrant inflammatory immune activation that alters metabolic homeostasis. In some embodiments, the nutritional imbalance is associated with an imbalance in the ratio of tolerogenic cell subsets (e.g. regulatory t cells) or activities (e.g. tolerogenic cytokine secretion such IL-10, TGF-beta) to inflammatory cell subsets (e.g. Th1 cells) or activities (e.g. inflammatory cytokine secretion such as TNF-alpha, IL-17), with the inflammatory functions displaying higher activity than the tolerogenic functions. In some embodiments, an increased immune in inflammatory activity affects the mechanisms that metabolic organs and systems utilize for communication. For example, cancer patients who have malnutrition often exhibit a high level of leptin, which is a hormone that induces satiety and thus decreases the patient's hunger. Other diseases that lead to cachexia include, e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rheumatoid arthritis, chronic infection or sepsis, renal failure, heart failure and cancer. The condition is characterized by inflammation, anorexia, insulin resistance and increased muscle protein breakdown with or without a loss of fat mass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0461" num="0465">Examples of nutritional imbalance include: Cachexia, anorexia nervosa, kwashiorkor and marasmus.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0489" num="0493">In some embodiments, the unwanted side effects, including toxicities such as digestive abnormalities, are associated with treatment of the subject with metformin, paroxetine, valproic acid, or clozapine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0490" num="0494">In one embodiment, reducing the one or more symptoms (e.g., of unwanted side effects) increases compliance by the subject to the treatment regimen. In one embodiment, reducing one or more symptom (e.g., of unwanted side effects) enables the physician to prescribe a higher-dose of the drug to be administered. In such embodiments, treatment of the underlying disease is more effective (e.g. increased reduction of disease symptoms, shorter period to achieve a disease or symptom-free state, or longer maintainance of a disease or symptom-free state, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0491" num="0495">In one embodiment, a method of lowering toxicity of a drug treatment (e.g., an anti-cancer drug treatment) in a subject is provided. The method includes: a) administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a glycan therapeutic preparation to a subject who has received the drug treatment; b) administering the drug treatment to a subject who has been treated with a pharmaceutical composition comprising a glycan therapeutic preparation; or c) administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a glycan therapeutic preparation and administering the drug treatment, to a subject, thereby treating the subject. In some embodiments, the toxicity is dose-limiting toxicity. In some embodiments, the method increases the tolerance of the subject to drug treatment, e.g. an anti-cancer drug treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0492" num="0496">In some embodiments, dose limiting toxicity prevents subjects from being treated with the maximal efficacious dose of a drug. As one example of dose-limiting toxicity, diarrhea can be caused by the chemotherapy drugs irinotecan and 5-fluoruracil. Irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil may damage the intestinal epithelium of subjects. As a result nutrient and fluid absorption and secretion is modulated. In some instances, the digestive abnormality forces a clinician to reduce the dose of the drug to adjust it to the subject's tolerance level. In some instances, the lowering may lead to a treatment regimen with a less efficacious dose thereby limiting the treatment effect (or prolonging the treatment interval. In some embodiments, glycan therapeutic preparations are administered to treat dose limiting toxicity, e.g., to increase the dose that is tolerated by the subject. In some embodiments, tolerability is increased by limiting one or more digestive abnormalities associated with the respective efficacious drug dose.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0493" num="0497">In some embodiments, the subject experiences a reduction in at least one symptom of the gastrointestinal disease, disorder or condition following treatment. In some embodiments, a reduction in the severity of a symptom following treatment can be determined (e.g. by measuring a known biomarker) and is in the order of about 3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or about 100%. In some embodiments, the symptoms, measured as described herein, are decreased by an average of about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or about 100% when compared to symptoms prior to the administration of a pharmaceutical glycan therapeutic composition. In some embodiments, the reduction in the severity of the symptom persists for at least about a day, two days, three days, four days, five days, a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, a year, two years, five years, ten years after treatment or the reduction is permanent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0494" num="0498">In one embodiment, a symptom of a gastrointestinal disease, disorder or condition remains partially, substantially, or completely eliminated or decreased in severity in a subject for at least about 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 9 months, one year, 18 months, two years, three years, four years, five years, ten years, or more than ten years after the termination of treatment. In another embodiment a symptom of a gastrointestinal disease, disorder or condition is permanently eliminated or decreased in severity in a subject after the termination of treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0495" num="0499">Proteomic Analysis of Microbial Populations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0496" num="0500">Preparations of glycan therapeutics may be selected based on their ability to increase the expression of microbial proteins associated with healthy states or to decrease the expression of microbial proteins associated with diseased states. Proteomic analysis of microbial populations can be performed following protocols known to one skilled in the art (e.g., Cordwell, Exploring and exploiting bacterial proteomes, Methods in Molecular Biology, 2004, 266:115). To identify differentially expressed proteins (for example, to identify changes in protein expression upon treatment of microbial populations with glycan therapeutics), proteomic analysis can be performed as described, e.g., in Juste et al. (Bacterial protein signals are associated with Crohn's disease, Gut, 2014, 63:1566). For example, the protein is isolated from the microbial lysates of two samples (for example, an untreated microbial population and a population that has been treated with glycan therapeutics). Each protein sample is labeled (e.g., with a fluorescent dye, e.g., Cy3 or Cy5 CyDye DIGE Fluor minimal dye, GE Healthcare) and analyzed by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Gels are stained and protein spots identified as being significantly different between the two samples are excised, digested, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). X!TandemPipeline can be used to identify differentially expressed proteins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0497" num="0501">Preparations of glycan therapeutics may also be selected for administration to a human subject based on their effect on the presence of microbial fermentation products. For example, preparations of glycan therapeutics can be selected for their ability to induce or promote growth of bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids such as propionate (propionic acid), acetate, and/or butyrate (butyric acid). Similarly, preparations of glycan therapeutics can be selected for their ability to induce or promote growth of bacteria that produce lactic acid, which can modulate the growth of other bacteria by producing an acidic environment. Such analysis may also be used to pair probiotic bacteria with glycan therapeutics such that the glycan therapeutic is a substrate for the production of the desired fermentation products.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0498" num="0502">The metabolites that are present in fresh or spent culture media or in biological samples collected from human subjects may be determined using methods known in the art and described herein. Unbiased methods that may be used to determine the relative concentration of metabolites in a sample and are known to one skilled in the art, such as gas or liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry or <sup>1</sup>H-NMR. These measurements may be validated by running metabolite standards through the same analytical systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0499" num="0503">In the case of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, polar metabolites and fatty acids can be extracted using monophasic or biphasic systems of organic solvents and an aqueous sample and derivatized (Fendt et al., Reductive glutamine metabolism is a function of the a-ketoglutarate to citrate ratio in cells, Nat Commun, 2013, 4:2236; Fendt et al., Metformin decreases glucose oxidation and increases the dependency of prostate cancer cells on reductive glutamine metabolism, Cancer Res, 2013, 73:4429; Metallo et al., Reductive glutamine metabolism by IDH1 mediates lipogenesis under hypoxia, Nature, 2011, 481:380). An exemplary protocol for derivatization of polar metabolites involves formation of methoxime-tBDMS derivatives through incubation of the metabolites with 2% methoxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine followed by addition of N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) with 1% tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane (t-BDMCS). Non-polar fractions, including triacylglycerides and phospholipids, may be saponified to free fatty acids and esterified to form fatty acid methyl esters, for example, either by incubation with 2% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>in methanol or by using Methyl-8 reagent (Thermo Scientific). Derivatized samples may then be analyzed by GC-MS using standard LC-MS methods, for example, a DB-35MS column (30 m×0.25 mm i.d.×0.25 μm, Agilent J&amp;W Scientific) installed on a gas chromatograph (GC) interfaced with an mass spectrometer (MS). Mass isotopomer distributions may be determined by integrating metabolite ion fragments and corrected for natural abundance using standard algorithms, such as those adapted from Fernandez et al. (Fernandez et al., Correction of 13C mass isotopomer distributions for natural stable isotope abundance, J Mass Spectrom, 1996, 31:255). In the case of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), polar metabolites may be analyzed using a standard benchtop LC-MS/MS equipped with a column, such as a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC Polymeric column (2.1×150 mm; EMD Millipore). Exemplary mobile phases used for separation could include buffers and organic solvents adjusted to a specific pH value. In combination or in the alternative, extracted samples may be analyzed by <sup>1</sup>H-nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR). Samples may be combined with isotopically enriched solvents such as D20, optionally in the presence of a buffered solution (e.g., Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>in D<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.4). Samples may also be supplemented with a reference standard for calibration and chemical shift determination (e.g., 5 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt (DSS-d<sub>6</sub>, Isotec, USA)). Prior to analysis, the solution may be filtered or centrifuged to remove any sediment or precipitates, and then transferred to a suitable NMR tube or vessel for analysis (e.g., a 5 mm NMR tube). <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra may be acquired on a standard NMR spectrometer, such as an Avance II+500 Bruker spectrometer (500 MHz) (Bruker, Del.), equipped with a 5 mm QXI-Z C/N/P probe-head) and analyzed with spectra integration software (such as Chenomx NMR Suite 7.1; Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, AB). (Duarte et al., <sup>1</sup>H-NMR protocol for exometabolome analysis of cultured mammalian cells, Methods Mol Biol, 2014:237-47). Alternatively, <sup>1</sup>H-NMR may be performed following other published protocols known in the art (Chassaing et al., Lack of soluble fiber drives diet-induced adiposity in mice, Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol, 2015; Bal et al., Comparison of Storage Conditions for Human Vaginal Microbiome Studies, PLoS ONE, 2012:e36934).</div>

<heading id="h-0009">Example 1: Preparation of Glycan Therapeutics</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0502" num="0506">To a round bottom flask equipped with an overhead stirrer and a jacketed short-path condenser was added one or more mono- or disaccharides along with 3-20% by dry weight of one or more of the catalysts described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,466,242 and WO 2014/031956, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Water or another compatible solvent (1.54 equiv) was added to the dry mixture and the slurry was combined at approximately 100 rpm using a paddle sized to match the contours of the selected round bottom flask as closely as possible. The mixture was then heated to 80-155° C. Once the solids achieved a molten state, the vessel was placed under 10-1000 mbar vacuum pressure. The reaction was stirred for 30 minutes to 8 hours, constantly removing water from the reaction. Reaction progress was monitored by HPLC. When sufficient oligomerization had occurred, the stirrer was shut off, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and vented to atmospheric pressure, and the solid mass was dissolved in a volume of water sufficient to create a solution of approximately 50 Brix (grams sugar per 100 g solution). Once dissolution was complete, solid catalyst was removed by filtration and the oligomer solution was concentrated to approximately 50-75 Brix by rotary evaporation. In cases in which an organic solvent has been used, water immiscible solvents can be removed by biphasic extraction and water miscible solvents can be removed by rotary evaporation concomitant to the concentration step.</div>

The slurry was combined at approximately 100 rpm using a paddle sized to match the contours of the selected round bottom flask as closely as possible. The mixture was then heated to 155° C. until the slurry achieved a molten state. The reaction was then placed under 300 mbar vacuum and stirred at 100 RPM for 3 hours, constantly removing water from the reaction. After the pre-established time had elapsed, the stirrer was shut off, the reaction was vented to atmospheric pressure, and the slurry was cooled to room temperature. 100 mL of water (100% by dry weight) was added to the now solid mass and the material was allowed to dissolve over 16 hour to create a solution of approximately 50 Brix (grams sugar per 100 g solution). Once dissolution was complete, solid catalyst was removed by filtration through a coarse glass-fritted funnel.

<heading id="h-0010">Example 2: Purification of Glycan Therapeutics</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0511" num="0515">Oligosaccharides synthesized as in Example 1 were dissolved in deionized water to a final concentration of 25-50 Brix. The material was then exposed to at least 2 mass equivalents of Dowex Monosphere 88 ion exchange resin. Exposure may occur by swirling in a flask at 120-170 rpm or by filtration through a wet slurry packed column as long as the residence time is sufficient for the solution to achieve a final pH between 3 and 5. The oligomer solution was isolated by filtration (as in the case of swirled reactions) or elution (as in the case of column filtration) and the process was repeated with Dowex Monosphere 77 ion exchange resin in an analogous fashion until the solution pH was above 5.5. Finally the solution was exposed to Dowex Optipore SD-2 Adsorbent decolorizing resin until the solution was sufficiently clarified and filtered through a 0.2 micron filter to remove residual resin and resin fines. The final solution was then concentrated to 50-85 Brix by rotary evaporation or to a solid by lyophilization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0512" num="0516">Man100 and xyl100 were synthesized as in Example 1 and were purified by ion exchange. The material was purified by elution through three different ion-exchange chromatography columns using deionized water as an eluent at a speed of 2 bed volumes per hour. The columns were arranged serially in the following order: Dowex Monosphere 88 strong cation resin, Dowex Monosphere 77 weak base resin, and Dowex Optipore SD-2 adsorbent decolorizing resin. Each column was 220 mL in bed volume. After passage, the solution was filtered through a 0.20 micron filter to remove residual resin and resin fines. The final solution was then concentrated to a 65-75 Brix syrup by rotary evaporation or to a 92-98 Brix solid by lyophilization. Isolated yields of glycan varied by monomeric content and preparation but were consistently between 80-85% by recovered mass and 88-94% by molar equivalent.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Example 3: Modification of Glycan Therapeutics by Removal of Low Molecular Weight Species</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0513" num="0517">Oligomers prepared and purified as in Examples 1 and 2 were modified so as to remove low molecular weight species. The separation was achieved by osmotic separation. Approximately 45 cm of 1.0 kD MWCO Biotech CE dialysis tubing (31 mm flat width) from Spectrum Labs was placed into deionized water and soaked for 10 minutes, then one end was sealed with a dialysis tubing clip. A 25 Brix solution of 8 grams dry oligosaccharide was sterile filtered and sealed into the tube with a second clip along with a few mL of air to permit the tube to float. The filled tube was then placed in a 3 gallon tank of deionized water which was stirred with sufficient force to induce slow swirling of the sealed tubes. After 8 hours, the water in the tank was replaced and the tube was allowed to stir for an additional 16 hours. Once the dialysis was complete and the material had a DP2+yield greater than 95% and a DP3+yield greater than 90%, the dilute solution was sterile filtered and concentrated in vacuo to a final concentration of approximately 65 Brix or lyophilized to a solid with a residual moisture between 1 and 10%. Alternatively, the separation was achieved by tangential flow filtration (TFF). In this case, 100 mL of 25 Brix glycan sample dissolved in deionized water and sterile filtered was placed into the feed bottle of a Spectrum Labs KrosFlo Research IIi TFF system that was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The sample was then diafiltered through a 1 kD mPES MidiKros hollow-fiber filter at a transmembrane pressure of 25 psig. HPLC samples of the feed stock taken every 0.5 diafiltration volumes were used to determine when the material had a DP2+yield greater than 95% and a DP3+yield greater than 90% at which point the solution was sterile filtered and concentrated in vacuo to a 65 Brix syrup or lyophilized to a solid with residual water content of 1-10% by mass. Low molecular weight oligomers can also be removed by precipitation with 70% ethanol as in Gras, et al. Food Chem. 2001, 128, 773-777. Glycans can also be fractionated into pools with different average molecular weights by activated charcoal chromatography as in Sanz, et al. Chromatographia 2006, 64, 233-236.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">Example 4: Methods for Analyzing Preparations of Glycan Therapeutics</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0514" num="0518">Measurement of Glycan Content by Liquid Refractometry</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0515" num="0519">This experiment was designed to quantitate the amount of glycan in any given aqueous solution. A Mettler-Toledo Refracto 30GS portable sugar refractometer was calibrated using high-purity reverse-osmosis deionized water. Several drops of the glycan solution were filtered through a 0.2 micron syringe filter directly onto the lens of the refractometer. The measurement was taken at room temperature and reported as Brix. The glycans were routinely concentrated to 75 Brix without obvious solidification or crystallization at 23° C. Brix can then be converted to solubility assuming a specific density of water equal to 1.0 g/mL. Thus, 75 Brix (100 grams of solution consisting of 75 grams of glycan and 25 grams of water) equals an aqueous solubility of 3.0 g/mL. As a comparison, the aqueous solubility of D-glucose is reported to be 0.909 g/mL (48 Brix) at 25° C. by Sigma-Aldrich.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0516" num="0520">Monomeric Composition by Hydrolysis and GC-MS</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0517" num="0521">This experiment was designed to quantitate the ratio of monomer content within a given oligosaccharide. Glycosyl composition analysis was performed by combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of the per-O-trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of the monosaccharide methyl glycosides produced from the sample by acidic methanolysis as described previously by Santander et al. (2013) Microbiology 159:1471. Between 100 and 200 g of sample were lyophilized into a suitable test tube. Inositol (20 □g) was added to the sample as an internal standard, then the sample was heated to 80° C. in 1M HCl/methanol for 18 hours. The resulting monosaccharides were then re-acetylated using pyridine and acetic anhydride in MeOH, and per-O-trimethylsilylated with Tri-Sil (Pierce) at 80° C. for 30 minutes. GC/MS analysis of the TMS methyl glycosides was performed on an Agilent 7890A GC interfaced to a 5975C MSD, using a Supelco Equity-1 fused silica capillary column (30 m×0.25 mm ID). Each peak was assigned to a component sugar based upon comparison to known standards and integration of the respective peaks allowed clean calculation of the relative percentage of monomers within an exemplified glycan. In all tested cases, the monomer composition of a given oligosaccharide matched the input ratio within experimental error and the output composition matched the input composition within the precision of the measurement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0518" num="0522">Molecular Weight Distribution by Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0519" num="0523">This experiment was designed to quantitate the distribution of molecular weights within a given oligosaccharide. The measurement was made by HPLC using the method described in Monograph of United States Pharmacopeia, 38(6) In-Process Revision: Heparin Sodium (USP37-NF32). Separations were achieved on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system via dual Shodex OHpak SB-802.5 HQ columns using pure HPLC grade water as the eluent at 1.0 mL/min flow rate and an RI detector held at 40° C. The column temperature was set at 40° C. and glucose (180 g/mol), maltose (342 g/mol), pullulan 1300 (1080 g/mol; provided by Sigma-Aldrich), and pullulan 6000 (6100 g/mol; provided by Sigma-Aldrich) were used to draw a standard curve. A 1 mg/mL solution of the sample was prepared and passed through a 0.22 μm syringe filter, followed by 10 μl injections into the HPLC. A third-order polynomial curve was constructed based on the logarithmic molecular weights and elution volumes of the listed standards. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw), the number average molecular weight (Mn), and the polydispersity index (PDI) for the sample were calculated by comparison to the standard curve.

Similar analysis of a glu50gal50 sample showed a MW, high mass, and low mass of 1195 g/mol (˜DP7), 4331 g/mol (˜DP27), and 221 g/mol (˜DP1) respectively.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0523" num="0527">The proportion of glycan with DP greater than or equal to 2 (DP2+) and 3 (DP3+) may be measured by ion-affinity chromatography. A sample of glycan was diluted out to 50-100 mg/mL and 10 μL of this solution was injected onto an Agilent 1260 BioPure HPLC equipped with a 7.8×300 mm BioRad Aminex HPX-42A column and RI detector. Using pure HPLC-grade water as an eluent, the sample was eluted at 0.6 mL/min through an 80° C. column and an RI detector maintained at 50° C. The peaks representing DP1-6 are assigned by comparison to reference standards and integrated using the Agilent ChemStation software. Peaks are typically integrated as DP1, DP2, DP3, DP4-7, and DP8+. The DP that is achievable by the reaction described in Example 1 varies from monomer to monomer although it is consistent across batches if the procedure is followed correctly, e.g. glucose reliably achieves higher DP values than arabinose. For example, across 17 batches of glu100, DP2+values ranged from 85-93% and DP3+values ranged from 80-90%. Conversely, across 6 batches of ara100, DP2+values ranged from 63-78% and DP3+values ranged from 48-71%. Mixtures of monomers behaved as averages of the individual components. For man100 and xyl100 the DP2+yield was 91.9% and 89.6, respectively, and the DP3+yield was 85.5 and 85.5, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0524" num="0528">Alpha-/Beta-Distribution by 2D NMR</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0525" num="0529">This experiment was designed to quantitate the ratio of alpha- and beta-glycosidic bonds within a given sample by two-dimensional NMR. Approximately 150 mg of 65 Brix oligosaccharide solution was dried to stable mass in a vacuum oven at 45-95° C. under 400 mbar pressure. The sample was subjected to two cycles of dissolution in D20 and drying to remove residual H<sub>2</sub>O. Once dried, the sample was dissolved in 750 μL D20 with 0.1% acetone, placed into a 3 mm NMR tube, and analyzed in a Bruker Avance-III operating at 500.13 MHz 1H (125.77 MHz 13C) equipped with a Bruker BBFO probe operating at 21.1° C. The sample was analyzed using a heteroatomic single quantum coherence pulse sequence (HSQC) using the standard Bruker pulse sequence. Anomeric protons between 4-6 ppm (1H) and 80-120 ppm (13C) were assigned by analogy to glucose as reported in Roslund, et al. (2008) <i>Carbohydrate Res. </i>343:101-112. Spectra were referenced to the internal acetone signal: 1H—2.22 ppm; 13C—30.8 ppm. Isomers were quantitated by integration of their respective peaks using the MNova software package from Mestrelab Research (Santiago de Compostela, Spain). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the anomeric region of a representative spectrum. Table 6 lists the distribution across 13 distinct combinations of monomers showing the alpha-/beta-ratio to be as high as 4:1 as in the case of rha100 and as low as 1:1 as in the case of glu50gal50.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0528" num="0532">This experiment was designed to identify the composition of a glycan by 2D-NMR identification of the constituent monomers. Approximately 150 mg of 65 Brix oligosaccharide solution was dried to stable mass in a vacuum oven at 45° C. under 300 mbar pressure, typically requiring 4-8 hours. Once dried, the sample was dissolved in 1.0 mL D<sub>2</sub>O with 0.1% acetone, placed into a 3 mm NMR tube, and analyzed in a Bruker Avance-III using the spectral parameters listed in Table 7. The sample was analyzed using a 13C-1H heteroatomic single quantum coherence pulse sequence (HSQC) using the standard Bruker pulse sequence. Spectra were manually phased then referenced in both dimensions to the internal acetone signal: 1H—2.22 ppm; 13C—30.89 ppm. The anomeric region of each glycan spectra derived from a single sugar monomer was then examined for peaks representing specific glycosidic bonds characteristic to that monomer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0532" num="0536">Due to the spin-isolated nature of single carbohydrate rings within polysaccharides, the HSQC spectrum of a glycan with more than one monomer is predicted to be represented by the sum of the HSQC peaks of each of its constituent sugars. Therefore, each constituent monomer has unique HSQC peaks that will appear in any glycan that contains that monomer irrespective of other constituent monomers and furthermore, the monomers used to synthesize a glycan can be determined by identifying the fingerprint peaks unique to each constituent monomer. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that the HSQC spectra of glu50gal50 is a hybrid of the spectra of glu100 and gal100.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0534" num="0538">At least 5 peaks appeared for each glycan unit used as a starting material in the synthesis of a glycan therapeutic containing 3 or fewer distinct glycan units. The HSQC spectra of glycan therapeutics containing 4 or more distinct glycan units have at least 4 peaks for each constituent glycan unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0535" num="0539">Branching Analysis</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0536" num="0540">This experiment was designed to quantitate the distribution of glycosidic regioisomers (branching) within a given oligosaccharide. For glycosyl linkage analysis, the samples were permethylated, depolymerized, reduced, and acetylated; and the resultant partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described by Heiss et al (2009) Carbohydr. Res. 344:915. The samples were suspended in 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide and left to stir for 1 day. Permethylation was effected by two rounds of treatment with sodium hydroxide (15 min) and methyl iodide (45 min). The aqueous solution was hydrolyzed by addition of 2M trifluoroacetic acid and heating to 121° C. for 2 hours. Solids were isolated in vacuo and acetylated in acetic acid/trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting PMAAs were analyzed on an Agilent 7890A GC interfaced to a 5975C MSD (mass selective detector, electron impact ionization mode); separation was performed on a 30 m Supelco SP-2331 bonded phase fused silica capillary column. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows three representative GC spectra from this analysis. These analyses show that the glycans had at least 0.1-10% of each of the 1,2-; 1,3-; 1,4-, and 1,6-glycoside bond types. The materials also contained at least 5% of the branched bond types (including but not limited to 1,3,6-; 1,4,6-; or 1,2,4-glycosides) and at least 3% of the monomeric units existed in the furanose form. A glycan originating from a single monomer consisted of at least 12 distinct non-terminal substitution patterns. A glycan originating from two monomers consisted of at least 18 distinct non-terminal substitution patterns. A glycan originating from three or more monomers consisted of at least 24 distinct non-terminal substitution patterns.</div>
<heading id="h-0013">Example 5: Effect of Glycans on Microbial Populations Ex Vivo</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0537" num="0541">To determine the desired composition of glycans, bacterial cultures are grown in the presence of candidate glycans and assayed for their growth, community composition (e.g., by 16S rRNA gene sequencing), production of metabolites, and phenotypic or transcriptomic properties. Desired glycans are selected based on their ability to elicit desired properties within the bacterial culture. Bacterial cultures include monocultures, mixed cultures, cultures isolated from humans or laboratory animal models, cultures isolated from a human or laboratory animal model and spiked with an isolate or collection of isolates, or cultures isolated from a human or laboratory animal model and depleted of a collection of species (for example, by application of an antibiotic). This assay can be performed in the presence of antibiotics or other test compounds. The results obtained from the in vitro assays are compared with those obtained after treating humans with glycans or administering the glycans to a laboratory animal establishing the in vitro-in vivo correlation of results.</div>
<heading id="h-0014">Example 6: Effect of Glycans on Commensal Bacteria In Vitro</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0538" num="0542">An in vitro assay was performed to assess the ability of various bacterial strains, including commensals of the gastrointestinal tract, to utilize different glycans as growth substrates. This assay was designed to assess the ability of selected glycans to promote the growth of microbiota associated with effects on cancer progression, including protective effects. Bacterial strains were handled at all steps in an anaerobic chamber (AS-580, Anaerobe Systems) featuring a palladium catalyst. The chamber was initially made anaerobic by purging with an anaerobic gas mixture of 5% hydrogen, 5% carbon dioxide and 90% nitrogen and subsequently maintained in an anaerobic state using this same anaerobic gas mixture. Anaerobicity of the chamber was confirmed daily using Oxoid anaerobic indicator strips that change color in the presence of oxygen. All culture media, assay plates, other reagents and plastic consumables were pre-reduced in the anaerobic chamber for 24-48 hours prior to contact with bacteria. Glycans ara50gal50, glu33gal33fuc33, glu50gal50, gal100, glu100, xyl100, ara100, ara60xyl40, glu80man20, glu60man40, man52glu29gal19, man100, xyl75ara25, and a commercially available control, FOS (Nutraflora FOS; NOW Foods, Bloomingdale Ill.), were prepared at 5% w/v in water, filter-sterilized and added to Costar 3370 assay plates for a final concentration of 0.5% w/v in the assay, with each glycan assayed in two non-adjacent wells and dextrose and water supplied as positive and negative controls.</div>

Nat Commun. 2014; 5:3114), supplemented with 0-10% (v/v) CMG. <i>B. thetaiotaomicron, B. caccae </i>and <i>B. cellulosyliticus </i>were tested in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 15 mM sodium chloride, 8.5 mM ammonium sulfate, 4 mM L-cysteine, 1.9 μM hematin, 200 μM L-histidine, 100 μM magnesium chloride, 1.4 μM iron sulfate heptahydrate, 50 μM calcium chloride, 1 μg/mL vitamin K3 and 5 ng/mL vitamin B12 (Martens E C et al. Cell Host &amp; Microbe 2008; 4, 447-457). <i>C. scindens, P. copri </i>and <i>R. obeum </i>were tested in 10 g/L tryptone peptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 0.5 g/L L-cysteine hydrochloride, 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 1 μg/mL vitamin K3, 0.08% w/v calcium chloride, 0.4 μg/mL iron sulfate heptahydrate, 1 μg/mL resazurin, 1.2 μg/mL hematin, 0.2 mM histidine, 0.05% Tween 80, 0.5% meat extract (Sigma), 1% trace mineral supplement (ATCC), 1% vitamin supplement (ATCC), 0.017% v/v acetic acid, 0.001% v/v isovaleric acid, 0.2% v/v propionic acid and 0.2% v/v N-butyric acid (Romano K A et al. mBio 2015; 6(2):e02481-14). Bacteria were exposed to glycans ara50gal50, glu33gal33fuc33, glu50gal50, gal100, glu100, xyl100, ara100, ara60xyl40, glu80man20, glu60man40, man52glu29gal19, man100, xyl75ara25, commercial FOS and dextrose at a final concentration of 0.5% w/v in 96-well microplates, 200 μL final volume per well, at 37° C. for 18-48 hours, anaerobically. OD600 measurements for each isolate at the end of the incubation period were obtained using a Biotek Synergy2 reader with Gen5 2.0 software according to manufacturer's specifications. Measurements were normalized by dividing the OD600 readings of the isolate on test glycans by the average OD600 of the isolate in medium supplemented with 0.5% w/v dextrose to facilitate comparison of glycan utilization by strains that grow within significantly different OD600 ranges.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0543" num="0547">Glycans may increase the concentration of microbial proteins that are sufficiently similar to tumor antigens to elicit immune cell activity via antigenic mimicry or cross-reactivity. Antigen mimicry may drive anti-tumor effects via two mechanisms. First, if microbes remain confined in the intestinal lumen, microbes or microbial antigens are locally captured by CD103+CD11b+dendritic cells that migrate to the draining lymph node to present relevant antigen to T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0544" num="0548">Subsequently, these T cells can traffic to the tumor to drive an anti-tumor immune response. A second mechanism is that microbial antigens, rather than T cells, can travel through the body to a tumor site. Translocation of microbial proteins and even entire microorganisms from the intestine to mesenteric lymph nodes, the spleen, and other sites has been documented (Abt et al. (2012). Commensal bacteria calibrate the activation threshold of innate antiviral immunity. Immunity 37, 158-170; Wheeler et al. (2014). The biology of bacterial peptidoglycans and their impact on host immunity and physiology. Cell. Microbiol. 16, 1014-1023), and this breach of the mucosal barrier may prove essential for instances in which antigenic mimicry determines the long-range effects of the microbiome on immunosurveillance. Additionally, such antigenic mimicry may aid the immune systems recognition of pathogenic microorganisms that share antigens with microbial molecules that are exposed to the immune system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0545" num="0549">In mouse models, the efficacy of such immune checkpoint blockade is strongly dependent on the gut microbiome. CTLA4 blockade lost its therapeutic activity against fibrosarcomas in mice that were either raised in a germ-free environment or that had been raised in specific pathogen-free conditions and then treated with multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics to sterilize the gut (Vetizou, et al. (2015). Anticancer immunotherapy by CTLA-4 blockade relies on the gut microbiota. Science 350, 1079-1084). This defect was overcome by gavage with <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>, by immunization with <i>B. fragilis </i>polysaccharides, or by adoptive transfer of <i>B. fragilis</i>-specific T cells, suggesting a therapy-relevant crossreactivity between microbial and tumor antigens recognized by the same T cell receptor (TCR). Accordingly, both in mice and in patients, T cell responses specific for distinct <i>Bacteroides </i>species (<i>B. fragilis </i>and <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i>) were associated with the administration (in humans) and efficacy (in mice) of CTLA-4 blockade. The microbiome also affects the therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 blockade. Injection of a blocking antibody against PD-L1 was much more efficient in reducing the growth of melanomas in mice containing a high abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium </i>in their gut than in mice lacking this genus. <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-treated mice exhibited significantly improved tumor control compared with their untreated littermates, and this effect was mediated by CD8+ T cells. DCs purified from mice that had been treated with <i>Bifidobacterium </i>were particularly active in presenting a melanoma-derived peptide antigen to T cells for stimulation of their proliferation and IFN-g production, suggesting that <i>Bifidobacterium </i>improves the anticancer immune response through an effect on DCs (Sivan et al. (2015) Commensal <i>Bifidobacterium </i>promotes antitumor immunity and facilitates anti-PD-L1 efficacy. Science 350, 1084-9), which may increase the presentation of a microbiome-derived antigen. By shifting the concentration of microbes present in the microbiome, the antigens may also be shifted and the prevalence of antigens that mimic tumor-associated antigens may be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0546" num="0550">As shown in Table 13, most glycans supported growth of Parabacteroides PDI.6 and <i>Bacteroides </i>isolates BVU.10, BTH.8, BCA.26 and/or BCE.71 with Average Normalized Growth values of at least 0.2 in the assay. In the assay, glu80man20, glu100, glu60man40, glu50gal50 and ara100 supported growth of <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, in addition to the Bacteroidetes PDI.6, BVU.10, BTH.8, BCA.26 and/or BCE.71.</div>

<heading id="h-0015">Example 7: Collection of Fecal Samples</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0551" num="0555">Fecal samples were collected by providing subjects with the Fisherbrand Commode Specimen Collection System (Fisher Scientific) and associated instructions for use. Collected samples were stored with ice packs or at −80° C. until processing (McInnes &amp; Cutting, Manual of Procedures for Human Microbiome Project: Core Microbiome Sampling Protocol A, v12.0, 2010, hmpdacc.org/doc/HMP_MOP_Version12_0_072910.pdf). Alternative collection devices may also be used. For example, samples may be collected into the Globe Scientific Screw Cap Container with Spoon (Fisher Scientific) or the OMNIgene-GUT collection system (DNA Genotek, Inc.), which stabilizes microbial DNA for downstream nucleic acid extraction and analysis. Aliquots of fecal samples were stored at −20° C. and −80° C. following standard protocols known to one skilled in the art.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0552" num="0556">To determine the titer of common bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract, fecal samples were collected as described in Example 7 and prepared as a 10% weight/volume suspensions in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Ten-fold serial dilutions were prepared in sterile PBS and plated (100 μL per dilution) to <i>Brucella </i>Blood Agar (Anaerobe Systems; incubated anaerobically to non-selectively titer common member of the gut microbiota, including <i>Bacteroides</i>, or incubated aerobically to non-selectively titer facultative anaerobes such as Proteobacteria). <i>Bacteroides </i>Bile Esculin Agar (Anaerobe Systems; cultured anaerobically to titer <i>Bacteroides fragilis </i>group), Cycloserine-Cefoxitin Fructose Agar (Anaerobe Systems; cultured anaerobically to titer <i>Clostridium difficile</i>), <i>Lactobacillus</i>-MRS Agar (Anaerobe Systems; cultured anaerobically to titer <i>Lactobacillus</i>), Eosin Methylene Blue Agar (Teknova; cultured aerobically to titer <i>Escherichia coli </i>and other Gram-negative enteric bacteria), Bile Esculin Agar (BD; cultured aerobically to titer <i>Enterococcus </i>species), <i>Bifidobacterium </i>Selective Agar (Anaerobe Systems; to titer <i>Bifidobacterium </i>species), or MacConkey Agar (Fisher Scientific; to titer <i>E. coli </i>and other Gram-negative enteric bacteria) may also be used. Plates were incubated at 37° C. under aerobic or anaerobic conditions as appropriate for the target species. After 24-48 hours, colonies were counted and used to back-calculate the concentration of viable cells in the original sample.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0553" num="0557">To non-selectively culture samples containing bacteria collected from a human or laboratory animal model, rich media or agar such as <i>Brucella </i>Blood Agar (Anaerobe Systems), Brain Heart Infusion Broth (Teknova), or Chopped Meat Glucose Broth (Anaerobe Systems) were used. A minimal media formulation such as M9 (Life Technologies) supplemented with amino acids, carbon sources, or other nutrients as needed were used to non-selectively culture bacteria during in vitro assays testing the effects of glycans or other compounds on bacterial populations. Alternatively, other minimal media formulations known to one skilled in the art were used, for example, as reported in Martens et al. (Mucosal Glycan Foraging Enhances Fitness and Transmission of a Saccharolytic Human Gut Bacterial Symbiont, 2008, Cell Host &amp; Microbe, 4:447-457). Alternatively, fecal slurries at a concentration of 0.1%-10% weight/volume in PBS were used in the presence or absence of additional media elements for in vitro assays testing the effects of glycans or other compounds on bacterial populations.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0554" num="0558">The ex vivo assay was designed to determine if glycans can modulate a complex human fecal microbial community. Modulation of the community may induce functional and/or taxa shifts that may affect various host responses that may relate to the protection against or treatment of diseases, including cancer. Fecal samples and slurries were handled in an anaerobic chamber (AS-580, Anaerobe Systems) featuring a palladium catalyst. Glycans glu100, xyl100, man52glu29gal19, and a commercially available control, FOS (Nutraflora FOS; NOW Foods, Bloomingdale Ill.), were prepared at 5% w/v in water, filter-sterilized and added to 96-deep well assay plates for a final concentration of 0.5% w/v, with each glycan assayed in two non-adjacent wells and dextrose and water supplied as positive and negative controls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0555" num="0559">A human fecal sample donation was stored at −80° C. To prepare working stocks the fecal sample was transferred into the anaerobic chamber and allowed to thaw. The fecal sample was prepared to 20% w/v in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 (P0261, Teknova Inc., Hollister, CA), 15% glycerol, centrifuged at 2,000×g, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was suspended in PBS pH 7.4 to 1% w/v fecal slurry. Prepared 1% w/v fecal slurry were contacted with glycans to 500 μL final volume per well, at 37° C. for 18 hours, anaerobically. Genomic DNA was extracted from the fecal samples and variable region 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced (Earth Microbiome Project protocolwww.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/16s/ and Caporaso J G et al. 2012.

<heading id="h-0018">Example 10: Effects of Glycans on Microbial Communities In Vivo in Healthy Human Volunteers</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0557" num="0561">A Randomized, single-blind, cross-over, controlled study was conducted to analyze the effects of glycans on the microbiota of the human GI tract. 45 healthy human volunteers were enrolled in the 35-day study which included a 7 day run-in period prior to randomization. All volunteers were between 18 and 40 years of age and had a BMI between 20 and 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Following the 7 day run-in period, subjects that met eligibility criteria were randomized to one of three treatment groups of 15 subjects each: glu50gal50, glu100 as a syrup, and a commercial FOS control in powder form. Subjects consumed the equivalent of 8 grams dry weight of glycan and FOS once a da-y for 7 days followed by a 7 day washout period. They then consumed the equivalent of 16 grams dry weight of glycan and FOS once a day for 7 days followed by a 7 day washout period. Subjects were instructed to mix the glycan and FOS with 200 ml of tap water prior to consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0558" num="0562">The study identified two classes of taxa responding to glycan treatment (see, Table 15): (1) taxa that are in all or a large percentage of individuals, but respond robustly only in a subset of individuals (e.g. OTU 11 in individuals treated with glu50gal50) and (2) taxa that are found in a small subset of individuals, but robustly respond in all subjects (e.g. OTU 51 in glu100 and glu50gal50). Therapeutic glycans modulated a larger number of OTU than the commercial FOS control: two in FOS and four each in glu100 and glu50gal50. The glycans showed overlapping (OTU 11 and OTU 51) and differential modulation of OTUs (see, Table 15).</div>

For most OTUs growth modulation varies between subjects, some of which show modulation while others don't exhibit a shift in the taxa. For at least one OTU (OTU 51) all subjects hosting the OTU showed a modulation. The microbial community in the subjects was stable during the course of the study. Bacteria that were absent at the beginning of the study did not appear during the course of the study (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> for OTU 51, subjects that host the OTU show growth of the OTU in the GI tract in response to the glycan treatment, often shortly after the begin of consumption of the glycan. Others that do not host the OTU do not show any changes in abundance for OTU upon administration of the glycan. Subjects may be classified as responders and non-responders to glycans and may further be selected for glycan treatment, e.g. on the basis of the presence or absence of particular taxa.</div>

<heading id="h-0019">Example 11: Effect of Glycans on Gene Expression in a Mouse Model</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0564" num="0568">In a study two groups of mice are used. The control group of mice are fed with standard chow, and the different treatment groups of mice are fed with standard chow supplemented with glycans. After 1-30 days, blood samples are drawn from the mice, the mice are sacrificed, and tissues from the intestine, liver, skin, and other sites of interest are collected and stored at −80° C. RNA is isolated from the tissues and converted to cDNA. The GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) is used to analyze the differential expression between the untreated and glycan-treated animals of approximately 14,000 murine genes. The experimental protocol and raw data analysis are performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and standard protocols. The biological function of the differentially expressed genes and their involvement in various processes are obtained from the following databases: RefGene (Reference for genes, proteins and antibodies: refgene.com/), CTD (Comparative Toxicogenomics Database: ctd.mdibl.org/), MGI (Mouse Genomics Informatics: www.informatics.jax.org/), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes: www.genome.jp/kegg/genes.html).

Body weights of the mice did not change significantly throughout the course of the study.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0568" num="0572">Genomic DNA was extracted from the fecal samples and variable region 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced (Earth Microbiome Project protocol www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocol/16s/ and Caporaso J G et al. 2012.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0570" num="0574">The changes in observed shifts with administration of xylose were attributed to an increase in relative abundance of sequences assigned to genus <i>Akkermansia </i>(phylum Verrucomicrobia, p=0.0313, Wilcoxon paired test, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12<i>a</i> </figref>), and genus <i>Blautia </i>(phylum Firmicutes, family Lachnospiraceae, p=0.0313, Wilcoxon paired test, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12<i>b</i> </figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0571" num="0575">The most prominent <i>Akkermansia </i>species in the mammalian gut is <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>. Its preferred energy source is host intestinal mucin. Consumption of a low fiber diet and high intake of simple sugars and fat results in decreased mucus production (British Journal of Nutrition/Volume 102/Issue 01/July 2009, pp 117-125, Quantitative Imaging of Gut Microbiota Spatial Organization, Earle K A et al, Cell Host Microbe. 2015 Oct. 14; 18(4):478-88). Thinning of intestinal mucus may result in increased gut permeability and translocation of microorganisms or their components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which induce inflammation. LPS levels are increased upon consumption of high fat diet in rodents which then develop metabolic syndrome (Metabolic endotoxemia initiates obesity and insulin resistance, Cani P D et al, Diabetes. 2007 July; 56(7):1761-72).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0572" num="0576">Bacteroidetes, may induce the growth of <i>Akkermansia</i>. For example, colonization of germ free mice with <i>Bacteroides </i>thetaiotaomicron induces mucus production by intestinal goblet cells (Wrzosek et al. BMC Biology 2013 11:). This may create a favorable environment for <i>Akkermansia </i>growth. Consumption of mucus by <i>Akkermansia </i>may stimulate increased mucus production and play a role in the restoration of the gut barrier that prevents leaking of microbial endotoxin LPS. Decreased endotoxemia reduces inflammation Inflammation precedes most cancers. Bronchitis, colitis, cervicitis, gastritis, and hepatitis, for example, reflect inflammation of the bronchus, colon, cervix, stomach, and liver, respectively. Many cancers, especially solid tumors, appear to be preceded by inflammation of a given organ. For instance, people who smoke cigarette develop bronchitis, and 15% to 20% of these people develop lung cancer (Wingo et al. Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1973-1996, with a special section on lung cancer and tobacco smoking. J Natl Cancer Inst 1999; 91:675-90). Similarly, people who have colitis are at high risk of developing colon cancer (Itzkowitz, Inflammation and cancer IV. Colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel disease: the role of inflammation. Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 2004; 287:G7-1734). Infection with <i>Helicobacter pylori </i>can induce gastritis, which in its chronic form can lead to gastric cancer (Peter, <i>Helicobacter pylori </i>and gastric cancer: the causal relationship. Digestion 2007; 75:25-35).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0573" num="0577"> <i>Akkermansia muciniphila </i>metabolites include the SCFA propionate which is also thought to modulate inflammation (see, Example 15). Glycan therapeutics when administered in an effective amount may modulate bacterial species, such as, e.g., <i>Akkermansia </i>that play a role in the reduction of inflammation.</div>

A majority of genes that were down-regulated in mouse host treated with glycans are involved in inflammatory responses: complement pathway, apoptosis, antigen presentation, oxidative stress, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton remodeling. The data suggest that altered genetic regulation in response to glycan treatment decreased the inflammation which can be a requisite for the development of cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0579" num="0583">Genes that were upregulated in mice treated with glycans were involved in Notch signaling and Wnt signaling pathways, which control cell proliferation, migration and tissue regeneration. This could be a sign of more active epithelial regeneration induced by functional shifts of the microbiota as a result of the glycan treatment.</div>
<heading id="h-0022">Example 14: In Vitro Co-Culture Models to Test the Effect of Glycans on Host Responses to Bacterial Communities at Intestinal Sites</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0580" num="0584">Bacteria can elicit both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses from host (mammalian) cells, and different bacterial species can elicit different host responses. The immune system and pro- and anti-inflammatory responses are linked to diseases, disorders or pathological conditions related to, e.g., immune imbalances, nutritional imbalances which can lead to and may be associated with cancers. Preparations of glycans are used to alter the bacterial population to elicit a desired host response. An in vitro co-culture model is used to measure the host responses elicited by bacterial populations grown in the presence of glycans. Glycans that promote bacterial populations that elicit beneficial host responses or minimize detrimental host responses are selected using this assay.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0581" num="0585">Epithelial cell lines or tissues from the intestine are used in a co-culture model (Haller D, Bode C, Hammes W P, Pfeifer A M A, Schiffrin E J, Blum S, 2000. Non-pathogenic bacteria elicit a differential cytokine response by intestinal epithelial cell/leucocyte co-cultures. Gut. 47:79-97) (Borruel et al., 2003. Effects of nonpathogenic bacteria on cytokine secretion by human intestinal mucosa. Am J Gastroenterology. 98:865-870). Human enterocyte-like CaCO-2 cells are seeded at a density of 2.5×10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml on 25 mm cell culture inserts (0.4 μm nucleopore size; Becton Dickinson). The inserts are placed into 6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) and cultured 18-22 days at 37° C./10% CO<sub>2 </sub>in DMEM (glutamine, high glucose; Amimed) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (56° C., 30 minutes; Amimed), 1% MEM non-essential amino acids (Gibco BRL), 10 μg/ml gentamycin (Gibco BRL), and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin (10 000 IU/ml/10 000 UG/ml; Gibco BRL). The cell culture medium is changed every second day until the cells are fully differentiated. Alternatively, a 3D reconstructed tissue model produced from normal, human cell-derived small intestine epithelial and endothelial cells and fibrobasts (Epilntestinal model; MatTek Corporation, Ashland, Mass.) is used. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) is determined using a MultiCell-ERS voltmeter/ohmmeter. Tissue culture inserts are washed twice with prewarmed antibiotic-free medium prior to challenge with bacterial cultures. Separately, bacterial cultures are grown in the presence of preparations of glycan. After 16-24 hours of growth in the presence of glycans, the bacterial suspensions are prepared in antibiotic-free medium and 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>8 </sup>CFU are added to confluent cell or tissue cultures. The co-cultures are incubated at 37° C. for 4-24 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0582" num="0586">At the conclusion of the co-incubation period, the supernatant is collected and analyzed for inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines including IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF, IL-8, RANTES, IL-10, TGF-β, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-23. This analysis is performed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or other comparable quantification technique (e.g., Luminex Assay; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.) following standard protocols. To analyze a broader range of responses, gene expression (e.g., by microarray) or transcriptomic (e.g., by RNA-Seq) analysis is performed by lysing the cells, purifying RNA, and following standard protocols. This procedure is used to analyze the expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, immunomodulatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and other relevant host responses.</div>
<heading id="h-0023">Example 15: Effect of Glycans on Microbial SCFA Metabolite Production In Vitro</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0583" num="0587">An in vitro assay was performed to assess the production of short chain fatty acids by gut commensal bacteria cultured with the glycan glu80man20 or commercially available FOS as a carbon source. Strains were handled under strictly anaerobic conditions in an AS-580 anaerobic chamber (Anaerobe Systems) using pre-reduced reagents and materials. The Bacteroidete <i>Bacteroides uniformis </i>(ATCC 8492) “BUN.80” was tested in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 15 mM sodium chloride, 8.5 mM ammonium sulfate, 4 mM L-cysteine, 1.9 μM hematin, 200 μM L-histidine, 100 μM magnesium chloride, 1.4 μM iron sulfate heptahydrate, 50 μM calcium chloride, 1 μg/mL vitamin K3 and 5 ng/mL vitamin B12 (Martens E C et al. Cell Host &amp; Microbe 2008; 4, 447-457). The Lachnospiracea <i>Dorea longicatena </i>(DSM 13814) “DLO.76” was tested in 900 mg/L sodium chloride, 26 mg/L calcium chloride dihydrate, 20 mg/L magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 10 mg/L manganese chloride tetrahydrate, 40 mg/L ammonium sulfate, 4 mg/L iron sulfate heptahydrate, 1 mg/L cobalt chloride hexahydrate, 300 mg/L potassium phosphate dibasic, 1.5 g/L sodium phosphate dibasic, 5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.125 mg/L biotin, 1 mg/L pyridoxine, 1 m/L pantothenate, 75 mg/L histidine, 75 mg/L glycine, 75 mg/L tryptophan, 150 mg/L arginine, 150 mg/L methionine, 150 mg/L threonine, 225 mg/L valine, 225 mg/L isoleucine, 300 mg/L leucine, 400 mg/L cysteine, and 450 mg/L proline (Theriot C M et al. Nat Commun. 2014; 5:3114), supplemented with 10% (v/v) Chopped Meat Glucose broth (Anaerobe Systems). Bacteria were exposed to either glycan glu80man20 or FOS at 0.5% (w/v) final and incubated at 37° C. for 39-50 hours. Following incubation, cells were pelleted from 1.5 mL aliquots of cultures in duplicate by centrifugation at 18,000×g for five minutes, the supernatant was sterilized through a 0.22 um polyethersulfone filter, and the supernatant was stored at −80° C. or on dry ice until it was analyzed. Short chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis was performed on the filtered culture supernatants using a cold extraction of short chain fatty acids, measured by EI-CGMS without derivatization. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> summarizes the results obtained. In the assay, cultures of Bacteroidete BUN.80 and Lachnospiracea DLO.76 grown with either glycan glu80man20 or FOS produced supernatants with total SCFA concentrations in excess of 5,000 μM. Acetate was the SCFA produced in the highest concentrations in the assay, and propionate was produced at the second-highest levels. Butyrate, isovalerate, valerate, hexanoate and octanoate were also detected in the assay.</div>
<heading id="h-0024">Example 16: Effect of Glycans on Microbial SCFA Metabolite Production In Vivo</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0584" num="0588">To assess the production of short chain fatty acids by gut commensal bacteria upon glycan administration in vivo, short chain fatty acid analysis was performed on 30-50 mg of cecal contents from mice fed either a High Fat diet (Research Diets D12492), Normal Mouse chow (Research Diets D12450), or High Fat diet+glycan using a GC-based method. High fat diets are associated with pro-inflammatory states and the development of colonic cancers. Treatment with glycans (glu100 at 6% or man52glu29gal19 at 1%) reduced the abundance of both butyrate and propionate in the cecal contents of mice compared to high fat diet alone (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). As shown in Table 17, glycans reduced the levels of certain SCFAs in this study.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0586" num="0590">The decrease in short chain fatty acids due to glycan treatment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and Table 17) may increase the propensity of T cells that differentiate in the gastrointestinal tract to become inflammatory T cells (e.g. Th17) that can traffic to tumor sites and drive inflammatory responses against the tumor. SCFAs constitute an important energy source for colonocytes and also function as signaling molecules, modulating intestinal inflammation, and metabolism. SCFAs, in particular acetate, propionate, and butyrate, favor histone H3K27 acetylation and increased expression of the Treg-specific transcription factor gene, Foxp3, thereby boosting Treg development in the gastrointestinal tract (Furusawa et al., 2013. Commensal microbe-derived butyrate induces the differentiation of colonic regulatory T cells. Nature 504, 446-450). These Tregs are absent in germfree mice that lack both commensal bacteria and their metabolites, such as the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate, and are necessary for their development (Arpaia et al., 2013 Metabolites produced by commensal bacteria promote peripheral regulatory T-cell generation. Nature 504, 451-455; Atarashi et al., 2011 Induction of colonic regulatory T cells by indigenous <i>Clostridium </i>species. Science 331, 337-341; Furusawa et al., 2013). The modulation of T cell function by the microbiota, through SCFAs, toward tolerance (IL-10 secretion) rather than inflammation (IL-17 secretion) has also been proposed for IL-10/IL-17 double-secreting T cells. Thus, T cells can switch from a tolerance to inflammatory phenotype and vice versa based on the presence or absence of SCFAs (Ruff and Kriegel, 2015, Autoimmune host-microbiota interaction at barrier sites and beyond. Trends Mol. Med. 21, 233-244), and the decrease of SCFAs driven by glycans likely leads to an increase in inflammatory T cells. It is also well-appreciated in the art that Th17 cells primed in the intestine could traffic to peripheral sites, undergo functional plasticity, and mediate inflammation: A number of mouse models of chronic inflammation residing in distant, non-mucosal tissues, where an impact of the gut microbiota was demonstrated, outlined the pro-inflammatory role of intestinal Th17 cells (Lee et al., 2011, Proinflammatory T-cell responses to gut microbiota promote experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108 (Suppl 1), 4615-4622; Wu et al., 2010, Gut-residing segmented filamentous bacteria drive autoimmune arthritis via T helper 17 cells. Immunity 32, 815-827; Yang et al., 2014, Focused specificity of intestinal TH17 cells towards commensal bacterial antigens. Nature 510, 152-156). It has been shown in the art that an increase in inflammatory T cells or increase in activity of inflammatory T cells in a tumor can drive improved control over cancer (Sharma and Alison, 2015, Immune checkpoint targeting in cancer therapy: toward combination strategies with curative potential. Cell 161, 205-214).). The decreased generation of tolerogenic T cells may also lead to an activation of inflammatory functions against pathogens or infections resulting from decreased inflammatory immune function. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses are linked to diseases, disorders or pathological conditions related to, e.g., immune imbalances, nutritional imbalances and cancers.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0590" num="0594">The data suggest that glycan treatment modulates the total metabolite output of the GI tract microbiota in the animal including SCFAs (see Example 16) and bile acids (see Example 18). Metabolic changes and potential links to the immune system and inflammatory responses are thought to play a role in diseases, disorders or pathological conditions related to, e.g., immune imbalances, nutritional imbalances and cancers.</div>
<heading id="h-0026">Example 18: Effect of Glycans on Bile Acid Production In Vivo</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0591" num="0595">The production of certain bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid (DOC) and Lithocholic acid (LCA) which are associated with a high fat diet have been linked to cancer development. Deoxycholic acid (DOC) is secondary bile acid produced solely by the 7a-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids carried out by anaerobic gut bacteria from the genus <i>Clostridium</i>. DOC can be considered as a microbial co-carcinogen that not only contributes to colon carcinogenesis, but that also participates to the development of liver cancer, presumably by inducing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype of hepatic stellate cells, thereby stimulating pro-inflammatory and tumor-promoting reactions in a mouse model of obesity-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (Yoshimoto et al., 2013, Obesity-induced gut microbial metabolite promotes liver cancer through senescence secretome. Nature 499, 97-101). DOC may well cooperate with other bacterial products, including LPS, in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma (Dapito et al., 2012, Promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma by the intestinal microbiota and TLR4. Cancer Cell 21, 504-516). Numerous other studies have shown that DOC induces apoptosis in colon cells in short-term cultures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0592" num="0596">Bile acid analysis was performed on 30-50 mg of cecal contents from mice fed either a High Fat diet (Research Diets D12492), Normal Mouse chow (Research Diets D12450), or High Fat diet+glycan using Biocrates LC-MS based Bile Acid Kit. Glycan treatment significantly altered the bile acid composition of the mouse cecum (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, Table 20), while total bile acid pool size did not change.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0594" num="0598">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, glycan treatment resulted in a reduction of (A) DCA (deoxycholic acid) and (B) LCA (lithocholic acid) compared to high fat control. The reduction in bile acids resulting from glycan treatment may prevent the development of cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0595" num="0599">Many undiscovered links between other bile acids and the development of cancer may exist. For example, the concentration of Glycodeoxycholic acid, Glycolithocholic acid, Alpha-Muricholic acid, Beta-Muricholic acid, Taurocholic acid, and Taurochenodeoxycholic acid, which are all significantly altered by glycan treatment (Table 20) may affect cancer development. Furthermore, population-based studies have shown that subjects who consume high-fat and high-beef foods display elevated levels of fecal secondary BAs, mostly DOC and LCA, as do patients diagnosed with colonic carcinomas. Glycan treatment may modulate the bile acids present in the gastrointestinal tract of subjects consuming a high fat diet to prevent cancer development. Furthermore, the decrease in inflammation resulting from alterations of bile acids may systemically decrease inflammatory cell numbers across the body and thereby may influence diseases that are related to aberrant immune inflammatory activation, e.g., auto-immune diseases and other diseases related to immune imbalances and nutritional imbalances.</div>
<heading id="h-0027">Example 19: Effect of Glycans on Chemotherapy-Induced Toxicity and Immune Responses In Vivo</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0596" num="0600">This study was conducted to elucidate the effects of glycan therapeutics on chemotherapy-induced toxicity in a modified rat model (Fukudome et al., Diamine oxidase as a marker of intestinal mucosal injury and the effect of soluble dietary fiber on gastrointestinal tract toxicity after intravenous 5-fluorouracil treatment in rats, Med Mol Morphol. 2014 June; 47(2):100-7). Off-target toxicity of chemotherapeutics including diarrhea, oral and gastrointestinal mucositis, and leukopenia and neutropenia, can limit dose and frequency of treatment, and can cause significant suffering and decreased quality of life in affected patients. In these studies, normal rats were treated with glycans and the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), then monitored for manifestations of toxicity including weight loss, diarrhea, and hematological effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0597" num="0601">In this study, 75 male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) were randomized into five groups of fifteen animals each, and each animal was individually housed. The rats were allowed to acclimate for four days following arrival, and starting on Day −7, animals in four glycan-treated groups began treatment with novel glycan compositions (glu100, glu50/gal50, glu33/gal33/fuc33, or man100) at 2.5% wt/wt ad libitum in drinking water; treatment with glycans continued through Day 9. During this same period, animals in the control group received plain water. Beginning on Day 0, all rats were dosed with 5-FU (100 mg/kg in 0.2 mL/100 g) via intraperitoneal injection once daily through Day 3. Daily, rats were weighed, monitored for survival, and assessed visually for the presence of diarrhea. Animals exhibiting weight loss greater than 30% were euthanized. Diarrhea severity was scored on a scale of 0-4 as follows: a score of 0 indicates a normal, well-formed pellet; a score of 1 indicates a loose stool that is soft but stays in shape; a score of 2 indicates a loose stool of abnormal form with excess moisture; a score of 3 indicates watery stool or diarrhea; and a score of 4 indicates bloody diarrhea. On Day 5, non-terminal blood samples were collected via retro-orbital bleed from 7-10 rats/group and a complete blood count was performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0598" num="0602">While there were no significant differences in body weight or diarrhea score between control and glycan-treated rats in this study, administration of glu/gal/fuc significantly increased white blood cell count on Day 5 (p&lt;0.05) compared to 5-FU treatment alone (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0599" num="0603">Treatment with 5-FU elicits a number of off-target toxicities, including neutropenia and leukopenia. In this study, treatment of rats with glu/gal/fuc increased the white blood cell count compared to 5-FU treatment alone. In an inflammatory response, white blood cells (leukocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, or monocytes) are recruited to the site of injury in response to damage, e.g. to the intestinal mucosa, caused by the 5-FU insult. A potential mechanism for the increase in WBCs by glu/gal/fuc may be through direct or indirect action upon the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) via the gut microbiota. Bacterially-derived SCFAs have demonstrated both pro- and anti-inflammatory actions, depending upon the cell type affected; SCFAs may inhibit leukocyte function and migration, but may also increase accumulation of neutrophils (Vinolo et al., Regulation of inflammation by short chain fatty acids, Nutrients. 2011 October; 3(10)). While further analysis is required to determine the subpopulation(s) of white blood cells affected by glu/gal/fuc, the increase in WBCs seen with glu/gal/fuc may confer an increased ability to react to bacterial infiltration across the gut membrane and thus ameliorate some of the toxic effects of 5-FU treatment. In this way, glu/gal/fuc or similar glycans may decrease the presentation or severity of side effects and possibly prevent the need to decrease 5-FU dose or frequency. Several drug toxicities are also related to or associated with immune imbalances and nutritional imbalances apart from cancer.</div>
<heading id="h-0028">Example 20: Effect of Glycans on Drug Toxicity and GI Tract Motility In Vivo</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0600" num="0604">This study was conducted to analyze the effects of glycan therapeutics in a mouse model of opioid-induced constipation. In this model, normal mice are dosed with glycan or control for several days and then administered a dose of morphine sufficient to produce decreased gastrointestinal (GI) transit and colonic propulsion (Coates et al. 2006 Neurogastroenterol Motil 18:464-471). In humans, morphine and related opiate drugs are known to cause constipation. They act on neurons in the myenteric plexus as mu-opioid receptor agonists, leading to decreased GI motility and propulsion. The proportion of the US adult population who take opiates chronically (non-cancer patients), is roughly 4%. In an observational study of patients on opiates for chronic pain, 47% experienced constipation (Tuteja et al. 2015 Neurogastroenterol Motil 22: 424-430). There is evidence that chronic constipation can predispose individuals to benign GI neoplasms and colorectal cancer. The hypothesis for this is that increased transit times allow for greater exposure of the GI mucosa to carcinogenic agents such as some bile acids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0601" num="0605">Approximately 30% of cancer patients undergoing treatment/surgery and 90% of advanced stage patients experience significant cancer pain and are most often treated with opioids (Levy M H, Samuel T A. 2005. Semin Oncol. 32:179-93), which in turn cause constipation in up to 90% of patients (Ahmedzai et al. 2015. Supp Care Cancer 23:823-830). Despite this side effect, opioids are the most efficacious analgesics in this setting. Dose limitation of opioids in cancer patients due to side-effects may result in a lack of adequate pain management.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0602" num="0606">Chemotherapeutic agents themselves can cause constipation. <i>Vinca </i>alkaloids, platinum agents, thalidomide and hormonal agents result in a high incidence of constipation (Gibson, Rachel J., and Dorothy M K Keefe. “Cancer chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea and constipation: mechanisms of damage and prevention strategies.” Supportive Care in Cancer 14.9 (2006): 890-900).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0603" num="0607">Several drug toxicities affecting GI motility (e.g. causing constipation or diarrhea) in cancer are also related to or associated with other immune imbalances and nutritional imbalances. In this study, mice (male ICR; CD-1, 6-7 weeks old, 25-30 grams; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.) were individually housed. Mice were treated with either commercially-available fiber polydextrose (PDX; “Litesse”, Dupont Danisco, Surrey, United Kingdom) or xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS; “Llife-Oligo XOS”, Bio Nutrition, Inc., Island Park, N.Y.) or novel glycan compositions (xyl100, ara100, glu100); all administered at 1% ad libitum in drinking water for 11 days. A control group received plain drinking water. On day 12, all mice were administered morphine at a dose of 3 mg/kg subcutaneously to reduce colonic propulsion. One control group of mice were treated with naloxone, a mu-receptor inverse agonist 30 minutes prior to morphine administration. Naloxone is known to counteract the action of morphine at the mu-receptor. Colonic propulsion was assessed as follows: thirty minutes post morphine dosing, a 3 mm glass bead was inserted at a depth of 2 cm into the distal colon through each mouse's anus. Mice were observed for 30 minutes for expulsion of the bead, and the time in seconds to expulsion was noted. A cutoff of 30 minutes was used as a maximum time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0604" num="0608">Administration of naloxone, XOS and PDX had significant effects on the time to bead expulsion, with overall latency decreased (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). Xyl100-treated animals had an overall average decrease in expulsion time, but this did not reach significance. Naloxone, XOS and xyl100-treated groups, fell into two groups, those mice that responded and ones that responded significantly less to the treatments. This effect was seen less in the PDX-treated animals. Seventy-five percent of mice in the vehicle-treated group reached the maximal cutoff time. Ara100 and glu100 had a non-statistically significant effect on bead expulsion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0605" num="0609">A second analysis was performed using a reduction in expulsion of &gt;25% of maximum expulsion time as a cutoff to define a “responder” (1350 seconds)). Using this arbitrary cutoff, naloxone had 6/8 mice respond to treatment, PDX, 7 had responders, XOS had 5 responders, and xyl100 and ara100 had 4 responders each, and glu100 and vehicle had 1 responder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0606" num="0610">A third analysis was performed to determine the average time to bead expulsion in the responder versus non-responder animals in each treatment group (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20<i>a </i>and 20<i>b</i> </figref>). A cutoff time for bead expulsion was set at 1800 seconds. In this mouse model of colonic propulsion, naloxone had the expected effect of reversing the effects of morphine, as it is a direct inverse agonist, competing with morphine for mu-receptor occupancy and blocking its known effects on gastrointestinal motility. XOS and PDX have been shown to have efficacy in clinical constipation settings (Shimada et al, 2015 J. Nutr Sci Vitaminol 61:345-353; Tateyama et al., 2005 J Nutr Sci Vitaminol 51:445-448), and had positive effects in this mouse study. Xyl100, XOS and naloxone had an effects in this model and PDX and ara100 had similar effects as well, especially when the group of responders was assessed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20<i>b</i> </figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0607" num="0611">These results, obtained in a widely used animal model for colonic propulsion suggest that glycan therapeutics reduced morphine's effect of decreased colonic motility, as measured by colonic propulsion. Selected glycans appear to increase colonic propulsion in animals responsive to treatment, whereas some animals were not responsive.</div>
<heading id="h-0029">Example 21: Effect of Glycans on Cancer Development in a Mouse Melanoma Model</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0608" num="0612">To study efficacy of the therapeutic glycans described herein in the treatment of cancer, an animal model of melanoma was chosen. In this model, mice usually develop tumors within 7-21 days and a treatment effect can be observed by measuring the kinetics of tumor growth. For example, a treatment effect can be in the form of delaying tumor growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0609" num="0613">Melanoma is a cancer of the skin, but is mostly observed in skin exposed to sunlight. Melanoma is most commonly diagnosed in non-Hispanic whites; 1 per 100,000 in African Americans, 4 per 100,000 in Hispanics, and 25 per 100,000 in non-Hispanic whites. The number of deaths in 2015 was 2.7 per 100,000 men and women per year. The rates of melanoma have been rising for at least 30 years. The estimated 5-year survival rate for patients whose melanoma is detected early is about 98 percent in the U.S. The survival rate falls to 63 percent when the disease reaches the lymph nodes, and 17 percent when the disease metastasizes to distant organs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0610" num="0614">New checkpoint inhibitor therapies have improved the outlook for patients with metastatic melanoma. Anti-PD-1 therapies (e.g. nivolumab and pembrolizumab) have been shown to produce overall response rates on the order of 30% in metastatic melanoma patients (nivolumab FDA label and pembrolizumab FDA label). Combination studies of anti-PD-1 therapy with anti-CTLA4 therapy have shown 60% overall response rate (compared to 11% with anti-CTLA4 therapy alone) and a median progression-free survival of 8.9 months (nivolumab FDA label). Larkin et al. showed median progression-free survival among stage III and IV metastatic melanoma patients of 11.5 months for combination therapy of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) compared to 6.9 months for nivolumab alone, and 2.9 months for ipilimumab alone (DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1504030).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0611" num="0615">Some commensal bacterial species may be implicated in regulating gut immunity and responses to immunotherapies in physically distant tumors (Vétizou M et al. Anticancer immunotherapy by CTLA-4 blockade relies on the gut microbiota. Science 2015 Nov. 27; 350:1079). Sivan et al. showed decreased tumor growth kinetics of B16 melanoma cells in mice by combining bifidobacteria species with anti-PD-L1 therapy (Sivan A et al. Commensal <i>Bifidobacterium </i>promotes antitumor immunity and facilitates anti-PD-L1 efficacy. Science 2015 Nov. 27; 350:1084). Therapeutic glycans capable of modulating the microbiota (such as, e.g., <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, Bacteroidales, Clostridiales) may be useful in cancer therapy, in some cases by promoting anti-tumor immunity, in some cases by increased melanoma-specific effector T-cell responses. Therapeutic glycans combined with existing immunotherapies may produce an additive or synergistic effect. Cancer models, such as the animal melanoma model are informative with respect to efficacy of agents for the treatment of immune imbalances and/or nutritional imbalances.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0617" num="0621"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows tumor growth curves for Group 1 mice that received vehicle treatment (gray long-dashed line) and Group 2 mice that received Man100 in the drinking water at 1% from 5 days prior to tumor inoculation through the duration of the study (black solid line). As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the tumor growth curves were suppressed in mice that received man100 in the drinking water (Group 2) compared to the vehicle control (Group 1).Additionally, mice receiving anti-PD-L1 (Group 3) showed superior tumor growth suppression (gray shortest-dashed line), and addition of the bifidobacteria mix (Group 4, gray medium-dashed line) did not show significant tumor growth changes compared to Group 1. This effect was determined to be statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) on days 21, 24, 28, and 31 based on one-way ANOVA comparing Group 2 to Group 1. Man100 inducing a delay in tumor growth in this model suggests enhanced immune control of the tumors throughout the duration of treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0618" num="0622"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows the spider plots of the individual tumor growth curves for Group 1 (vehicle control, thin gray dotted lines), Group 2 (Man100, thick black solid lines), and Group 3 ( ), anti-PD-L1, thick gray solid lines).By day 24, the tumor growth in most of the animals in Group 1 became exponential, whereas in Group 2 and Group 3, the exponential phase was delayed until days 28 or 31 for almost all of the animals. Since delay of tumor growth was achieved with both man100 and anti-PD-L1, but both groups relapsed, it suggests the possibility of additive or synergistic effects of combining man100 with anti-PD-L1 to suppress tumor growth or induce robust tumor rejection. Man100 could also be combined with other therapies to produce an additive or synergistic effect.</div>

<heading id="h-0032">Example 24: Properties of the Glycan Therapeutic in the Treatment, Co-Treatment and Prevention of Different Oncological Processes/Diseases</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0630" num="0634">In a group of mice that take a selected test glycan therapeutic a repression of the expression of oncogenes jun, myc and fos may be detected with respect to the control group. The jun and fos products are transcription factors that dimerize to form the transcription complex called AP-1 (Activating Protein-1). AP-1 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of genes induced by growth factors and tumor promoters. Overexpression of oncogenes Jun and/or fos is associated with several cancers such as breast, ovarian, colon, osteosarcoma, cervical, lung and bladder cancer. Therefore, AP-1 is used as a target for chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. Myc oncogene product is a protein that regulates the expression of the transcription factor E2F and phosphatase responsible for activation of Cdc cyclins, which are involved in cell cycle regulation. The myc oncogene is overexpressed in many human cancers, including pancreatic, cervical, breast and colon cancer. Myc oncogene product is also used as target for cancer treatment. A study in humans showed that in the intestinal mucosa there is a repression in the expression of oncogenes jun, fos and myc after infusion of the membrane with a strain of <i>Lactobacillus</i>. In a group of mice that take a selected test glycan therapeutic a repression on the expression of the gene Adamts1 (a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase (reprolysin type) with thrombospondin type 1 motif) may be detected with respect to the control group. Adamts1 gene product is a protein that has a metalloproteinase domain and disintegrin domain. This protein is involved in inflammatory processes and the development of cancer cachexia as tested in animal models of colon cancer. It has been demonstrated overexpression of Adamts1 gene in breast cancer with high metastatic activity. It has been speculated that overexpression of this gene might promote tumor growth by recruiting fibroblasts. In a group of mice that take a selected test glycan therapeutic a repression on the expression of the gene ATF3 (activating transcription factor 3) may be detected with respect to the control group. ATF3 gene product is a transcription factor expressed in conditions of stress and DNA damage in various tissues. In many breast tumors has been reported overexpression of ATF3. This protein is used as a marker of prostate cancer since its involvement has been shown in developing this type of cancer and is therefore a potential therapeutic target. In a group of mice that take a selected test glycan therapeutic an activation on the expression of Ddit4 gene (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4) may be detected with respect to the control group. Ddit4 gene product is a protein called RTP801 or REDD1, which inhibits the pathway mTOR/S6K1, involved in cell proliferation. Inhibitors of this route are being evaluated as cancer therapy. In mice has been described that the gene Ddti4 deficiency promotes tumor growth, while in humans has been described repression of the gene in various cancers. In a group of mice that take a selected test glycan therapeutic a repression on the expression of Egr1 gene (early growth response 1) may be detected with respect to the control group. The Egr1 gene product is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes and its involvement has been demonstrated in cell growth and survival of prostate cancer. In animal models of prostate cancer has shown that lack of Egr1 gene retards tumor growth. In a group of mice that take a selected test glycan therapeutic a repression on the expression of Sox9 gene (SRY (sex Determining Region Y)-box 9) may be detected with respect to the control group. The Sox9 gene produces a protein that acts as a transcription factor with DNA-binding domain type HMG (High Mobility Group). It has been shown an implication of Sox9 gene product in the proliferation of pancreatic cancer and overexpression of the same in different cell lines of colon cancer. In a group of mice that take a selected test glycan therapeutic a repression of the expression of interleukin 1 alpha gene (IL1a) may be detected with respect to the control group. The IL1a is a cytokine involved in inflammatory processes. The IL1a gene is overexpressed in various cancers, including lung cancer, colon and melanoma. In colon cancer IL1a stimulates the cell migration and angiogenesis and its expression is induced by prostaglandin E2. In a study in humans showed that in the intestinal mucosa occurs a repression in the IL1a gene expression after the infusion of the membrane with a strain of <i>Lactobacillus</i>. In a group of mice that take a selected test glycan therapeutic an activation of the expression of Gadd45b gene (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45 beta) and Gadd45q gene (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45 gamma) may be detected with respect to the control group. The products of Gadd45 g and Gadd45b genes are proteins related with cell cycle control. In mice models of melanoma have been shown that a lack of function of Gadd45b produces higher tumor growth. The product of this gene is required for activation of p38 kinase. The p38 protein is involved in tumor suppression. The expression of Gadd45 g and Gadd45b genes is repressed in various cancers.</div>
