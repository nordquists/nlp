<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation application of U.S. Pat. No. 9,642,677 entitled “Oral Irrigator with Massage Mode,” filed on Mar. 14, 2013 and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to health and personal hygiene equipment and methods of controlling such equipment. More particularly, the present invention relates to oral irrigators and methods of controlling such equipment.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Oral irrigators typically are used to clean a user's teeth and gums by discharging a pressurized fluid stream into a user's oral cavity. The fluid impacts the teeth and gums to remove debris. Often, some users may prefer one pressure level whereas others may prefer another pressure. However, typically, the pressure level may be determined by characteristics of the pump and motor and may not be variable between users. For example, certain flow characteristics, such as pressure, are determined by a mechanical valve, cavity or fluid passage size, or the like, which may not be altered based on particular user preferences and may be complicated to manufacture.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">One example may take the form of a handheld oral irrigator general includes an irrigating device, such as an oral irrigator or a nasal irrigator. The irrigating device includes a pump and a motor connected to the pump and configured to selectively drive the pump. Additionally, the irrigating device includes a massage module in communication with the motor. During a normal mode, the pump has a first pulse rate and during a massage mode, the massage module provides a massage control signal to the motor, causing the pump to have a second pulse rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Another example may take the form of a method for varying a pulse rate for an oral cleaning device. The method includes activating a motor connected to pump; determining by a processing element whether a massage mode should be activated; if the massage mode is activated, providing a massage signal to the motor, causing a massage pulse rate output by the pump; and if the massage mode is not activated, providing a normal signal to the motor, causing a normal pulse rate output by the pump.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Yet another example may take the form of an oral irrigator. The oral irrigator includes a reservoir defining a fluid cavity, a pump in fluid communication with the fluid cavity, and a motor connected to the pump and configured to selectively activate the pump. The oral irrigator may also include a handle in fluid communication with the pump and a signal generator in communication with the motor and configured to selectively vary a control signal provided to the motor to vary one or more output characteristics of the motor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example, an oral irrigator including a reservoir, a tip in fluid communication with the reservoir, a pump in fluid communication with the tip and the reservoir, where the motor drives the pump is disclosed. The oral irrigator also includes a control module electrically coupled to the motor to vary an output of the motor. During a normal mode, the control module drives the motor to output a normal pulse rate, a normal flow rate, and a normal fluid pressure as the fluid exits the tip and during a massage mode, the control module drives the motor to output a massage pulse rate, a massage flow rate, and a massage fluid pressure as the fluid exits the tip. The massage pulse rate is lower than the normal pulse rate, the massage fluid pressure is lower than the normal fluid pressure, and the massage fluid pressure is lower than the normal fluid pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another example, an oral irrigation device including a fluid reservoir; a reciprocating pump in fluid communication with the fluid reservoir; a tip in fluid communication with the pump; a motor operably connected to the pump, wherein the motor drives the pump to pump fluid from the fluid reservoir to the tip; a mechanically adjustable valve that varies one or more fluid path characteristics of a flow path between the reservoir and the tip to change an outlet fluid pressure of fluid exiting the tip; and a processing element in electrical communication with the motor. The processing element varies performs the following operations: responsive to receiving a first user input, the processing element varies a voltage applied to the motor to vary a fluid output pressure of the fluid exiting the tip; and responsive to receiving a second user input, the processing element varies a frequency applied to the motor to vary a fluid pulse rate of the fluid exiting the tip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">While multiple examples are disclosed, still other examples of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which shows and describes illustrative examples of the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of modifications in various aspects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Some examples of the present disclosure include an irrigating device, such as an oral irrigator, having a massage module. The massage module may be configured to vary one or more characteristics of a fluid stream to create a fluid flow that may massage a user's gums, as well as enhance user's comfort as the user cleans his or her teeth or gums. The oral irrigator may include a motor and a pump connected to and controlled by the motor. The pump is fluidly connected to a fluid supply and pumps fluid from the supply to an outlet (such as a tip). The massage module may also be in communication with the motor and may provide one or more control signals to the motor to vary one or more characteristics of the motor, such as speed, power, or torque. Because the motor is connected to the pump, as the massage module varies the speed or other characteristic of the motor, the output characteristics of the pump may be correspondingly varied. The output characteristics of the pump may be varied based on a fluid flow that may “massage” a user's gums, such as a pulsed output where the fluid pulses (the flow intermittently turns on an off). In another example, the massage module may vary the outlet fluid pressure of the oral irrigator during massage mode, e.g., may reduce the outlet pressure as compared to clean mode. In this example, the fluid pulse rate may remain substantially the same in both clean mode and massage mode or may also be varied along with the pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, the oral irrigator may include a cleaning or normal mode and a massage mode. During the cleaning mode, the oral irrigator may include a relatively steady fluid flow or may include a fluid flow having a slight pulse (e.g., due to a mechanical characteristics of the pump). During the massage mode, the massage module may vary the fluid pulsing length and/or pressure. For example, the massage module may vary a control signal to selectively vary the power level provided the motor. In a specific implementation, the power may be selectively activated and deactivated, which may cause the motor to produce intermittent motion resulting in varying the output of the pump. The pump may be selectively activated to create a pulsating fluid flow through the oral irrigator outlet (e.g., the tip).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In one example, the pulses created by the massage module may be longer fluid pulse or breaks in the fluid stream as compared to the normal operation. The increase in pulse length causes the fluid stream to massage a user's gums, enhancing blood flow and providing an enjoyable experience to the user. This is because the pulses may be timed with recovery the gum tissues (e.g., timed to allow blood to flow back into the tissue between each fluid pulse), and provides therapeutic benefits to the gums.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The massage mode may vary one or more characteristics of the control signal based on user input. For example, the user may select the massage mode and may then vary the frequency, magnitude, or shape of the control signal, such as changing the shape of a voltage waveform or its frequency. In other examples, the massage mode may apply a predetermined signal to the motor. For example, a control signal may be determined for the massage mode and when the massage mode is activated by the user, the stored signal may be applied. In these examples, the oral irrigator may include a plurality of control signals that may correlate to different massage modes. In yet other examples, the oral irrigator may include stored signals that may be selected by a user for a predetermined pulsing effect, as well as may vary one or more signals to allow the user to dynamically variable the pulsing effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition to providing a massage mode, the massage module or another processing element of the oral irrigator may vary one or more output characteristics of the oral irrigator to provide feedback to a user. As a first example, the massage mode may be activated automatically one or more times during normal mode to indicate to a user to move to a different tooth or portion of the mount. As a second example, the massage mode may be activated after a predetermined time period in order to alert the user that a cleaning time (which may be set by the user or be preselected) has expired. As a third example, the massage mode may be activated automatically every time period, e.g., every 30 seconds the massage mode may be activated to provide a massaging feel interspersed with cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In other examples, the massage module may be used with other irrigating devices. For example, the massage mode may be implemented in a nasal irrigator and may vary the fluid flow rate and pressure to massage the user's nasal tissues. In these examples, the pulse rate and control signal may be varied as compared to the oral irrigator, but may still provide a massaging effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In yet other examples, the massage module may be used with other oral instruments to provide a massaging effect and/or to enhance cleaning. For example, the massage module may be incorporated into an electrically driven toothbrush. In this example, the massage module may vary the motor speed or power to vary vibrations or bristle movement.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference now to the figures, the oral irrigator will be discussed in more detail. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a front perspective view of an oral irrigator including a massage mode. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a rear perspective view of the oral irrigator of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may include a base <b>102</b>, a reservoir <b>104</b>, and a handle <b>108</b>. The base <b>102</b> may provide support for the reservoir <b>104</b> and the handle <b>108</b>, as well as house many of the drive and power assembly components of the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. For example, the base <b>102</b> may house a pump, control circuitry, and/or motor, which will be discussed in more detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The base <b>102</b> may include a bottom support <b>128</b> and a cover <b>130</b>. The bottom support <b>128</b> may provide support for one or more of the internal components of the oral irrigator <b>100</b> and the cover <b>102</b> may cover those components to conceal them, as well as provide protection for those components. The base <b>102</b> may include a plurality of feet <b>132</b> <i>a</i>, <b>132</b> <i>b</i>, <b>132</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>132</b> <i>d </i>to support the base <b>102</b> on a surface, such as a countertop or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The base <b>102</b> may also include a clamp <b>134</b> or other structure to releasably support the handle <b>108</b>. In some examples, the clamp <b>134</b> may be a C-clamp; however, other attachment mechanisms are envisioned. The base <b>102</b> may also include a hose cavity <b>136</b> or hose box that may receive and support the hose <b>118</b> in a collapsed position. For example, the hose cavity <b>136</b> may include one or more arms on which the hose <b>118</b> may be wrapped. The hose cavity <b>136</b> may be recessed into the cover <b>130</b>, may be flush with the cover, or may extend outwards from the cover.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The oral irrigator <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> is a countertop irrigator. However, in some examples, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may be a handheld irrigator. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front perspective view of a second example of an oral irrigator. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in examples where the oral irrigator <b>100</b> is a handheld unit, the reservoir <b>104</b> and handle <b>106</b> may be connected together. The reservoir <b>104</b> may include a removable cavity that may refilled by a user and then reattached to the handle <b>106</b>. Additionally, in these examples, the internal components of the irrigator <b>100</b>, such as the motor, pump, and control circuitry, may be included within the handle <b>106</b> rather than a base unit. The description of the oral irrigation described below is generally directed to the oral irrigator illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>; however, it should be noted that the description is equally applicable to the oral irrigator <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, with the exception that the internal components of the base are included in the handle <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are cross-section views of the oral irrigator taken along lines <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B-<b>3</b>B, respectively, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the reservoir <b>104</b> defines a cavity <b>105</b> to hold liquid that may be expelled trough a tip <b>114</b> connected to the handle <b>108</b>. The reservoir <b>104</b> may include a lid <b>120</b> and may be removable from the base <b>102</b>. In some examples, the oral irrigator <b>102</b> may be a handheld or more compact and the reservoir <b>104</b> may be incorporated into the handle <b>108</b> (e.g., a container attachable to the handle <b>108</b>). The reservoir <b>104</b> may be substantially any size or shape and may be modified as desired, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reservoir is included as a cavity attached to the handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the handle <b>108</b> is movable relative to the base <b>102</b> and may be fluidly connected to the reservoir <b>104</b>. For example, a hose <b>118</b> may fluidly connect the reservoir <b>104</b> to the handle <b>108</b> and tip <b>114</b>. In examples where the reservoir <b>104</b> may be incorporated into the handle <b>108</b>, the hose <b>118</b> may be internal to the handle <b>108</b> or may be omitted (e.g., a fluid pathway may be defined through a housing of the handle rather than a tube). In some examples, the handle <b>108</b> may include a plurality of internal components, such as a check valves, bypass valves, pause valves, or the like. In these examples, the handle <b>108</b> may be used to vary one or more characteristics of the fluid flow output by the tip, separate from or in addition with the features for controlling the fluid output within the base. As mentioned above, although a number of components, such as the pump, reservoir, etc., are discussed herein as being incorporated into the base, in certain examples these components may be included with the handle. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a handheld oral irrigator may include a portable reservoir attached to the handle with a pump internal the handle. Accordingly, the discussion of any particular example for the handle and base is meant as illustrative only.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The tip <b>114</b> may be selectively removable from the handle <b>108</b>. For example, an eject <b>126</b> button can selectively release the tip <b>144</b> from the handle <b>108</b>. The tip <b>114</b> defines a fluid pathway that is fluidly connected to the hose <b>118</b>. The tip <b>114</b> includes an outlet <b>122</b> from which fluid from the reservoir <b>104</b> may be expelled from the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. The tip <b>114</b> may generally be configured to be inserted into a user's mouth and may expel fluid against a user's teeth, gums, tongue, etc. In some examples, the outlet <b>122</b> portion of the tip <b>144</b> may be shaped as a nozzle or may include a nozzle or other attachment connected thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The oral irrigator <b>100</b> may include a plurality of control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>124</b> to control one or more characteristics or parameters of the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. For example, the control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>124</b> may activate/deactivate the oral irrigator <b>100</b>, may vary a flow rate, a fluid pressure, a setting (e.g., slow, medium fast), and/or may activate a particular mode, e.g., massage mode. The number of control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>124</b>, as well as their structure, size, or shape may be varied as desired. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the two control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> on the base <b>102</b> are illustrated as rotatable knob or buttons; however, in other examples, the control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> may be switches, sliders, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">A first control actuator <b>110</b> may be configured to vary a fluid pressure of fluid as it exits the tip <b>114</b>. For example, the control actuator <b>110</b> may be connected to a valve that may selectively change the diameter or other fluid pathway characteristics of a fluid outlet or pathway between the reservoir <b>104</b> and the tip <b>114</b>. As the diameter is varies, such as due to a user turning the control actuator <b>110</b>, the outlet fluid pressure as fluid is expelled from the tip <b>114</b> may be selectively modified. As another example, the first control actuator <b>110</b> may activate a massage module to activate a massage mode for the oral irrigator <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">A second control actuator <b>112</b> on the base may be configured to selectively power the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. In other words, the second control actuator <b>112</b> may be a power button or knob to turn on the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. Additionally, in some examples, the second control actuator <b>112</b> may activate one or more settings. As an example, the second control actuator <b>112</b> may activate and deactivate the oral irrigator <b>100</b>, as well as select one or more settings, such as a massage mode, low pressure, high pressure, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">A third control actuator <b>113</b> on the base may be configured to selectively activate massage mode. In some examples the third control actuator <b>113</b> may be positioned adjacent to the second control actuator <b>112</b> and may be a compressible button, rather than a knob. However, in other examples, the control actuator <b>113</b> may be a knob and may be located on the handle or other portions of the base <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In some examples, a fourth control actuator <b>124</b> may be disposed on the handle <b>108</b>. The fourth control actuator <b>124</b> may selectively activate one or more settings or may act to pause the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. By placing the control actuator <b>124</b> on the handle <b>108</b>, the user may more easily change settings or pause the oral irrigator <b>100</b> while he or she is using the oral irrigator <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The various control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>124</b> may be configured as desired and may change one or more settings or parameters of the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. For example, any of the buttons <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>124</b> may be configured to activate a massage mode for the oral irrigator <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The oral irrigator <b>100</b> may also include a plurality of lights <b>117</b> <i>a</i>, <b>117</b> <i>b</i>, which may be used to provide feedback to a user. For example, the lights <b>117</b> <i>a</i>, <b>117</b> <i>b </i>may illuminate, change color, or may pulse to indicate a current mode of the oral irrigator, a pressure level of the oral irrigator, or the like. In a specific example, a first light <b>117</b> <i>a </i>is illuminated during normal mode and a second light <b>117</b> <i>b </i>is illuminated during massage mode. See, for example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may include a power cable <b>116</b> or port to receive a power cable. The power cable <b>116</b> may be configured to be received into an outlet or power source and may transfer power from a power source to the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. It should be noted that the type of power cable <b>116</b> might be varied based on the power source for the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. Alternatively, such as the oral irrigator shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may include an integrated power supply; such as one or more batteries, and in these cases the power cord <b>116</b> may be omitted or may be used to recharge the integrated power supply (rather than directly provide power to the oral irrigator <b>100</b>). As will be discussed in more detail below, the power cord <b>116</b> may function to act as a power supply for the oral irrigator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">An illustrative example of the internal components of the oral irrigator <b>100</b> will now be discussed in further detail. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are various perspective views of the oral irrigator <b>100</b> with select elements hidden for clarity. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may include a motor <b>142</b>, a gear box <b>144</b>, a pump <b>146</b>, and a chassis <b>140</b> supporting the motor <b>142</b>, gear box <b>144</b> and pump <b>146</b>. A valve assembly <b>156</b> including a valve <b>158</b> may fluidly connect the reservoir <b>104</b> to the pump <b>146</b> and a valve fitting <b>152</b> may fluidly connect the pump <b>146</b> to the hose <b>118</b> (and thus the tip <b>114</b> and handle <b>108</b>). Additionally, a check valve <b>167</b> may be positioned between the valve assembly <b>156</b> and the valve fitting <b>152</b>. The check valve <b>167</b> may regulate fluid pressure of the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. The oral irrigator <b>100</b> may also include a control circuitry <b>164</b> having a signal generator <b>166</b> in electrical communication with the motor <b>142</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4A</figref>, the motor <b>142</b> may be substantially any type of motor that may drive movement or create mechanical work sufficient to drive a pump. For example, the motor <b>142</b> may be a direct current motor, where the speed of the motor <b>142</b> may be controlled by a signal, such as a voltage signal. Control of the motor <b>142</b> will be discussed in more detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4A</figref>, the motor <b>142</b> may include a drive shaft <b>143</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) that is connected to a gear shaft <b>147</b> and a drive gear <b>149</b>. The drive gear <b>149</b> is connected to a piston <b>145</b> or other moveable element within the pump <b>146</b>. The gear box <b>144</b> may cover the gear shaft <b>147</b>, the drive gear <b>149</b>, and other mechanical gears or linkage elements that may be used to connect the drive shaft <b>143</b> of the motor <b>144</b> to the pump <b>146</b>. The linkage and gear elements may be varied as desired and may depend on the orientation of the motor and the pump relative to one another, the size or speed of the motor, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The pump <b>146</b> may be substantially any type of component that may pump fluid from one location to another. For example, the pump <b>146</b> may be a piston driven pump that may selectively push fluid from the reservoir <b>104</b> into the hose <b>118</b>. However, many other pump types are envisioned. Some illustrate pump types include a diaphragm pump or a centrifugal pump. The pump <b>146</b> may include a pump body <b>169</b> and an inlet pump <b>165</b> received within the pump body <b>169</b>. The first control actuator <b>110</b> may be connected to the pump <b>146</b> and may be attached to a bypass valve or other control valve (not shown). As discussed briefly above, the first control actuator <b>110</b> may selectively vary the pressure of fluid output from the pump <b>146</b> and may do so by varying the diameter of a fluid channel between the pump <b>146</b> and the tip <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-4B</figref>, the valve assembly <b>156</b> may be connected to the pump <b>146</b> and received into a bottom of the reservoir. The valve assembly <b>156</b> may include a valve <b>158</b> and one or more sealing members <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>, such as O-rings or sealing cups. The valve <b>158</b> may regulate fluid flow from the reservoir <b>104</b> into the pump <b>146</b>. Accordingly, the valve <b>158</b> is in fluid communication with the reservoir <b>104</b> and provides fluid from the reservoir <b>104</b> into the pump <b>146</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The oral irrigator <b>100</b> may also include one or more isolators <b>168</b>. The isolators <b>168</b> may connect the chassis <b>140</b> to the bottom support <b>128</b> of the base <b>102</b>. In some examples, the isolators <b>168</b> may absorb vibrations from the motor <b>142</b> and the pump <b>146</b>, to reduce the vibrations that may be transmitted to the bottom support <b>128</b> and/or feet <b>132</b> <i>a</i>, <b>132</b> <i>b</i>, <b>132</b> <i>c</i>, <b>132</b> <i>d</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Additionally, in some examples, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may include one or more feedback components. For example, the lights <b>117</b> <i>a</i>, <b>117</b> <i>b</i>, which may be light emitting diodes (LEDs) can be used to provide feedback to the user. Continuing with this example, the lights <b>117</b> <i>a</i>, <b>117</b> <i>b </i>may be illuminated to indicate the mode of the oral irrigator (e.g., massage mode or normal mode), or may be illuminated to indicate a cleaning or activation time, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The control circuit <b>164</b> may control the motor <b>142</b> and other elements of the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a simplified block diagram of the oral irrigator <b>100</b> illustrating the electrical communication between select components. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 5</figref>, a power source <b>115</b> (which may be an outlet in communication via the power cable <b>116</b> or one or more batteries) may be in communication with a massage module <b>172</b>, the motor <b>142</b>, and optionally, one or more of the input buttons <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>124</b>. For example, the second control actuator <b>112</b> may be in communication with a switch <b>148</b> module that may be in communication with control circuitry <b>164</b> and/or power source <b>115</b> to selectively activate the motor <b>142</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In some examples, the control circuitry <b>164</b> may provide a substrate that supports one or more components, as well as provides communication between those components. For example, the control circuit <b>164</b> may be a printed circuit board including one or more traces or connective lines that transmit signals between the massage module <b>172</b>, the motor <b>142</b>, and/or the power source <b>115</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The massage module <b>172</b> may selectively control the motor <b>142</b> to vary one or more parameters of oral irrigator <b>100</b>. The massage module <b>172</b> may include a signal generator <b>166</b> as well as one or more processing elements <b>170</b>. The processing element <b>170</b> may be one or more processors or control chips that may process and execute instructions. The signal generator <b>166</b> may be substantially any type of component that may create voltage signals to control one or more characteristics of the motor <b>142</b>. For example, the signal generator <b>166</b> may create one or more repeating or non-repeating electronic signals (e.g., voltage waveforms) that may be applied to the motor <b>142</b>. In a particular implementation, the signal generator <b>166</b> may be a function generator that may produce electrical waveforms over a range of frequencies. Exemplary waveforms include sinusoidal waves, square waves, sawtooth waves, triangular waves, and so on. Additionally, the signal generator may be configured to create modified waves that include characteristics of two or more waveforms. Illustrative waveforms that may be used will be discussed in more detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a simplified circuit diagram of the massage module <b>172</b>. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the signal generator <b>166</b> may be in communication with an amplifier <b>174</b> and a gate <b>176</b> or switch. The signal generator <b>166</b> may be in communication with the processor element <b>170</b>, which may determine the signals generated by the signal generator <b>166</b>. In some examples, the signal generator <b>166</b> may be incorporated into the processing element <b>170</b>, such that the processing element <b>170</b> may perform the functions of the signal generator <b>166</b> and may create and apply signals to the motor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The signal generator <b>166</b> may be in communication with an amplifier <b>174</b>. The amplifier <b>174</b> may amplify a signal generated by the signal generator <b>166</b> prior to applying the signal to the motor. For example, the amplifier <b>174</b> may be an operational amplifier or a differential amplifier. The amplifier <b>174</b> may be in communication with the motor <b>142</b> as well as the signal generator <b>166</b>. In some examples, the amplifier <b>174</b> may be configured to receive feedback from its output, in order to provide a more consistent output signal. However, it should be noted that the configuration of the amplifier <b>174</b>, as well as the type of amplifier and inputs used may be varied based on the type of motor <b>142</b> and signal generator used <b>166</b>. Additionally, depending on the output voltage of the signal generator and/or other system characteristics, the amplifier <b>174</b> may be omitted. In these instances, the signal may be directly or indirectly applied to the motor without being amplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The amplifier <b>174</b> may be in communication with a gate <b>176</b> or switch. The gate <b>176</b> may selectively provide the output of the amplifier <b>174</b> (which may be a signal produced by the signal generator <b>166</b>) to the motor <b>142</b>. For example, when the gate is not activated, the motor <b>142</b> may not receive a signal from the signal generator, but may receive a constant power signal. As another example, when the gate is not activated, the motor <b>142</b> may be separated from any signal or power source, preventing the motor from being activated. In this example, the gate <b>176</b> provides power to the motor and the signal produced by the signal generator varies the signal transmitted through the gate and during normal mode the motor receives a constant voltage signal and during massage mode the motor receives a variable signal. As yet another example, the activation voltage for the gate <b>176</b> may be varied to control the current transmission to the motor. In particular, the gate <b>176</b> may be turned slightly activated during one mode allowing a reduced amount of current to travel between its source and drain (when the gate is a transistor) and then may be fully activated to allow full current flow. The variation in current may be used to pulse the signal to the motor or may be used to slow the motor down.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The gate <b>176</b> may be a switch or other selectively activated component. In one example, the gate <b>176</b> may be a transistor, such as a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), such as an N-channel MOSFET. However, other types of transistors or gates are also envisioned, as well as other components that may be used to selectively provide communication between two or more components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The massage module and other control circuitry of the oral irrigator may be implemented in a number of different manners, which may vary as desired. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7D</figref> illustrate various circuit schematics that may be used to implement one or more functions of the oral irrigator, control circuitry, and/or massage module.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is an illustrative circuit schematic of the control circuitry for one example of the oral irrigator.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> illustrates a third example of a schematic for the oral irrigator. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the voltage source may be higher than the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> and may include a fuse <b>181</b> to help regulate spikes in current and/or voltage. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the second control element <b>171</b> may also be used to provide clock signals and resets for the oral irrigator <b>100</b> and the switch <b>148</b> may provide communication between one or more of the control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>124</b> with the processing element <b>170</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> illustrates a diagram of the switch <b>148</b> and light module. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B, 7C, and 7D</figref>, the switch <b>148</b> module may be in communication with the processing element <b>170</b>, the lights <b>117</b> <i>a</i>, <b>117</b> <i>b</i>, the second control actuator <b>112</b>, and the third control actuator <b>113</b>. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, when the second control actuator <b>112</b> is activated by the user, the switch <b>148</b> may provide a signal to the processing element <b>170</b>, which may activate the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. Additionally, the switch <b>148</b> may activate the first light <b>117</b> <i>a </i>to indicate that the oral irrigator <b>100</b> has been activated and is in the normal mode. For example, the normal or clean mode may be a default mode that may be activated when the oral irrigator <b>100</b> is initially activated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B, 7C and 7D</figref>, when the second control actuator <b>113</b> is activated by the user, the switch <b>148</b> may provide a signal to the processing element <b>170</b> indicating that the user has activate the massage mode or second mode. Additionally, the switch <b>148</b> may illuminate the second light <b>117</b> <i>b </i>to indicate to the user that the massage mode has been activated. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, both lights <b>117</b> <i>a</i>, <b>117</b> <i>b </i>may be light emitting diodes. However, in other embodiments, other light sources are envisioned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">With reference again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-6</figref>, in operation, the user may rotate, push, or otherwise provide an input to the second control actuator <b>112</b>. The second control actuator <b>112</b> may activate the oral irrigator <b>100</b>, causing the power supply <b>115</b> to provide power to the control circuitry <b>164</b> and the motor <b>142</b>. During normal operation, control circuitry <b>164</b> will provide a normal control signal to the motor <b>142</b>. For example, the voltage or power source <b>115</b> may be placed into communication with the motor <b>142</b> and may provide a substantially constant control signal to the motor <b>142</b>. As the motor <b>142</b> receives the constant control signal, the motor <b>142</b> may begin turning the drive shaft <b>143</b>, moving the piston <b>145</b>. As the piston moves, fluid from the reservoir <b>104</b> may be pulled through the valve <b>158</b> into the pump <b>146</b> and be pushed through the outlet <b>154</b> of the valve fitting <b>152</b> into the hose <b>118</b>. The fluid may then travel through the hose <b>118</b> to the handle <b>108</b> and exit out of the tip <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">During normal operation, the control signal to the motor <b>142</b> may be substantially constant, causing the motor <b>142</b> to rotate the drive shaft in a constant manner (e.g., having a constant velocity). In examples where a piston pump or other reciprocating pump is used, the fluid may be slightly pulsed as it is expelled from the tip <b>114</b>. This is due to the reciprocating nature of the pump, e.g., the alternating pulling and pushing to alternately pull fluid from the reservoir <b>104</b> and push fluid from the pump out to the tip <b>114</b>. Depending on the type, size, or the like, the pulses during normal operation may have a somewhat short duration and fast frequency. In one example, the pulses due to the reciprocating nature of the pump <b>146</b> may be about 26 pulses per second. However, in other examples, during normal mode, the fluid outlet may not be pulsed, but may be substantially constant. For example, in examples where a non-reciprocating pump is used, the output during normal mode may be substantially constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">During use, if the user hits the pause actuator <b>124</b>, a valve within the handle <b>106</b> may reduce or substantially prevent fluid from exiting the tip <b>114</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the fourth control actuator <b>124</b> may transmit a signal to the processing element <b>170</b> that may temporarily stop movement of the motor <b>142</b>, to prevent or reduce fluid transmitted from the reservoir <b>104</b> to the tip <b>114</b>. Also, if the first control actuator <b>110</b> is activated, the user may selectively adjust the pressure of fluid expelled from the tip <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">If massage mode is activated, such as by a user providing an input to the oral irrigator <b>100</b> through one of the control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>124</b>, the fluid output characteristics may be modified. For example, the third control actuator <b>113</b> may be used to activate a massage mode for the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. During massage mode, the processing element <b>170</b> may selectively activate the gate <b>176</b>, to vary the signal provided to the motor <b>142</b>. In one example, the signal generator <b>166</b> may apply a varying signal to the motor <b>142</b>, which may cause the motor <b>142</b> to selectively vary one or more movement characteristics. For example, the signal generator <b>166</b> may apply a signal that has a variable voltage across a predetermined time duration. The signal may vary not only in voltage magnitude, but also in time between a high voltage and a low voltage (e.g., frequency).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the amplifier <b>174</b> may increase the signal generated by the signal generator <b>166</b> and provide the increased control signal to the motor <b>174</b>. The control signal may selectively interrupt or vary the power supplied to the motor <b>142</b>, causing the motor to intermittently stop or slow down, reducing, stopping, or changing the movement of the drive shaft <b>143</b>. As the drive shaft <b>143</b> varies, the piston <b>145</b> may also vary, which may increase the length of pulses produced by the pump <b>146</b>, as well as the pressure output by the pump <b>146</b>. As an example, when the control signal is low or otherwise prevents power from being transmitted to the motor, the motor <b>142</b> may stop rotating the drive shaft <b>143</b>, which may in turn, stop movement of the piston <b>145</b>, reducing or stopping fluid from flowing from the reservoir <b>104</b> to the tip <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Specifically, one control signal may be configured create 0.5 second pulses. In other words, the pump <b>146</b> may produce 2 pulses per second, with may have a substantially slower pulse rate than the pulse rate due to the reciprocating nature of the pump, and each pulse may have a substantially longer duration as compared to the normal mode. However, it should be noted that other pulse rates are envisioned and will be discussed in more detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In some implementations, the flow rate of the oral irrigator during massage mode may be reduced as compared to the flow rate during normal mode. As a specific example, the massage mode flow rate may be between 40 to 70 percent and often 50 to 60 percent of the flow rate during normal mode. In some implementations, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may have a flow rate during clean mode ranging between 300-400 mL per minute and often may be about 370 mL per minute and during massage mode the flow rate may range between 150-200 mL per minute or lower and often may be 222 mL per minute.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition to changing the pulse rate, the control signal may also vary the magnitude of power provided to the motor <b>142</b>, which may increase or decrease the outlet pressure of the pump <b>142</b>. In a specific implementation, the outlet pressure of the oral irrigator during cleaning mode may range between 70 to 95 psi, and often average between 90-93 psi and during massage mode may range between 60 to 90 psi, and often average between 80-87 psi. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> illustrate example pressure ranges for the oral irrigator during normal mode and during massage mode. For example, by applying an increased voltage to the motor <b>142</b>, the current supplied to the motor <b>142</b> may also increase, increasing the torque of the motor <b>142</b>. The increased torque may exert an increased force on the piston <b>145</b>, to increase the output pressure of the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. Accordingly, in some examples, the control signal may vary not only the durations for which a voltage is applied to the motor, but also the magnitude of the voltage in order to vary not only the fluid pulses but also the fluid pressure output by the oral irrigator <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">As the fluid exits the tip <b>114</b>, the user may direct the flow on his or her teeth, gums, tongue, cheeks, or the like. The varying control signals may vary the fluid output by the tip <b>114</b>. In some examples, the variation in fluid may create a massage effect on a user's gums. For example, during each pulse fluid may not exit from the tip <b>114</b>, allowing blood to return to the user's gums before the next fluid stream hits the gums. This may provide a massaging effect, as well as may stimulate blood flow to the gums and enhance the cleaning experience with the oral irrigator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">The signal generator <b>166</b> may vary a frequency and magnitude of the control signal based on a desired output pulse rate and fluid pressure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref> illustrate control signals that may be created by the signal generator to be applied to the motor <b>142</b>. The control signals may include one or more voltage peaks and voltage minimums. As some illustrative examples, the voltage peaks may be 170V, 12V, 6V, or other values and the voltage minimums may be a subset of the voltage peaks and often may be substantially or about 0V. However, it should be noted that many other voltage values are envisioned and the voltage of the control signal may depend on the motor, the processing element, and other system parameters and as such may be modified as desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, a control signal <b>200</b> may be a square wave having a voltage peak <b>202</b> or amplitude and a voltage minimum <b>204</b>. In some examples, the voltage peak <b>202</b> (i.e., maximum voltage) may be applied for a duration T<b>1</b> and the voltage minimum <b>204</b> may be applied for a duration T<b>2</b>. In this example, the durations T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> may be approximately equal. In a particular implementation, the peak voltage <b>202</b> may be approximately 12 V and the minimum voltage <b>204</b> may be 0 V, additionally both durations T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> may have a length of approximately 100 ms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">When the control signal <b>202</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is applied to the motor <b>142</b>, during the duration T<b>2</b> of the minimum voltage <b>204</b>, the motor <b>142</b> may not receive power. In other words, because the minimum voltage <b>204</b> is set to 0 V, the motor <b>142</b> may not be powered. As the motor <b>142</b> does not receive power during the duration of the minimum voltage <b>204</b>, the drive shaft <b>143</b> may slow down and stop moving, stopping movement of the piston <b>145</b> within the pump <b>146</b>. Thus, during the duration T<b>2</b>, the pump <b>146</b> may not pump fluid, creating a pause in fluid flow. Then, when the peak voltage <b>202</b> is applied, the motor <b>142</b> may begin rotating the drive shaft <b>143</b>, causing the piston <b>145</b> to push fluid from the pump <b>146</b>, creating fluid flow. In this example, the minimum voltages <b>204</b> may define the “pulse” length, or the intermission between fluid output.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, in another example, the maximum voltage <b>202</b> may be selected to be approximately 12V and the minimum voltage <b>204</b> may be selected to be approximately 6 V or half of the maximum voltage. However, in other embodiments, the minimum voltage may be 0V in this example as well. Additionally, the two time durations may be selected to be 160 ms. In this example, during second duration T<b>2</b> when the minimum voltage <b>204</b> is applied to the motor <b>142</b>, the motor <b>142</b> may receive some power, but the power may be reduced as compared to the maximum voltage <b>202</b>. In this example, the motor <b>142</b> may still rotate the drive shaft <b>143</b>, but may do so at a reduced torque and speed, which may also cause a reduced flow rate and pressure output by the pump <b>146</b>. In this example, during each pulse, fluid may be output from the tip <b>114</b>, but at a slower flow rate and pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">In yet another implementation, the time durations T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> may be selected to be 250 ms. In these examples, the frequency of the pulses may be reduced, such that there may be fewer pulses per second as compared to examples where the time durations may be shorter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, because the time durations T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> may be substantially equal, the time of fluid output and fluid pause may be substantially the same. However, in other examples, the time durations for the maximum voltage and the minimum voltage may be varied. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a control signal <b>212</b> may include a voltage maximum <b>212</b> having a duration T<b>3</b> and a voltage minimum <b>214</b> having a duration T<b>4</b>. In this example, the peak time duration T<b>3</b> may be shorter than the minimum time duration T<b>4</b>, which may result in longer “pauses” in fluid flow or pulses. The time duration T<b>4</b> may be twice, three times, or more, the length of the peak time duration T<b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">As one example, the minimum voltage time duration T<b>4</b> may be three times as long as the maximum voltage time duration T<b>3</b>. Thus, the pause in fluid flow may last three times as long as the fluid flow segments or pulses. In a specific implementation, the maximum voltage <b>212</b> may be 12V and may have time duration T<b>3</b> of 100 ms, the minimum voltage <b>214</b> may be 0V and may have a duration of 300 ms. However, the above values are illustrative only and many other implementations are envisioned. Furthermore, although the control signal <b>210</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is illustrated as having a longer low voltage duration T<b>4</b> than maximum voltage duration T<b>3</b>, in some examples, the maximum voltage time duration T<b>3</b> may be longer than the minimum voltage time duration T<b>4</b>. In these examples, the pauses or breaks between fluid flow may be reduced as compared to the fluid stream time durations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">In the control signals <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, there may be a rapid transition between the maximum or peak voltage <b>202</b>, <b>212</b> and the minimum voltage <b>204</b>, <b>214</b>. For example, both control signals <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> may be square waves that substantially instantaneously transition between minimum and maximum values. However, in other examples, the control signal may gradually transition between a maximum and minimum voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, a control signal <b>220</b> having a sinusoidal shape is illustrated. The control signal <b>220</b> may have a peak voltage <b>220</b> and a minimum voltage <b>224</b>, with the peak voltage <b>220</b> having a time duration T<b>5</b> and the minimum voltage having a time duration T<b>6</b>. However, because the control signal <b>220</b> may gradually change between the maximum and minimum levels, the durations T<b>5</b> and T<b>6</b> may represent the time between inflection points <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>. The inflection points <b>226</b>, <b>228</b> generally may represent half of a cycle or period for the control signal <b>220</b>. In other words, the sum of the durations T<b>5</b> and T<b>6</b> may represent the period for the control signal <b>220</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Using the control signal <b>220</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the motor <b>142</b> may more subtly transition between the high and low states of fluid flow. That is, the transition between the “pulses” may be tapered so that there may not be a sudden reduction in fluid flow, but a more gradual reduction. In some examples, the peak voltage <b>222</b> may be three times as large as the minimum voltage <b>224</b>. As one example, the peak voltage <b>222</b> may be selected at 15V and the minimum voltage <b>224</b> may be selected at 3V. In this example, the period of the control signal <b>220</b> may be 1800 ms with the high duration T<b>5</b> being 900 ms and the low duration <b>16</b> being 900 ms. Although the control signal <b>222</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> is a sine wave, other waveforms are envisioned, such as combination waveforms (e.g., having characteristics of multiple wave types), elliptical waveforms, and the like. Accordingly, the discussion of any particular waveform is meant as illustrative only.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">The massage module <b>172</b> may not only vary the pulse rate fluid flow of the oral irrigator, but may also vary an outlet fluid pressure for the oral irrigator. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a chart illustrating an example outlet pressure of the oral irrigator during clean mode. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a chart illustrating an example outlet pressure of the oral irrigator during massage mode. With reference first to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may pulse rapidly (which may be due to the reciprocating nature of the pump) and the outlet pressure <b>240</b> may vary between peaks <b>242</b> and valleys <b>244</b>. As can be seen from the graph in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, each pressure peak <b>242</b> may be generally close together with a pressure pulse rate of just over 21 peaks per second. Additionally, the average pressure for the peaks <b>242</b> may be 91.8 psi and generally the pressure at the peaks <b>242</b> ranges between 91 and 92 psi. The example outlet pressures discussed herein are meant as illustrative only and may be higher or lower based as desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the output pressure <b>240</b> may also drop to the valleys <b>244</b>, which may hover around 0 psi before the pressure ramps back up extend towards a pressure peak <b>242</b>. Each of the valleys <b>244</b> may occur while the piston <b>145</b> in the pump <b>146</b> is drawing fluid into the pump chamber before it expels the fluid and are therefore due to the reciprocating nature of the pump <b>146</b>. Accordingly, in examples where a non-reciprocating pump may be used, the outlet pressure during normal mode may be substantially constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, during massage mode, the outlet pressure <b>250</b> of the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may be lower than during clean mode (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>) and may also have non-pulsating periods during which the outlet pressure may be close to or at 0 psi. For example, the outlet pressure <b>250</b> may include a high pressure period T<sub>high </sub>and a low pressure period T<sub>low</sub>. During the high pressure period T<sub>high</sub>, the outlet pressure <b>250</b> may include a plurality of pressure peaks <b>252</b>, as well as ramp peaks <b>256</b> that are the pressure peak while the oral irrigator <b>100</b> is transitioning between the high pressure period and the low pressure period. Additionally, the outlet pressure <b>250</b> may include valleys <b>254</b>, <b>258</b>. The first valley <b>254</b> may be during the high pressure T<sub>high </sub>period and may be due to the reciprocating nature of the piston <b>145</b>, as discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. The second valley <b>258</b> represents the low pressure period between pulses of high pressure. During the low pressure period T<sub>low</sub>, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may output little to no pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, in some examples, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may have an average outlet pressure of 85.9 psi during massage mode. As with the clean mode, many other outlet pressures are envisioned and the above examples are meant as illustrative only and not limiting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">A method for operating the oral irrigator <b>100</b> including the massage module <b>172</b> will now be discussed in more detail. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a method <b>300</b> for activating the massage mode. The method <b>300</b> may begin with operation <b>302</b> and the irrigator <b>100</b> may be activated. For example, the second control actuator <b>112</b> may be selected by a user to turn on the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. Once the oral irrigator <b>100</b> is activated, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to operation <b>304</b>. In operation <b>304</b>, the processing element <b>170</b> may determine whether massage mode has been activated. For example, the processing element <b>170</b> may determine whether a user has provided an input to one of the control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>124</b> to select the massage mode. In a specific implementation, the switch <b>148</b> may provide an input to the processing element <b>170</b> when the second control actuator is activated. As another example, the massage mode may be activated automatically after a select time period of activation of the irrigator <b>100</b>, e.g., after 30 seconds of operation, the massage mode may be automatically activated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">If the massage mode is not activated, the method may proceed to operation <b>314</b>, which will be discussed in more detail below. However, if in operation <b>304</b> the massage mode is activated, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to operation <b>306</b>. In operation <b>306</b>, the signal generator <b>166</b> may generate a control signal <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>. The control signal generated <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> may be selected from a predetermined signal, or as will be discussed in more detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, may be generated based on one or more user inputs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Once the signal generator <b>166</b> has generated the control signal <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to operation <b>308</b>. In operation <b>308</b> the control signal may be applied to the motor. For example, the gate <b>176</b> may be activated to provide the control signal from the signal generator <b>166</b> to the motor <b>142</b>. As the control signal is applied to the motor <b>142</b>, the motor <b>142</b> may drive the drive shaft <b>143</b> based on the signal. For example, the motor <b>142</b> may selectively slow down or stop rotation of the drive shaft and/or may decrease or reduce the torque produced by the drive shaft. The variations in the drive shaft movement may create related changes in the piston <b>145</b>, thus varying the output of the pump <b>146</b>, changing the output characteristics of the fluid flow from the tip <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">After operation <b>308</b>, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to operation <b>312</b>. In operation <b>312</b>, the processing element <b>170</b> may determine whether to end massage mode. For example, the user may provide a second input to the oral irrigator <b>100</b>, e.g., by selecting one of the control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>124</b>, to indicate that he or she wishes to resume normal mode. As another example, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may have a predetermined time period for massage mode (e.g., 1 minute, or the like), and the processing element <b>172</b> may determine to end massage mode once the allotted time has passed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In operation <b>312</b>, if massage mode is not terminated, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to operation <b>310</b>. In operation <b>310</b>, the method <b>300</b> may determine whether the same control signal <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> should be applied to the motor or whether a different signal should be applied. If the control signal is to remain the same, the method <b>300</b> may return to operation <b>308</b> and the signal may continue to be applied to the motor <b>142</b>. However, in operation <b>310</b> if a new signal is desired, the method <b>300</b> may return to operation <b>306</b> and the signal generator <b>166</b> may generate a new control signal. For example, in some examples, a user may wish to vary pressure, pulse rate, or the transition between pulses during massage mode. In these instances, the processing element <b>170</b> may receive a user input to vary the control signal and may instruct the signal generator <b>166</b> to create a new control signal or vary the current control signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, if in operation <b>312</b> massage mode is terminated, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to operation <b>314</b>. In operation <b>314</b> the processing element <b>170</b> may provide a constant signal to the motor <b>142</b>. In other words, the normal mode signal may be applied to the motor, and in some instances, the normal mode signal may be substantially constant. As the motor <b>142</b> receives the normal mode signal, movement of the drive shaft <b>143</b> may be constant, and any pulses in the fluid output may be due to the reciprocating nature of the pump <b>146</b>, rather than variable movement in the motor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">After operation <b>314</b>, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to operation <b>316</b>. In operation <b>316</b>, the processing element <b>170</b> may determine whether more cleaning is desired. For example, the processing element <b>170</b> may determine whether the user has deactivated the power control actuator <b>112</b>. As another example, the oral irrigator may be configured to have an activation time corresponding to a predetermined “cleaning” length and once the time length has expired, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may automatically shut off.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">If more cleaning is desired, the method <b>300</b> may return to operation <b>304</b>. However, if no additional cleaning is desired, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to operation <b>318</b>. In operation <b>318</b>, the processing element <b>170</b> may deactivate the motor. As one example, the processing element <b>170</b> may switch off a connection between the power supply <b>115</b> and the motor <b>142</b>. After operation <b>318</b>, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to an end state <b>320</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">In some examples, the pressure and pulse rate of the massage mode may be statically set. However, in other examples, the pressure and pulse rate of the pulses during massage mode may be dynamically modifiable or may be initially set by a user (e.g., calibrated to a particular user's preferences). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for dynamically modifying one or more characteristics of the fluid flow during massage mode. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the method <b>400</b> may begin with operation <b>402</b>. In operation <b>402</b>, massage mode for the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may be activated. For example, the user may select one of the control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>124</b> to indicate his or her desire to enter massage mode. Once in massage mode, as described in operations <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the signal generator <b>166</b> may generate a signal and apply the signal to the motor <b>142</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">Once massage mode has been activated, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to operation <b>404</b>. In operation <b>404</b>, the processing element <b>170</b> may determine whether the outlet pressure should be varied. For example, on the control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>124</b> may be used to allow the user to provide an input indicating whether he or she wishes for the pressure to be increased or decreased. In a particular example, rotating one of the control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>124</b> in a first direction may correspond to an increase in pressure and rotating in a second direction may correspond to a decrease in pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">If the pressure is to be varied from the current control signal output, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to operation <b>406</b>. In operation <b>406</b> the processing element <b>170</b> may determine whether the pressure should be increased. In other words, the processing element <b>170</b> may determine whether the user input to vary the pressure corresponds to an increase in pressure or a decrease. It should be noted that in many implementations, operations <b>404</b> and <b>406</b> may be performed substantially simultaneously. For example, the processing element <b>170</b> may receive a single input that indicates both a change a pressure, as well as whether the pressure is to be increased or decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">In operation <b>406</b>, if the pressure is going to be decreased, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to operation <b>408</b>. In operation <b>408</b>, the control signal <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> may be modified by the processing element <b>170</b> to reduce the maximum voltage <b>202</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, or reduce the amplitude of the control signal. As discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>, by decreasing the maximum voltage of the control signal, the output pressure by the pump <b>146</b> may be reduced due to a reduction in output torque by the motor. However, it should be noted that in other examples, the pressure may be decreased manually, such as by a user closing or opening a valve, such a by-pass valve or the like. In these examples, the control signal may not be modified, but the mechanical properties of the fluid path between the reservoir <b>104</b> and the tip <b>114</b> may be changed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">If in operation <b>406</b> the pressure is going to be increased the method <b>400</b> may proceed to operation <b>410</b>. In operation <b>410</b>, the peak voltage <b>202</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>222</b> or amplitude of the control signal <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> may be increased. As a specific example, the peak voltage may increase from 10 V to 12V. As discussed above, the outlet pressure may be related to the voltage applied to the motor <b>142</b> by the control signal, such that a change in the voltage may correspond to a change in pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">After either operation <b>408</b> or <b>410</b>, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to operation <b>412</b>. In operation <b>412</b>, the processing element <b>170</b> may determine whether the pulse length and/or pulse rate should be varied. For example, the user may be provide input to the oral irrigator <b>100</b> through one or more of the control actuators <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>124</b> indicating his or her desire to increase the pulse rate or length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">If the pulse rate is going to be varied, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to operation <b>414</b>. In operation <b>414</b>, the processing element <b>170</b> may determine whether the pulse rate is going to be increased. For example, the user input to vary the pulse rate may also include an indication of whether the pulse rate should be increased or decreased. Additionally, as discussed above with respect to pressure, in some examples, the user input indicating that the pulse rate should be varied may also include data indicating whether the pulse rate should be increased or decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">In operation <b>414</b>, if the pulse rate is going to decrease, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to operation <b>416</b>. In operation <b>416</b>, the signal generator <b>166</b> may decrease the frequency of the control signal <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>. As an example, the duration T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>, T<b>4</b>, T<b>5</b> may be increased, such that the cycles per unit of time of the control signal may be increased, reducing the number of pulses per second.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">In operation <b>414</b> if the pulse rate is going to be increased, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to operation <b>418</b>. In operation <b>418</b>, the signal generator <b>166</b> may increase the frequency of the control signal. For example, the duration T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>, T<b>4</b>, T<b>5</b> for the control signal may shorten, increasing the number of cycles of the control signal per minute. By shortening the length of the maximum and minimum voltages applied to the motor <b>142</b>, the length of each pulse may be shortened, increasing the number of pulses per time frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">After operations <b>416</b> or <b>418</b> or if in operation <b>412</b> the pulse rate is not going to be changed, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to an end state <b>420</b> and may terminate. It should be noted that the method <b>400</b> is an illustrative method for varying one or more characteristics of the fluid flow through the tip <b>114</b> during massage mode. However, many other methods are envisioned. As one example, the transition between high and low or fluid flow and a pulse may be varied by changing the transition between the maximum and the minimum voltage levels in the control signal. As another example, the length of fluid flow as compared to pulses or breaks in fluid flow may be varied by changing the duration T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>, T<b>4</b>, T<b>5</b> that either the maximum voltage or the minimum voltage is applied to the motor <b>142</b>.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Other Examples</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">As generally discussed above, the processing element <b>170</b> may vary a control signal to the motor to change either or both the fluid pulse rate and/or the fluid outlet pressure. In other examples, the processing element <b>170</b> may activate a switch or valve to vary the pulse rate and/or pressure. As a first example, the processing element <b>170</b> may be in communication with an electrical valve such as a solenoid valve and when the massage mode is activated, the processing element <b>170</b> may vary the outlet of the valve to change the pressure and/or may selectively open and close the valve to change the flow rate of the oral irrigator <b>100</b>. As a second example, the oral irrigator <b>100</b> may include a gear driven turbine or a water driven turbine that may be mechanically actuated or actuated by the processing element <b>170</b> to vary the flow rate of the oral irrigator <b>100</b>.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">Conclusion</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The foregoing description has broad application. For example, while examples disclosed herein may focus on a massage mode for oral irrigators, it should be appreciated that the concepts disclosed herein may equally apply to other motor driven devices where a variation in motion may be desired. Similarly, although the massage module is discussed with respect to reducing a pulse rate to create a massage feeling, the devices and techniques disclosed herein are equally applicable to modifying the pulse rate or pressure of an outlet fluid for other applications (e.g., creating a faster pulse rate for quicker or more effective cleaning). Accordingly, the discussion of any example is meant only to be exemplary and is not intended to suggest that the scope of the disclosure, including the claims, is limited to these examples.</div>
