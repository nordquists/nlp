<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Continuation Application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/403,883 filed May 6, 2019, which is a Continuation Application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/701,429 filed on Apr. 30, 2015 and issued as U.S. Pat.

<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Exemplary embodiments relate to a wireless communication, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for transmitting a communication channel between terminals in a wireless communication system.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Discussion of the Background</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">An amount of data transmitted through wireless communication has gradually increased. However, the frequency resources that service providers can provide are limited and have become increasingly saturated, and thus, mobile carriers continuously develop technologies for discovering new frequencies and improving efficient use of frequencies. One of the actively studied technologies to ease the frequency resource shortage and to create a new mobile communication service is Device-to-Device (D2D) communication technology. Representatively, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which is a mobile communication standardization association, actively conducts D2D communication technology standardization that is referred to as Proximity-based services (ProSe).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The D2D communication includes a communication between terminals, e.g., user equipments (UEs), located in proximity to each other, such that the terminals can directly send and receive data therebetween using the frequency band of, or out of the frequency band of, a wireless communication system using a communication technology of the wireless communication system without passing through the infrastructure of a base station, such as an evolved NodeB (eNodeB). This technology enables a UE to utilize a wireless communication when located out of the area in which wireless communication infrastructure is deployed, and provides an advantage of reducing network load in the wireless communication system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Because the resources for D2D communication are limited, it may be necessary to exploit the limited resources effectively in performing wireless communications. For example, a communication problem may occur if a UE carrying out a D2D communication processes a baseband signal by using only existing parameters of the wireless communication system, such as parameters of LTE or LTE-Advanced system parameters, without using one or more parameters configured in consideration of the limited resource characteristics of the D2D communication.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Exemplary embodiments will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of inventive concept are shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Throughout the drawings and the detailed description, unless otherwise described, the same drawing reference numerals are understood to refer to the same elements, features, and structures. In describing the exemplary embodiments, detailed description on known configurations or functions may be omitted for clarity and conciseness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, the terms, such as first, second, A, B, (a), (b), and the like may be used herein to describe elements in the description herein. The terms are used to distinguish one element from another element. Thus, the terms do not limit the element, an arrangement order, a sequence or the like. It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being “on”, “connected to” or “coupled to” another element, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. The present specification provides descriptions in association with a wireless communication network, and tasks executed in the wireless communication network may be performed in the process where a system (for example, a base station) that manages the corresponding wireless communication network controls the network and transmits data, or may be performed in a User Equipment (UE) that is wireless linked to the corresponding network and capable of communicating with the network system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The multiple access method applied to a wireless communication system may not be limited to certain technical schemes. Various methods and schemes can be used, including CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access), OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access), SC-FDMA (Single Carrier-FDMA), OFDM-FDMA, OFDM-TDMA, OFDM-CDMA. For uplink transmission and downlink transmission, either TDD (Time Division Duplex), which uses different time locations for uplink and downlink transmissions, respectively, or FDD (Frequency Division Duplex), which uses different frequencies for uplink and downlink transmissions, may be utilized. Further, both the TDD and FDD schemes may be used for uplink and downlink transmissions between a base station and a UE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a network architecture of a wireless communication system, according to one or more exemplary embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the network architecture of an Evolved-Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (E-UMTS), which is an example of a wireless communication system. The E-UMTS system may be Evolved-UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA), Long Term Evolution (LTE), or LTE-advanced (LTE-A). Wireless communication technologies and/or protocols of a wireless communication system with which UEs communicate may be configured according to the respective network system. UEs are configured to communicate with a base station supporting one or more of the network architectures described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">A wireless communication system is widely deployed to provide various communication services, such as voice and packet data, etc. Also, a wireless communication system may support a device to device (D2D) communication between UEs. A wireless communication system supporting D2D communication will be described later in more detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an Evolved-UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) includes a base station (hereinafter referred to as an evolved NodeB (eNB) <b>20</b>) that provides a terminal (hereinafter referred to as User Equipment (UE) <b>10</b>) with a Control Plane (CP) and a User Plane (UP).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The UE <b>10</b> may be a stationary or mobile entity, and may be referred to as a Mobile station (MS), an Advanced MS (AMS), a User Terminal (UT), a Subscriber Station (SS), a wireless device, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The eNB <b>20</b> may generally refer to a station that communicates with the UE <b>10</b>, and may be referred to as a Base Station (BS), a Base Transceiver System (BTS), an access point, a femto-eNB, a pico-eNB, a Home eNB, a relay, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The eNB <b>20</b> may provide at least one cell to a UE. A cell may refer to a geographical area in which the eNB <b>20</b> provides a communication service, or a specific frequency band. A cell may refer to downlink frequency resource and/or uplink frequency resource. Also a cell may refer to the combination of downlink frequency resource and optional uplink frequency resource. Also, if carrier aggregation (CA) is not considered, uplink and downlink frequency resources generally exist in pairs within a cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">An interface for transmitting user traffic or control traffic may be used between eNBs <b>20</b>. A source eNB <b>21</b> may refer to an eNB which has established a wireless bearer with a UE <b>10</b> currently, and a target eNB <b>22</b> mar refer to an eNB, which a UE <b>10</b> that disconnects a wireless bearer with a source eNB <b>21</b> attempts to handover to and establish a new wireless bearer with.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">eNBs <b>20</b> may be connected with each other via an X2 interface, which is used to send and receive a message between eNBs <b>20</b>. An eNB <b>20</b> is connected to an Evolved Packet System (EPS), more specifically Mobility Management Entity (MME)/Serving Gateway (S-GW) <b>30</b>, via S1 interface. S1 interface supports many-to-many-relation between eNBs <b>20</b> and MME/S-GWs <b>30</b>. PDN-GW <b>40</b> is utilized to provide packet data service toward MME/S-GW <b>30</b>. PDN-GW <b>40</b> varies depending on the purpose of communication or service, and PDN-GW <b>40</b> supporting a specific service can be found using Access Point Name (APN) information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, the term “downlink” refers to a communication from a base station to a UE, and the term “uplink” refers to a communication from a UE to a base station. For downlink, a transmitter may be part of a base station, and a receiver may be part of a UE. For uplink, a transmitter may be part of a UE and a receiver may be part of a base station. The base station may include an eNB, a relay, and the like as described above, for example. There is no limitation in the multiple access method applied to a wireless communication system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The wireless communication system may include a radio protocol architecture associated with a user plane and a radio protocol architecture associated with a control plane, according to one or more exemplary embodiments. The user plane indicates a protocol stack for user data transmission, and the control plane indicates a protocol stack for control signal transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Physical (PHY) layers of a UE and an eNB provide an information transfer service to a higher layer using a physical channel. A physical (PHY) layer is connected to a Media Access Control layer which is a higher layer, through a transport channel. Data is transferred, through a transport channel, between the MAC layer and the physical layer. The transport channel is classified based on a scheme of transmitting data through a radio interface. In addition, data is transferred through a physical channel between different physical layers (that is, between physical layers of a UE and an eNB, between physical layers of a transmitter and a receiver). The physical channel may be modulated based on an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and uses a space formed of time and frequencies, and a space formed of a plurality of antennas as radio resources. Hereinafter, examples of physical control channels will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">A Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH) among physical channels may inform a UE of resource allocations of a Paging CHannel (PCH) and a DownLink Shared CHannel (DL-SCH) and Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) information associated with a DL-SCH. A PDCCH may deliver, to a UE, uplink scheduling grant which reports resource allocation of uplink transmission. A Physical Control Format Indicator CHannel (PCFICH) informs a UE of the number of OFDM symbols used for PDCCHs, and is transmitted in each subframe. A Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator CHannel (PHICH) carries a HARQ ACK/NACK signal as a response to uplink transmission. A Physical Uplink Control CHannel (PUCCH) delivers HARQ ACK/NACK with respect to downlink transmission and uplink control information such as a scheduling request and a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI). A Physical Uplink Shared CHannel (PUSCH) delivers an UpLink Shared CHannel (UL-SCH). The PUSCH may include HARQ ACK/NACK and Channel State Information (CSI) such as a CQI. Recently, methods for carrying out discovery and direct communication between in-coverage or out-of-coverage devices in a network have been studied for the purpose of public safety, etc. A UE performing D2D communication may be referred as a D2D UE. Further, a UE transmitting a signal based on a D2D communication may be referred to as a transmitting (Tx) UE, and a UE receiving a signal based on a D2D communication may be referred as a receiving (Rx) UE. A Tx UE may transmit a discovery signal, and an Rx UE may receive the discovery signal. A Tx UE and an Rx UE may exchange their roles therebetween. Further, a signal transmitted by a Tx UE can be received by two or more Rx UEs. Also, D2D communication between a Tx UE and an Rx UE may be called a sidelink, which is distinct from existing uplink and downlink between an evolved NodeB and a UE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Hereinafter, a UE is assumed to support D2D communication. A UE supporting a D2D communication may carry out a D2D communication if a user of the terminal switches it on (from switched off state) to make the UE D2D-enabled by manipulating User Interface (UI). Further, a UE may be operated in a D2D-enabled configuration consistently, in accordance with the characteristics of the UE (e.g., a terminal manufactured for public purposes) or subscriber policy (e.g., public safety plan, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Also, network (for example, a D2D server which manages a ProSe (Proximity Services) ID and a ProSe application ID, a serving base station of a corresponding UE) may determine whether a D2D communication is granted at a UE in which its user enabled a D2D communication. More specifically, the UE may carry out a D2D communication only when a D2D communication is granted by a network even though the UE has been enabled to use a D2D communication by the user. Information on whether D2D is granted may be output on a display of the UE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The resources for a D2D communication may be allocated by a UE, e.g., a cluster head, responsible for allocating the resources for a D2D communication or a base station. A UE may need to transmit buffer status report (BSR) for D2D data to the base station or the cluster head during a D2D communication. The base station and the cluster head may be referred to as a base station collectively for convenience of description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The load at a base station can be distributed and reduced if adjacent UEs perform D2D communications in a cellular system. Also, when adjacent UEs carry out D2D communications, UE's transmission power consumption and transmission latency may be reduced because UEs send data to a target located within a relatively short distance. Moreover, from the perspective the whole system, frequency utilization effectiveness is enhanced because existing cellular-based communication and D2D communication use the same resources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">D2D communication may be classified into a communication method of in-coverage UE, which is located in network coverage (base station coverage) and a communication method of out-of-coverage UE, which is located out of network coverage. Also, D2D may be referred to as Proximity based Service (ProSe) or ProSe-D2D. The usage of the term ProSe for D2D is intended not to change the meaning of technology transceiving data directly between UEs, but to indicate the features of proximity-based service in addition to the device-to-device communication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating a concept of cellular network-based Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, according to one or more exemplary embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the communication between a first UE <b>210</b> located in a first cell and a second UE <b>220</b> located in a second cell may be D2D communication between a UE included in a network coverage and a UE included in the network coverage. In addition, the communication between a third UE <b>230</b> located in the first cell and a forth UE <b>240</b> located in a first cluster may be D2D communication between a UE included in a network coverage and a UE located outside the network coverage. The communication between the fourth UE <b>240</b> located in the first cluster and a fifth UE <b>250</b> located in the first cluster may be D2D communication between two UEs located outside the network coverage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">A fifth UE <b>250</b> may operate as a Cluster Head (CH) in a first cluster. A cluster head refers to a UE responsible for allocating resources. The cluster head may include an independent synchronization source (ISS) for synchronizing out-of-coverage UEs. An ISS is a synchronization source other than a base station, which does not induce transmission synchronization from other D2D synchronization sources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In one or more exemplary embodiments, in carrying out a D2D communication, a base station <b>200</b> may transmit Downlink Control Information (DCI) to a first UE <b>210</b>, where the Downlink Control Information may include control information for indicating D2D scheduling assignment (SA) information, which will be transmitted from the first UE <b>210</b> to other D2D UEs. The first UE <b>210</b> is a UE located within the coverage of the base station <b>200</b>. In a D2D communication from a first UE <b>210</b> to other D2D UEs (e.g., a second UE <b>220</b>), D2D SA information may include allocation information about available transmission resources and/or reception resource and other control information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">A first UE <b>210</b>, which received Downlink Control Information including control information for indicating D2D SA information from base station, may transmit D2D SA information to a second UE <b>220</b>. The second terminal <b>220</b> may be a UE located out of the coverage of the base station <b>220</b>. The first UE <b>210</b> and the second UE <b>220</b> may perform D2D communication based on D2D SA information. Specifically, the D2D communication may include: receiving, at the second UE <b>220</b>, D2D SA information; based on the D2D SA information, obtaining information indicating resources in which D2D data of the first UE <b>210</b> is transmitted; and receiving, from the first UE <b>210</b> to the second UE <b>220</b>, data via information indicating resources in which D2D data of the first UE <b>210</b> is transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Various signals may be used for D2D communication. Some definitions are presented below, but are not limited as such.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">First, as a synchronization signal for D2D communication between UEs (D2DSS), there are Primary D2D Synchronization Signal (PD2DSS) and Secondary D2D Synchronization Signal (SD2DSS). Here the entity transmitting a synchronization signal refers to D2D Synchronization Source (D2D SS), and information identifying D2D SS is referred to as Physical Synchronization Source Identity (PSSID).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">D2D SS is a node capable of transmitting D2D synchronization signal, where transmitting D2D (Tx D2D) Synchronization Source is a source from which a UE receives a D2D synchronization signal, and Original D2D Synchronization Source is a source from which a D2D synchronization signal is originated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">D2D SS<sub>ue_net </sub>is a set of D2DSS sequences transmitted from a UE when a transmission timing reference is an eNB, and D2D SS<sub>ue_oon </sub>is a set of D2DSS sequences transmitted from a UE when a transmission timing reference is not an eNB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, one of channels in which system information related to D2D communication or information related to synchronization is transmitted includes Physical D2D Synchronization Channel (PD2DSCH). The examples of control information transmitted on PD2DSCH are D2D frame number (DFN) and out-of-coverage D2D resource pool, and other control information may be included in PD2DSCH and indicated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In a D2D communication, physical layer control information may be transmitted on Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH). In this configuration, the physical layer control information includes Scheduling Assignment (SA) information. Although PSCCH is similar to PUSCH format for Wide Area Network (WAN) communication such as LTE, it corresponds to ProSe dedicated physical channel for transmitting physical layer control information. More specifically, although PSCCH format may be similar to the PUSCH format at least in part, some or all of parameters may be provided as values different from those of a physical channel for a WAN transmission. Further, actual traffic data distinguished from physical layer control information in D2D communication may be referred to as the term D2D data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, since the path for D2D communication may be called sidelink, the term PD2DSCH may include Physical Sidelink Broadcast Channel (PSBCH). Also PSSID may indicate Physical Sidelink Synchronization Identity as well as Physical Synchronization Source Identity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In a D2D communication, a UE may operate in a first mode and a second mode. The first mode is a mode in which the UE is capable of carrying out D2D communication only when the UE has been assigned resources for a D2D communication from a base station, where a base station sends a D2D grant to a transmitting UE, which transmits a D2D signal to another UE. The D2D grant provides the transmitting UE with parameter information that needs to be decided by a base station among pieces of Scheduling Assignment (SA) information that needs to be obtained at a receiving UE for D2D data reception in a D2D communication, resource allocation information for the SA, and resource allocation information for data indicated by the SA. The parameter information that needs to be decided by the base station includes resource allocation information for data indicated by the SA. The D2D grant is forwarded to a transmitting UE in Downlink Control Information (DCI), and may be carried in Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) or Enhanced PDCCH (EPDCCH). The D2D grant may be control information with its distinct D2D purpose indicated by uplink grant or D2D-RNTI assigned to each UE. The D2D grant may be referred to as SA/data grant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">To begin a D2D communication between UEs in the first mode, D2D resource pool may need to be defined in advance. D2D resource pool refers to a set of necessary resources for control information related to D2D communication or data transmission and reception, including resources for D2D scheduling assignment (SA) transmission (“resource for receiving D2D SA” from the perspective of D2D receiving UE), resources for D2D data transmission and reception, resources for transmitting a discovery signal (“resources for receiving a discovery signal” from the perspective of D2D receiving UE), etc. Basically, D2D communication utilizes uplink subframes in which an opportunity for a UE to transmit a signal. Accordingly, in a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) system, every subframe can be a candidate for D2D resource pool, and in a Time Division Duplex (TDD) system, one or more uplink subframes determined according to TDD UL-DL configuration can be a candidate for D2D resource pool.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating a concept of resource pool used for D2D communication and a slot in D2D communication, according to one or more exemplary embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in a LTE frame structure at the top, each frame is assigned system frame number (SFN) 0, 1, . . . , N, where each frame includes 10 subframes. Each subframe includes 2 slots, where the number of each slot n<sub>s </sub>is given 0˜19 in a frame. Also the slot number begins from 0 again once when frame is changed. Here, resources for a UE is allocated in all frames, all subframes, and all slots so that a communication is available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In a D2D frame structure at the bottom, the concept of SFN (or DFN (D2D frame number)) is identical with the frame structure at the top. However, since D2D communication is possible only in a D2D resource pool prepared for D2D communication, the D2D frame structure at the bottom is different from the frame structure at the top where D2D communication is possible in all frames, all subframes, and all slots.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Hereinafter, subframes included in a D2D resource pool are referred to as D2D subframes, and slots included in a D2D resource pool are referred to as D2D slots. Also, the subframes, which are D2D subframes included in a D2D resource pool, used for transmitting synchronization signals, Primary D2D Synchronization Signal (PD2DSS) and Secondary D2D Synchronization Signal (SD2DSS), are referred as D2DSS subframes. In a D2DSS subframe, Physical D2D Synchronization Channel (PD2DSCH) is also transmitted which will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Likewise, as a D2D subframe included in the D2D resource pool, a subframe used for transmitting data in a D2D communication may be referred as D2D data subframe; considering that Physical Sidelink Share Channel (PSSCH) is a channel used for data transmission in the D2D communication, and the D2D subframe may be referred to as PSSCH subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, as a D2D subframe included in the D2D resource pool, the subframe used for transmitting control information such as D2D SA, etc. may be referred as D2D SA subframe; considering that Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH) is the channel used for transmitting control information such as D2D SA, etc., the D2D subframe may be referred to as PSCCH subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, as a D2D subframe included in the D2D resource pool, a subframe used for transmitting a D2D discovery signal may be referred as D2D discovery subframe; considering that the channel used for transmitting the D2D discovery signal is Physical Sidelink Discovery Channel (PSDCH), the D2D subframe may be referred to as PSDCH subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Moreover, PD2DSCH is a channel used for transmitting broadcast information in D2D communication, and may be referred to as Physical Sidelink Broadcast Channel (PSBCH) as described above, and the D2D subframe in which PD2DSCH is transmitted may be referred as PSBCH subframe. Also, since PD2DSCH is also transmitted in D2DSS subframe as stated above, the PSBCH subframe and the D2DSS subframe may be the same subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, a D2DSS subframe may have the structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, but not limited as such. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a D2DSS subframe in a normal cyclic prefix (CP) includes total 14 OFDM symbols in a time axis and total 6 physical resource blocks (PRBs) in a frequency axis. Among 14 OFDM symbols, OFDM symbols corresponding to OFDM symbol numbers 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13 are assigned to PD2DSCH, OFDM symbols corresponding to OFDM symbol numbers 2, 9 are assigned to PD2DSS, OFDM symbols corresponding to OFDM symbol numbers 3, 10 are assigned to SD2DSS, OFDM symbols corresponding to OFDM symbol numbers 4, 11 are assigned to DMRS, OFDM symbol corresponding to OFDM symbol number 14 is used as guard period (GP). The transmission period of D2DSS subframe may be 40 ms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">D2DSS may be transmitted in the D2DSS subframe. D2DSS includes PD2DSS and SD2DSS. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, PD2DSS and SD2DSS may be transmitted using two symbols, respectively, in the D2DSS subframe. Also as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, PD2DSCH may be transmitted in the D2DSS subframe, where Demodulation Reference Signal (DM-RS) may be transmitted as a demodulation reference signal for PD2DSCH. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is just an example, so the exact symbol position may be defined differently in a different position in the synchronization subframe, except that two symbols are used for PD2DSS and SD2DSS, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the second mode, D2D slot number is obtained by re-indexing an index value consecutively from 0 to the slots which belong to a D2D resource pool and applying a modulo-20 operation on each index value. For example, the index values in a D2D resource pool are 0, 1, 2, . . . , 18, 19, 20, 21, . . . , and by applying modulo-20 operation to each index value, D2D slot numbers 0, 1, 2, . . . , 18, 19, 0, 1, . . . are generated. D2D slot numbers are assigned regardless of SFN or DFN, and all of D2D slot numbers 0˜19 need not to be located within one frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In the first mode, D2D slot number is obtained by assigning, contiguously from 0, index values for the slots belonging to uplink subframes between scheduling assignment periods and applying modulo-20 operation on an index value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">D2D slot number may be represented by n<sub>s_D2D</sub>, but not limited as such.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Similarly, D2D subframe number may be defined. Regarding D2D subframes as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the second mode, D2D subframe number is obtained by re-indexing index values for D2D subframes in a D2D resource pool contiguously from 0 and applying modulo-10 operation on each index value. For example, where the index value of D2D subframe in a D2D resource pool is 0, 1, 2, . . . , 8, 9, 10, 11, . . . , application of modulo-10 operation to each index value yields D2D subframe numbers 0, 1, 2, . . . , 8, 9, 0, 1, . . . . That is, D2D subframe numbers are given regardless of SFN or DFN, and all of D2D subframe number 0˜9 are not necessarily located within one frame. In the first mode, D2D subframe number is obtained by assigning, contiguously from 0, index values for the subframes belonging to uplink subframes between scheduling assignment periods and applying modulo-10 operation on each index value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">D2D subframe number may be expressed as n<sub>sf_D2D</sub>, but not limited as such. Also, the relationship between D2D slot number and D2D subframe number can be represented as n<sub>sf_D2D</sub>=└n<sub>s_D2D</sub>/2┘. That is, an integer obtained by rounding down the half of D2D slot number by 2 is D2D subframe number.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As stated above, D2D slot number is a value obtained by re-indexing, contiguously from 0, index values for the slots in a D2D resource pool and applying modulo-20 operation to each of the indexed value. Here, the indexed values just before applying the modulo-20 operation to D2D slot number may be defined as ‘D2D slot number before modulo-20 operation’. The D2D slot number before modulo-20 operation may be expressed as n<sub>ss</sub>, which is the number of sidelink slot (ss). Particularly, in case where the n<sub>ss </sub>is for the slots defined on PSSCH, which is a channel used for data transmission in D2D communication, it may be expressed as n<sub>ss</sub> <sup>PSSCH</sup>, but is not limited as such.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In accordance with the above definitions described herein, the relationship between n<sub>s_D2D </sub>and n<sub>ss </sub>(or n<sub>ss</sub> <sup>PSSCH</sup>) may be expressed as n<sub>s_D2D</sub>=(n<sub>ss</sub>)mod 20 (or n<sub>s_D2D</sub>=(n<sub>ss</sub> <sup>PSSCH</sup>)mod 20).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">As explained in the above, D2D subframe number is a value obtained by re-indexing, contiguously from 0, index values for subframes in a D2D resource pool and applying modulo-10 operation to each index value. Here, the value just before applying modulo-10 operation to D2D subframe number may be defined as ‘D2D subframe number before modulo-10 operation’. The D2D subframe number before modulo-10 operation may be expressed as n<sub>ssf </sub>which is the number of sidelink subframe (ssf), but is not limited as such. Specifically, in case where the n<sub>ssf </sub>is for the slots defined on PSSCH which is a channel used for data transmission in D2D communication, it may be expressed as n<sub>ssf</sub> <sup>PSSCH</sup>, but is not limited as such. Further, the relationship between n<sub>ss </sub>(or n<sub>ss</sub> <sup>PSSCH</sup>) and n<sub>ssf </sub>(or n<sub>ssf</sub> <sup>PSSCH</sup>) may be expressed as n<sub>ss</sub>=└n<sub>ssf</sub>/2┘ (or n<sub>ss</sub> <sup>PSSCH</sup>=└n<sub>ssf</sub> <sup>PSSCH</sup>/2┘).</div>

Details of the TDD UL-DL configurations are defined in 3GPP standards specification, such as “3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical channels and modulation (Release 12)”, 3GPP TS36.211 V12.3.0 (September 2014). Details of TDD UL-DL configurations defined in 3GPP TS36.211 V12.3.0 are hereby incorporated by reference, but exemplary embodiments are not limited thereto. In FDD system, a radio frame (having SFN or DFN) includes ten uplink subframes, and thus the ten uplink subframes in the radio frame may be D2D subframes of a D2D resource pool.</div>
