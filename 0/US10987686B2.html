<heading id="h-0001">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 16/451,702, filed Jun. 25, 2019, now allowed, which is a continuation U.S. application Ser. No. 15/306,224, filed Oct. 24, 2016, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 10,391,506, issued Aug. 27, 2019, which is a national stage filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT/US2015/057686 filed Oct. 28, 2015, which claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/069,512, filed Oct. 28, 2014, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">As described for example in WO98/32539, spray application systems for spraying liquids (e.g. paints, garden chemicals etc.) are generally known. Such systems generally comprise a reservoir to contain a liquid and a spray gun through which the liquid is dispensed. The liquid may be fed from the reservoir under gravity and/or it may be entrained in a stream of pressurized liquid, for example air or water, which is supplied to the gun from an external source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">As also described in WO98/32539 disposable liners have been used with (e.g. re-usable) liquid reservoirs. The liner may aid in disposal of the contents; protect the reservoir or its contents; as well as facilitate or even eliminate the cleaning of the reservoir.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">With current spray (e.g. paint) application systems, a portion of the liquid (e.g. paint) is retained within the liquid reservoir or liner after dispensing the liquid. Depending on the size of the liquid reservoir or liner, the amount of retained paint may range from about Â½ to 1 ounce. In the case of relatively expensive liquids, such as colored automobile base coat paints that can cost $3-$6 per sprayable ounce, the cost of such wasted retained (e.g. paint) liquid can be substantial. Thus, industry would find advantage in minimizing the amount of paint or other liquid that is retained on components of spray application systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Presently described are components of a spray application system. At least one component comprises a liquid repellent surface (e.g. layer). In some embodiments, the liquid repellent surface comprises a fluoropolymer or a (e.g. non-fluorinated) binder and a fluorochemical material. In another embodiment, the liquid repellent surface (e.g. layer) comprises a porous layer and a lubricant impregnated into pores of the porous layer. The component is typically a liquid reservoir, a liquid reservoir liner, a lid for a liquid reservoir or liner, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the component comprises a thermoplastic polymeric material. In some favored embodiments, the component is a removable liquid reservoir or liner. In some favored embodiments, the component is a collapsible liquid reservoir or liner. The spray application system typically further comprises a gravity-fed spray gun.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Also described are spray application systems, methods of using a spray application system, as well as methods of making a component of a spray application system wherein the component has a liquid repellent surface.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodied spray application system. The gun <b>1</b> comprises a body <b>2</b>, a handle <b>3</b> which extends downwards from the rear end of the body, and a spray nozzle <b>4</b> at the front end of the body. The gun is manually-operated by a trigger <b>5</b> which is pivotally-mounted on the sides of the gun. The liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>6</b> is located on the top of the body <b>2</b> and communicates with an internal passageway (not visible) which extends through the gun from a connector <b>7</b> at the lower end of the handle <b>3</b> to the nozzle <b>4</b>. During use, liquid (e.g. paint) is provided in reservoir <b>6</b>. Removable lid <b>8</b> is engaged with the open end of (e.g. paint) liquid reservoir <b>6</b>. Further, connector <b>7</b> is connected to a source of compressed air (not shown) so that, when the user pulls on the trigger <b>5</b>, compressed air is delivered through the gun to nozzle <b>4</b> and entrains and atomizes paint being delivered under gravity from liquid reservoir <b>6</b>. The liquid (e.g. paint) is then discharged through the nozzle <b>4</b> with the compressed air, as a spray.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Various spray gun designs can be utilized in the embodied spray application system, such as described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,582,350; 5,267,693; and EP 0768 921.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the components of another embodied liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>11</b> that can be used with the gun <b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (or any similar gun) instead of liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>6</b>. The liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>11</b> comprises an open container <b>12</b>, of suitable size for attachment to a (e.g. hand-held) spray gun, having an air hole <b>12</b>A in its base and provided with a liner <b>13</b>. The liner <b>13</b> corresponds in shape to and fits within the interior of container <b>12</b>. The (e.g. removable) liner may have a narrow rim <b>14</b> at the open end that contacts the top edge of the container <b>12</b>. The container <b>12</b> also has a (e.g. disposable) lid <b>15</b>. Lid <b>15</b> typically engages rim <b>14</b> of the open end of the liner <b>13</b> and is held firmly in place when lid <b>15</b> is attached to container <b>12</b>. The lid can be attached by an annular collar <b>20</b> which screws onto the container, such as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Liquid reservoir <b>6</b> or container <b>12</b> of the liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>11</b> is typically formed from a self-supporting (e.g. rigid) thermoplastic polymeric material, for example polyethylene or polypropylene, of any suitable size. For use with paint spray guns, containers having a capacity ranging from 100 ml to 1 liter such as a capacity of 250, 500 or 800 ml are common. The lid <b>15</b> is also typically formed from a thermoplastic polymeric material, for example, polyethylene or polypropylene. The lid may be transparent, translucent or opaque and may optionally be colored. The collar <b>20</b> may be a molded thermoplastic or it may be a machined metal (for example, aluminum). In some embodiments, fluid reservoir <b>6</b> and container <b>12</b> are formed by injection molding of a thermoplastic polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Liquid reservoir <b>6</b>, as well as liner <b>13</b>, are typically also self-supporting but can also be collapsible, i.e. collapses when (e.g. paint) liquid is withdrawn from the liner or liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir during operation of the spray gun. In one embodiment, the liner <b>13</b> or liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>6</b> have a (e.g. thicker) rigid base <b>13</b>A and (e.g. thinner) flexible side walls <b>13</b>B. In this embodiment, the base may have a thickness of about 250 to 400 microns. In contrast, the side walls can range from about 100 to 250 microns and in some embodiments are no greater than 225, 200 or 175 microns. When the liner collapses, it typically collapses in the longitudinal direction by virtue of the side walls collapsing rather than the base. Liner <b>13</b> and some embodiments of liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>6</b> are preferably formed by thermo/vacuum forming a sheet of thermoplastic material such as low density polyethylene (LDPE). When the liner <b>13</b> or liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>6</b> is collapsible it can be characterized as a single-use or in other words âdisposableâ component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The lid <b>15</b> typically include a (e.g. central) aperture <b>16</b> from which extends a connector tube <b>17</b> provided, at its end, with outward extensions <b>18</b> forming one part of a connection, such as a bayonet connection; i.e. a fitting engaged by being pushed into a socket and then twisted to lock in place. The liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>11</b> can be attached to the spray gun <b>1</b> through the use of an adapter <b>21</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The adapter <b>21</b> is a tubular component which, at one end <b>22</b>, is formed internally with the other part of the (e.g. bayonet) connection for attachment to the connector tube <b>17</b>. The other end <b>23</b> of the adapter can be shaped to match the standard attachment of the spray gun (typically a screw thread). The adapter <b>21</b> may be a machined metal component and may, for example, be formed from anodized aluminum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">During use of the spray application system, adapter <b>21</b> is securely attached (at end <b>23</b>) to the spray gun. Liner <b>13</b> is inserted into container <b>12</b>. Liquid (e.g. paint) is then put into liner <b>13</b>, lid <b>15</b> is pushed into place, and collar <b>20</b> engaged (e.g. screwed down) tightly with container <b>12</b> to hold the lid in position. The rim <b>14</b> of the liner <b>13</b> is typically held in place between lid <b>15</b> and container <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As paint is removed from within the liner <b>13</b>, the sides of the liner collapse as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as a result of the decreased pressure within the liner. The base of the liner, being more rigid, retains its shape so that the liner tends to collapse in the longitudinal rather than the transverse direction thereby reducing the possibility of pockets of paint being trapped in the liner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The liner <b>13</b> typically has a smooth (e.g. continuous) internal surface, lacking structures that would increase retention of the liquid (e.g. paint). Thus, the liner typically has no discontinuities (projections or indentations) from a planar surface such as pleats, corrugations, seams, joints, gussets, or groove at the internal junction of the side walls <b>13</b>B with the base <b>13</b>A. Further, the liner volumetrically coincides with the inside of the container <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Liquid (e.g. paint) can be mixed within liner <b>13</b> or within liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>6</b>. To facilitate the use as a mixing receptacle, the side walls of the container <b>12</b> or liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir <b>6</b> may be provided with markings <b>25</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) enabling the volume of the contents within the container to be determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Although fluid reservoir <b>6</b>, container <b>12</b>, and liner <b>13</b> may be opaque, such components are preferably transparent or translucent such that the liquid can be visually observed through the walls. This can also facilitate using the fluid reservoir <b>6</b>, or container <b>12</b> and liner <b>13</b> as a mixing receptacle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Liquid (e.g. paint) contained in the liquid reservoir <b>6</b> or liner <b>13</b> it is often mixed by hand. Hand mixing can be beneficial to avoid air entrapment. The inside surfaces of the liquid reservoir <b>6</b> or liner <b>13</b> are also typically not exposed to high amounts of mixing forces when mixed by hand. However, the side walls of the mixing container may be âscrapedâ in order to ensure all of the toners are thoroughly mixed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the liners are thermoformed, injection molded, blow molded (or formed using some other plastic processing technique) from materials such as, but not necessarily limited to, low density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene, and/or blends thereof. Suitable liner components are commercially available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn. under trade designation â3M PPS PAINT PREPARATION SYSTEMâ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">To ensure that there are no unwanted particles, the liquid (e.g. paint) typically passes through a (e.g. removable) filter as the (e.g. paint) liquid passes from the liquid reservoir <b>6</b> or liner <b>13</b> to the spray nozzle during use of the spray application system. Such filter can be positioned at various locations. In one embodiment, aperture <b>16</b> is covered by a filter mesh <b>19</b> which may be a push fit into the aperture or may be an integral part of the lid <b>15</b>, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In another embodiment, a filter may be provided within liquid reservoir <b>6</b>, as described and depicted in FIG. 12 of WO 98/32539.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7 and 8 and 11</figref> depict examples of illustrative liquid (e.g. paint) reservoirs, liquid reservoir liners, lids for liquid (e.g. paint) reservoirs and liners. Such components may optionally include various other adaptations as known in the art for spray application systems, as described for examples in WO 98/32539.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In the present invention, a component (e.g. a liquid reservoir, a liquid reservoir liner, a lid for a liquid reservoir or liner, or a combination thereof) of a spray application system comprises a liquid repellent surface (e.g. layer). The liquid repellent surface layer may be present on a portion of a surface of at least one of such components or the liquid repellent surface layer may be present on the entire surface that comes in contact with liquid (e.g. paint) during use. Although the exterior surfaces of the liquid reservoir, liner, lid, etc. may comprise the liquid repellent surface layer described herein, in typical embodiments, the interior surface(s) of at least one of such components comprises a liquid repellent surface layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, article <b>100</b> is a component of a spray application system comprising substrate <b>110</b> (e.g. a liner, liquid reservoir, or lid), and a liquid (e.g. paint) repellent surface comprising a porous layer <b>128</b> disposed on a (e.g. paint or other liquid contacting) surface of the substrate, and a lubricant <b>150</b> disposed in pores <b>125</b> of the surface treated porous layer. The surface treated porous layer (<b>120</b> with <b>128</b>) is positioned between the substrate <b>110</b> and the impregnated lubricant <b>150</b>. However, in some embodiment, portions of the porous layer are evident at the outermost surface surrounded by valleys of lubricant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In one favored embodiment, the porous layer comprises a plurality of sintered inorganic oxide (e.g. silica) particles <b>125</b> arranged to form a porous three-dimensional network. The porous layer comprises a hydrophobic layer <b>128</b> disposed on the porous three-dimensional network. The hydrophobic layer is generally disposed on the opposing surface of the porous layer relative to the surface of the porous layer disposed on (e.g. in contact with) the substrate or component of the spray application system. Thus, the porous layer can be considered to have two major surfaces, one major surface disposed on a substrate or component, and the opposing major surface comprising the hydrophobic coating impregnated with lubricant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the porous layer includes a porous network of sintered inorganic oxide particles. In typical embodiments, the inorganic oxide particles comprise or consist of silica. However, various other inorganic oxide particles can be used in place of silica or in combination with silica, such as alumina, titania, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The term ânanoparticleâ refers to particles that are submicron in size. In some embodiments, the nanoparticles have an average particle size, which typically refers to the average longest dimension of the particles, that is no greater than 500 nanometers, no greater than 200 nanometers, no greater than 100 nanometers, no greater than 75 nanometers, no greater than 50 nanometers, no greater than 40 nanometers, no greater than 25 nanometers, no greater than 20 nanometers, no greater than 10 nanometers, or no greater than 5 nanometers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The average particle size is often determined using transmission electron microscopy but various light scattering methods can be used as well. The average particle size refers to the average particle size of the nanoparticles used to form the porous layer coating. That is, the average particle size refers to the average particle size of the inorganic oxide nanoparticles prior to sintering, such as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the porous layer comprises thermally sintered inorganic oxide nanoparticles, such as fumed silica. Fumed silica is advantageously lower in cost in comparison to smaller non-aggregated nanoparticles. Fumed silica is commercially available from various suppliers including Evonik, under the trade designation âAerosilâ; Cabot under the trade designation âCab-O-Silâ, and Wacker Chemie-Dow Corning. Fumed silica consists of microscopic droplets of amorphous silica fused into branched, chainlike, three-dimensional secondary aggregate particle. Thus, the fumed silica aggregates comprise sub-particles that are often referred to as primary particles, typically ranging in size from about 5 to 50 nm. Further, the aggregates can agglomerate. Thus, the particle size of the aggregates and agglomerates is considerably larger. For example, the average particle size (of aggregates and agglomerates) is typically greater than 10 microns (without sonication). Further, the average aggregate particle size after 90 seconds of sonication typically ranges from 0.3 to 0.4 microns. The energy of mixing the fumed silica into a liquid medium is generally less than 90 seconds of sonication. Hence, the particle size of fumed silica in the liquid medium and dried coating thereof is surmised to range between the aggregate particle size (e.g. 0.3 to 0.4 microns) and the particle size without sonication (10 microns).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In certain embodiments, bimodal distributions of particle sizes may be used. For example, nanoparticles or particles having an average particle size of at least 150 or 200 nanometers can be used in combination with nanoparticles having an average (non-aggregate) particle size of no greater than 100, 80, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10 nanometers. The smaller sized sintered nanoparticles can be considered âmortarâ for the larger particle size âbricksâ. The weight ratio of the larger to smaller nanoparticles can be in the range of 2:98 to 98:2, in the range of 5:95 to 95:5, in the range of 10:90 to 90:10, or in the range of 20:80 to 80:20. In this embodiment, the larger sized particles may be fumed silica. The particle size of the larger inorganic oxide particles is typically no greater than 30, 25, 20 or 15 microns. In some embodiments, the porous layer is free of particles having a particle size greater than 10 microns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The inclusion of larger particles can increase porosity and lower cost. However, the use of larger particles detracts from providing thin, uniform porous layers. Additionally, larger particles may result in the porous layer and repellent coating having a hazy appearance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the (e.g. silica) nanoparticles preferably have an average particle size (i.e., longest dimension) that is no greater than 100, 80, 50, 40, 30, 20 or 10 nanometers. In this embodiment, the porous layer may be free of particles having an average particle size greater than 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 nanometers, such as fumed silica.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The (e.g. silica) inorganic oxide particles used to prepare the porous layer coating compositions can have any desired shape or mixture of shapes. The (e.g. silica) particles can be spherical or non-spherical (i.e., acicular) with any desired aspect ratio. Aspect ratio refers to the ratio of the average longest dimension of the particles to the average shortest dimension of acicular particles. The aspect ratio of acicular (e.g. silica) particles is often at least 2:1, at least 3:1, at least 5:1, or at least 10:1. Some acicular particles are in the shape of rods, ellipsoids, needles, and the like. The shape of the particles can be regular or irregular. The porosity of the coatings can be varied by changing the amount of regular and irregular shaped particles in the composition and/or by changing the amount of spherical and acicular particles in the composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">For embodiments wherein the (e.g. silica) nanoparticles are spherical, the average diameter is often less than 50 nanometers, less than 40 nanometers, less than 25 nanometers, or less than 20 nanometers. Some nanoparticles can have an even smaller average diameter such as less than 10 nanometers or less than 5 nanometers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">For embodiments wherein the (e.g. silica) nanoparticles are acicular, they often have an average width (smallest dimension) equal to at least 1 nanometer, at least 2 nanometers, or at least 5 nanometers. The average width of acicular (e.g. silica) nanoparticles is often no greater than 25 nanometers, no greater than 20 nanometers, or no greater than 10 nanometers. The acicular nanoparticles can have an average length D<sub>1 </sub>measured by dynamic light scattering methods that is, for example, at least 40 nanometers, at least 50 nanometers, at least 75 nanometers, or at least 100 nanometers. The average length D<sub>1 </sub>(e.g., longer dimension) can be up to 200 nanometers, up to 400 nanometers, or up to 500 nanometers. The acicular nanoparticles may have degree of elongation D1/D2 in a range of 5 to 30, wherein D2 means a diameter in nanometers calculated by the equation D2=2720/S and S means specific surface area in meters squared per gram (m<sup>2</sup>/gram) of the nanoparticle, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,497 (Watanabe et al.).</div>

In other embodiments, the particles (e.g. nanoparticles) typically have an average specific surface area equal to at least 500 m<sup>2</sup>/gram, at least 600 m<sup>2</sup>/gram, or at least 700 m<sup>2</sup>/gram.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The (e.g. silica) inorganic oxide nanoparticles are typically commercially available in the form of a sol. Some examples of aqueous-based silica sols comprising spherical silica nanoparticles are commercially available under the trade designation LUDOX (e.g., LUDOX SM) from E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. (Wilmington, Del.). Other aqueous-based silica sols are commercially available under the trade designation NYACOL from Nyacol Co. (Ashland, Mass.). Still other aqueous-based silica sols are commercially available under the trade designation NALCO (e.g., NALCO 1115, NALCO 2326, and NALCO 1130) from Ondea Nalco Chemical Co. (Oak Brook, Ill.). Yet other aqueous-based silica sols are commercially available under the trade designation REMASOL (e.g., REMASOL SP30) from Remet Corporation (Utica, N.Y.) and under the trade designation SILCO (e.g., SILCO LI-518) from Silco International Inc (Portland, Oreg.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Suitable non-spherical (i.e., acicular) inorganic oxide nanoparticles may also be obtained in the form of aqueous-based sol. Some acircular silica nanoparticles sols are available under the trade designation SNOWTEX from Nissan Chemical Industries (Tokyo, Japan). For example, SNOWTEX-UP contains silica nanoparticles having a diameter in the range of about 9 to 15 nanometers with lengths in a range of 40 to 300 nanometers. SNOWTEX-PS-S and SNOWTEX-PS-M have a chain of beads morphology. The SNOWTEX-PS-M particles are about 18 to 25 nanometers in diameter and have lengths of 80 to 150 nanometers. The SNOWTEX-PS-S has a particle diameter of 10-15 nm and a length of 80-120 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The particles in the porous layer are sintered. At least some adjacent inorganic oxide particles tend to have bonds such as inorganic oxide (e.g. silica) ânecksâ joining them together. Stated differently, at least some adjacent particles tend to be joined (i.e. fused) together forming a three-dimensional porous network. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a transmission electron micrograph of one example of a porous layer comprising sintered nanoparticles. Since sintering is utilized to bond the particles to each other, the porous layer of the sintered particles typically does not include an organic (e.g. polymeric) binder for the purpose of fixing the particles to the component. Thus, the inorganic oxide content of the sintered porous layer is typically at least 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100 wt-%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The term ânetworkâ refers to a continuous three-dimensional structure formed by linking together inorganic oxide (e.g. silica) particles. The term âcontinuousâ means that the individual particles are linked over a sufficient dimension (e.g. area) such that the porous layer, together with the hydrophobic layer and impregnated lubricant can provide the desired repellency of water or other fluid. In typical embodiments, the porous layer has no gaps or discontinuities in the areas where the sintered porous layer is present on the component. However, some discontinuities or gaps may be present provided that the presence thereof does not detract from the desired repellency properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The term âporousâ refers to the presence of voids between the individual (e.g. silica) particles within the (e.g. continuous) porous layer coating. The network of (dried) sintered particles has a porosity of 20 to 50 volume percent, 25 to 45 volume percent, or 30 to 40 volume percent. Porosity may be calculated from the refractive index of the porous layer coating according to published procedures such as in W. L. Bragg and A. B. Pippard, <i>Acta Crystallographica, </i>6, 865 (1953). Porosity tends to correlate to the roughness of the surface. In some embodiments, the porosity may be greater than 50 volume percent. Porosity of the surface can often be increased by using (e.g. silica) particles with a larger average particle size or by using a mixture of particles with different shapes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the sintered nanoparticles are acid-sintered (e.g. silica) nanoparticles. In this embodiment, the porous layer is prepared from a coating composition that contains an acid having a pKa (H<sub>2</sub>O) that is less than or equal to 3.5. The use of weaker acids such as those having a pKa greater than 4 (e.g., acetic acid) can result in less uniform coatings. In particular, coating compositions with weaker acids such as acetic acid typically bead up on the surface of a component. The pKa of the acid added to the coating composition is often less than 3, less than 2.5, less than 2, less than 1.5, or less than 1. Useful acids that can be used to adjust the pH of the porous coating composition include both organic and inorganic acids. Example acids include, but are not limited to, oxalic acid, citric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, CF<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, HCl, HBr, HI, HBrO<sub>3</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, HClO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H, CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H, CF<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, and CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>OH. In many embodiments, the acid is HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. In some embodiments, it is desirable to provide a mixture of an organic and inorganic acid. If commercially available acidic silica sols are used, the addition of a stronger acid can improve the uniformity of the porous layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">For embodiments wherein the sintered nanoparticles are acid-sintered (e.g. silica) nanoparticles, the coating composition generally contains sufficient acid to provide a pH no greater than 5. The pH is often no greater than 4.5, no greater than 4, no greater than 3.5, or no greater than 3. For example, the pH is often in the range of 2 to 5. In some embodiments, the coating composition can be adjusted to a pH in the range of 5 to 6 after first reducing the pH to less than 5. This pH adjustment can allow the coating of more pH sensitive components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The porous layer coating composition containing the acidified (e.g. silica) nanoparticles usually is applied to a component surface and then dried. In many embodiments, the porous layer coating composition contains (a) (e.g. silica) nanoparticles having an average particle diameter (i.e., average particle diameter prior to acid-sintering) no greater than 40 nanometers and (b) an acid with a pKa (H<sub>2</sub>O) that is less than or equal to 3.5. The pH of the porous layer coating composition often is less than or equal to 5 such as in the pH range of 2 to 5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The acidified (e.g. silica) nanoparticles exhibit a stable appearance when the pH is in the range 2 to 4. Light-scattering measurements have demonstrated that the acidified silica nanoparticles at pH in the range of 2 to 3 and at a concentration of 10 weight percent silica nanoparticles can retain the same size for more than a week or even more than a month. Such acidified porous layer coating compositions are expected to remain stable even longer if the concentration of silica nanoparticles is lower than 10 weight percent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In other embodiments, the sintered nanoparticles are base sintered (e.g. silica) nanoparticles. In this embodiment, the porous layer can be prepared from a nanoparticle sol having a pH of greater than 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, or 10 and the sintered nanoparticles may be characterized as base-sintered (e.g. silica) nanoparticles.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The porous layer is generally prepared by coating an inorganic oxide (e.g. silica) nanoparticle sol on a surface of a component. A sol is a colloidal suspension of the nanoparticles in a continuous liquid medium. Thus, the sol is utilized as a coating composition. The sol typically comprises water or a mixture of water plus a water-miscible organic solvent. Suitable water-miscible organic solvents include, but are not limited to, various alcohols (e.g., ethanol or isopropanol) and glycols (e.g., propylene glycol), ethers (e.g., propylene glycol methyl ether), ketones (e.g., acetone), and esters (e.g., propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate). The (e.g. silica) nanoparticles included in the porous layer coating compositions typically are not surface modified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, optional silane coupling agents, that contain a plurality of reactive silyl groups, can be added to the porous layer coating compositions. Some example coupling agents include, but are not limited to, tetraalkoxysilanes (e.g., tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS)) and oligomeric forms of tetraalkoxysilane such as alkyl polysilicates (e.g., poly(diethoxysiloxane). These coupling agents may, at least in some embodiments, improve binding between silica particles. If added, the coupling agent is typically added to the porous layer coating composition in an amount of 1 to 10 or 1 to 5 weight percent based on the weight of silica particles. However, in typical embodiments, the porous layer (i.e. prior to deposition of the hydrophobic layer) is free of silane coupling agent such as tetraalkoxysilanes (e.g., tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS)) and oligomeric forms of tetraalkoxysilane such as alkyl polysilicates (e.g., poly(diethoxysiloxane).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The sol coating compositions can be applied directly to any component. The component can be an organic material (e.g., polymeric) or inorganic material (e.g., glass, ceramic, or metal). The surface energy of the component surface may be increased by oxidizing the component surface prior to coating using methods such as corona discharge or flame treatment methods. These methods may also improve adhesion of the porous layer to the component. Other methods capable of increasing the surface energy of the component include the use of primer layers such as thin coatings of polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC). Alternatively, the surface tension of the porous layer coating composition may be decreased by addition of lower alcohols (e.g., alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments a surfactant may be included in the (e.g. sol) coating composition. Surfactants are molecules having both hydrophilic (polar) and hydrophobic (non-polar) regions and that are capable of reducing the surface tension of the porous layer coating composition. Useful surfactants include anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, and nonionic surfactants. Various surfactants can be utilized, such as described in US2013/0216820, US2014/0120340 and WO2013/127054; incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">When added, the surfactant is typically present in an amount up to 5 weight percent based on a total weight of the porous layer coating composition. For example, the amount can be up to 4 weight percent, up to 2 weight percent, or up to 1 weight percent. The surfactant is typically present in an amount equal to at least 0.001 weight percent, at least 0.005 weight percent, at least 0.01 weight percent, at least 0.05 weight percent, at least 0.1 weight percent, or at least 0.5 weight percent. However, in some embodiments, the porous layer is substantially free of surfactant. Surfactants can interfere with adhesion of the porous layer to the component and/or the hydrophobic layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The (e.g. sol) coating compositions are typically applied to the surface of the component using conventional techniques such as, for example, bar coating, roll coating, curtain coating, rotogravure coating, knife coating, spray coating, spin coating, or dip coating techniques. Coating techniques such as bar coating, roll coating, and knife coating are often used to adjust the thickness of the coating composition. The coating compositions can be coated on one or more sides of the component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The average dry coating thickness of the porous layer is dependent upon the particular porous layer coating composition used. In general, the average thickness of the dry and sintered porous layer is typically at least 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 nm and often no greater than about 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 micron. In some embodiments, the thickness is no greater than 500, 400, or 300 nm. In other embodiments, the thickness is no greater than 250, 200, or 100 nm. The thickness can be measured using an ellipsometer such as a Gaertner Scientific Corp. Model No. L115C. The mechanical properties of the porous layer often improve as the thickness is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Although the actual coating thickness can vary considerably from one particular point to another, it is often desirable to apply the porous layer coating composition uniformly over the surface of the component. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to control the average coating thickness within 200 â«, within 150 â«, or within 100 â«. The particle size of the nanoparticles and larger particles affects the ability to achieve a thin, uniform coating. Thus, in some embodiments, the thickness of the coating is greater than the maximum particle size of the nanoparticles and larger particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Once applied to the component, the coating composition is typically dried at temperatures in a range from 20Â° C. to 250Â° C. In some embodiments, the coating composition is dried at a temperature no greater than 225Â° C., 200Â° C., 175Â° C., 150Â° C., 125Â° C. or 100Â° C. An oven with circulating air or inert gas such as nitrogen is often used for drying purposes. The temperature may be increased further to speed the drying process, but care should be exercised to avoid damage to the component. For inorganic components, the drying temperature can be above 200Â° C. The dried porous layer refers to the porous layer remaining after the drying process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">After the (e.g. sol) coating composition is applied to the component, a gelled material forms as the sol dries and the (e.g. silica) acidified nanoparticles sinter to form the continuous network. Thus, in this embodiment, the drying temperature is also the temperature at which the sintering occurs. Micrographs reveal the formation of ânecksâ between adjacent nanoparticles that are created even in the absence of other silicon-containing materials such as the silane coupling agents. The formation of these necks is attributed to the catalytic action of strong acid or strong base in making and breaking siloxane bonds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Alternatively, for substrates or components having sufficient heat resistance, the inorganic oxide (silica) particles can be thermally sintered, typically at temperatures substantially greater than 200Â° C. For example it is common to thermally sinter (e.g. silica) particles at temperatures of greater than 300Â° C., 400Â° C., or 500Â° C. ranging up to 1000Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The dried porous layer can contain some water such as the amount of water typically associated with equilibrium of the porous layer with the atmospheric moisture present in the environment of the porous layer. This equilibrium amount of water is typically no greater than 5 weight percent, no greater than 3 weight percent, no greater than 2 weight percent, no greater than 1 weight percent, or no greater than 0.5 weight percent based on a total weight of the dried porous layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Although a three-dimensional network of sintered inorganic oxide (e.g. silica) particles is a preferred porous layer in view of durability, various other porous layers are also suitable for lubricant impregnation, as described in the art. For example, as described in US2014/0147627; porous layers can alternatively be formed by spraying an emulsion of particles/nanoparticles that assemble into a porous layer upon drying of the solvent. Further, porous layers can also be produced via electrodeposition, mechanical roughening (e.g. abrasive blasting), dry etching, and polymer fiber spinning. In one embodiment, the porous layer is formed by exposing a surface of the component to a solvent (e.g., acetone). For example, the solvent may impart texture by inducing crystallization (e.g., polycarbonate liquid reservoirs may recrystallize when exposed to acetone). In yet another embodiment, the porous layer can be formed from particle/nanoparticles, a solvent, and a polymeric organic binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">A hydrophobic layer is disposed on a surface of the porous three-dimensional network of the sintered inorganic oxide (e.g. silica) particles. A hydrophobic layer can also be disposed on a surface of the porous layer formed by other methods as just described. This is accomplished by coating a surface of the (e.g. sintered) porous layer with a hydrophobic material</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The selection of hydrophobic material is typically based on the selection of lubricant. In typical embodiments, the hydrophobic layer comprises a material of the same chemical class as the lubricant. For example, when the hydrophobic layer comprises a fluorinated material (e.g. comprising a fluorinated group), the lubricant is typically a fluorinated liquid. Likewise, when the hydrophobic layer comprises a hydrocarbon material (e.g. comprising a hydrocarbon group), the lubricant is typically a hydrocarbon liquid. Further, when the hydrophobic layer comprises a silane or siloxane material (lacking long chain alkyl groups), the lubricant is typically a silicone fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the hydrophobic layer may comprise an organic polymeric material such as polydimethylsiloxane or a fluoropolymer composed of tetrafluoroethylene, optionally in combination with hexafluoropropylene and/or vinylidene fluoride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">However, in typical embodiments, the hydrophobic layer is bonded to the porous layer. In this embodiment, the hydrophobic layer comprises a compound having the general formula A-B or A-B-A, wherein A is an inorganic group capable of bonding with the sintered (e.g. silica) particles and B is a hydrophobic group. In some embodiments, A is a reactive silyl group. The (e.g. silane) hydrophobic surface treatment compounds are typically covalently bonded to the porous layer through a âSiâOâSiâ bond. Suitable hydrophobic groups include aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon groups, fluorinated groups such as polyfluoroether, polyfluoropolyether and perfluoroalkane.</div>

Preferred solvents often include aliphatic alcohols, perfluorinated hydrocarbons, fluorinated hydrocarbons, hydrofluoroethers, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the surface treatment composition contains aliphatic alcohols, hydrofluoroethers, or combinations thereof.

US2014/0120340 and US2013/0216820.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">After coating a surface of the sintered porous layer with a hydrophobic compound and evaporating any solvent that is present, a lubricant is coated onto the surface treated porous layer of sintered inorganic oxide particles thereby impregnating the lubricant into pores of the surface treated porous layer. By impregnate, it is meant that the pores are saturated with the lubricant. Further, the lubricant is held in place within the pores by surface tension forces, capillary forces, van der Waal forces (e.g., suction), or combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">The repellent surface layer of the spray application system component is typically not exposed to forces in excess of the forces that hold the lubricant in place within the pores. Thus, in some embodiments, the repellent surface layer is suitable for liquid (e.g. paint) reservoirs, liners, and lid wherein the liquid (e.g. paint) is mixed within such components in a manner (such as by hand mixing) such that the mixing forces are less than the forces that hold the lubricant within the pores of the porous layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">The impregnating lubricant may be sprayed or brushed onto the (e.g. surface treated) porous layer. In one embodiment, the lubricant is applied by filling or partially filling a container that includes the component having the (e.g. surface treated) porous layer. The excess impregnating liquid is then removed from the container. Additional methods for impregnating lubricant include spin coating processes and condensing the lubricant onto the (e.g. surface treated) porous layer. The lubricant can also be applied by depositing a solution with the lubricant and one or more volatile liquids (e.g., via any of the previously described methods) and evaporating away the one or more volatile liquids. With any of these methods, the excess lubricant may be mechanically removed (e.g., pushed off the surface with a solid object or fluid), absorbed off of the surface using another porous material, removed via gravity or centrifugal forces or removed by utilizing a wash liquid (e.g., water or paint) to remove excess lubricant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">The lubricant is generally a liquid at the use temperature of the coated component. Although environmental use temperatures can range from â40Â° C. to 45Â° C., use temperatures most commonly range from 40Â° F. to 120Â° F. In typical embodiments, the lubricant is a liquid at room temperature (e.g. 25Â° C.). In typically embodiments, a single lubricant is utilized. However, a mixture of lubricants can also be used, especially mixtures within the same chemical class.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">By âliquidâ it is meant that the lubricant has a dynamic (shear) viscosity of at least about 0.1, 0.5, or 1 mPas and no greater than 10<sup>7 </sup>mPas at the use temperature. In typical embodiments, the dynamic viscosity is no greater than 10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>, or 10<sup>3 </sup>mPas.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">The lubricant generally has no solubility or only trace solubility with water, e.g., a solubility of 0.01 g/l or 0.001 g/l or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments, the surface tension at the boundary of the lubricant is preferably &lt;50 mN/m, in particular is in the range from 5 to 45 mN/m, and specifically is in the range from 10 to 40 mN/m at 20Â° C., in particular when the liquid that is being repelled from the surface is an aqueous liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">In some embodiments, the lubricant is a hydrocarbon fluid. Suitable lubricants include low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons such as saturated hydrocarbons having at least 8 carbon atoms, preferably at least 10 carbon atoms, in particular from 10 to about 20 carbon atoms, e.g. octanes, nonanes, decanes, decalins, undecanes, dodecanes, tetradecanes, and hexadecane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In some embodiments, the lubricant is a branched C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>50 </sub>hydrocarbon, such as polyisobutenes or mineral oil.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">The hydrocarbon lubricant can optionally comprise substituents such as in the case of alkanols and diols having at least 8 carbon atoms, preferably at least 10 carbon atoms, e.g. 3-octanol, 1-decanol, 2-decanol, undecanols, dodecanols, tridecanols, 2-hexadecanol, 2-hexyldecanol, and 2-octyl-1-dodecanol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">In some embodiments, the lubricant is a fluorinated fluid such as perfluorohydrocarbons (also referred to as perfluoroalkanes), polyfluoroethers, and polyfluroropolyethers. Perfluorohydrocarbons typically have at least 8 carbon atoms, preferably at least 10 carbon atoms, in particular from 10 to 40 carbon atoms, e.g. perfluorodecalins, perfluoroeicosanes, and perfluorotetracosanes. Suitable perfluoropolyethers are available from DuPont as the trade designation KRYTOX. Other suitable perfluoropolyethers are available from Sigma-Aldrich, ranging in molecular weight from about 1500 to about 3500 amu, such as available under the trade designation FOMBLIN Y.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Other suitable lubricants include silicone fluids. The silicones are generally linear, branched, or cyclic polydimethylsiloxanes, or polymethylhydrosiloxanes. These may have various organic end-groups or side-chains. Silicone lubricants are commercially available from Rhodia, Gelest, and Fischer Scientific.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">The method of making an article as described herein generally comprises providing a component, forming a surface treated porous layer on a surface of the component, wherein the porous layer comprises sintered inorganic oxide (e.g. silica) particles and impregnating a lubricant into pores of the surface treated porous layer. The method of forming the surface treated porous layer typically comprises coating a plurality of inorganic oxide particles dispersed in a liquid medium onto a surface of the component. Such coating is also referred to herein as a sol. The sintering of the inorganic oxide nanoparticles can occur during drying of the sol when the sol contains a strong acid or base or the inorganic oxide particles can be thermally sintered, as previously described. After sintering, the porous layer contains a plurality of sintered particles arranged to form a (e.g. continuous) three-dimensional network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">The hydrophobic compound can also be dispersed in a liquid medium (e.g. aqueous and/or organic solvent) and applied to the porous layer as a coating composition. The hydrophobic coating composition can be applied to the porous layer using any suitable application method. The application method often involves forming a coating layer by dip coating, spin coating, spray coating, wiping, roll coating, brushing, spreading, flow coating, or the like, or combinations thereof. Alternatively the hydrophobic compound can be applied to the porous layer via vapor deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">The hydrophobic coating composition is typically applied to the porous layer at room temperature (typically in a range of 15Â° C. to 30Â° C. or in a range of 20Â° C. to 25Â° C.). Alternatively, the porous layer can be preheated at an elevated temperature such as, for example, in a range of 40Â° C. to 200Â° C., in a range of 50Â° C. to 175Â° C., or in a range of 60Â° C. to 150Â° C. before application of the hydrophobic coating composition. The resulting coating can be dried and then cured at ambient temperature (for example, in the range of 15Â° C. to 30Â° C. or in the range of 20Â° C. to 25Â° C.) or at an elevated temperature (for example, in the range of 40Â° C. to 200Â° C., in the range of 50Â° C. to 175Â° C., or in the range of 50Â° C. to 100Â° C.) for a time sufficient for the curing to take place.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Typically, the hydrophobic layer coating is applied to the porous layer on the component such that after curing, a hydrophobic layer is formed over the porous layer. That is, the porous layer is positioned between the component and the hydrophobic layer. The hydrophobic layer can be a monolayer or greater than a monolayer in thickness. When greater than a monolayer in thickness, the hydrophobic layer is typically a small fraction of the total thickness and may generally range from a few nanometers to 50, 75 or 100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">In some embodiments, the method further comprises bonding the hydrophobic compound to the porous layer by reacting a surface of the sintered (e.g. silica) particles in the porous layer with a silane compound. The silane compound contains both a reactive silyl group and a hydrophobic group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">After application to the porous layer, the hydrophobic coating composition can be dried and cured by exposure to heat and/or moisture. Curing attaches the silane compound to the porous layer. Curing results in the formation of the âSiâOâSiâ bond between the silane compound and the sintered (e.g. silica) particles in the porous layer. The resulting hydrophobic layer is attached to the component through the porous layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">If a crosslinker is included in the coating composition, these materials can react with any remaining reactive silyl groups on the silane compound. Moisture cure can be affected at temperatures ranging from room temperature (for example, 20Â° C. to 25Â° C.) up to about 80Â° C. or more. Moisture curing times can range from a few minutes (for example, at the higher temperatures such as 80Â° C. or higher) to hours (for example, at the lower temperatures such as at or near room temperature).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">For the attachment of the silane compound to the porous layer, sufficient water typically can be present to cause hydrolysis of the hydrolyzable groups described above, so that condensation to form âSiâOâSiâ groups can occur (and thereby curing can be achieved). The water can be, for example, present in the hydrocarbon layer coating composition, adsorbed on the component surface, or in the ambient atmosphere. Typically, sufficient water can be present if the coating method is carried out at room temperature in an atmosphere containing water (for example, an atmosphere having a relative humidity of about 30 percent to about 50 percent). The silane compound can undergo chemical reaction with the surface of the acid-sintered (e.g. silica) particles in the porous layer to form a hydrophobic layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">When the liquid (e.g. paint) repellent surface comprises a lubricant impregnated into pores of a porous layer as just described, the outer exposed surface is predominantly liquid lubricant. Some structures of the porous layer may protrude through the liquid lubricant and be present at the outer exposed surface. However, the outer exposed surface is predominantly liquid lubricant. In this embodiment, typically at least 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95% or greater of the surface area is a liquid lubricant, as can be determined by microscopy.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0196">In some embodiments, the (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder is a film-grade resin, having a relatively high molecular weight. Film-grade resins can be more durable and less soluble in an organic solvent that may be present in the liquid (e.g. paint) being repelled. In other embodiments, the (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder can be a lower molecular weight film-forming resin. Film-forming resins can be more compliant and less likely to affect the collapsibility of a liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir or liner. Viscosity and melt flow index are indicative of the molecular weight. Mixtures of (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0197">In some embodiments, the film-grade (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder typically has a melt flow index of at least 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, or 5 g/10 min at 200Â° C./5 kg ranging up to 20, 25, or 30 g/10 min at 200Â° C./5 kg. The melt flow index can be determined according to ASTM D-1238. The tensile strength of the (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder is typically at least 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 MPa. Further, the (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder can have a low elongation at break of less than 10% or 5%. The tensile and elongation properties can be measured according to ASTM D-638.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0198">In other embodiments, the (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binders have a lower molecular weight and lower tensile strength than film-grade polymers. In one embodiment, the melt viscosity of the (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binders (as measured by ASTM D-1084-88) at 400Â° F. (204Â° C.) ranges from about 50,000 to 100,000 cps. In another embodiment, the molecular weight (Mw) of the (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder is typically at least about 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 5000 g/mole ranging up to 10,000; 25,000; 50,000; 75,000; 100,000; 200,000; 300,000; 400,000, or 500,000 g/mole. In some embodiments, the (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder has a tensile strength of at least 5, 10, or 15 MPa ranging up to 25, 30 or 35 MPa. In some embodiments, the (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder has an elongation at break ranging up 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500%</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0199">In typical embodiments, the non-fluorinated organic polymeric binder does not form a chemical bond with the fluorochemical material as this may hinder the migration of the fluorochemical material (e.g. compound) to the outermost surface layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0200">In some embodiments, the (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder is not curable, such as in the case of alkyd resins. An alkyd resin is a polyester modified by the addition of fatty acids and other components. They are derived from polyols and a dicarboxylic acid or carboxylic acid anhydride. Alkyds are the most common resin or âbinderâ of most commercial âoil-basedâ paints and coatings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0201">In some embodiments, the selection of the non-fluorinated polymeric binder can affect the concentration of fluorochemical material that provides the desired liquid (e.g. paint) repellency properties. For example when the binder is atactic polystyrene, having a molecular weight of 800-5000 kg/mole, the concentration of fluorochemical material was found to exceed 2.5 wt.-% in order to obtain the desired liquid (e.g. paint) repellency properties. Thus, for some non-fluorinated polymeric binders, the concentration of fluorochemical material may be at least 3, 3.5, 4, or 5 wt.-% of the total amount of fluorochemical material and (e.g. non-fluorinated) polymeric binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0202">The fluoropolymers or compositions comprising a fluorochemical material and a non-fluorinated organic polymeric binder can be dissolved, suspended, or dispersed in a variety of organic solvents to form coating compositions suitable for use in coating the compositions onto a substrate or component of a spray application system. The organic coating compositions typically contain at least about 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% organic solvent or greater, based on the weight of the coating composition. The coating compositions typically contain at least about 0.01%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15% or greater solids of fluoropolymer or (e.g. non-fluorinated) organic polymeric binder and fluorochemical material, based on the total weight of the coating composition. However, the coating composition can be provided as a concentrate with an even higher amount of solids, e.g. 20, 30, 40, or 50 wt.-% solids. Suitable solvents include for example alcohols, esters, glycol ethers, amides, ketones, hydrocarbons, chlorohydrocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, hydrofluoroethers, chlorocarbons, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the coating composition is an aqueous suspension, emulsion, or solution comprising at least 50 wt.-% or greater water and an organic cosolvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0203">The coating compositions may contain one or more additives provided the inclusion of such does not detract from the liquid (e.g. paint) repellent properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0204">The coating compositions can be applied to a substrate or component by standard methods such as, for example, spraying, padding, dipping, roll coating, brushing, or exhaustion (optionally followed by the drying of the treated substrate to remove any remaining water or organic solvent). The substrate can be in the form of sheet articles that can be subsequently thermally formed into a liquid (e.g. paint) reservoir, liner or lid. When coating flat substrates of appropriate size, knife-coating or bar-coating may be used to ensure uniform coatings of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0205">The moisture content of the organic coating composition is preferably less than 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50 ppm. In some embodiments, the coating composition is applied to the substrate at a low relative humidity, e.g. of less than 40%, 30% or 20% at 25Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0206">The coating compositions can be applied at an amount sufficient to achieve the desired repellency properties. Coatings as thin as 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 nm ranging up to 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 or 5 microns can provide the desired repellency. However, thicker coatings (e.g., up to about 10, 15, 20 microns or more) can also be used. Thicker coatings can be obtained by applying to the substrate a single thicker layer of a coating composition that contains a relatively high concentration of solids. Thicker coatings can also be obtained by applying successive layers to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0207">In another embodiment, the fluorochemical material can be combined with a thermally processable (e.g. thermoplastic) polymer and then melt processed into a surface layer, substrate, or component such as a liquid (e.g. paint) repellent reservoir, liner or lid. In this embodiment, the fluorochemical material typically migrates to the surface forming a surface layer with a high concentration of fluorochemical material relative to the total amount of fluorochemical material and thermally processable polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0208">In typical embodiments, the amount of fluorochemical material is at least about 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0 or 2.5 wt.-% and in some embodiments, at least about 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 or 5 wt.-%. The amount of fluorochemical material is typically no greater than 25, 20, 15, or 10 wt.-% of the sum of the fluorochemical material (melt additive) and thermally processable polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0209">To form a polymer blend by melt processing, the fluorochemical material can be, for example, mixed with pelletized, granular, powdered or other forms of the thermally processable polymer and then melt processed by known methods such as, for example, molding or melt extrusion. The fluorochemical material can be mixed directly with the polymer or it can be mixed with the polymer in the form of a âmaster batchâ (concentrate) of the fluorochemical material in the polymer. If desired, an organic solution of the fluorochemical material can be mixed with powdered or pelletized polymer, followed by drying (to remove solvent) and then melt processing. Alternatively, the fluorochemical composition can be added to the polymer melt to form a mixture or injected into a molten polymer stream to form a blend immediately prior to extrusion or molding into articles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0210">In some embodiments, the melt processable (e.g. thermoplastic) polymer is a polyolefin, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, or polyacrylate. The thermoplastic polymer preferably is a polyolefin, mixture or blend of one or more polyolefins, a polyolefin copolymer, mixture of polyolefin copolymers, or a mixture of at least one polyolefin and at least one polyolefin copolymer. The thermoplastic polymer is more preferably a polyolefin polymer or copolymer wherein the polymer unit or copolymer unit is ethylene, propylene or butylene or mixtures thereof. Thus the polyolefin is preferably polypropylene, polyethylene, polybutylene or a blend or copolymer thereof. In one embodiment, the thermoplastic polymer is polyethylene having a melting point ranging from 90-140Â° C. such as available from Chevron Phillips under the trade designation âMarFlex 1122 Polyethyleneâ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0211">Extrusion can be used to form polymeric films. In film applications, a film forming polymer is simultaneously melted and mixed as it is conveyed through the extruder by a rotating screw or screws and then is forced out through a slot or flat die, for example, where the film is quenched by a variety of techniques known to those skilled in the art. The films optionally are oriented prior to quenching by drawing or stretching the film at elevated temperatures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0212">Molded articles are produced by pressing or by injecting molten polymer from a melt extruder as described above into a mold where the polymer solidifies. Typical melt forming techniques include injection molding, blow molding, compression molding and extrusion, and are well known to those skilled in the art. The molded article is then ejected from the mold and optionally heat-treated to effect migration of the polymer additives to the surface of the article.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0213">After melt processing, an annealing step can be carried out to enhance the development of repellent characteristics. The annealing step typically is conducted below or above the melt temperature of the polymer for a sufficient period of time. The annealing step can be optional. The TFE copolymers can also be thermally processed into a component of a spray application system such as a liquid (e.g. paint) repellent reservoir, liner or lid at temperatures above the melt point of the fluoropolymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0214">The repellent surface layer such as the porous layer impregnated with lubricant as well as the other (e.g. solid) liquid (e.g. paint) repellent materials described herein can be provided on a wide variety of organic or inorganic components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0215">In some embodiments, different components are coated with different solid materials. In other embodiments, the surface of one portion of a component can comprise one type of a solid liquid (e.g. paint) repellent material and another surface portion can comprise a different type of solid material. Likewise, the surface of one portion of a component can comprise one type of a solid liquid (e.g. paint) repellent material and another surface portion can comprise a lubricant impregnated into pores of a porous layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0216">In typical embodiments, the entire surface of the component (e.g. reservoir, liner or lid) of the spray application system that normally comes in contact with a liquid (e.g. paint) comprises a liquid (e.g. paint) repellent surface as described herein. In other embodiments, only a portion of the surface of the component (e.g. reservoir, liner or lid) of the spray application system that normally comes in contact with a liquid (e.g. paint) comprises a liquid (e.g. paint) repellent surface as described herein. This latter embodiment, is still beneficial relative to components lacking a liquid (e.g. paint) repellent surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0217">Suitable polymeric materials for components include, but are not limited to, polyesters (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate or polybutylene terephthalate), polycarbonates, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) copolymers, poly(meth)acrylates (e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, or copolymers of various (meth)acrylates), polystyrenes, polysulfones, polyether sulfones, epoxy polymers (e.g., homopolymers or epoxy addition polymers with polydiamines or polydithiols), polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene and copolymers thereof or polypropylene and copolymers thereof), polyvinyl chlorides, polyurethanes, fluorinated polymers, cellulosic materials, derivatives thereof, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0218">In some embodiments, where increased transmissivity is desired, the polymeric component can be transparent. The term âtransparentâ means transmitting at least 85 percent, at least 90 percent, or at least 95 percent of incident light in the visible spectrum (wavelengths in the range of 400 to 700 nanometers). Transparent components may be colored or colorless.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0219">Suitable inorganic substrates include metals and siliceous materials such as glass. Suitable metals include, for example, pure metals, metal alloys, metal oxides, and other metal compounds. Examples of metals include, but are not limited to, chromium, iron, aluminum, silver, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, cobalt, tin, steel (e.g., stainless steel or carbon steel), brass, oxides thereof, alloys thereof, and mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0220">The combination of the porous layer and impregnated lubricant, as well as the other (e.g. solid) materials described herein can render the coated surface hydrophobic. The terms âhydrophobicâ and âhydrophobicityâ refer to a surface on which drops of water or aqueous liquid exhibit an advancing and/or receding water contact angle of at least 50 degrees, at least 60 degrees, at least 70 degrees, at least 90 degrees, at least 95 degrees, or at least 100 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0221">In some embodiments, the advancing and/or receding contact angle of the repellent surface of the substrate or component with water may increase, relative to the substrate or component lacking a liquid (e.g. paint) repellent surface, by at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 degrees. In some embodiments, the receding contact angle with water may increase by at least 45, 50, 55, 60, or 65 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0222">In some embodiments, surface treatment and impregnated lubricant, as well as the other (e.g. solid) materials described herein, provide a surface that exhibits an advancing and/or receding contact angle with water of at least 105, 110, or 115 degrees. The advancing and/or receding contact angle with water is typically no greater than 135, 134, 133, 132, 131, or 130 degrees and in some embodiments, no greater than 129, 128, 127, 126, 125, 124, 123, 122, 121, or 120 degrees. The difference between the advancing and/or receding contact angle with water of the liquid repellent surface layer can be at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 degrees. Favorably the difference between the advancing and receding contact angle with water of the surface treated hydrophobic lubricant impregnated porous surface, as well as the other (e.g. solid) materials described herein is no greater than 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 degree. As the difference between the advancing and/or receding contact angle with water increases, the tilt angle needed to slide or roll off a (e.g. water or paint) droplet from a planar surface increases. One of ordinary skill appreciates that deionized water is utilized when determining contact angles with water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0223">The contact angle of the liquid (e.g. paint) repellent surface of the substrate or component can also be evaluated with other liquids instead of water. For example, since paints often comprise 2-n-butoxyethanol, the contact angle of the liquid (e.g. paint) repellent surface with a solution of 10% by weight 2-n-butoxyethanol and 90% by weight deionized water can also be of importance. In some embodiments, the advancing contact angle with such 2-n-butoxyethanol solution is at least 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70 degrees and in some embodiments at least 75 or 80 degrees. In some embodiments, the receding contact angle with such 2-n-butoxyethanol solution is at least 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 70 degrees. In some embodiments, the advancing and/or receding contact angle of the liquid (e.g. paint) repellent surface of the substrate or component with a solution of 10% by weight 2-n-butoxyethanol and 90% by weight deionized water is no greater than 100, 95, 90, 85, 80, or 75 degrees.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0225">The combination of the porous layer and impregnated lubricant as well as the other (e.g. solid) materials described herein can be used to impart or enhance (e.g. aqueous) liquid repellency of a variety of substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0226">The term âaqueousâ means a liquid medium that contains at least 50, 55, 60, 65, or 70 wt-% of water.

The amount of organic cosolvent does not exceed 50 wt-% of the total liquids of the coating composition. In some embodiments, the amount of organic cosolvent does not exceed 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 or 5 wt-% organic cosolvent. Thus, the term aqueous includes (e.g. distilled) water as well as water-based solutions and dispersions such as paint.</div>

Common polymeric binders utilized in paint include acrylic polymers, alkyd polymers, urethane polymers, epoxy polymers, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the (e.g. base coat) paint may comprise a combination of acrylic and alkyd polymers. In other embodiments, the (e.g. clear coat) paint may comprise hexamethylene isocyanate oligomers and/or cyclohexyl isocyanate oligomers at concentrations ranging from about 20 to 40 wt-% for âready to sprayâ compositions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0233">In the absence of opacifying pigment(s), such as titanium dioxide, silica, carbon black, etc. or other colorant (i.e. pigment or dye other than black or white) the paint may be characterized as a âclear coatâ. Paints that further comprise opacifying pigment(s), yet not colored pigments may be characterized as primers. Further, paints that further comprise both opacifying pigment(s) and colorant(s) may be characterized as base coats.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0234">Whereas clear coats are generally free of opacifying pigments and colorants, primers and base coats typically comprise at least 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 wt-% or greater of opacifying pigment(s) such as titanium dioxide. Base coats further comprise colorants at various concentrations. In some embodiments, the paint comprises 5 to 25 wt-% of colorants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0235">The liquid medium may comprise relatively small concentrations of volatile organic solvents. For example, the volatile organic content of water-based flat architectural paint, water-based automobile primer, and water-based clear coat is typically no greater than 250 grams/liter and in some embodiments no greater than 200 grams/liter, 150 grams/liter, 100 grams/liter, or 50 grams/liter. The VOC content may be higher, ranging from at least 275, 300, or 325 grams/liter up to 500 grams/liter, particularly for automobile base coat. In some embodiments, the VOC content is no greater than 450 or 425 grams/liter. Paint referred to as no-VOC typically may contain 5 grams/liter or less of volatile organic solvents. As used herein, VOC is any organic compound having a boiling point less than or equal to 250Â° C. measured at a standard atmospheric pressure of 101.3 kPa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0236">As the concentration of colored pigment(s) increases, the concentration of (e.g. volatile) organic solvents present for the purpose of dissolving and dispersing such colored pigment(s) can also increase. Further, (e.g. volatile) organic solvents can also be utilized to lower the viscosity of the paint. Viscosity will vary with the thinner level chosen. However, in some embodiments, the viscosity of the âready to sprayâ paint at 20Â° C. ranges from 50 to 100 cps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0237">The paint may comprise water-soluble organic solvents such as alcohols (e.g. alkylene glycol alkyl ether). For example, the paint may comprise 2-butoxyethanol (ethylene glycol monobutyl ether), having a boiling point of 171Â° C. (340Â° F.); butoxypropan-2-ol (propylene glycol n-butyl ether), having a boiling point of 171Â° C. (340Â° F.); 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol (diethylene glycol monobutyl ether), having a boiling point of 230Â° C. (446Â° F.); and combinations thereof.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0238">The paint may further comprise other solvents that may be characterized as âexemptâ solvents, i.e. not causing the formation of ground level ozone (smog), according to environmental chemists. Representative examples include acetone, ethyl acetate, tertiary butyl acetate (TBAc), and isopropanol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0239">When the spray application system described herein is utilized to apply an aqueous liquid mixture, such as paint, the method may comprise applying more than one coat of the same or different paint compositions.

In another embodiment, the method may comprise applying one or more coats of a (e.g. colored) base coat. In another embodiment, the method may comprise applying one or more coats of a clear coat. The method may comprise applying a combination of primer, sealer, base coat, and/or clear coat. The method is particularly advantageous for use with (e.g. automobile) base coats that are substantially more expensive than primers, sealers and clear coats.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0240">In some embodiments, 3-4 coats may be applied (e.g. to an automobile panel) wherein each coat, or in other words âfilm build per wet coatâ ranges in thickness from 0.80 to 1.0 mils. Upon drying this can produce a dried film build ranging from about 0.10 to 0.20 mils.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0241">In some embodiments, each coat of the method utilizes an aqueous paint. In other embodiments, at least one coat may be an organic solvent based paint, i.e. a paint comprising greater than 50 wt-% organic solvent that may not form a single phase with water. Organic solvent-based paints typically do not contain any water. For example, solvent-based clear coats may contain organic polar and non-polar solvents such as xylene, acetone, naphtha, alkyl benzene, toluene, heptan-2-one, and the like at a total organic solvent concentration ranging from at least 50 wt-%, or 60 wt-% up to about 75 wt-% or greater.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0242">In one embodied method, a solvent based clear coat is applied to a dried water based base coat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0243">When the paint comprises organic solvent, the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer) may be selected such that the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer) has no solubility or only trace solubility with the organic solvent(s) of the paint, e.g., a solubility of 0.01 grams/liter or 0.001 grams/liter or less. Further, when the paint comprises an organic solvent, the non-fluorinated polymeric binder, fluorochemical material, or fluoropolymer may be selected to exhibit no solubility or only trace solubility with the organic solvent(s) of the paint, e.g., a solubility of 0.01 grams/liter or 0.001 grams/liter or less. Alternatively or in combination with having trace solubility, the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer) as well as the non-fluorinated polymeric binder, fluorochemical material, and/or fluoropolymer may be selected such that it is compatible with the paint and paint application methods. The lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer), non-fluorinated polymeric binder, fluorochemical material, and/or fluoropolymer may be present in the paint at higher concentrations, i.e. greater than 0.01 grams/liter, or greater than 0.1 grams/liter, or greater than 0.25 grams/liter, or greater than 0.5 grams/liter; yet still be compatible with the paint and paint application methods. In some embodiments, the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer), non-fluorinated polymeric binder, fluorochemical material, and/or fluoropolymer may function as a paint additive and be present in the paint at concentrations ranging from about 0.5 grams/liter to 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, or 3 wt-% of the paint.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0244">There are various approaches that can be taken to determine the compatibility of the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer), non-fluorinated polymeric binder, fluorochemical material, and/or fluoropolymer with the paint.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0245">In one approach the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer) may be sufficiently (e.g. chemically) compatible with the paint such that the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer) does not migrate to a surface of the paint. This can be evaluated by comparing the concentration of lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer) of the dried paint at one major surface relative to an underlying or opposing major surface layer of the dried paint. When opposing major surface layers of the dried paint comprise substantially the same concentration (difference of less than 10, 5 or 1% relative to the major surface having the higher concentration) of lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer), the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer) can be characterized as chemically compatible. Likewise, when opposing major surface layers of the dried paint comprise substantially the same concentration (difference of less than 10, 5 or 1% relative to the major surface having the higher concentration) of non-fluorinated polymeric binder, fluorochemical material, and/or fluoropolymer, such materials can be characterized as chemically compatible with the paint.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0246">In another approach, the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer) may be sufficiently compatible with the paint such that the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer) does not affect the inter-layer adhesion of a painted substrate. This can be evaluated according to Standard Test Method for Measuring Adhesion by Tape Test (ASTM D3359-09). When the cross-hatch adhesion is substantially the same relative to a control of the same paint in the absence of the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer), the presence of the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer) can be characterized as not affecting the inter-layer adhesion. Typically, 90, 95, or 100% of the paint is retained after cross-hatch adhesion testing according to ASTM D3359-09. Likewise, the non-fluorinated polymeric binder, fluorochemical material, and/or fluoropolymer may be sufficiently compatible with the paint such that the presence thereof does not affect the inter-layer adhesion of a painted substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0247">In yet another approach, the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer), non-fluorinated polymeric binder, fluorochemical material, and/or fluoropolymer may be sufficiently compatible with the paint such that the lubricant (or the combination of lubricant and hydrophobic layer), non-fluorinated polymeric binder, fluorochemical material, and/or fluoropolymer does not affect the method of applying the paint. For example, additional coats of the same paint can be uniformly applied at a sufficient film build as previously described. In yet another example, additional coats of a different paint (e.g. a clear coat applied to a dried base coat) can be uniformly applied at a sufficient film build as previously described. Lack of uniformity across the painted panel or substrate can typically be visually detected by observing the occurrence of âfisheyesâ or other incompatibility-related coating defects while applying the paint and/or by uneven gloss and/or color that can be measured after the applied paint has dried.</div>

The Comparative Examples, in contrast, were characterized by water contact angle hysteresis above 10Â°, indicative of more resistance to drop motion. Note that CE.B was characterized by no difference between the advancing and receding contact angle because contacting water droplets instantly spread on the porous layer. This sheet of water was not easily removed by tilting, however, meaning CE. B was not repellent to water.

The painted film samples were then turned vertically for 5 minutes to allow paint to drain off of the surface. The masses of the drained film pieces were measured to determine the mass of paint residue remaining on the surface.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0374" num="0379">A thermoformed low density polyethylene (LDPE) PPSâ¢ liner (400 ml) was manufactured by 3M.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0375" num="0380">The liner was first treated with air plasma using a Diener instrument (Atto Version 1 Model) by pumping the chamber down to a pressure of 0.2 mbar, setting the power to full (reading of 100), setting the air at a flow rate of 35Â±25 NI/h, to plasma treat the inside of the liner for 5 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0376" num="0381">The liner was removed from the plasma chamber and the 5 wt % of porous coating formulation of PE 5 (as previously described) was immediately applied to the insides of the liner using a pipette. The liner was manually rotated to obtain complete wetting by the coating formulation, and excess coating was drained by flipping the container upside down. The coated liner was then dried at 75Â° C. for 15 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0377" num="0382">A hydrophobic layer was applied to the porous layer in the same manner using the previously described HFPO Silane solution. The solvents were allowed to evaporate overnight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0378" num="0383">The Fomblin Y 14/6 lubricant was then coated onto the surface treated porous layer in the same manner until approximately â of the interior surface was covered with lubricant. The liner was then placed onto rollers for 30 minutes to allow the lubricant to spread and impregnate the pores. The liner was removed from the rollers and held vertically for Ë3 weeks to drain off excess lubricant such that the liner now had a repellent interior surface.</div>

The paint was then poured out of the liners, and the liners were placed upside down for 5 minutes (liner with repellent interior) or about 3 hours (CE.F) to allow more of the paint to drain. The liners were each reweighed and the mass of retained paint was calculated. The test results were as follows:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0386" num="0391">MEFBSE (C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>9</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>OH), a fluorochemical alcohol having an equivalent weight of 357, was made in two stages by reacting perfluorohutanesulfonyl fluoride (PBSF) with methylamine to form MEFBSA (C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>9</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)H), followed by reaction with ethylenechlorohydrin, using a procedure essentially as described in Example 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 2,803,656 (Ahlbrecht, et al.),</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0387" num="0392">Fluorochemical 1 was then prepared using the protocol described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,396,866 (Jariwala et al.) by esterifying the MEFBSE with octadecanedioic acid at a molar ratio of 2:1 as follows: to a three-necked round bottom flask was added 25 g (0.0793 moles) of Emerox 118 (available from Cognis Corporation, Cincinnati, Ohio), 56.7 g (0.159 moles) of MEFBSE, 100 g toluene and 1 g (0.007 moles) of 70 wt % solution of methanesulfonic acid. The contents of the flask were refluxed using a Dean-Stark trap and a condenser at 112Â° C. for 12 h. The solution was then cooled to 80Â° C. To this solution was added 1.08 g (0.007 moles) of triethanol amine and the solution was stirred at 80Â° C. for 1 h. This toluene solution was then washed with 75 g hot water (80Â° C.) three times. After the last wash the organic bottom layer was distilled to remove the toluene. The residue remaining the flask was the diester product, which was poured into a jar and allowed to crystallize on cooling to room temperature.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0392" num="0397">A single drop of the (e.g. PPG Envirobase) paint, approximately 0.2 mL, was applied at 21Â° C. to a central portion of the (e.g. repellent surface of the) sample (7.5 cm by 5.0 cm coated glass microscope slide). The sample (e.g. glass slide) was immediately orientated vertically. If the paint drop slid down the glass slide, it was denoted âPassâ, if not âFailâ.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0394" num="0399">The entire non-repellent surface of the sample (i.e. uncoated side of the 7.5 cm by 5.0 cm glass slide) was masked with tape, obtained from 3M Company under the trade designation âSCOTCH-BLUE PAINTERS TAPEâ. The sample (glass slide) was then immersed in the (e.g. PPG Envirobase) paint to a depth of 3.5 cm for 10 minutes at 21Â° C. (or in other words about half the coated surface was immersed). The sample (glass slide) was removed from the diluted paint, orientated vertically for 30 seconds, and the masking tape removed. The paint remaining on the immersed coated surface was then visually estimated and expressed as percentage of retained paint coverage.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0396" num="0401">A sample of sufficient size (2.8 by 3.2 cm) was weighed. The entire non-repellent surface of the sample (i.e. uncoated side) was masked with tape the âSCOTCH-BLUE PAINTERS TAPEâ. The repellent surface of the sample was entirely submerged (e.g. 30 g) in the (e.g. PPG Envirobase) paint for 10 minutes at 21Â° C. The sample was then removed from the paint, the masking tape removed, and the sample orientated vertically by means a binder clip for 1 minute. The bottom edge of the sample was contacted with a paper towel to wick away paint that may have pooled along the bottom edge of the material. The weight of each sample was again measured and the amount of paint remaining per area was calculated. The paint remaining on the coated surface was visually estimated and expressed as percentage of retained paint coverage.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0406" num="0411">To prepare CE84, EX85 and EX86 coating solutions were applied to the inside walls of the spray gun paint container using a pipette as follows: the bottom of an LDPE PPS container was first wet with the coating solution, and the solvent was allowed to evaporate under ambient conditions. The container was then tilted 90Â° and a pipette was used to coat a strip of the interior side wall of the container. Next, the container was manually rotated to obtain complete wetting of the entire interior sidewall by the coating solution. Excess coating solution was drained by flipping the container upside down, and the solvent was allowed to evaporate under ambient conditions for at least 30 minutes. Paint repellency was determined according to Test Method 3 as follows:</div>
