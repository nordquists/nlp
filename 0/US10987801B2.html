<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA444048921">
<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A tendon-driven robotic gripper is disclosed for performing fingertip and enveloping grasps. One embodiment comprises two fingers, each with two links, and is actuated using a single active tendon. During unobstructed closing, the distal links remain parallel, creating exact fingertip grasps. Conversely, if the proximal links are stopped by contact with an object, the distal links start flexing, creating a stable enveloping grasp. The route of the active tendon and the parameters of the springs providing passive extension forces are optimized in order to achieve this behavior. An additional passive tendon is disclosed that may be used as a constraint preventing the gripper from entering undesirable parts of the joint workspace. A method for optimizing the dimensions of the links in order to achieve enveloping grasps of a large range of objects is disclosed and applied to a set of common household objects.</div>

<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">Technical Field</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to object manipulation devices, systems, and techniques, and more particularly to gripper configurations that may be utilized with robots and other mobility and/or actuation platforms.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">End-effectors for robots operating in unstructured environments are typically designed to satisfy multiple criteria. They must be versatile and capable, enabling manipulation of a wide range of objects and in many scenarios. At the same time, low complexity and cost can be key enablers for wide availability, a desirable feature both for research and development, and subsequent refinement into a product.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The various end-effector designs described herein employ a low-complexity approach. With the understanding that a gripper populating this part of the design space will inevitably lack a number of advanced capabilities, the described features can enable a wide range of tasks and handle many target objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure focuses on stable grasping, and not in-hand manipulation such as changing the object's pose in hand or activating additional object degrees of freedom (e.g., pushing a button, pulling a trigger). The embodiments described herein achieve two types of grasps, which are particularly useful for performing numerous tasks. The first one, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, is fingertip grasps, which is highly suitable for small objects, or for cases where fingers <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, <b>102</b> <i>b </i>(collectively <b>102</b>) of a hand, gripper or end effector <b>104</b> cannot reach around an object <b>106</b> <i>a </i>(e.g., because of the surface the object is resting on). The second type, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D-1F</figref>, is that of enveloping grasps, where fingers <b>102</b> of the hand, gripper or end effector <b>104</b> create contacts around the circumference of an object <b>106</b> <i>b</i>. These grasps are well suited for resisting a wide range of external disturbances, unlike fingertip grasps, which are easily affected by torques applied around the axis of contact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In one implementation, the hardware starting point consists of two fingers <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, <b>102</b> <i>b</i>, each with two joints <b>108</b> <i>a</i>, <b>108</b> <i>b </i>(collectively <b>108</b>), <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b </i>(collectively <b>110</b>) and links <b>112</b> <i>a</i>, <b>112</b> <i>b </i>(collectively <b>112</b>), <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>(collectively <b>114</b>). Using at least two revolute joints per finger <b>102</b> is motivated by the goal of achieving exact fingertip grasps, where the distal links <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>are perfectly parallel with respect to one another, throughout the range of motion of the fingers <b>102</b>. Actuation is performed through a single motor (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1F</figref>) connected to all joints <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> via a tendon (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1F</figref>), providing flexion forces. Extension is entirely passive, achieved with joint springs (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1F</figref>) and passive elastic tendons (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1F</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">With a single motor driving four joints <b>108</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>108</b> <i>b</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b</i>, the hand (e.g. end effector) is underactuated. The choice between the type of grasp being performed (fingertip or enveloping) is not made actively, by controlling the actuators. Rather, type of grasp being performed happens passively through object contact, as the hand, gripper or end effector <b>104</b> mechanically adapts to the shape of the object <b>106</b> <i>a</i>, <b>106</b> <i>b</i>. When the hand, gripper or end effector <b>104</b> is closing unobstructed, the distal links <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>stay parallel with respect to one another in a fingertip grasp configuration. If the proximal links <b>112</b> <i>a</i>, <b>112</b> <i>b </i>are stopped by contact with an object (e.g., object <b>106</b> <i>b </i>as best illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, the distal links <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>flex in, completing an enveloping grasp, as best illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>). Furthermore, the ratio of torques applied at each joint <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> cannot be changed at run-time, as the joints <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are not independently actuated, and must be optimized at design-time for stable grasps in as many cases as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Passive transition between fingertip and enveloping grasps can also be seen in the MARS hand [<b>1</b>], which later evolved into the SARAH family of hands [<b>2</b>], both of which use four-bar linkages for actuation. The use of tendons in the embodiments presented herein comprise a more compact implementation that avoids protruding knuckles or joints, at the cost of reduced finger contact areas. Passively adaptive, optimized underactuated designs also include the Harvard Hand [<b>3</b>], [<b>4</b>] and the breakaway transmission mechanism [<b>5</b>] used in the Barrett hand (Barrett Technologies, Cambridge, Mass.). Both of these designs may be utilized to perform enveloping grasps, but are not optimized for exact fingertip grasps. A detailed and encompassing optimization study for underactuated hands, focusing mainly on four-bar linkages but with applications to other transmission mechanisms as well, can be found in [<b>6</b>].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">An important body of work has also focused on the force generation capabilities of redundant or tendon-driven mechanisms in the context of studying the human hand [<b>7</b>], [<b>8</b>], [<b>9</b>], [<b>10</b>]. A number of studies have focused on highly underactuated anthropomorphic hand models [<b>11</b>], [<b>12</b>], [<b>13</b>]; the latter also makes use of the principles of passive adaptation. Finally, force generation has been studied extensively in the context of fully-actuated robotic hands, and a number of useful tools have been proposed; see [<b>14</b>], [<b>15</b>], [<b>16</b>], [<b>17</b>] and references therein for details.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">This disclosure describes highly-capable single-actuator, two-finger grippers designed for both fingertip and enveloping grasps. This disclosure also presents a method for optimizing a route of the active and passive tendons, as well as the stiffness and pretensioning of the extensor springs, for achieving the desired behavior. At least one implementation employs an additional passive tendon as a constraint that prevents the hand, gripper or end effector from entering undesirable parts of the joint workspace. Also described is a method for optimizing absolute and relative dimensions of the links for achieving enveloping grasps of a desired family of objects, and apply the method to a large set of common household objects. Finally, we demonstrate a prototype hand, gripper, or end effector implementing the results of these optimizations.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">II. Operation and Constraints</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">One implementation uses a hand, gripper, or end effector model <b>204</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, in which the fingers <b>202</b> <i>a</i>, <b>202</b> <i>b </i>(collectively <b>202</b>) are symmetrical. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows one finger <b>204</b> of a hand, gripper, or end effector at three successive positions along a range of motion represented by arrow <b>205</b>, approaching and contacting a relatively small object <b>206</b> <i>a </i>in a fingertip grasp. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows the one finger <b>204</b> at three successive positions along a range of motion represented by arrow <b>205</b>, approaching and contacting a relatively large object <b>206</b> <i>b </i>in an enveloping grasp. This disclosure focuses on the behaviors of a single finger <b>202</b> for ease of explanation, even though the various gripping described herein employs two fingers. The variables θ<sub>1 </sub>and θ<sub>2 </sub>denote the proximal and distal joint angles of the proximal and distal joints <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, respectively. A single actuated tendon (e.g., flexor tendon <b>416</b> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) flexes the joints <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, with extensor tendons (e.g., <b>418</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and passive springs (e.g., linear spring <b>430</b>, joint spring <b>432</b> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) providing extension torques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The desired behavior of the gripper <b>204</b> can be summarized through the following four constraints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">1) As the gripper <b>204</b> is closing unobstructed, distal links <b>214</b> must remain parallel along the range of motion <b>205</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. This means that as the proximal joint <b>208</b> flexes, the corresponding distal joint <b>210</b> extends to compensate (i.e., θ<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2</sub>=90 degrees throughout free motion).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">2) If a fingertip grasp has been established, contact forces between the gripper <b>204</b> and an object <b>206</b> <i>a </i>must create a stable grasp. In particular, contact forces on the fingertips <b>222</b> should not hyperextend the distal joint <b>210</b> (i.e., θ<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2</sub>=90 degrees must hold in the presence of fingertip contact forces).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">3) If proximal joints <b>208</b> are stopped due to contact with an object <b>206</b> <i>b</i>, the distal joint <b>210</b> must start flexing, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in order to contact the object <b>206</b> <i>b </i>(i.e., θ<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2</sub>&gt;90 degrees).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">4) Once an enveloping grasp (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) has been completed, object contact forces and joint torques created by the actuated tendon (e.g., flexor tendon <b>416</b> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) must be in equilibrium and create a stable grasp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">We note that, for all constraints above, θ<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2 </sub>is greater than or equal to 90 degrees is a necessary, but not sufficient condition. This constraint can be enforced with an additional unactuated tendon. The most straightforward implementation is the passive tendon <b>317</b> <i>a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, with the additional passive tendon (e.g., string) <b>317</b> <i>a </i>connecting a palm <b>324</b> directly to the distal joint <b>210</b>. The mechanism essentially acts as a four-bar linkage, preventing the case where θ<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2</sub>&lt;90 degrees throughout the range of motion <b>205</b> of the gripper <b>204</b>. However, the mechanism allows configurations where θ<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2</sub>&gt;90 degrees, as the passive tendon <b>317</b> <i>a </i>(e.g., string), that completes the four-bar linkage, simply loses tension and goes slack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In practice, this constraint is implemented with a passive tendon <b>317</b> <i>b </i>constrained to wrap around a number of mandrels <b>326</b> <i>a</i>, <b>326</b> <i>b </i>(collectively <b>326</b>) of equal radii around both joints <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. This has the advantage of allowing better control of the tendon route inside the fingers <b>204</b>. That is, as long as the passive tendon <b>317</b> <i>b </i>wraps around both joint mandrels <b>326</b>, the rest of the route can be changed as needed in order to avoid collision with other design elements. This implementation can also scale to future gripper versions with more links per finger <b>204</b>, e.g., a single passive tendon <b>317</b> <i>b </i>can traverse multiple joints enforcing similar constraints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In both implementations, small variations in the length of the passive tendon <b>317</b> (e.g., string that enforces the constraint can lead to noticeable deviations in distal link <b>214</b> poses. The second variant above allows use of a simple mechanism housed in the distal link <b>214</b>. The passive tendon <b>317</b> <i>b </i>terminates inside a small piece <b>328</b> that sits on a screw <b>330</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Turning the screw <b>330</b> allows fine adjustments in the length of the passive tendon <b>317</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">III. Optimization of Kinetic Behavior</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The hardware constraint described in the previous section contributes significantly to achieving the desired behavior, but does not suffice by itself. In particular, it does not ensure that constraint 1) is met (i.e., distal links <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>) remain parallel to one another throughout unobstructed closing). It also does not contribute in any way to constraint 4) (i.e., stable contact forces during enveloping grasps, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). In one implementation, in order to meet all the constraints in the list, and ensure the complete desired behavior, a number of parameters in the design are optimized. In particular, parameters pertaining to both the active flexor tendon <b>416</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and the passive, spring-based extension mechanism (e.g., extensor tendon <b>418</b>, spring <b>420</b>, mandrels <b>418</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) are optimized. In this context, the term “kinetic” is used to refer to the effect of net joint torques on both the motion of the fingers <b>204</b> and the forces transmitted to an object <b>206</b> <i>a</i>, <b>206</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2B</figref>) through contacts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">A. Optimized Design Parameters</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a complete gripper mechanism <b>404</b> (only a portion illustrated) contains three main components that determine its behavior, namely: 1) flexor tendon <b>416</b>, 2) joint spring <b>432</b>, and 3) extensor tendon <b>418</b>. The effect of each of these main components is determined by a number of parameters, detailed in the following list and illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">1) Flexor Tendon <b>416</b> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In this implementation, the flexor tendon <b>416</b> is the only component connected to a motor <b>434</b>, and is the only major component that can be actively controlled at runtime. In use, the common tendon-pulley model (as in [<b>18</b>]) made be employed. The common tendon-pulley model assumes that the flexor tendon <b>416</b> travels through a number of routing points <b>436</b> <i>a</i>, <b>436</b> <i>b</i>, <b>436</b> <i>c </i>(three illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, collectively <b>436</b>) that the flexor tendon <b>416</b> can slide through, but that force a path of the flexor tendon <b>416</b> to change direction. As a result of this change in direction, the routing points <b>436</b> are the locations where the flexor tendon <b>416</b> applies force to the links <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> of the finger <b>402</b>. The parameters which can be optimized are: locations of routing points <b>436</b>, radii of joint mandrels <b>426</b> <i>a</i>, <b>426</b> <i>b </i>radii, spring stiffness and tension of joint springs <b>432</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The locations of the routing point <b>436</b>, relative to the joints <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>, determine the joint torques applied by the flexor tendon <b>416</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">As previously explained, the flexor tendon <b>416</b> can also wrap around joint mandrels <b>426</b> <i>a</i>, <b>426</b> <i>b</i>. As long as the flexor tendon <b>416</b> is touching a mandrel <b>426</b>, its moment arm around that joint mandrel <b>426</b> is constant and equal to the radius of the joint mandrel <b>426</b>. It is possible for the flexor tendon <b>416</b> to detach from the joint mandrel <b>426</b> during operation, in which case the moment arm is determined by the routing points <b>436</b> <i>c </i>proximal and distal <b>436</b> <i>a</i>, <b>436</b> <i>b </i>to that joint mandrel <b>426</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Each joint <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> contains an off-the-shelf torsional spring <b>432</b> (only one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and illustrated on the opposite finger for sake of clarity of illustration). The spring stiffness may be optimized for the application. For example, changes in spring stiffness may be made in discrete steps, constrained by availability in manufacturers' catalogs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Additionally, the springs <b>432</b> can be pre-tensioned to exert some level of torque even in the gripper's <b>404</b> fully extended pose. The amount of pretensioning can be changed by varying a location of the spring leg supports inside the proximate and distal links <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and palm link <b>324</b> (which constitutes a link), and by choosing springs <b>432</b> with various leg angles at rest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition to joint springs <b>432</b>, extension torques are provided by a passive tendon <b>418</b>. The extensor tendon <b>418</b> runs along an extension side of the joint <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>, hence is interchangeably referred to as extensor tendon <b>418</b> herein, and is connected to a linear spring <b>430</b>. Compared to joint springs <b>432</b>, the extensor tendon <b>418</b> has two main advantages. First, a change in length of the extensor tendon <b>418</b> is determined by the relationship between the two joints <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>, as flexion at one joint <b>408</b>/<b>410</b> can be offset by extension of the other joint <b>410</b>/<b>408</b>. Second, the moment arms around the joints <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> can be finely controlled through the radii of the joint mandrels <b>426</b> <i>a</i>, <b>426</b> <i>b</i>, respectively. The linear spring stiffness parameter may be optimized. For example, changes may be made in discrete steps, constrained by off-the-shelf availability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">A pre-tensioning level in the linear spring <b>430</b> may be optimized. The pre-tensioning level is determined by a length of the extensor tendon <b>418</b>, and thus a length of the linear spring <b>430</b>) in the fully extended pose of the gripper <b>404</b>. A pretensioning mechanism allows this parameter to be adjusted after the gripper <b>404</b> has been constructed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The radii of the joint mandrels <b>426</b> may be optimized. Similarly to the flexor tendon <b>416</b>, the joint mandrel radii determine the constant moment arm of the extensor tendon <b>416</b> around each joint <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>. Note that, unlike the flexor tendon <b>416</b>, the geometry of the gripper <b>404</b> constrains the extensor tendon <b>418</b> to always wrap around the mandrels <b>426</b>, and additional routing points do not affect its behavior.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The above parameters are used to compute the resulting joint torque applied at both joints <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> of the finger <b>402</b> via Equation 1 (below), as a function of the joint angles θ<sub>1</sub>, θ<sub>2 </sub>and the actuation force f applied to the active tendon.
<br/>
<i>T</i> <sub>r</sub>=[<i>T</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>,T</i> <sub>2</sub>]<sup>T</sup>  Equation 1
<br/>
Essentially, the joint torque sums the effect of the active flexor tendon <b>416</b> and passive extensor tendon <b>418</b>, as well as joint springs <b>432</b>, as per Equation 2 (below), where Ja and Jp are the Jacobians of the routing points <b>436</b> of the active flexor and passive extensor tendons <b>416</b>, <b>418</b>, respectively, kl and Δ<sub>l </sub>are the stiffness and elongation of the linear spring <b>430</b> attached to the extensor tendon, Kj is a diagonal matrix comprising the stiffness coefficients of the joint springs <b>432</b>, and Δθ is the vector of joint displacements relative to the rest pose of joint springs <b>432</b>.

B. Joint Torque Ratios and Constraints
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">For a given gripper pose and tendon force, a factor in determining the direction of infinitesimal joint motion or the stability of forces applied to the object is the ratio of individual joint torques T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">rather than their absolute values. As such, all constraints will be on the normalized value of T<sub>r </sub>denoted by {circumflex over (T)}<sub>r</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The latter (T-hat-r) essentially defines a direction in joint torque space; thus will express constraints in terms of this direction. The behavior of the gripper is checked at a number of discrete points throughout its workspace. In particular, two sets of poses are created by taking equidistant samples from the workspace, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. This includes fingertip poses (illustrated by line with black dots or dark circles) and enveloping poses (illustrated by line with white dots or undarken circles).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The fingertip poses comprise a set of poses where the distal links (e.g., <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>) are parallel (θ<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2</sub>=90 degrees). It is noted that the effect of the hardware constraint prevents the distal joint <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b </i>from hyperextending (cross-hatched region in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>), for instance due to the additional tendon constraint from Sec. II.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The enveloping poses comprise a set of poses where the distal joint <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b </i>is flexed for an enveloping grasp (θ<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2</sub>/2=90 degrees).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In experimental implementation, the sets contain 11 and 7 poses respectively; which appears to provide a sufficient sampling resolution to ensure desired behavior throughout the joint workspace.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The active tendon force may be defined or grouped into four levels of active tendon force: a) parallel closing force fclose, b) enveloping force fenvel, c) grasping force finf, and d) opening force, which are each explained in turn below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The parallel closing force fclose is the active force that closes the gripper while maintaining parallel distal links <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In this regime, the proximal joint <b>108</b> <i>a</i>, <b>108</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) must flex, but the distal joint <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) must extend to compensate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The enveloping force fenvel is the active force applied once the proximal links <b>112</b> <i>a</i>, <b>112</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are stopped due to object contact and that flexes the distal joints <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) creating an enveloping grasp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The grasping force finf is the force applied once an object <b>106</b> <i>a</i>, <b>106</b> <i>b </i>has been grasped, in order to hold the object <b>106</b> <i>a</i>, <b>106</b> <i>b </i>stably. The grasping force finf can be arbitrarily large, constrained only by the power of the motor <b>434</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and the links' structural rigidity. Of the grasping force finf is considered to be large enough so that the effects of the spring-based forces in the system are negligible, thus Equation 2 may be simplified as Equation 3, below, by ignoring the other term.
<br/>
<i>T</i> <sub>r</sub>(<i>f</i> <sub>inf</sub>,θ)=<i>J</i> <sub>a</sub> <i>f</i> <sub>inf</sub>:  Equation 3
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The opening force is the force for extending the gripper, f=0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">For every combination of gripper pose and tendon force, the resultant joint torque T<sub>r</sub>(f,θ) can be computed, as in Eq. (1). We also define a normalized joint torque eq, resulting from potential contacts with the object, as per Equation 4, below
<br/>
<i>T</i> <sub>eq</sub>(θ)=<i>J</i> <sub>c</sub> <i>c</i>(2)  Equation (4)
<br/>
 In Equation 4, Jc is the Jacobian of contact locations on the gripper, and c is the vector of contact forces. For fingertip poses, a single contact located in the center of the distal link is assumed. For enveloping poses, an additional contact located at the center of the proximal link is assumed. All contact force magnitudes are normalized to 1.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">It is now possible to compute an overall measure of whether a particular set of design parameters creates the desired behavior. For each pose in the fingertip and enveloping sets, the torque ratio constraints explained below, and illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, are defined. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, angles α and β are used to define a distance metric from the vector τ<sub>r </sub>to the cone defined by τ<sup>0 </sup>and τ<sup>1</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">For each pose in fingertip poses (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>), for the parallel closing regime: the gripper <b>104</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) must stay in the mode where the distal links <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>114</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are parallel. Thus, the proximal joint <b>108</b> <i>a</i>, <b>108</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) must flex, but the distal joint <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) must extend to compensate. This is achieved if fclose is strong enough to overcome spring forces at the proximal joint <b>108</b> <i>a</i>, <b>108</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), but not at the distal joint <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), as illustrated by the cone in the lower right quadrant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Also for each pose in fingertip poses, for the enveloping and grasping regimes: tendon force must overcome the spring forces and flex the distal joint <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) as well. However, the ratio of distal to proximal torques must not exceed the level that can be supported by contact with the object, as illustrated by the cone in the upper right quadrant. If τ2 it too large relative to τ1, the distal joint will flex and, as in [<b>6</b>], the finger will “eject” from the object. The reverse effect is not an issue as the distal joint <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) cannot hyperextend due to hardware constraints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Further for each pose in fingertip poses, for the opening regime: with no active force applied, the gripper must return to the extended pose, as illustrated by the cone in the lower left quadrant.</div>

D. Optimization Method
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Optimization was performed using a combination of random search and gradient descent with numerical gradient computation. At each step, a random set of parameters may be chosen and the corresponding value of S is computed. If S is below a given threshold, a gradient descent loop is run, where a step is taken in the direction of the numerically computed gradient until S stops improving. The resulting parameter set is then saved into a database. The overall algorithm can be allowed to run for an arbitrarily chosen amount of time, after which point the configuration with the lowest value of S found so far can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In practice, for a parameter space of dimensionality <b>16</b>, it was found that one computation of the function S takes approximately 19 ms, while computation of the numerical gradient takes approximately 0.6 s. A rigorous analysis of the time required for the best solution to stop improving was not performed; however empirically, it was found that after approximately 60 CPU hours of computation (8 to 10 hours on a single multi-core commodity desktop) no significant improvements can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In future work, different optimization algorithms may be tried, suited for large dimensional parameter spaces and highly non-linear optimized functions, such as simulated annealing. Other possible approaches could include casting the optimization function to a formulation that allows efficient computation of the global optimum, such as a Linear or Quadratic Program, as in [<b>19</b>].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">IV. Optimization of Link Dimensions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Based on the kinetic optimization described so far, the subject gripper can execute both fingertip and enveloping grasps. The main reason for pursuing these capabilities is to increase the versatility of the gripper; however, in order to maximize their benefit focus should also be directed on the range of objects on which such grasps can be executed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Fingertip grasps are relatively straightforward in terms of graspable object dimensions: the widest object that can grasped must fit between the fingers in the fully extended pose; the thinnest one can be arbitrarily thin (e.g. a sheet of paper). However, enveloping grasps are more difficult to execute. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7B</figref> illustrate potential successful and unsuccessful enveloping grasps based on the dimensions of the grasped object. The determining factors for the range of objects <b>706</b> <i>a</i>, <b>706</b> <i>b</i>, <b>706</b> <i>c </i>(collectively <b>706</b>) that the gripper can geometrically envelop are the lengths and thicknesses of the links <b>712</b> <i>a</i>, <b>712</b> <i>b</i>, <b>714</b> <i>a</i>, <b>714</b> <i>b</i>, <b>724</b>. We propose a second type of optimization, aiming to maximize this range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The space of possible objects may be parameterized by dividing the 2D profiles <b>838</b> <i>a</i>, <b>838</b> <i>b </i>(collectively <b>838</b>) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8C</figref> of the objects <b>706</b> into two categories: rectangular and elliptical. For each category, the object profile <b>838</b> is defined by its width and height.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The parts of the object space that are most important for a gripper to cover will be application-specific. For a gripper intended for versatile manipulation in human settings, a set (n=62) of objects common in households and offices was measured, such as glasses, mugs, bottles, cans, pens, cellphones, various product boxes, staples, condiment packs, computer mice, etc. An illustration of the elliptic object space <b>840</b> <i>a </i>and 2D rectangular object space <b>840</b> <i>b </i>is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8D</figref>, respectively, populated by the objects that were measured. Notably, spaces are symmetrical as objects can be approached from either direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">A. Optimization Function</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">We optimized 6 parameters that affect the space of objects the gripper can geometrically enclose: length and thickness of the palm, proximal and distal links. For each set of parameters, the optimization function was defined as the number of discrete samples in the object space interest region that the gripper failed to enclose. Each object was approached by the gripper along a direction aligned with its height axis, and centered along the object's width. An enveloping grasp was defined as successful if the following conditions were met.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">1) Contact is established on all four links of the gripper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">2) θ<sub>1 </sub>greater than or equal to 45 degrees: as the gripper is underactuated, the proximal joints stop flexing only when contact with an object prevents further motion; only at that point do the distal joints start flexing. The exact angle where that happens depends on the friction coefficient between the proximal link and the object. We chose a value of 45 degrees, which corresponds to a friction coefficient of 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">3) θ<sub>1</sub>+θ<sub>2 </sub>greater than or equal to 110 degrees: this condition distinguishes an enveloping grasp from a fingertip grasp (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">4) The opposing fingertips do not collide as they are flexing to complete the enveloping grasp (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">Based on the distribution of measured objects, the following object space regions of interest were empirically defined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">A) Since circular objects are more predominant than non-circular elliptical ones, attention was focused on circular objects with diameters between 40 mm and 90 mm, sampled every 10 mm. Objects with diameters between 50 mm and 60 mm were given double weight (69 discrete samples in total).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">B) Rectangular objects with width and height between 40 mm and 100 mm, independently sampled at every 10 mm (49 samples in total).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">It is important to note that this type of object space sampling is far from complete. It does not explicitly address objects with irregular shapes, or objects approached by the gripper along a direction that is offset from the center and not aligned with a major object axis. In practice, explicitly optimizing for this particular subset of object shapes, and relying on the gripper's passive mechanical adaptation to handle deviations from it, has been found to work well in a wide range of situations, as illustrated in the next section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">It is also noted that the space of enveloping grasps is always complemented by the space of fingertip grasps, which is significantly less constrained. This is the reason for choosing to focus enveloping grasps on the relatively large objects in the set, with an assumption that fingertip grasps are well suited for small objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">B. Optimization Results</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The same optimization method described in Sec. III-D is used, with the parameters and function described in the previous subsection. For this function, a single evaluation took approximately 0.25 s, and computation of the numerical gradient took approximately 3 s. Complete optimization times similar to the ones in Sec. III-D were allowed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Notably, the optimization method produces improved coverage of the object space, allowing for enveloping grasps of a wide range of objects. However, many common objects still cannot be enveloped; for those, this particular model must rely on fingertip grasps. In the future, we plan to study additional methods for improving the range of objects that can be envelop; these can include overlapping fingers, interlocking distal links, or multiple fingers offset from each other in the plane perpendicular to the closing direction, as in [<b>4</b>].</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">The value of the dimensionless optimization function S, computed using Alg. 1, above, for this configuration is 3.47. This value represented the norm of the error metrics computed over a set of 18 poses (11 fingertip grasps and 7 enveloping grasps), according to multiple constraints for each pose. As such, it is difficult to attach intuitive insights to any particular value. It is however noted that each individual error metric was defined so that a value below 1.0 indicates qualitatively acceptable behavior; as such, we take a norm of 3.47 over 64 total constraints to be acceptable, a result that was indeed confirmed in practice, as shown below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Based on these results, the model shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> was designed, and then used to construct a prototype gripper <b>1104</b>. The links <b>1112</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1114</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1134</b> were 3D-printed on a ProJet HD 3000 rapid prototyping machine. The prototype gripper <b>1104</b> used off-the-shelf torsional <b>1132</b> and linear springs <b>1130</b>, as well as ball bearings for the joints <b>1108</b>, <b>1110</b>. The tendons <b>1116</b>, <b>1117</b>, <b>1118</b> were made from Spectra lines, commonly used for fishing or kiting, a model rated to 200 lbs. force. A number of the routing points <b>1136</b> are called out in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, as are the flexor tendon <b>1116</b>, passive tendon, and extensor tendon <b>1118</b>. The fingers <b>1102</b> <i>a </i>(only one shown) were padded with off-the-shelf rubber pads. The total cost of parts for the gripper <b>1104</b> (excluding the motor) was approximately $70.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">The prototype gripper <b>1104</b> exhibited all the desired characteristics. In particular, the prototype gripper <b>1104</b> was used to demonstrate both fingertip grasps, on objects ranging in size from the maximum finger span to a sheet of paper, and enveloping grasps, on objects with dimensions as predicted by our dimensional optimization. In addition, the prototype gripper <b>1104</b> was suitable for grasping objects of irregular shapes, and using off-center approach directions. A number of examples of the gripper <b>1104</b> grasping objects <b>1206</b> are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12L</figref>. The closing sequence for both a fingertip and enveloping grasp can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1F</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">VI. Discussion and Conclusions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">This disclosure introduces two types of optimization and analysis for a two-finger, single-actuator gripper. A first goal was for the gripper to achieve stable fingertip grasps, with the distal links in perfect opposition, as long as the fingers close unobstructed. In case the proximal links are stopped by contact with the object, the distal links must flex, creating stable enveloping grasps. A second goal was to extend the range of objects that the gripper can kinematically enclose. As shown herein, these goals can be achieved by a combination of optimized links dimensions and actuation parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">A prototype gripper <b>1104</b> has been constructed according the results of these optimizations, and the approached described herein validated. The resulting end-effector can perform fingertip and enveloping grasps for a wide range of objects, exhibits the desired transition between these modes, and passively adapts to the shape of the object while maintaining stable grasps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">While noting the capabilities of a gripper designed using this approach, it is important to also highlight its limitations. This end-effector is meant to explore what is possible with a relatively low-complexity design, and very affordable hardware (and, in particular, a single actuator). An understanding of the trade-offs involved can help put the design to the best use, by matching it with suitable applications, and inform the design of more complex versions, for cases where improved performance is necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">A single actuated tendon provides flexion forces for both proximal and distal joints, meaning that a combination of flexion at the proximal joint and extension at the distal joint leads to no net change in tendon length. As such, external forces acting on the grasped object that induce this combination of joint motions are not resisted by the motor, but only by friction between the object and the rubber fingerpads. Transition from fingertip to enveloping grasps happens passively, with no active sensing or grasp planning, but does require a level of friction between the grasped object and the robot's proximal links, reducing the range of objects that can be enclosed. The two fingers are in permanent opposition, enabling fingertip grasps of very small objects but leading to collision between the distal links when trying to envelop them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13E</figref>, a gripper system may comprise a kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> that is removably coupleable to an adaptation module or “motor pack” <b>1350</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, in one embodiment a kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> may comprise two finger assemblies <b>1302</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1302</b> <i>b</i>, each comprising a distal finger element <b>1314</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1314</b> <i>b </i>movably coupled to a proximal finger element <b>1312</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1312</b> <i>b </i>with a distal joint <b>1310</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1310</b> <i>b</i>. The proximal finger elements <b>1312</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1312</b> <i>b </i>are movably coupled, via proximal joints <b>1308</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1308</b> <i>b </i>to a proximal assembly <b>1324</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">The proximal assembly <b>1324</b> may be removably coupled to the motor pack <b>1350</b>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C-E</figref>) in a manner such that the proximal assembly <b>1324</b> may receive a motion actuation transferring element, such as a motion actuation piston fitting <b>1352</b>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>), to cause the kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> to move in accordance with movement of a motor <b>1354</b> in the motor pack <b>1350</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the proximal end of one embodiment of a proximal assembly <b>1324</b> is shown in orthogonal view to illustrate that a recess <b>1356</b> may be defined therethrough to accommodate coupling with the motor pack <b>1350</b>. The recess may comprise one or more channeled or grooved coupling features <b>1358</b>, along with a circumferential coupling recess <b>1360</b>. The channeled or grooved coupling features <b>1358</b> and circumferential coupling recess <b>1360</b> allow an actuation piston fitting <b>1352</b>, such as that depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>, to be removably coupled into such recesses <b>1360</b> and/or grooves <b>1358</b>, and to pass a tension motion actuation to the flexor tendons of the kinematic assembly <b>1304</b>, as described above. In other words, the kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> is removably coupleable from the motor pack <b>1350</b> by virtue of such a coupling configuration, wherein one or more motion actuations may be passed across the interface which also serves to couple the two assemblies to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>, the depicted embodiment, the removable coupling is accomplished by inserting the coupling features <b>1362</b> of the actuation piston fitting <b>1352</b> through the channels <b>1356</b> of the proximal assembly <b>1324</b> until they reach the circumferential coupling recess <b>1360</b>. The kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> is then twisted relative to the motor pack <b>1350</b> to place the coupling features <b>1362</b> within the circumferential coupling recess <b>1360</b>. Such provides a stable coupling for applying tensile loads across the interface between the kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> and the motor pack <b>1350</b>, to ultimately controllably tension the tendons within the kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> and cause grasping of the kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> as per the above description. An engagement ring <b>1366</b> provides counterloading to tensile loads passed through the actuation piston fitting <b>1352</b> as the engagement ring <b>1366</b> is interfaced with the proximal assembly <b>1324</b> of the kinematic assembly <b>1304</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> are an electric motor <b>1354</b> and a motor controller board <b>1368</b>. The electric motor <b>1354</b> and the motor controller board <b>1368</b> are configured to controllably cause the actuation piston fitting <b>1352</b> to insert (extend) or retract.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref>, a side orthogonal view of a motor pack <b>1350</b> is shown featuring a transparent outer housing to facilitate a limited view of a threaded member or screw member <b>1370</b> that is coupled to an output shaft of the motor <b>1354</b> by a gear train or transmission assembly <b>1372</b> such that rotation of the electric motor <b>1354</b> causes rotation of the screw member <b>1370</b>. Rotation of the screw member <b>1370</b> causes the actuation piston fitting <b>1352</b> to insert (extend) or retract relative to the engagement ring <b>1366</b>, causing insertion or retraction of one or more tensile element or tendons of a kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> when a kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> is removably coupled to the motor pack <b>1350</b>. A proximal coupling interface <b>1374</b> is configured to be removably coupled to a structural member such as a robotic wrist or other portion of a robotic arm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13E</figref> illustrates a bottom orthogonal view of a motor pack <b>1350</b> with aspects of a proximal coupling interface <b>1374</b> depicted. In the depicted embodiment, a series of perimetric coupling elements <b>1378</b> forming an outer threaded surface <b>1380</b> as well as an inner threaded surface <b>1382</b> may be movably engaged by a coupling ring intended to be loosened or tightened relative to the outer threads <b>1380</b> manually (i.e., using an operator's hand. The coupling ring may be configured to create a radially-constraining “hoop stress” that maintains, and also allows adjustability of, an overall diameter of the assembly of perimetric coupling elements <b>1378</b> so that the inner threaded surface <b>1382</b> may be screwed onto a fitting on a substrate member (i.e., such as a robotic arm) with a desired diameter of the assembly of perimetric coupling elements <b>1378</b>. To lock down the motor pack <b>1350</b> relative to the substrate member, the coupling member may be further rotated to cause a clamping level of hoop stress against the interfaced substrate member, for secure coupling of the motor pack <b>1350</b> to the substrate member. The assembly of perimetric coupling elements <b>1378</b> may comprise a material such as a metal or polymer. The assembly of perimetric coupling elements <b>1378</b> may be configured such that it is intended to be a mechanical failure and decoupling point for the kinematic assembly—motor pack—substrate member assembly in the event that a substantial collision is encountered at the kinematic assembly <b>1304</b>. In other words, should a collision with a foreign object cause a load to the gripper/motor pack/substrate system that exceeds a certain design threshold, the system may be configured such that the proximal coupling interface <b>1374</b> breaks loose from the substrate by small micromotions at one or more of the assembly of perimetric coupling elements <b>1378</b> which allow for a release of the substrate from the assembly of perimetric coupling elements <b>1378</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">The removable interface described above in relation to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13E</figref> facilitates design of a kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> which has no motors or electronics. This allows the kinematic assemblies <b>1304</b> to be easily removed, cleaned or sterilized without motor or electronic damage. This allows kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> to be easily replaced—or traded in a “tool change” type of configuration for another tool, such as another size of kinematic assembly, another tool, such as a pipetting device or syringe, or another kinematic assembly <b>1304</b>. Other kinematic assemblies <b>1304</b> may, for example, have 1, or 3, or more fingers as opposed to two as in the depicted embodiment. Such configurations may feature motor packs with two more motors, as well as removable couplings that facilitate passage of two or more insertion/retraction motion actuations, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">In one embodiment, a robot or robotic arm may carry or have available a tool compartment or “holster” into which a kinematic assembly <b>1304</b> may be inserted, such as in a closed grasp configuration for geometric efficiency, after which the robot may rotate the substrate member (or rotate and/or insert/retract, depending upon the particular release configuration. The configuration depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13E</figref> requires insertion and turning for coupling, and turning and retraction for decoupling), thereby rotating the motor pack <b>1350</b> and decoupling the motor pack <b>1350</b> from the kinematic assembly <b>1304</b>. Importantly, the coupling and decoupling action described herein is a tool-less exchange (i.e., does not require tools such as wrenches and the like—only requires specific combined motions, such as insertion/rotation along certain axes). Also importantly, since the aforementioned kinematic assembly <b>1303</b> embodiment has no motors or electronics, not only may it be cleaned or cheaply replaced, but also it may be decoupled in an uncomplicated manner—without electronic leads or contacts to disconnect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14B</figref>, one of the challenges with a conventional coupling of a gripper or kinematic assembly <b>1404</b> to a robotic arm <b>1480</b> is in picking up a small object <b>1406</b>, such as a pen, from a substantially flat surface <b>1482</b>, such as a tabletop. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, if the robotic arm <b>1480</b> places the gripper <b>1404</b> a bit too high relative to the object (e.g., pen) <b>1406</b>, the gripper <b>1402</b> misses the object <b>1406</b> to be grasped. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, if the robotic arm <b>1480</b> places the gripper <b>1406</b> a bit too low relative to the object (e.g., pen) <b>1046</b>, the gripper <b>1402</b> collides with the flat surface (e.g., tabletop) <b>1482</b>, and conventionally is unable to pick up the object (e.g., pen) <b>1406</b> from there without further adjustment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15H</figref>, with the subject underactuated gripper design configurations, a kinematic assembly <b>1504</b> may be advanced by a robotic arm <b>1580</b> toward a small object <b>1506</b>, such as a pen, from a substantially flat surface <b>1582</b>, such as a tabletop, with an elevation relative to the object <b>1506</b> that typically would be too close, and still successfully grasp and pick up the object (e.g., pen) <b>1506</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, a kinematic assembly <b>1504</b> is being advanced toward an object (e.g., pen) <b>1506</b> in a configuration that conventionally would be too close for fingertip grasping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the fingertips <b>1584</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1584</b> <i>b </i>of the kinematic assembly <b>1504</b> collide with the tabletop <b>1582</b>. However, rather than become mechanically overconstrained, the passive adaptation of the kinematic assembly <b>1504</b> to the environment, which is based upon tendon routing/geometry and general kinematics described herein, allows the kinematic assembly <b>1504</b> to adapt and rotate the distal finger elements <b>1514</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1514</b> <i>b </i>inward toward the object (e.g., pen) <b>1506</b> to be grasped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> shows these distal finger elements <b>1514</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1514</b> <i>b </i>starting to rotate inward toward the object (e.g., pen) <b>1506</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15C and 15D</figref> each show further inward rotation of the distal finger elements <b>1514</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1514</b> <i>b </i>until the object (e.g., pen) <b>1506</b> is grasped between the distal ends of the fingertips <b>1584</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1584</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">In one embodiment, the kinematic assembly may be configured to allow for the robot or operator to command a pick up of the object <b>1506</b> straight away from this grasping configuration. In another embodiment, with an upward motion of the kinematic assembly <b>1504</b> away from the surface (e.g., tabletop) <b>1582</b>, the distal finger elements <b>1514</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1514</b> <i>b </i>are allowed to rotate downward while the proximal finger elements <b>1512</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1512</b> <i>b </i>rotate inward toward the object (e.g., pen) to be grasped, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref>. With further upward motion of the kinematic assembly <b>1504</b> away from the surface (e.g., tabletop) <b>1582</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15F and 15G</figref>, the object (e.g., pen) <b>1506</b> becomes grasped in a conventional fingertip grasp, after which the object <b>1506</b> may securely be lifted away from the surface <b>1582</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15H</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A-16D</figref> show wedged distal finger elements <b>1614</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1614</b> <i>b</i>, having a wedged geometry on their outer/distal aspects <b>1686</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1686</b> <i>b</i>, but having a flat geometry on their gripping surfaces <b>1688</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1688</b> <i>b</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">Future designs can improve performance in multiple ways. For example, distal links on opposite fingers that overlap with each other instead of colliding when performing enveloping grasps can enable the enclosing of smaller objects. Also for example, inclusion of an additional link for each finger, as in the MARS [1] or SARAH [2] hands, could improve the ability to adapt to various grasped object shapes. As a further example, independent actuation for the proximal and distal joints can increase the stability of grasps; combined with tactile sensing, this approach can enable enveloping grasps of a wider range of objects. The features will play an important role on the way to versatile end-effectors, widely available for operation in unstructured environments.
