<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/972,369, filed on Jan. 10, 2008, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to multimedia content distribution, and more particularly relates to the usage of multimedia servers in the provision of multimedia content via a network.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) systems and other packet network-based multimedia systems typically utilize one or more multimedia servers to process multimedia content for distribution to viewers via a packet-switched network. These multimedia servers typically provide multiple transmission services simultaneously, such as broadcasting network television programming and multicasting pay-per-view programming while simultaneously handling packet retransmission requests for lost and corrupted packets. Conventional systems often implement a best-effort approach to try to ensure that each service is accorded sufficient resources of the multimedia server, but it often is the case that changing circumstances can leave one or more of the services without sufficient resources to meet quality constraints while other services have more than sufficient resources, thereby degrading some services without necessarily benefiting the quality of other services at the multimedia server.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described with particular reference to the presently preferred example embodiments. However, it should be understood that this class of embodiments provides only a few examples of the many advantageous uses of the innovative teachings herein. In general, statements made in the specification of the present application do not necessarily delimit any of the various claimed inventions. Moreover, some statements may apply to some inventive features but not to others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> illustrate example techniques for dynamic allocation of multimedia server resources among multimedia transmission services of a service provider based on predicted resource usage by each multimedia transmission service. In at least one embodiment, a predictive usage model of the utilization of server resources by one or more multimedia transmission services is generated for various combinations of operating characteristics, such as time of day, day of week, programming event or content, network status, and the like. The predictive usage model can be generated using past resource utilization characteristics of the multimedia transmission services from prior time periods having the same or similar characteristics. The service provider then can use the predictive usage model to more efficiently allocate multimedia server resources among the multimedia transmission services for upcoming time periods, which may be of fixed or variable duration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The term “multimedia” refers to video content, audio content, or a combination thereof. Accordingly, the term “multimedia content” refers to a stream of video content, a stream of audio content, or a combination thereof. In the context of the output of audio content, either alone or in combination with the display of video content, a viewer is understood to be a listener. The term “multimedia transmission service” refers to a service or process performed by multimedia content service to affect the distribution of multimedia content to one or more viewer premises via a network (or via a plurality of networks). Example multimedia transmission services include, but are not limited to, linear program broadcasting (e.g., the broadcast transmission of network television program content or cable television program content), program multicasting (e.g., the multicast transmission of pay-per-view content), dropped/corrupted packet retransmission (e.g., packet retransmission to a single viewer via a unicast or packet retransmission to a group of viewers via a multicast), burst content unicasting (e.g., a burst transmission of multimedia content to a viewer in response to an instant channel change (ICC) request), multimedia encoding or transcoding, and the like. For readability purposes, multimedia transmission services are also referred to herein simply as “services.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The term “multimedia server resource” refers to a hardware or software resource of a multimedia server. Examples of multimedia server resources include operating system resources, thread resources, processor resources, bus resources, cache resources, memory resources, hard disk resources, network interface resources, bus resources, input/output (I/O) resources, and the like. For ease of reference, multimedia server resources are also referred to herein simply as “resources.” The allocation of multimedia server resources to a particular multimedia transmission service can include, but is not limited to, the allocation of a quantity or proportion of a resource (e.g., a particular proportion of a processor's bandwidth for processing the multimedia transmission service or a particular proportion of a cache for caching data related to the multimedia transmission service), an allocation of a priority (e.g., assigning a particular priority to thread scheduling and processing for the multimedia transmission service), a selective enabling of a filtering mechanism (e.g., configuring a network interface to filter out incoming network packets associated with the multimedia transmission service), or combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">For ease of illustration, certain techniques disclosed herein are described in an example context of an Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) network utilizing a multimedia receiver (e.g., a set top box (STB) device) at a viewer premises to interface between a display device, such as a television, monitor or display screen, and the multimedia content distribution network of a service provider. However, these techniques also can be implemented in other contexts without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In the context of a relatively fixed multimedia receiver, a viewer premises can include, for example, a residence or place of work of the viewer, a car, a boat, a plane or other vehicle, and the like. In the context of a portable multimedia receiver, such as a multimedia-enabled cellular phone, a viewer premises can include the viewer's personal space while operating the multimedia receiver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example multimedia content distribution system <b>100</b> having dynamic allocation of multimedia server resources in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. In the depicted example, the multimedia content distribution system <b>100</b> includes a service provider <b>102</b>, a plurality of viewer premises (viewer premises <b>104</b>-<b>107</b>), and a network <b>108</b>, whereby the network <b>108</b> connects the service provider <b>102</b> and the viewer premises <b>104</b>-<b>107</b>. The service provider <b>102</b> can include, for example, a cable television provider, a satellite television provider, an Internet-based multimedia content provider, and the like. Each of the viewer premises can include, for example, a display device <b>110</b> and a set top box (STB) device <b>112</b> or other multimedia receiver, such as a digital network radio receiver, a multimedia-enabled cellular phone, a digital radio receiver, and the like. The display device <b>110</b> can include, for example, a television, a monitor, or other display screen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The network <b>108</b> can include any of a variety of digital networks or a combination thereof. Examples of the network <b>108</b> can include an Internet-Protocol (IP)-based network, such as the Internet, an Ethernet network, a wireless network (e.g., an IEEE 802.1a/b/g/n-compatible network), a satellite network, a Bluetooth™-based network, and the like. The transmission medium of the network <b>108</b> for wire-based implementations can include, for example, a coaxial cable-based medium (e.g., a cable television medium), a digital subscriber line (DSL)-based medium (e.g., a plain old telephone system (POTS) medium), a fiber-optic medium, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The service provider <b>102</b> includes one or more multimedia servers (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) configured to provide one more multimedia transmission services supporting the distribution of multimedia content <b>114</b> to the viewer premises <b>104</b>-<b>107</b> via the network <b>108</b>. These multimedia transmission services can include, but are not limited to, a linear program broadcast service <b>116</b>, a program multicast service <b>117</b>, a packet retransmission service <b>118</b>, and a burst unicast service <b>119</b>. The linear program broadcast service <b>116</b> represents a broadcast transmission of multimedia content to at least a substantial subset of the viewers associated with the service provider <b>102</b>, such as an IP-based broadcast transmission of regular network television programming and regular cable television programming. The program multicast service <b>117</b> represents a multicast transmission of multimedia content to a more restricted subset of the viewers, such as an IP-based multicast of the multimedia content of a pay-per-view program event. The packet retransmission service <b>118</b> represents a retransmission of dropped or corrupted network packets for any of the other services, where the packet retransmission can be multicast when a significant proportion of the viewers are experiencing packet reception difficulties or, in some instances, unicast transmission to each viewer experiencing difficulties. Other examples of multimedia transmission services include multimedia encoding or transcoding (e.g., encoding video and audio information into compressed data in accordance with the H.264 format (also referred to as the MPEG4 format), the MPEG 2 format, the SMPTE 421M (VC-1) standard, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The service provider <b>102</b> and the network <b>108</b> each typically has a relatively fixed processing bandwidth and it often is the case that there are not enough multimedia server resources at the service provider <b>102</b> to ensure that each multimedia transmission service receives sufficient resources to achieve optimum performance of the multimedia transmission service. However, due to changing conditions, certain multimedia transmission services temporarily may have a higher precedence. To illustrate, due to the popularity of the National Football League (NFL™) Super Bowl as a televised event, viewers are unlikely to change channels frequently during the transmission of the football game itself, but there are likely to be many instant channel change requests during halftime as viewers browse other channels while waiting for the second half of the game to begin. Accordingly, since video quality is likely to be a more pressing issue than satisfactory performance for instant channel changes during the transmission of the football game, the linear program broadcast service <b>116</b> (which transmits the multimedia content of the game to the viewers) could be considered to have a higher priority than the burst unicast service <b>119</b> (which bursts video content to a viewer at the initiation of an instant channel change (ICC) request from the viewer) during the game itself. In contrast, the expected number of ICC requests during the halftime of the football game may make it appropriate to prioritize the burst unicast service <b>119</b> over the linear program broadcast service <b>116</b> to help ensure that the ICC requests from the viewers are satisfactorily handled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">To facilitate the more optimal processing of the multimedia transmission services, in one embodiment the service provider <b>102</b> includes a multimedia server resource allocation mechanism <b>120</b> to generate a predictive usage model <b>122</b> that provides a prediction of the resource needs of the multimedia transmission services for a given set of operating parameters (e.g., time of day, network status, special programming events, etc). The multimedia server resource allocation mechanism <b>120</b> further is configured to determine the operating parameters <b>124</b> for each successive time period (fixed or dynamic), and allocate multimedia server resources between the multimedia transmission services <b>116</b> based on the operating parameters <b>124</b> and the predictive usage model <b>122</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">To illustrate, the predictive usage model <b>122</b> may be conceptually represented by a matrix indicating a particular allocation of resources between the multimedia transmission services <b>116</b>-<b>119</b> for each matrix entry. Each matrix entry can be indexed based on a particular combination of operating parameters (e.g., combinations of the time of day, the day of the week, the programming content, and the status of the network <b>108</b>). The particular allocation for a given matrix entry can include, for example, a relative prioritization of the multimedia transmission services so as to determine the priority given by one or more multimedia servers in processing the multimedia transmission services. To illustrate, the particular allocation for a given time period could assign packets associated with the packet retransmission service <b>118</b> a higher priority for outgoing processing at a network interface of a multimedia server compared to packets associated with the linear program broadcast service <b>116</b>. The particular allocation alternately can include a specific allocation of resources to each multimedia transmission service. To illustrate, the particular allocation could allocate a first number of processor cores of a multiple-processor multimedia server to the burst unicast service <b>119</b> and allocate a second number of the processor cores to the linear program broadcast service <b>116</b>. The particular allocation of resources also can include the selective implementation of a filtering mechanism for one or more multimedia transmission services. To illustrate, a filtering mechanism can be enabled so that the network interface of a multimedia server disregards all incoming packet retransmission requests for the packet retransmission service <b>118</b> when it is appropriate to do so. The particular allocation also can include a combination of any of a priority assignment, a quantity/proportion allocation, or selective implementation of a filtering mechanism. Further, as discussed below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the particular allocation can be on an intra-server allocation, an inter-server allocation, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">By using the predictive usage model <b>122</b>, in at least one embodiment the particular allocation implemented by the multimedia server resource allocation mechanism <b>120</b> can dynamically change as the operating parameters <b>124</b> change. The change in operating parameters <b>124</b> can result from the typical change in programming over the course of a day or a week, as a result in the change in the status of the network <b>108</b>, and the like. The time period for which a particular resource allocation is implemented can be fixed, such as on a half-hour basis corresponding to the typical division of television programming into thirty-minute time slots. Alternately, the time period during which a particular allocation is implemented can be dynamic and can end in response to particular occurrences or non-occurrences of certain events. For example, one of the operating characteristics <b>124</b> can include a number of dropped packets such that once the number of dropped packets (or the proportion of dropped packets) exceeds a predetermined level, a new allocation is implemented that prioritizes the packet retransmission service <b>118</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Table 1 below illustrates a brief portion of a simple matrix representation of the predictive usage model <b>122</b>. Table 2 illustrates the corresponding relative resource utilization characteristic for each service.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In the example of Tables 1 and 2, the particular resource utilization characteristic of the multimedia transmission services for a given thirty minute time period on a given day of the week can be predicted from the matrix entry of the predictive usage model <b>122</b> indexed by the time period and day of the week. The identified resource utilization then can be used by the multimedia server resource allocation mechanism <b>120</b> to set relative priorities between the multimedia transmission services, to set particular hardware and software allocations, or to implement particular filter mechanisms as appropriate. To illustrate, the predicted usage for the time period at 7:00-7:30 PM on Monday is USAGE.sub.—3, which indicates that the burst unicast service <b>119</b> has a high resource utilization for this time period, whereas the program multicast service <b>117</b> and the linear program broadcast service <b>116</b> have a low resource utilization and a medium resource utilization, respectively, for this time period. Thus, the multimedia server resource allocation mechanism <b>120</b> may skew the allocation of multimedia server resources in favor of the burst unicast service <b>1</b> <b>19</b> during this time period.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition to operating parameters associated with the multimedia content being transmitted, the status of the network <b>108</b> can be used as an operating parameter in predictive modeling of future resource needs. To illustrate, a network outage typically causes a significant increase in the number of lost packets and, consequently, a corresponding increase in the number of packet retransmission requests from the receiving devices. Depending on the scope of a network outage in the multimedia content distribution system <b>100</b>, the service provider <b>102</b> could be flooded with millions of packet retransmission requests. The servicing of all of these packet retransmission requests could require extensive use of the multimedia server resources and therefore negatively impact the quality of other multimedia transmission services provided by the service provider <b>102</b>. Accordingly, as illustrated by Table 3 below, when a network outage is not detected, the default resource allocation resulting from the predicted usage of Table 1 can be utilized. In contrast, when a network outage is detected (e.g., either as a total outage or when a proportion of dropped packets to overall packets exceeds a threshold), the default allocation is overridden by a different allocation whereby the packet retransmission service <b>118</b> is deprioritized and packet retransmission requests are filtered out so as to prevent the multimedia servers of the service provider <b>102</b> from being overwhelmed from processing of a flood of packet retransmissions.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated by Table 4, the assignment of relative priorities among the multimedia transmission services for scheduling of processing within the multimedia servers of the service provider <b>102</b> (with a priority of 0 being highest priority) can dynamically at the change between one portion of the programming event to another (e.g., from broadcast of the game to a commercial break or from broadcast of the game to halftime) rather than, or in addition to, at a particular time or after a particular fixed duration. Further, as Table 4 illustrates, the predictive usage model <b>122</b> can include resource allocation information for the particular operating parameters <b>124</b> in addition to, or in place of, the predicted resource allocation information for the particular operating parameters <b>124</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The predictive usage model <b>122</b> can be generated in any of a variety of manners. In one embodiment, predictive usage model <b>122</b> is generated from historical resource utilization characteristics as reported by the multimedia servers for time periods having one or more characteristics in common, such as occurring at the same time of day, during the same day of the week, during the same day of the month, having the same programming category (e.g., sports, movies, or a particular series), or being used to transmit the same programming event (e.g., the transmission of a particular movie on two successive weekend nights), and the like. In addition to, or instead of, historical modeling, a designer or programmer can generate the predictive usage model <b>122</b> based on expectations of resource utilization by multimedia transmission services for future events for which there is little or no historical information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example implementation of a multimedia server <b>200</b> having dynamic intra-server resource allocation in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. The multimedia server <b>200</b> corresponds to one or more multimedia servers implemented by the service provider <b>102</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for the distribution of multimedia content to one or more viewer premises. In the illustrated example, the multimedia server <b>200</b> includes a processor bank <b>202</b> comprising one or more central processing units (CPUs) <b>204</b> or other processor cores, a memory <b>206</b> (e.g., random access memory), one or more busses <b>208</b> (e.g., a cross-point switch, a memory bus, etc.), a bus controller <b>210</b>, a direct memory access (DMA) controller <b>212</b>, a hard drive <b>214</b>, a network interface <b>216</b>, and an intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> (corresponding to the multimedia server resource allocation mechanism <b>120</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> can be implemented as software, hardware, firmware, or a combination thereof. To illustrate, the intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> can be implemented as a computer program <b>222</b> stored in the memory <b>206</b> or the hard drive <b>214</b>, whereby the computer program <b>222</b> comprises a set of instructions executed by one or more of the CPUs <b>204</b> so as to manipulate the one or more CPUs to perform the processes described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The network interface <b>216</b> is coupled to the network <b>108</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and performs network-level processing of incoming and outgoing data for the multimedia transmission services of the service provider <b>102</b>, such as the packetization of outgoing data, the depacketization of incoming data, the filtering of data packets, and requests for lost/damaged packet retransmission. The processor bank <b>202</b> handles the processing of data for the multimedia transmission services, such as the encoding or transcoding of multimedia content, multicast and broadcast group management, digital rights management (DRM), and the processing of incoming ICC requests and the processing of the resulting outgoing burst of multimedia content. The DMA controller <b>212</b> manages direct memory accesses to the memory <b>206</b> for the data associated with the multimedia transmission services. The bus controller <b>210</b> manages access to the one or more buses <b>208</b> for transferring data between the components of the multimedia server <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> includes inputs <b>231</b>-<b>235</b> to receive information from some or all of the resources of the multimedia server <b>200</b> regarding past utilization of the resources of the multimedia server <b>200</b> by the multimedia transmission services. To illustrate: the processor bank <b>202</b> can report processor utilization characteristics, cache utilization characteristics, and I/O utilization characteristics for each of the multimedia transmission services for particular past time periods; the memory <b>206</b> can provide memory utilization characteristics for past time periods, the bus controller <b>210</b> can provide bus utilization characteristics for past time periods, and so forth. The intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> can use these past resource utilization characteristics to generate the predictive usage model <b>122</b> as described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> further includes outputs <b>241</b>-<b>245</b> to the resources of the multimedia server <b>220</b> so as to configure the resources to process the multimedia transmission services in accordance with an allocation of resources determined from the predictive usage model <b>122</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). To illustrate, the intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> can configure the network interface <b>216</b> to flag packets associated with a particular multimedia transmission service as high priority, which may afford them a larger share of an incoming queue <b>224</b> or an outgoing queue <b>226</b> of the network interface <b>216</b>. The intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> further can configure the network interface <b>216</b> to implement filtering of incoming and outgoing packets based on the multimedia transmission service with which they are associated (e.g., by filtering out packets associated with a very low priority multimedia transmission service). Likewise, the intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> can configure the DMA <b>212</b> and the bus controller <b>210</b> to process data from the multimedia transmission services based on their respective priorities. Further, the intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> can allocate the CPUs <b>204</b> and caches (not shown) of the processor bank <b>202</b> based on the determined allocation, as well as prioritize execution threads and interrupts associated with the multimedia transmission services based on their respective priorities, and the like. Thus, in effect, the intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b> can distribute the “processing bandwidth” of the multimedia server <b>200</b> among the multimedia transmission services based on their relative priorities for a given time period as determined from the predictive usage model <b>122</b>. Table 5 below is a non-limiting list of multimedia server resources which may be allocated by the intra-server resource allocation module <b>220</b>.</div>
