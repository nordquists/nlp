<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In this specification, the terms “source” and “drain” of a transistor interchange with each other depending on the polarity of the transistor or the levels of potentials applied to the terminals. In general, in an n-channel transistor, a terminal to which a lower potential is applied is called a source, and a terminal to which a higher potential is applied is called a drain. Further, in a p-channel transistor, a terminal to which a lower potential is applied is called a drain, and a terminal to which a higher potential is applied is called a source. In this specification, although connection relation of the transistor is described assuming that the source and the drain are fixed in some cases for convenience, actually, the names of the source and the drain interchange with each other depending on the relation of the potentials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Note that in this specification, a “source” of a transistor means a source region that is part of a semiconductor film functioning as an active layer or a source electrode connected to the semiconductor film.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Note that in this specification, a state in which transistors are connected to each other in series means, for example, a state in which only one of a source and a drain of a first transistor is connected to only one of a source and a drain of a second transistor. In addition, a state in which transistors are connected parallel to each other means a state in which one of a source and a drain of a first transistor is connected to one of a source and a drain of a second transistor and the other of the source and the drain of the first transistor is connected to the other of the source and the drain of the second transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In this specification, the term “connection” means electrical connection and corresponds to a state where current, voltage, or a potential can be supplied or transmitted. Accordingly, a connection state means not only a state of direct connection but also a state of indirect connection through a circuit element such as a wiring, a resistor, a diode, or a transistor that allows current, voltage, or a potential to be supplied or transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In this specification, even when different components are connected to each other in a circuit diagram, there is actually a case where one conductive film has functions of a plurality of components such as a case where part of a wiring serves as an electrode. The term “connection” also means such a case where one conductive film has functions of a plurality of components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, in this specification, one of a first electrode and a second electrode of a transistor refers to a source electrode and the other refers to a drain electrode.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0284">For example, a method for controlling the concentration of impurities such as hydrogen and water contained in the oxide semiconductor and/or the oxygen vacancies in the film can be used as the method for controlling the resistivity of an oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0285">Specifically, plasma treatment can be used as a method for increasing or decreasing the concentration of impurities such as hydrogen and water and/or the oxygen vacancies in the film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0287" num="0286">Specifically, plasma treatment using a gas containing one or more kinds selected from a rare gas (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), hydrogen, boron, phosphorus, and nitrogen can be employed. For example, plasma treatment in an Ar atmosphere, plasma treatment in a mixed gas atmosphere of Ar and hydrogen, plasma treatment in an ammonia atmosphere, plasma treatment in a mixed gas atmosphere of Ar and ammonia, or plasma treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere can be employed. Thus, the oxide semiconductor film can have a high carrier density and a low resistivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0287">Alternatively, hydrogen, boron, phosphorus, or nitrogen is added to the oxide semiconductor film by an ion implantation method, an ion doping method, a plasma immersion ion implantation method, or the like, so that the oxide semiconductor film can have a low resistivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0288">Alternatively, an insulating film containing hydrogen is formed in contact with the oxide semiconductor film, and the hydrogen is diffused from the insulating film to the oxide semiconductor film, so that the oxide semiconductor film can have a high carrier density and a low resistivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0289">For example, an insulating film with a hydrogen concentration of greater than or equal to 1×10<sup>22 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>is formed in contact with the oxide semiconductor film, in that case hydrogen can be effectively supplied to the oxide semiconductor film. Specifically, a silicon nitride film can be used as the insulating film formed in contact with the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0290">Hydrogen contained in the oxide semiconductor film reacts with oxygen bonded to a metal atom to be water, and an oxygen vacancy is formed in a lattice from which oxygen is released (or a portion from which oxygen is released). Due to entry of hydrogen into the oxygen vacancy, an electron serving as a carrier is generated in some cases. Furthermore, bonding of part of hydrogen to oxygen bonded to a metal atom causes generation of an electron serving as a carrier in some cases. Thus, the oxide semiconductor film can have a high carrier density and a low resistivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0291">Specifically, an oxide semiconductor with a hydrogen concentration measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) of greater than or equal to 8×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably greater than or equal to 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably greater than or equal to 5×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>can be suitably used for the conductive film <b>524</b>, the first region <b>508</b>A, or the second region <b>508</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0292">On the other hand, an oxide semiconductor with a high resistivity can be used for a semiconductor film where a channel of a transistor is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0294" num="0293">For example, an insulating film containing oxygen, in other words, an insulating film capable of releasing oxygen, is formed in contact with an oxide semiconductor film, and the oxygen is supplied from the insulating film to the oxide semiconductor film, so that oxygen vacancies in the film or at the interface can be filled. Thus, the oxide semiconductor film can have a high resistivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0295" num="0294">For example, a silicon oxide film or a silicon oxynitride film can be used as the insulating film capable of releasing oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0296" num="0295">The oxide semiconductor film in which oxygen vacancies are filled and the hydrogen concentration is reduced can be referred to as a highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film. The term “substantially intrinsic” refers to the state in which an oxide semiconductor film has a carrier density lower than 8×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than 1×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than 1×10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has few carrier generation sources and thus can have a low carrier density. The highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has a low density of defect states and accordingly can have a low density of trap states.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0296">Furthermore, a transistor including the highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has an extremely low off-state current; even when an element has a channel width of 1×10<sup>6 </sup>μm and a channel length L of 10 μm, the off-state current can be lower than or equal to the measurement limit of a semiconductor parameter analyzer, that is, lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>−13 </sup>A, at a voltage (drain voltage) between a source electrode and a drain electrode of from 1 V to 10 V.</div>

A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has few carrier generation sources, and thus can have a low carrier density. Thus, a transistor in which a channel region is formed in the oxide semiconductor film rarely has a negative threshold voltage (is rarely normally on). A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has a low density of defect states and accordingly has few carrier traps in some cases. Further, the highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has an extremely low off-state current; even when an element has a channel width of 1×10<sup>6 </sup>μm and a channel length of 10 μm, the off-state current can be less than or equal to the measurement limit of a semiconductor parameter analyzer, that is, less than or equal to 1×10<sup>−13 </sup>A, at a voltage (drain voltage) between a source electrode and a drain electrode of from 1 V to 10 V.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0541" num="0540">Furthermore, the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> can be formed using insulating films formed of the same kinds of materials; thus, a boundary between the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> cannot be clearly observed in some cases. Thus, in this embodiment, the boundary between the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> is shown by a dashed line. Although a two-layer structure of the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> is described in this embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this.

As the oxide insulating film having a blocking effect against oxygen, hydrogen, water, and the like, an aluminum oxide film, an aluminum oxynitride film, a gallium oxide film, a gallium oxynitride film, an yttrium oxide film, an yttrium oxynitride film, a hafnium oxide film, a hafnium oxynitride film, and the like can be given.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0543" num="0542">Although the variety of films such as the conductive films, the insulating films, and the oxide semiconductor films which are described above can be formed by a sputtering method or a PECVD method, such films may be formed by another method, e.g., a thermal CVD method. Examples of the thermal CVD method include a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method and an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0544" num="0543">A thermal CVD method has an advantage that no defect due to plasma damage is generated since it does not utilize plasma for forming a film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0545" num="0544">Deposition by a thermal CVD method may be performed in such a manner that a source gas and an oxidizer are supplied to the chamber at a time so that the pressure in a chamber is set to an atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure, and react with each other in the vicinity of the substrate or over the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0546" num="0545">Deposition by an ALD method may be performed in such a manner that the pressure in a chamber is set to an atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure, source gases for reaction are sequentially introduced into the chamber, and then the sequence of the gas introduction is repeated. For example, two or more kinds of source gases are sequentially supplied to the chamber by switching respective switching valves (also referred to as high-speed valves). For example, a first source gas is introduced, an inert gas (e.g., argon or nitrogen) or the like is introduced at the same time as or after the introduction of the first gas so that the source gases are not mixed, and then a second source gas is introduced. Note that in the case where the first source gas and the inert gas are introduced at a time, the inert gas serves as a carrier gas, and the inert gas may also be introduced at the same time as the introduction of the second source gas. Alternatively, the first source gas may be exhausted by vacuum evacuation instead of the introduction of the inert gas, and then the second source gas may be introduced. The first source gas is adsorbed on the surface of the substrate to form a first layer; then the second source gas is introduced to react with the first layer; as a result, a second layer is stacked over the first layer, so that a thin film is formed. The sequence of the gas introduction is repeated plural times until a desired thickness is obtained, whereby a thin film with excellent step coverage can be formed. The thickness of the thin film can be adjusted by the number of repetition times of the sequence of the gas introduction; therefore, an ALD method makes it possible to accurately adjust a thickness and thus is suitable for manufacturing a minute FET.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0547" num="0546">The variety of films such as the conductive films, the insulating films, the oxide semiconductor films, and the metal oxide films in this embodiment can be formed by a thermal CVD method such as an MOCVD method or an ALD method. For example, in the case where an In—Ga—Zn—O film is formed, trimethylindium, trimethylgallium, and dimethylzinc are used. Note that the chemical formula of trimethylindium is In(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. The chemical formula of trimethylgallium is Ga(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. The chemical formula of dimethylzinc is Zn(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0548" num="0547">For example, in the case where a hafnium oxide film is formed by a deposition apparatus using an ALD method, two kinds of gases, that is, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) as an oxidizer and a source gas which is obtained by vaporizing liquid containing a solvent and a hafnium precursor compound (e.g., a hafnium alkoxide or a hafnium amide such as tetrakis(dimethylamide)hafnium (TDMAH)) are used. Note that the chemical formula of tetrakis(dimethylamide)hafnium is Hf[N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>4</sub>. Examples of another material liquid include tetrakis(ethylmethylamide)hafnium.</div>

Examples of another material liquid include tris(dimethylamide)aluminum, triisobutylaluminum, and aluminum tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0550" num="0549">For example, in the case where a silicon oxide film is formed by a deposition apparatus using an ALD method, hexachlorodisilane is adsorbed on a surface where a film is to be formed, chlorine included in the adsorbate is removed, and radicals of an oxidizing gas (e.g., O<sub>2 </sub>or dinitrogen monoxide) are supplied to react with the adsorbate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0551" num="0550">For example, in the case where a tungsten film is formed using a deposition apparatus using an ALD method, a WF<sub>6 </sub>gas and a B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>gas are sequentially introduced plural times to form an initial tungsten film, and then a WF<sub>6 </sub>gas and an H<sub>2 </sub>gas are used, so that a tungsten film is formed.

The conductive films <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and <b>120</b> <i>b </i>serve as semiconductors before a step of forming the insulating film <b>118</b> and serve as conductors after the step of forming the insulating film <b>118</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0573" num="0572">To allow the conductive films <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and <b>120</b> <i>b </i>to serve as conductors, an oxygen vacancy is formed in the conductive films <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and <b>120</b> <i>b </i>and hydrogen is added from the insulating film <b>118</b> to the oxygen vacancy, whereby a donor level is formed in the vicinity of the conduction band. As a result, the conductivity of each of the conductive films <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and <b>120</b> <i>b </i>is increased, so that the oxide semiconductor film becomes a conductor. The conductive films <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and <b>120</b> <i>b </i>having become conductors can each be referred to as oxide conductor. Oxide semiconductors generally have a visible light transmitting property because of their large energy gap. An oxide conductor is an oxide semiconductor having a donor level in the vicinity of the conduction band.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0578" num="0577">The oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> can be formed using the materials described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0579" num="0578">In the case where the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>includes In-M-Zn oxide, it is preferable that the atomic ratio of metal elements of a sputtering target used for forming the In-M-Zn oxide satisfy In&gt;M. The atomic ratio between metal elements in such a sputtering target is, for example, In:M:Zn=2:1:3, InM:Zn=3:1:2, or In:M:Zn=4:2:4.1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0580" num="0579">In the case where the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c </i>is In-M-Zn oxide, it is preferable that the atomic ratio of metal elements of a sputtering target used for forming a film of the In-M-Zn oxide satisfy In≤M. The atomic ratio of metal elements in such a sputtering target is, for example, InM:Zn=1:1:1, In:M:Zn=1:1:1.2, InM:Zn=1:3:2, InM:Zn=1:3:4, InM:Zn=1:3:6, or InM:Zn=1:4:5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0581" num="0580">In the case where the oxide semiconductor films <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and <b>108</b> <i>c </i>are formed of In-M-Zn oxide, it is preferable to use a target including polycrystalline In-M-Zn oxide as the sputtering target. The use of the target including polycrystalline In-M-Zn oxide facilitates formation of the oxide semiconductor films <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and <b>108</b> <i>c </i>having crystallinity. Note that the atomic ratios of metal elements in each of the formed oxide semiconductor films <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and <b>108</b> <i>c </i>vary from the above atomic ratio of metal elements of the sputtering target within a range of ±40% as an error. For example, when a sputtering target of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>with an atomic ratio of In to Ga and Zn of 4:2:4.1 is used, the atomic ratio of In to Ga and Zn in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>may be 4:2:3 or in the vicinity of 4:2:3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0582" num="0581">The energy gap of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is 2 eV or more, preferably 2.5 eV or more, further preferably 3 eV or more. The use of an oxide semiconductor having a wide energy gap can reduce off-state current of the transistor <b>100</b>. In particular, an oxide semiconductor film having an energy gap more than or equal to 2 eV, preferably more than or equal to 2 eV and less than or equal to 3.0 eV is preferably used as the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b</i>, and an oxide semiconductor film having an energy gap more than or equal to 2.5 eV and less than or equal to 3.5 eV is preferably used as the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c</i>. Furthermore, the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c </i>preferably has a higher energy gap than the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0583" num="0582">Each thickness of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c </i>is more than or equal to 3 nm and less than or equal to 200 nm, preferably more than or equal to 3 nm and less than or equal to 100 nm, more preferably more than or equal to 3 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0584" num="0583">An oxide semiconductor film with low carrier density is used as the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c</i>. For example, the carrier density of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c </i>is lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, still further preferably lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0585" num="0584">Note that, without limitation to the compositions and materials described above, a material with an appropriate composition may be used depending on required semiconductor characteristics and electrical characteristics (e.g., field-effect mobility and threshold voltage) of a transistor. Further, in order to obtain required semiconductor characteristics of a transistor, it is preferable that the carrier density, the impurity concentration, the defect density, the atomic ratio of a metal element to oxygen, the interatomic distance, the density, and the like of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c </i>be set to be appropriate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0586" num="0585">Note that it is preferable to use, as the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c</i>, an oxide semiconductor film in which the impurity concentration is low and the density of defect states is low, in which case the transistor can have more excellent electrical characteristics. Here, the state in which the impurity concentration is low and the density of defect states is low (the amount of oxygen vacancy is small) is referred to as “highly purified intrinsic” or “substantially highly purified intrinsic”. A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has few carrier generation sources, and thus can have a low carrier density. Thus, a transistor in which a channel region is formed in the oxide semiconductor film rarely has a negative threshold voltage (is rarely normally on). A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has a low density of defect states and accordingly has few carrier traps in some cases. Further, the highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has an extremely low off-state current; even when an element has a channel width of 1×10<sup>6 </sup>μm and a channel length of 10 μm, the off-state current can be less than or equal to the measurement limit of a semiconductor parameter analyzer, that is, less than or equal to 1×10<sup>−13 </sup>A, at a voltage (drain voltage) between a source electrode and a drain electrode of from 1 V to 10 V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0587" num="0586">Accordingly, the transistor in which the channel region is formed in the highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film can have a small change in electrical characteristics and high reliability. Charges trapped by the trap states in the oxide semiconductor film take a long time to be released and may behave like fixed charges. Thus, the transistor whose channel region is formed in the oxide semiconductor film having a high density of trap states has unstable electrical characteristics in some cases. As examples of the impurities, hydrogen, nitrogen, alkali metal, and alkaline earth metal are given.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0588" num="0587">Hydrogen included in the oxide semiconductor film reacts with oxygen bonded to a metal atom to be water, and also causes oxygen vacancy in a lattice from which oxygen is released (or a portion from which oxygen is released). Due to entry of hydrogen into the oxygen vacancy, an electron serving as a carrier is generated in some cases. Furthermore, in some cases, bonding of part of hydrogen to oxygen bonded to a metal atom causes generation of an electron serving as a carrier. Thus, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film which contains hydrogen is likely to be normally on. Accordingly, it is preferable that hydrogen be reduced as much as possible in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. Specifically, in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, the concentration of hydrogen which is measured by SIMS is lower than or equal to 2×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than or equal to 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than or equal to 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than or equal to 5×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, and further preferably lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0589" num="0588">The oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>preferably includes a region in which hydrogen concentration is smaller than that in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c</i>. A semiconductor device including the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>having the region in which hydrogen concentration is smaller than that in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c </i>can be increased in reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0590" num="0589">When silicon or carbon that is one of elements belonging to Group 14 is included in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b</i>, oxygen vacancy is increased in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b</i>, and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>becomes an n-type film. Thus, the concentration of silicon or carbon (the concentration is measured by SIMS) in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>or the concentration of silicon or carbon (the concentration is measured by SIMS) in the vicinity of an interface with the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>is set to be lower than or equal to 2×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than or equal to 2×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0591" num="0590">In addition, the concentration of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b</i>, which is measured by SIMS, is lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than or equal to 2×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. Alkali metal and alkaline earth metal might generate carriers when bonded to an oxide semiconductor, in which case the off-state current of the transistor might be increased. Therefore, it is preferable to reduce the concentration of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0592" num="0591">Furthermore, when including nitrogen, the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>easily becomes n-type by generation of electrons serving as carriers and an increase of carrier density. Thus, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film which contains nitrogen is likely to have normally-on characteristics. For this reason, nitrogen in the oxide semiconductor film is preferably reduced as much as possible; the concentration of nitrogen which is measured by SIMS is preferably set to be, for example, lower than or equal to 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0593" num="0592">The oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c </i>may have a non-single-crystal structure, for example. The non-single crystal structure includes a c-axis aligned crystalline oxide semiconductor (CAAC-OS) which is described later, a polycrystalline structure, a microcrystalline structure, or an amorphous structure, for example. Among the non-single crystal structure, the amorphous structure has the highest density of defect states, whereas CAAC-OS has the lowest density of defect states.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0594" num="0593">The insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> function as a second gate insulating film of the transistor <b>100</b>. In addition, the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> each have a function of supplying oxygen to the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. That is, the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> contain oxygen. Furthermore, the insulating film <b>114</b> is an insulating film which can transmit oxygen. Note that the insulating film <b>114</b> also functions as a film which relieves damage to the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> at the time of forming the insulating film <b>116</b> in a later step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0595" num="0594">For example, the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> described in Embodiment 4 can be used as the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> in this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0101" num="0000">&lt;&lt;Oxide Semiconductor Film Functioning as Conductive Film, Oxide Semiconductor Film Functioning as Second Gate Electrode&gt;&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0596" num="0595">The material of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> described above can be used for the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>b </i>functioning as the second gate electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0597" num="0596">That is, the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>b </i>functioning as a second gate electrode contain a metal element which is the same as that contained in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> (the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c</i>). For example, the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>b </i>functioning as a second gate electrode and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> (the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> <i>c</i>) contain the same metal element; thus, the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0598" num="0597">For example, in the case where the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>b </i>functioning as a second gate electrode are each In-M-Zn oxide, the atomic ratio of metal elements in a sputtering target used for forming the In-M-Zn oxide preferably satisfies In≥M. The atomic ratio of metal elements in such a sputtering target is InM:Zn=2:1:3, In:M:Zn=3:1:2, In:M:Zn=4:2:4.1, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0599" num="0598">The conductive film <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>b </i>functioning as a second gate electrode can each have a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure of two or more layers. Note that in the case where the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>b </i>each have a stacked-layer structure, the composition of the sputtering target is not limited to that described above.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0600" num="0599">The insulating film <b>118</b> serves as a protective insulating film of the transistor <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0601" num="0600">The insulating film <b>118</b> includes one or both of hydrogen and nitrogen. Alternatively, the insulating film <b>118</b> includes nitrogen and silicon. The insulating film <b>118</b> has a function of blocking oxygen, hydrogen, water, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, or the like. It is possible to prevent outward diffusion of oxygen from the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, outward diffusion of oxygen included in the insulating films <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>, and entry of hydrogen, water, or the like into the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> from the outside by providing the insulating film <b>118</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0602" num="0601">The insulating film <b>118</b> has a function of supplying one or both of hydrogen and nitrogen to the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>a </i>and the conductive film <b>120</b> <i>b </i>functioning as a second gate electrode.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0742" num="0741">An example of a semiconductor device (memory device) which can retain stored data even when not powered and which has an unlimited number of write cycles is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A to 27C</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0743" num="0742">The semiconductor device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref> includes a transistor <b>3200</b> using a first semiconductor material, a transistor <b>3300</b> using a second semiconductor material, and a capacitor <b>3400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0744" num="0743">The first and second semiconductor materials preferably have different energy gaps. For example, the first semiconductor material can be a semiconductor material other than an oxide semiconductor (examples of such a semiconductor material include silicon (including strained silicon), germanium, silicon germanium, silicon carbide, gallium arsenide, aluminum gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, gallium nitride, and an organic semiconductor), and the second semiconductor material can be an oxide semiconductor. A transistor using a material other than an oxide semiconductor, such as single crystal silicon, can operate at high speed easily. On the other hand, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor has a low off-state current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0745" num="0744">The transistor <b>3300</b> is a transistor in which a channel is formed in a semiconductor layer including an oxide semiconductor. Since the off-state current of the transistor <b>3300</b> is small, stored data can be retained for a long period. In other words, power consumption can be sufficiently reduced because a semiconductor memory device in which refresh operation is unnecessary or the frequency of refresh operation is extremely low can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0746" num="0745">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>, a first wiring <b>3001</b> is electrically connected to a source electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b>. A second wiring <b>3002</b> is electrically connected to a drain electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b>. A third wiring <b>3003</b> is electrically connected to one of a source electrode and a drain electrode of the transistor <b>3300</b>. A fourth wiring <b>3004</b> is electrically connected to a gate electrode of the transistor <b>3300</b>. A gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b> and the other of the source electrode and the drain electrode of the transistor <b>3300</b> are electrically connected to one electrode of the capacitor <b>3400</b>. A fifth wiring <b>3005</b> is electrically connected to the other electrode of the capacitor <b>3400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0747" num="0746">The semiconductor device in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> has a feature that the potential of the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b> can be retained, and thus enables writing, retaining, and reading of data as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0748" num="0747">Writing and retaining of data are described. First, the potential of the fourth wiring <b>3004</b> is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>3300</b> is turned on, so that the transistor <b>3300</b> is turned on. Accordingly, the potential of the third wiring <b>3003</b> is supplied to the gate of the transistor <b>3200</b> and the capacitor <b>3400</b>. That is, a predetermined charge is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b> (writing). Here, one of two kinds of charges providing different potential levels (hereinafter referred to as a low-level charge and a high-level charge) is supplied. After that, the potential of the fourth wiring <b>3004</b> is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>3300</b> is turned off, so that the transistor <b>3300</b> is turned off. Thus, the charge supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b> is held (retaining).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0749" num="0748">Since the off-state current of the transistor <b>3300</b> is extremely small, the charge of the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b> is retained for a long time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0750" num="0749">Next, reading of data is described. An appropriate potential (a reading potential) is supplied to the fifth wiring <b>3005</b> while a predetermined potential (a constant potential) is supplied to the first wiring <b>3001</b>, whereby the potential of the second wiring <b>3002</b> varies depending on the amount of charge retained in the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b>. This is because in the case of using an n-channel transistor as the transistor <b>3200</b>, an apparent threshold voltage V<sub>th_H </sub>at the time when the high-level charge is given to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b> is lower than an apparent threshold voltage V<sub>th_L </sub>at the time when the low-level charge is given to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b>. Here, an apparent threshold voltage refers to the potential of the fifth wiring <b>3005</b> which is needed to turn on the transistor <b>3200</b>. Thus, the potential of the fifth wiring <b>3005</b> is set to a potential V<sub>0 </sub>which is between V<sub>th_H </sub>and V<sub>th_L</sub>, whereby charge supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b> can be determined. For example, in the case where the high-level charge is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b> in writing and the potential of the fifth wiring <b>3005</b> is V<sub>0 </sub>(&gt;V<sub>th_H</sub>), the transistor <b>3200</b> is turned on. On the other hand, in the case where the low-level charge is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b> in writing, even when the potential of the fifth wiring <b>3005</b> is V<sub>0 </sub>(V<sub>th_L</sub>), the transistor <b>3200</b> remains off. Thus, the data retained in the gate electrode of the transistor <b>3200</b> can be read by determining the potential of the second wiring <b>3002</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0751" num="0750">Note that in the case where memory cells are arrayed, it is necessary that data of a desired memory cell is read. For example, the fifth wiring <b>3005</b> of memory cells from which data is not read may be supplied with a potential at which the transistor <b>3200</b> is turned off regardless of the potential supplied to the gate electrode, that is, a potential lower than V<sub>th_H</sub>, whereby only data of a desired memory cell can be read. Alternatively, the fifth wiring <b>3005</b> of the memory cells from which data is not read may be supplied with a potential at which the transistor <b>3200</b> is turned on regardless of the potential supplied to the gate electrode, that is, a potential higher than V<sub>th_L</sub>, whereby only data of a desired memory cell can be read.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0752" num="0751">The semiconductor device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref> is different from the semiconductor device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> in that the transistor <b>3200</b> is not provided. Also in this case, writing and retaining operation of data can be performed in a manner similar to the semiconductor device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0753" num="0752">Next, reading of data of the semiconductor device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref> is described. When the transistor <b>3300</b> is turned on, the third wiring <b>3003</b> which is in a floating state and the capacitor <b>3400</b> are electrically connected to each other, and the charge is redistributed between the third wiring <b>3003</b> and the capacitor <b>3400</b>. As a result, the potential of the third wiring <b>3003</b> is changed. The amount of change in the potential of the third wiring <b>3003</b> varies depending on the potential of the one electrode of the capacitor <b>3400</b> (or the charge accumulated in the capacitor <b>3400</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0754" num="0753">For example, the potential of the third wiring <b>3003</b> after the charge redistribution is (C<sub>B</sub>×V<sub>B0</sub>+C×V)/(C<sub>B</sub>+C), where V is the potential of the one electrode of the capacitor <b>3400</b>, C is the capacitance of the capacitor <b>3400</b>, CB is the capacitance component of the third wiring <b>3003</b>, and V<sub>B0 </sub>is the potential of the third wiring <b>3003</b> before the charge redistribution. Thus, it can be found that, assuming that the memory cell is in either of two states in which the potential of the one electrode of the capacitor <b>3400</b> is V<sub>1 </sub>and V<sub>0 </sub>(V<sub>1</sub>&gt;V<sub>0</sub>), the potential of the third wiring <b>3003</b> in the case of retaining the potential V<sub>1 </sub>(=(C<sub>B</sub>×V<sub>B0</sub>+C×V<sub>1</sub>)/(C<sub>B</sub>+C)) is higher than the potential of the third wiring <b>3003</b> in the case of retaining the potential V<sub>0 </sub>(=(C<sub>B</sub>×V<sub>B0</sub>+C×V<sub>0</sub>)/(C<sub>B</sub>+C)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0755" num="0754">Then, by comparing the potential of the third wiring <b>3003</b> with a predetermined potential, data can be read.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0756" num="0755">In this case, a transistor including the first semiconductor material may be used for a driver circuit for driving a memory cell, and a transistor including the second semiconductor material may be stacked over the driver circuit as the transistor <b>3300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0757" num="0756">When including a transistor in which a channel formation region is formed using an oxide semiconductor and which has an extremely small off-state current, the semiconductor device described in this embodiment can retain stored data for an extremely long time. In other words, refresh operation becomes unnecessary or the frequency of the refresh operation can be extremely low, which leads to a sufficient reduction in power consumption. Moreover, stored data can be retained for a long time even when power is not supplied (note that a potential is preferably fixed).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0758" num="0757">Furthermore, in the semiconductor device described in this embodiment, high voltage is not needed for writing data and there is no problem of deterioration of elements. Unlike in a conventional nonvolatile memory, for example, it is not necessary to inject and extract electrons into and from a floating gate; thus, a problem such as deterioration of a gate insulating film is not caused. That is, the semiconductor device described in this embodiment does not have a limit on the number of times data can be rewritten, which is a problem of a conventional nonvolatile memory, and the reliability thereof is drastically improved. Furthermore, data is written depending on the state of the transistor (on or off), whereby high-speed operation can be easily achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0759" num="0758">The above memory device can also be used in an LSI such as a digital signal processor (DSP), a custom LSI, or a programmable logic device (PLD), in addition to a central processing unit (CPU), and a radio frequency identification (RF-ID) tag, for example.</div>

The second terminal of the switch <b>1203</b> (the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1213</b>) is electrically connected to the first terminal of the switch <b>1204</b> (the one of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1214</b>). The second terminal of the switch <b>1204</b> (the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1214</b>) is electrically connected to a wiring that can supply a power supply potential VDD. The second terminal of the switch <b>1203</b> (the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1213</b>), the first terminal of the switch <b>1204</b> (the one of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1214</b>), an input terminal of the logic element <b>1206</b>, and one of a pair of electrodes of the capacitor <b>1207</b> are electrically connected to each other. Here, the connection portion is referred to as a node M<b>1</b>. The other of the pair of electrodes of the capacitor <b>1207</b> can be supplied with a constant potential. For example, the other of the pair of electrodes of the capacitor <b>1207</b> can be supplied with a low power supply potential (e.g., GND) or a high power supply potential (e.g., VDD). The other of the pair of electrodes of the capacitor <b>1207</b> is electrically connected to the wiring that can supply a low power supply potential (e.g., a GND line). The other of the pair of electrodes of the capacitor <b>1208</b> can be supplied with a constant potential. For example, the other of the pair of electrodes of the capacitor <b>1208</b> can be supplied with a low power supply potential (e.g., GND) or a high power supply potential (e.g., VDD). The other of the pair of electrodes of the capacitor <b>1208</b> is electrically connected to the wiring that can supply a low power supply potential (e.g., a GND line).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0772" num="0771">The capacitor <b>1207</b> and the capacitor <b>1208</b> are not necessarily provided as long as the parasitic capacitance of the transistor, the wiring, or the like is actively utilized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0773" num="0772">A control signal WE is input to a first gate (first gate electrode) of the transistor <b>1209</b>. As for each of the switch <b>1203</b> and the switch <b>1204</b>, a conduction state or a non-conduction state between the first terminal and the second terminal is selected by the control signal RD that is different from the control signal WE. When the first terminal and the second terminal of one of the switches are in the conduction state, the first terminal and the second terminal of the other of the switches are in the non-conduction state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0774" num="0773">A signal corresponding to data retained in the circuit <b>1201</b> is input to the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1209</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> illustrates an example in which a signal output from the circuit <b>1201</b> is input to the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1209</b>. The logic value of a signal output from the second terminal of the switch <b>1203</b> (the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1213</b>) is inverted by the logic element <b>1206</b>, and the inverted signal is input to the circuit <b>1201</b> through the circuit <b>1220</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0775" num="0774">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, a signal output from the second terminal of the switch <b>1203</b> (the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1213</b>) is input to the circuit <b>1201</b> through the logic element <b>1206</b> and the circuit <b>1220</b>; however, one embodiment of the present invention is not limited thereto. The signal output from the second terminal of the switch <b>1203</b> (the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1213</b>) may be input to the circuit <b>1201</b> without its logic value being inverted. For example, in the case where the circuit <b>1201</b> includes a node in which a signal obtained by inversion of the logic value of a signal input from the input terminal is retained, the signal output from the second terminal of the switch <b>1203</b> (the other of the source and the drain of the transistor <b>1213</b>) can be input to the node.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0776" num="0775">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the transistors included in the memory element <b>1200</b> except for the transistor <b>1209</b> can each be a transistor in which a channel is formed in a layer formed using a semiconductor other than an oxide semiconductor or in the substrate <b>1190</b>. For example, the transistor can be a transistor whose channel is formed in a silicon layer or a silicon substrate. Alternatively, a transistor in which a channel is formed in an oxide semiconductor film can be used for all the transistors in the memory element <b>1200</b>. Further alternatively, in the memory element <b>1200</b>, a transistor in which a channel is formed in an oxide semiconductor film can be included besides the transistor <b>1209</b>, and a transistor in which a channel is formed in a layer formed using a semiconductor other than an oxide semiconductor or the substrate <b>1190</b> can be used for the rest of the transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0777" num="0776">As the circuit <b>1201</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, for example, a flip-flop circuit can be used. As the logic element <b>1206</b>, for example, an inverter or a clocked inverter can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0778" num="0777">In a period during which the memory element <b>1200</b> is not supplied with the power supply voltage, the semiconductor device described in this embodiment can retain data stored in the circuit <b>1201</b> by the capacitor <b>1208</b> that is provided in the circuit <b>1202</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0779" num="0778">The off-state current of a transistor in which a channel is formed in an oxide semiconductor film is extremely small. For example, the off-state current of a transistor in which a channel is formed in an oxide semiconductor film is significantly smaller than that of a transistor in which a channel is formed in silicon having crystallinity. Thus, when the transistor in which a channel is formed in an oxide semiconductor film is used as the transistor <b>1209</b>, a signal is retained in the capacitor <b>1208</b> for a long time also in a period during which the power supply voltage is not supplied to the memory element <b>1200</b>. The memory element <b>1200</b> can accordingly retain the stored content (data) also in a period during which the supply of the power supply voltage is stopped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0780" num="0779">Since the memory element performs pre-charge operation with the switch <b>1203</b> and the switch <b>1204</b>, the time required for the circuit <b>1201</b> to retain original data again after the supply of the power supply voltage is restarted can be shortened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0781" num="0780">In the circuit <b>1202</b>, a signal retained by the capacitor <b>1208</b> is input to the gate of the transistor <b>1210</b>. Thus, after supply of the power supply voltage to the memory element <b>1200</b> is restarted, the signal retained by the capacitor <b>1208</b> can be converted into the one corresponding to the state (the on state or the off state) of the transistor <b>1210</b> to be read from the circuit <b>1202</b>. Consequently, an original signal can be accurately read even when a potential corresponding to the signal retained by the capacitor <b>1208</b> changes to some degree.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0782" num="0781">By using the above-described memory element <b>1200</b> in a memory device such as a register or a cache memory included in a processor, data in the memory device can be prevented from being lost owing to the stop of the supply of the power supply voltage. Furthermore, shortly after the supply of the power supply voltage is restarted, the memory device can be returned to the same state as that before the power supply is stopped. Thus, the power supply can be stopped even for a short time in the processor or one or a plurality of logic circuits included in the processor, resulting in lower power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0783" num="0782">Although the memory element <b>1200</b> is used in a CPU in this embodiment, the memory element <b>1200</b> can also be used in an LSI such as a digital signal processor (DSP), a custom LSI, or a programmable logic device (PLD), and a radio frequency identification (RF-ID).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0803" num="0802">In this specification and the like, for example, when it is explicitly described that X and Y are connected, the case where X and Y are electrically connected, the case where X and Y are functionally connected, and the case where X and Y are directly connected are included therein.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0804" num="0803">Here, X and Y each denote an object (e.g., a device, an element, a circuit, a line, an electrode, a terminal, a conductive film, or a layer).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0805" num="0804">For example, in the case where X and Y are directly connected, an element that enables electrical connection between X and Y (e.g., a switch, a transistor, a capacitor, an inductor, a resistor, a diode, a display element, a light-emitting element, or a load) is not connected between X and Y, and X and Y are connected without the element that enables electrical connection between X and Y (e.g., a switch, a transistor, a capacitor, an inductor, a resistor, a diode, a display element, a light-emitting element, or a load) provided therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0806" num="0805">For example, in the case where X and Y are electrically connected, one or more elements that enable electrical connection between X and Y (e.g., a switch, a transistor, a capacitor, an inductor, a resistor, a diode, a display element, a light-emitting element, or a load) can be connected between X and Y. A switch is controlled to be on or off. That is, a switch is conducting or not conducting (is turned on or off) to determine whether current flows therethrough or not. Alternatively, the switch has a function of selecting and changing a current path. Note that the case where X and Y are electrically connected includes the case where X and Y are directly connected.</div>

Note that for example, in the case where a signal output from X is transmitted to Y even when another circuit is interposed between X and Y, X and Y are functionally connected.

Here, X, Y, Z1, and Z2 each denote an object (e.g., a device, an element, a circuit, a wiring, an electrode, a terminal, a conductive film, and a layer).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0813" num="0812">Even when independent components are electrically connected to each other in a circuit diagram, one component has functions of a plurality of components in some cases. For example, when part of a wiring also functions as an electrode, one conductive film functions as the wiring and the electrode. Thus, “electrical connection” in this specification includes in its category such a case where one conductive film has functions of a plurality of components.</div>
