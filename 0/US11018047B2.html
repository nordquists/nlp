<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/621,820, entitled “HYBRID LIFT PIN” and filed on Jan. 25, 2018, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein for reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure generally relates to apparatus for gas-phase processes. More particularly, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure relate to lift pins and to apparatus including lift pins.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Gas-phase reactors for processing substrates, such as semiconductor wafers, often include a susceptor within a reaction chamber. During processing, one or more substrates are placed within the reaction chamber and onto the susceptor using a robotic arm. After processing, the substrate(s) are removed from the surface of the susceptor and through an opening in the reaction chamber using the robotic arm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">During the substrate transfer process, lift pins, which extend through a vertical width of the susceptor and beyond, can be used to facilitate placement and removal of the substrate on and from the surface of the susceptor. In such cases, a substrate can be placed onto the susceptor by causing the lift pins to rise above the surface of the susceptor, placing the substrate onto the lift pins, and lowering the lift pins, such that the substrate rests on the susceptor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The susceptor and the lift pins are often formed of different materials. For example, a susceptor can be formed of silicon carbide coated graphite, and lift pins can be formed of silicon carbide or quartz. Because of differences in emissivity, heat conductance, and/or heat capacity of the different susceptor and lift pin materials, hot or cold spots can form on a substrate overlying the susceptor in the locations of the lift pins. The hot or cold spots can cause deposition or etch rates of material on a surface of the substrate in the area of the lift pins to be different (higher or lower) than areas away from the lift pins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, improved lift pins and apparatus including the lift pins are desired.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide improved lift pins and apparatus including the lift pins. As set forth in more detail below, in accordance with various embodiments of the disclosure, the improved lift pins provide better temperature uniformity across a surface of a substrate support assembly including the improved lift pins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with at least one embodiment of the disclosure, a lift pin includes a first section comprising a material having a first transparency and a second section comprising a material having a second transparency. The second section can act as a light pipe, collecting and reflecting all or most of the infrared and/or visible light and transmitting the infrared and/or visible light to the first section. In accordance with various aspects of these embodiments, the material having a first transparency comprises quartz. The material having a first transparency can be relatively opaque in the infrared region of the light spectrum—also referred to herein as infrared light (e.g., light having a wavelength of about 750 nm to about 1 mm), as measured, using e.g., Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). For example, the first transparency of infrared light can range from 0 or about 0 to about 10%, 0 or about 0 to about 5%, or 0 or about 0 to about 2%. The material having a second transparency can additionally or alternatively comprises quartz. The second transparency of infrared light can range from about 85 to about 100%, about 90 to about 100% (or less than 100%), or about 95 to about 100% (or less than 100%). In accordance with further aspects, the lift pin can include about 1 to about 60%, about 2 to about 55%, or about 5 to about 50% of the first section by length, mass, or volume. Additionally or alternatively, the lift pin can include about 40 to about 99%, about 2 to about 98%, or about 45 to about 98% of the second section by length, mass, or volume. The first section and the second section can be fused or welded together to form the lift pin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with further exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, a substrate support assembly includes a susceptor and one or more lift pins, such as a lift pin as described herein. The substrate support assembly can additionally include a susceptor support coupled to the susceptor, a rotatable shaft coupled to the susceptor support, and a lift pin mechanism to cause the moveable shaft to move in a vertical direction during a substrate transfer process.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The present disclosure generally relates to lift pins and assemblies including the lift pins. As set forth in more detail below, the lift pins and the assemblies can be used in the manufacturing of devices, such as devices formed using semiconductor substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The description of exemplary embodiments of lift pins and assemblies provided below is merely exemplary and is intended for purposes of illustration only; the following description is not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure or the claims. Moreover, recitation of multiple embodiments having stated features is not intended to exclude other embodiments having additional features or other embodiments incorporating different combinations of the stated features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The lift pins and assemblies described herein can be used to mitigate temperature variation across a surface of the substrate support assembly (e.g., across a surface of a susceptor of the assembly) and/or across a surface of a substrate. By reducing temperature variation across the susceptor and/or substrate surface, more uniform processing (e.g., cleaning, depositing, or etching of material) across a surface of the substrate can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, lift pins <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> are illustrated.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a reactor <b>700</b> in accordance with at least one embodiment of the disclosure is illustrated. Reactor <b>700</b> includes a reaction chamber <b>702</b>, including a reaction region <b>704</b> and a substrate lift mechanism <b>706</b>. As described in more detail below, during a substrate transfer operation, substrate lift mechanism <b>706</b> facilitates placement of a substrate <b>716</b> onto a top surface <b>722</b> of a susceptor <b>718</b> within reaction region <b>704</b> to allow removal of substrate <b>716</b> through an opening <b>720</b> of reaction chamber <b>702</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Reaction chamber <b>702</b> can be formed of, for example, quartz, and can be formed as a unitary piece, such as a tube. By way of example, reaction region <b>704</b> within reaction chamber <b>702</b> can have a rectangular cross section having a width of about 350 mm to about 450 mm (or be about 420 mm), a length of about 400 mm to about 800 mm (or be about 760 mm), and a height of about 20 mm to about 40 mm (or be about 30 mm). As noted above, reaction chamber <b>702</b> includes an opening <b>720</b> that resides above top surface <b>722</b> of susceptor <b>718</b> (e.g., when surface <b>722</b> is in a processing position).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Reaction chamber <b>702</b> can be suitable for a variety of applications, such as film (e.g., epitaxial) deposition processes, etch processes, clean processes, and the like. Further, reactor <b>700</b> can be a standalone reactor or form part of a cluster tool that may include similar or different reaction chambers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Substrate lift mechanism <b>706</b> includes at least one lift pin <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> (e.g., any of the lift pins described above), a lift pin support member <b>712</b> that can engage with and couple to the at least one pin <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>, and a movable shaft <b>714</b> mechanically coupled to the lift pin support member. During a substrate transfer process, substrate lift mechanism <b>706</b> causes the at least one lift pin <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> to be raised or lowered to allow placement of substrate <b>716</b> onto surface <b>722</b> and/or removal of substrate <b>716</b> from surface <b>722</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Although two lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, reactor <b>700</b> includes three (e.g., equally) spaced apart lift pins. Reactors in accordance with other embodiments of the disclosure can include any suitable number of lift pins and generally include three or more lift pins. A length L of lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> can vary according to application. Generally a length of lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> allows lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> to extend through a width W of susceptor <b>718</b> and above the susceptor top surface <b>722</b>—for example, when receiving a substrate <b>716</b> from a robotic arm (not illustrated) or presenting substrate <b>716</b> to be received by the robotic arm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure, lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> have a length L of about 20 to about 40 mm or about 30 mm (e.g., about 32.3 mm). This is a significantly shorter length than typical lift pins and allows processing and substrate transfer within a common region, namely reaction region <b>704</b>. Lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> can include a beveled section <b>724</b> (e.g., tapered section as described above) that is received within a portion of susceptor <b>718</b>. Beveled section <b>724</b> allows lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> to be received within a via <b>726</b> within susceptor <b>718</b> and to be retained at a desired level (e.g., a top surface of lift pins can be about planar with surface <b>722</b> or reside just (e.g., a few mm or less) below surface <b>722</b>. This allows susceptor <b>718</b> to retain lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> when, for example, lift pin support member <b>712</b> is not engaged with lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>. A top surface <b>728</b>, <b>730</b> of lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> can have a diameter of about 3 to about 6 mm, or about 4 mm, as noted above. Top surface <b>728</b>, <b>730</b> can be polished to a smooth finish (e.g., a roughness average of about 0.05 to 0.2 μm or less) to prevent or mitigate surface damage to substrate <b>716</b> during a transfer process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Lift pin support member <b>712</b> engages with lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> and moveable shaft <b>714</b>. In the illustrated example, lift pin support member <b>712</b> removably engages with lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> and is coupled to moveable shaft <b>714</b>. This allows movable shaft <b>714</b> to move only in a vertical direction (and not rotate), while allowing susceptor <b>718</b> to rotate—e.g., during substrate processing. Lift pin support member <b>712</b> can be formed of, for example, SiC-coated graphite, quartz, or glassy carbon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in more detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, lift pin support member <b>712</b> includes a plurality of lift pin arms <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>. Although two lift pin support arms are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the illustrated lift pin support member <b>712</b> includes three lift pin support arms. Each lift pin support arm <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> includes a first end <b>806</b>, <b>808</b> coupled to moveable shaft <b>714</b> and a second end <b>810</b>, <b>812</b> that receives and engages with a lift pin (e.g., one of lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>). Second end <b>810</b>, <b>812</b> can include, for example, a recess <b>814</b>, <b>816</b> to receive a bottom portion <b>818</b>, <b>820</b> of one or more lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>.

As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when lift pin support member <b>712</b> is disengaged from lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>, lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> are retained by susceptor <b>718</b>, allowing susceptor <b>718</b> to rotate, without requiring support member <b>712</b> and/or moveable shaft <b>714</b> to rotate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Moveable shaft <b>714</b> is in the form of a hollow tube. Moveable shaft <b>714</b> can be formed of, for example, quartz. In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, moveable shaft is configured to move a vertical distance of 5 to about 25 mm (or ˜17 mm). As a result, lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> can move about 5 to about 25 mm (or ˜17 mm), and lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b> can extend to a height of up to about 5, 10, or 20 mm above surface <b>722</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Susceptor <b>718</b> can be formed of, for example, SiC or SiC-coated graphite. In accordance with various examples of the disclosure, width W of susceptor <b>718</b> is relatively small to allow lift pin-assisted substrate transfer and processing in a single region—e.g., reaction region <b>704</b>. In accordance with various embodiments of the disclosure, a width W of susceptor <b>718</b> at a peripheral region <b>822</b> is less than a width of susceptor <b>718</b> at a center region <b>824</b> of susceptor <b>718</b>. This configuration can allow for a relatively thin susceptor—especially at the peripheral region—while allowing susceptor <b>718</b> to rotate and perform other functions, such as protecting an end of a thermocouple and providing desired heat transfer to and/or from substrate <b>716</b>. By way of examples, the width at peripheral region <b>822</b> ranges from about 3 to about 6.5 mm (or be ˜3.8 mm). A width of center region <b>824</b> can range from about 6 to about 10 mm (or be ˜6.4 mm).</div>

Structures <b>736</b>, <b>738</b> can engage with susceptor <b>718</b> and susceptor support arms <b>826</b>, <b>828</b>. Alternatively, structures <b>736</b>, <b>738</b> can be integrally formed with susceptor support arms <b>826</b>, <b>828</b>. Susceptor support arms <b>826</b>, <b>828</b> and structures <b>736</b>, <b>738</b> can be formed of, for example, SiC, SiC-coated graphite, or quartz.

In accordance with these embodiments, substrate support assembly <b>830</b> includes susceptor <b>718</b>, susceptor support <b>734</b>, rotatable shaft <b>732</b>, lift pin support member <b>712</b>, one or more lift pins <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>, moveable shaft <b>714</b>, a lift pin mechanism to cause the moveable shaft to move in a vertical direction during a substrate transfer process, and a susceptor rotation mechanism that causes susceptor <b>718</b> to rotate during substrate processing. As noted above, in accordance with various examples of the disclosure, susceptor <b>718</b> does not move in a vertical direction during substrate transfer—i.e., susceptor <b>718</b> does not move in a vertical direction as lift pins are raised and/or lowered and/or during other steps of a substrate transfer process. The lift pin mechanism and the susceptor rotation mechanism can be combined, as described in U.S. application Ser.
