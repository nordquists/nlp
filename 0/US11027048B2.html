<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates generally to the field of bioengineering and in particular to methods for producing decellularized, sterilized, and bioprosthetic tissues.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Tissue and organ transplantation is a rapidly growing therapeutic field as a result of improvements in surgical procedures, advancements in immunosuppressive drugs and increased knowledge of graft/host interaction. There are numerous investigations underway directed toward the engineering of improved transplantable tissue grafts, however, it is generally believed in the industry that ideal implants have yet to be produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of decellularized tissue scaffolds have been explored as a possibility for tissue engineering, however, the existing approaches have proven inadequate. References of interest include U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,743,574; 5,336,616; Gratzer et al., Tissue Engineering, 12(10):2975-2983 (2006); Woods et al., Biomaterials, 26:7339-7349 (2005); Williams et al., Acta Biomaterialia, 5:993-1005 (2009); Liao et al., Biomaterials, 29:1065-1074 (2008); Wilson et al., Ann Thorac Surg, 60:S353-S358 (1995); PCT App. Pub.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite major advancements in the field of biomedical engineering, modern tissue transplantation remains associated with complications including inflammation, degradation, scarring, contracture, calcification (hardening), occlusion, and/or rejection. Moreover, existing technologies for producing decellularized tissue scaffolds have failed to sufficiently reduce the number of cells in the tissue to an adequate level. Therefore, there is a need in the art for methods of producing tissues that avoid or reduce the above-described drawbacks and thus have greater short- and long-term usability. There is also a further need in the art for methods of producing sterile, decellularized tissues.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Decellularization technology is a method that has the potential to revolutionize tissue allograft transplantation. Decellularization involves extracting cellular materials (the source of immune response and viruses) from allograft tissues leaving an intact, structurally native extracellular matrix scaffold comprised of collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans. Moreover, the decellularization process as described herein gives rise to safer and more sterile grafts by eliminating bacteria and viruses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The description relates to preferred aspects by way of illustration only. It should be noted that from the following discussion, alternative aspects disclosed herein will be readily recognized as viable alternatives that can be employed without departing from the principles of what is claimed. It should be noted that the language used herein has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and it can not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter. Accordingly, the present disclosure is intended to be illustrative, but not limiting, of the scope of claimed methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a decellularized tissue” includes a combination of two or more decellularized tissues, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein any reference to “one aspect” or “an aspect” means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the aspect is included in at least one aspect. The appearances of the phrase “in one aspect” in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same aspect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes,” “including,” “has,” “having” or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion. For example, a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but can include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, “or” refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">“About” as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount, a temporal duration, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of ±20% or ±10%, more preferably ±5%, even more preferably ±1%, and still more preferably ±0.1% from the specified value, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The term “nucleic acid” refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form, composed of monomers (nucleotides) containing a sugar, phosphate and a base which is either a purine or pyrimidine. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the majority of organisms is the genetic material while ribonucleic acid (RNA) is involved in the transfer of information contained within DNA into proteins. The terms “nucleic acid,” “nucleic acid molecule,” “nucleic acid fragment,” “nucleic acid sequence or segment,” or “polynucleotide” may also be used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, DNA and RNA encoded by a gene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The terms “polypeptide,” “protein,” and “peptide” are used interchangeably herein. It is well-known in the art of protein biochemistry that amino acids, the ‘building blocks’ of proteins, have particular sizes and characteristics, such as charge, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. For example, nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In certain aspects, the present disclosure provides for tissue that is substantially free of some component (e.g., one or more cytoskeletal proteins, MHC molecules, or pathogens such as bacteria and viruses). As used herein, the term “substantially free” means that the presence of a particular component is either not detected using known assays, or if it is detected, it is only present in an amount that is in accordance with the tissue regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as set forth in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 1270 and 1271, herein incorporated by reference. In various aspects, “substantially free” can include a tissue that is about 90%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% free of a component.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">Methods</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In certain aspects, the decellularization methods of the present disclosure involve a series of progressively more sterile wash steps that include variations between hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic conditions, surfactant, enzyme, and physiological buffer solutions. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a general flowchart that is representative of the methods of one embodiment of the present disclosure. Each stage of the process is designed to sequentially break down and remove cellular components while preventing the degradation or disruption of extracellular matrix components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">According to certain aspects of the present disclosure, hypoosmotic conditions are first applied to burst cells. When the sample comprises skin, these conditions also serve to gently remove the epidermal cellular layer while leaving the underlying basement membrane matrix intact. In certain aspects, a second solution is applied, wherein that solution comprises a high salt content and surfactant (e.g., Triton-X100®). This second solution is utilized to solubilize and remove cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal components. In further aspects, cellular genetic materials are then degraded using endonucleases (e.g., DNAse, RNAse) which can also attack bacteria and viruses. In further aspects, tissues can subsequently be treated with a solution comprising a chaotropic agent and/or a surfactant to further removed any residual disrupted cellular materials. In certain aspects, that solution comprises tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP), a chaotropic agent that disrupts hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds. TnBP is also known to improve sterility by deactivating and removing viral proteins from blood products (Horowitz et al., Blood, 79(3):852-831 (1992)). Certain aspects of the present disclosure involve the additional step of washing the tissue as sufficient to provide residual surfactant levels far below cellular toxicity levels (Gratzer et al., Tissue Engineering, 12(10):2975-2983 (2006)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Although certain methods are asserted to provide tissue decellularization, the present disclosure describes one of the first known methods actually giving rise to substantially complete decellularization. Most decellularization processes can be classified as a physically-based process, a chemically-based process, or a biochemically-based process. There are many protocols that borrow from several of these process classifications and interpretation of the effects of decellularization on the extracellular matrix becomes more difficult as the complexity of the protocols increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The present disclosure relates in some aspects to a method of rendering a tissue acellular. In various aspects of the present disclosure, decellularization can be accomplished using a number of chemical treatments, including incubation in certain salts, detergents or enzymes. The method comprises exposing the tissue to a hypotonic solution under conditions such that cell lysis results, and subjecting the resulting tissue to nuclease treatment so as to remove nucleic acids and associated phosphorous-containing groups. Nuclease treatment effectively stops cell replication and protein synthesis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In some aspects, a method for producing a human bioprosthetic tissue is described herein. In some aspects the method includes contacting a human tissue with a hypotonic solution to produce a lysed tissue. In some aspects the method includes contacting the lysed tissue with a first surfactant solution to produce a surfactant-treated tissue. In some aspects the method includes contacting the surfactant-treated tissue with a nuclease enzyme solution to produce an enzyme-treated tissue. In some aspects the method includes contacting the enzyme-treated tissue with a cleaning solution comprising a second surfactant, a chaotropic agent, or a mixture thereof, to produce a decellularized tissue. In some aspects the method includes contacting the decellularized tissue with a bioburden reducing agent solution to produce the human bioprosthetic tissue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In some aspects the method includes contacting a human tissue with a hypotonic solution to produce a lysed tissue. As used herein, “hypotonic solution” means an aqueous solution with a salt concentration lower than that found in normal cells of the body (e.g., &lt;300 mOsm). A hyptonic solution is generally designed to (i) cause the cells in the tissue to absorb water (hypotonic conditions) and eventually burst and (ii) cause the intact epidermal layer of a tissue to separate from the underlying dermis while leaving the basement membrane intact. Thus, a hyptonic solution can be any aqueous solution with a salt concentration less than that found in normal cells (i.e. &lt;300 mOsm) that causes cell swelling. A hyptonic solution can include one or more organic or inorganic buffers, an alkaline pH, one or more antibiotics/antimycotics, one or more protease inhibitors, and osmolarity maintained that is hypotonic to cells. In some aspects, alkaline pH helps to limit protease activity, where desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In some aspects the method includes contacting a human tissue with a first surfactant solution to produce a surfactant-treated tissue. As used herein “first surfactant solution” means a solution including an anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic, and/or cationic detergent. An anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic, and/or cationic detergent can include Triton X-100, Triton X-200, Tween 20, Tween 80, sodium deoxycholate, CHAPS, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), N-lauroyl-sarcosinate, Igepal CA630, and/or Sulfobetain-10 and -16. In some aspects the first surfactant solution can be a high saline (e.g., &gt;1M), buffered solution at an alkaline pH (e.g., pH=8-10) containing 0.2-3% (v/v) of the anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic or cationic detergent. In some aspects the first surfactant solution can include salt (e.g., KCl, NaCl), one or more organic or inorganic buffers, one or more antibiotics/antimycotics, one or more anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic or cationic detergents and one or more protease inhibitors. The first surfactant solution is generally designed to remove cell membranes and cytoskeletal components. Alkaline pH helps to limit protease activity, where desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The use of the detergent Triton X-100® has been demonstrated to remove cellular membranes, as detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,299. Other acceptable decellularizing detergents include polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan mono-oleate and polyoxyethylene (80) sorbitan mono-oleate (TWEEN 20® and 80), sodium deoxycholate, 3-[(3-chloramidopropyl)-dimethylammino]-1-propane-sulfonate, octyl-glucoside and sodium dodecyl sulfate. In some aspects, a detergent can include octylphenol ethylene oxide condensate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In some aspects the method includes contacting a human tissue with a nuclease enzyme solution to produce an enzyme-treated tissue. As used herein the term “enzyme” refers to a protein-based biocatalyst. An enzyme can generally be used to breakdown nucleic and ribonucleic acids. Enzymes can include nucleases such as endonucleases (e.g., DNAse, RNAse, Benzonase). In some aspects, Deoxyribonuclease I is from bovine pancreas (<i>Bos Taurus</i>) (NM_174534.2; NP_776959.1). In some aspects, Ribonuclease A is from bovine pancreas (<i>Bos Taurus</i>) (NM_181810.1; NP_861526.1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In certain aspects, enzymes can be used to accomplish decellularization, including but not limited to dispase II, trypsin, and thermolysin. These enzymes react with different components of collagen and intercellular connections in achieving their effects. Dispase II attacks Type IV collagen, which is a component of the lamina densa and anchoring fibrils of the basement membrane. Thermolysin attacks the bulbous phemphigoid antigen in the hemidesmosome of the basal layer of keratinocytes. Trypsin attacks the desmosome complex between cells. Due to the protcolytic nature of these enzymes, care must be taken that cellular removal occurs without significant damage to the extracellular matrix, including the basement membrane complex. This is a function of concentration, time and temperature. If used for too long a time or at too high a concentration, dispase II for example can completely remove the basement membrane complex from the dermis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In some aspects the method includes contacting a human tissue with a cleaning solution comprising a second surfactant, a chaotropic agent, or a mixture thereof, to produce a decellularized tissue. As used herein the term “cleaning solution” means a solution that includes an anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic and/or cationic detergent or a chaotropic agent. An anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic and/or cationic detergent can include Triton X-100, Triton X-200, Tween 20, Tween 80, sodium deoxycholate, CHAPS, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), N-lauroyl-sarcosinate, Igepal CA630, and/or Sulfobetain-10 and -16. As used herein “chaotropic agent” means a substance that increases the transfer of apolar groups to water because of its ability to decrease the ‘ordered’ structure of water and to increase its lipophilicity. A chaotropic agent generally causes the dissolution of biological membranes, the solubilization of particulate proteins, changes in the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of proteins, and denaturation of nucleic acids. A chaotropic agent can include Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP), ions (e.g. SCN<sup>−</sup>, CNS<sup>−</sup>, ClO<sub>4</sub> <sup>−</sup>, I<sup>−</sup>, Br<sup>−</sup>, CH<sub>3</sub> <sup>−</sup>, COO<sup>−</sup>), urea derivatives, guanidine derivatives. In some aspects a cleaning solution can include one or more organic or inorganic buffers, one or more antibiotics/antimycotics, an alkaline pH, and the solution is prepared in sterile water or 70% ethanol as the solvent. In some aspects a cleaning solution can include 0.2-3% (v/v) of an anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic or cationic detergent or a chaotropic agent, one or more organic or inorganic buffers, one or more antibiotics/antimycotics, an alkaline pH, and the solution is prepared in either an (i) aqueous or (ii) 70% ethanol solvent. The cleaning solution is generally designed to remove any remaining cellular components (e.g., cytoskeletal proteins, DNA, RNA fragments). As above, alkaline pH helps to limit protease activity, where desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">In some aspects the method includes contacting a human tissue with an isotonic solution. As used herein “isotonic solution” means an aqueous solution with a salt concentration approximately equal or equal to that found in normal cells of the body. In some aspects, isotonic solutions can include Lactated Ringer's solution, Normal Saline solution (0.9%), and Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In some aspects the method includes contacting a human tissue with a protease inhibitor. As used herein “protease inhibitor” means an agent that is capable of deactivating enzymes that are capable of degrading proteins. Protease inhibitors can include phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF), aprotinin, leupeptin, and Ethylenediamineteteraacetic acid (EDTA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In various aspects, protease inhibitors are employed in combination with other reagents to prevent degradation of the extracellular matrix. Collagen-based connective tissues contain proteases and collagenases as endogenous enzymes in the extracellular protein matrix. Additionally, certain cell types including smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells contain a number of these enzymes inside vesicles called lysosomes. When these cells are damaged by events such as hypoxia, the lysosomes are ruptured and their contents released. As a result, the extracellular matrix can undergo severe damage from protein, proteoglycan and collagen breakdown. This damage can be severe, as evidenced in clinical cases of cardiac ischemia where a reduction in oxygen which is insufficient to cause cell death results in pronounced damage to the collagen matrix. Additionally, a consequence of extracellular breakdown is the release of chemoattractants, which solicit inflammatory cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, to the graft, which are intended to remove dead or damaged tissue. These cells also, however, perpetuate the extracellular matrix destruction through a nonspecific inflammatory response. Accordingly, the processing solution contains one or more protease inhibitors selected from the group of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethylene glycol-bis-(2-aminoethyl(ether)NNN′N′-tetraacetic acid, ammonium chloride, elevated pH, apoprotinin and leupeptin to prevent such damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In some aspects the method includes contacting a human tissue with a bioburden reducing agent solution. As used herein “bioburden reducing agent” means an agent that can inactivate, destroy, or eliminate infectious materials (e.g., bacteria, spores, fungi, mold, or viruses). Bioburden reducing agents can include an antibacterial agent, an alcohol (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propoyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl), an antiviral agent, an antimycotic agent, chlorine dioxide, a detergent, antimicrobials, antifungal agents, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide, and/or peracetic acid. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,962, herein incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The solutions of the present disclosure may optionally comprise an appropriate buffer. The buffer can involve one of many different organic buffers. In certain aspects, an organic buffer is selected from the group consisting of 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), Tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N′-[2-ethanesulfonic acid] (HEPES). Alternatively, a low salt or physiological buffer including phosphate bicarbonate acetate citrate glutamate with or without glycine, can be more appropriate in certain applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In some aspects, one or more of the solutions used in the presently disclosed methods further comprise at least one protease inhibitor. In certain aspects, the protease inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor, metalloprotease inhibitor, or a combination thereof. In some aspects, one or more of the solutions used in the presently disclosed methods comprises at least one enzyme. In certain aspects, that enzyme is DNase, RNase, or a combination thereof. In some aspects, one or more of the solutions used in the presently disclosed methods comprises a surfactant. In certain aspects, that surfactant is an anionic surfactant.

In some aspects, one or more of the solutions used in the presently disclosed methods further comprises about 70% ethanol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In certain aspects, a combination of physical treatments and chemical or biochemical treatments can be used for tissue decellularization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In certain aspects, cells are lysed physically using osmotic gradients, mechanical compression/massage, or freeze-thaw cycles. Hypertonic and hypotonic treatments put hydrostatic pressure on cell membranes in an aqueous environment causing them to burst and release their cell contents. The contents of the cell are then more accessible to later treatments with detergents or isotonic washout procedures. Mechanical compression or massage can be used to encourage membrane degradation and gradually expose more cell membranes to extraction solutions. Freeze-thaw cycles can be used to kill cells and then fracture their cell membranes so that subsequent washout procedures can access internal cell contents and fragmented membranes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In further aspects, the method includes carrying out one or more steps at a temperature of between about 20° C. and 40° C. In further aspects, one or more steps of the method is carried out at about 30° C. In further aspects, one or more steps of the method is carried out at room temperature. In further aspects, one or more steps of the method is carried out at 37° C. In further aspects, one or more steps of the method is carried out at 22° C.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">In some aspects, tissues are harvested and prepared for treatment. The extent of tissue preparation is dependant upon the tissue to be treated, but usually involves removing extraneous tissue elements and cutting the tissue to size in order to facilitate decellularization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In some aspects, a tissue is immersed in a hypotonic salt (&lt;300 mOsm) solution with a pH=7-9 (e.g., about 7, 7, about 8, 8, 9, or about 9), with anti-proteolytic agents whose concentration are dependant upon inhibitor used (e.g., phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF), aprotinin, leupeptin, Ethylenediamineteteraacetic acid (EDTA)), anti-microbial agents (e.g., penicillin, vancomycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, kanamycin, neomycin, sodium azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>)) with or without anti-fungal agents (e.g., Amphotericin B, Nystain) prepared with a type II cell culture grade deionized water.

To the container is then added 1.5 mL of a penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic/antimycotic 100× solution (stock concentration of 10,000 U/mL/10,000 mg/mL). This step of the decellularization treatment can also be performed using a solution made up as 1% (v/v) TnBP in 70% ethanol without antibiotics/antimycotics. The tissue then gently mixed on a shaker table (45-60 RPM) at T=20-25° C. for 48 hours with fresh solution changes every 12 hours. This stage is designed to further remove any remaining cellular components (cytoskeletal proteins, DNA, RNA) as TnBP is a “surfactant like” chaotropic solvent. Further, TnBP has been shown to deactivate viruses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">In some aspects, after treatment, the solution is decanted and refreshed with 300 mL of 50 mM Tris buffer solution adjusted to pH 9 (containing no TnBP). The same amount of antibiotic/antimycotic solution (penicillin/streptomycin) previous used is added and the container is allowed to mix gently on a shaker table (at 40-65 RPM), T=20-25° C., for 24 hours with fresh solution changed at 12 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">In some aspects, the previous pH 9 Tris buffer solution is decanted and replaced with 300 mL of a 1% (v/v) Peracetic Acid (PAA) solution in ethanol (PAA solution consisted of 2% peracetic acid, 100% ethanol, and sterile water (ratio v/v/v 2/1/1), providing a final sterilization solution of 1% PAA) for 4 hours, mixing gently on a shaker table (at 40-65 RPM), at T=20-40° C. After PAA treatment, fresh sterile phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS, containing 0.14 M sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, 6.5 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, 1.5 mM potassium phosphate monobasic and is adjusted to pH 7.4). The same amount of antibiotic/antimycotic (penicillin/streptomycin) solution used previously is added and the container is allowed to mix gently on a shaker table (at 40-65 RPM), T=20-25° C., for 12 hours. After, the specimen is rinsed twice for 30 minutes each with 300 mL fresh sterile phosphate buffered saline solution at room temperature containing no antibiotics/antimycotics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">In some aspects, each piece of tissue is bottled under sterile conditions with a minimum volume ratio of solution to tissue of 20:1 to 50:1 in either (i) fresh sterile phosphate buffered saline solution infused with penicillin/streptomycin (6 mL/L of 100× solution with a stock concentration of 10,000 U/mL/10,000 mg/mL) solution or (ii) 70% ethanol and stored at 4° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">Detergents</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Critical to the success of many decellularization strategies are detergents or surfactants. Various detergents can be used according to the present methods. Detergents are useful for decellularization when they are added in a sufficient concentration to form micelles. A micelle is a cluster of detergent monomers, often spherical, that is oriented so that the non-polar domains of the detergent molecules are interacting internally, and the polar domains are interacting with water molecules externally. The concentration at which detergents form micelles is called the critical micelle concentration (CMC). The CMC varies with decellularization conditions, including ionic strength, pH, temperature and the presence of protein and lipids (including other detergent molecules). Micelles occupy space in the aqueous environment, and as such, must disrupt hydrogen bonds between water molecules. During decellularization, the extraction of cell components, including lipids and proteins from tissue, is accomplished when these micelles enter the tissue, dissolve non-polar components, and are washed out with solution changes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">Detergents can be classified by one of three designations: ionic, nonionic, and zwitterionic. Ionic detergents are either anionic or cationic, although cationic detergents are not used in decellularization processes due to their strong denaturing tendencies. A subgroup of ionic detergents are the bile acid salts, found in the intestine where they solubilize fats. Bile acids are milder than other anionic detergents such as SDS. Nonionic detergents, such as Triton X-100®, have neutral polar head groups and are non-denaturing to proteins. Nonionic detergents break lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions. Finally, zwitterionic detergents, such as CHAPS, have properties of both ionic and nonionic detergents. Zwitterionic detergents are generally milder than ionic detergents and more denaturing to proteins than nonionic detergents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">Solvents</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Various solvents can be used according to the present methods for the disruption of protein and lipid interactions by destabilizing hydrophobic interactions. In some aspects, tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) is used. An added benefit to the use of TnBP in a decellularization protocol is its proven anti-viral action (Horowitz et al., Blood, 79:826-831 (1992); Horowitz et al., Dev Biol Stand, 81:147-161 (1993)). In further aspects of the present methods, any other solvent showing good decellularization performance with very little damage to the extracellular matrix can be used (Woods, M Sc Thesis Dalhousie University, Halifax NS, Canada (2002); Woods et al., Biomaterials, 26:7339-7349 (2005)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">Protease Protection and Antibiotic/Anti-Viral Treatments</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">During decellularization, lysed cells release the contents of lysosomes into the extracellular space. Many of the enzymes released, especially proteases, are highly effective at degrading the extracellular matrix. One goal of decellularization is to preserve the intact extracellular matrix while removing cellular components, so the action of degradative enzymes is counterproductive. In various aspects of the present disclosure, protease inhibitors are present during the initial cell lysis phase of the procedure. In further aspects of the present disclosure, protease inhibitors are additionally present during subsequent phases of the decellularization process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">According to the present disclosure, protease inhibition can be achieved through a combination of methods. In certain aspects, lysosomal proteases are inhibited by using elevated pH (˜pH 8). In further aspects, chelating agents that bind metallic enzyme cofactors such as magnesium, iron, or zinc (e.g., EDTA or 1,10 phenanthroline) are also used. In various aspects, chemical inhibition of proteases can be achieved by the addition of any one of a number of common protease inhibitors. Chemical inhibitors according to the present methods can include phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF), aprotinin, or leupeptin. PMSF (irreversible binding) and aprotinin (reversible binding) inhibit serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, whereas leupeptin (low stability in aqueous environments) inhibits both serine and cysteine proteases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">According to certain aspects of the present disclosure, methods are provided for the inhibition of bacteria. Inhibition of bacteria is beneficial in part because the decellularization process is not generally performed aseptically. In various aspects, common antibiotics used for decellularization treatments are used and can include gram positive bacteria cell wall synthesis inhibitors (e.g., penicillin or vancomycin), bacteria and mycoplasma protein synthesis inhibitors (e.g., streptomycin or gentamicin) and agents that induce ribosomal miscoding in gram positive/negative bacteria and mycoplasma (kanamycin). In further aspects, sodium azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>) is also added to decellularization solutions to inhibit microbial growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In some aspects, one or more of the solutions used in the presently disclosed methods further comprises at least one bioburden reducing agent. In further aspects the bioburden reducing agent is penicillin, streptomycin, peracetic acid, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">The use of allografts and xenografts is complicated by the potential for disease transmission. Many porcine tissues contain porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), even after decellularization (Leyh et al., J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 126:1000-1004 (2003); Walles et al., Eur J Cardiothorac Surg, 24:358-363 (2003)). Thus, in certain aspects, methods are provided for eliminating viruses. In further aspects, peracetic acid and/or ethanol treatments are used in conjunction with decellularization for the elimination of viruses (Hodde et al., Biotechnol Bioeng, 79:211-216 (2002)). In further aspects, the organic solvent TnBP is employed for the added purpose of diminishing the presence of viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) (Horowitz et al., Blood, 79:826-831 (1992); Horowitz et al., Dev Biol Stand, 81:147-161 (1993)). In further aspects, anionic detergents have the effect of diminishing the presence of viruses (e.g., HIV and other enveloped viruses) (Luscher-Mattli, Antivir Chem Chemother, 11:249-259 (2000); Cserhati et al., Environment International, 28:337-348 (2002)). In certain aspects, the extracellular matrix is loaded with protease inhibitors, antibiotics, and antiviral agents at the end of the decellularization procedure.</div>

<heading id="h-0015">Example 1: Decellularization of Human Skin</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Materials and Methods</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Decellularization Protocol</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Fresh frozen human skin from 6 donors (n=6) was procured, thawed at room temperature in its packaging, and prepared for treatment. The extent of tissue preparation was dependent upon the quality of the skin obtained, but generally involved removing extraneous tissue elements and cutting the tissue to size. The size of skin used was 4 cm×5 cm and tissues were treated with a minimum volume ratio of solution to tissue of 50:1 unless otherwise stated. For this example, three specimens of human skin were treated in one container. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted and the product numbers are provided in brackets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">The basic decellularization protocol followed is outlined in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This first stage of the decellularization treatment was designed to (i) cause the cells in the tissue to absorb water (hypotonic conditions) and eventually burst and (ii) cause the intact epidermal layer to separate from the underlying dermis while leaving the basement membrane intact. Specimens of fresh human skin were transferred to a lidded polypropylene jar containing 300 mL of a hypotonic solution containing 10 mM Tris buffer (Trizma Base, T87602) and 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, E9884) as a metalloprotease inhibitor. This solution was adjusted to pH=8 using HCl/NaOH prior to use. To this container was added 5 mL/L of a penicillin/streptomycin 100× solution (A5955, stock concentration of 10,000 U/mL/10,000 mg/mL) and 0.35 mL/L of a stock solution (5% w/v in 100% ethanol) of the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, P7626). The container was then allowed to mix gently on a shaker table at 40-65 RPM, T=20-25° C., for 24 hours with fresh solution changed at 12 hours. During the first 12 hours of treatment, the epidermis of the skin samples was released from the underlying dermis and was removed from the container when the solution was refreshed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">This next stage of the treatment was designed to remove cell membranes and cytoskeletal components. The hypotonic solution was decanted and replaced with 300 mL of a high saline solution containing 5 M potassium chloride (KCl, P9541), 50 mM Tris buffer (T87602) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (octyl phenoxy polyethoxyethanol, T9284), and a metalloprotease inhibitor (5 mM of EDTA, E9884). This solution was adjusted to pH=8 using HCl/NaOH prior to use. To this container was added 5 mL/L of a penicillin/streptomycin 100× solution (A5955, stock concentration of 10,000 U/mL/10,000 mg/mL) and 0.35 mL/L of a stock solution (5% w/v in 100% ethanol) of the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, P7626). The container was allowed to mix gently on a shaker table (at 40-65 RPM), T=20-25° C., for 36 hours with fresh solution changed every 12 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">To ensure sterility, all work from this point onward was carried out in a Class II/III biological safety cabinet using aseptic technique. The previous high saline solution was decanted and replaced with 300 mL of sterile, deionized water. Specimens were rinsed for 30 minutes. Following the rinse, the sterile deionized water was decanted and replaced with 300 mL of sterile Hanks'/HEPES physiological buffer (0.14 M Sodium Chloride (S9625), 5.4 mM Potassium Chloride (P9541), 0.26 mM Sodium Phosphate dibasic (S0876), 0.44 mM Potassium Phosphate monobasic (P5379), 4.2 mM Sodium Bicarbonate (S8875), 10 mM HEPES Sodium salt (H7006), 8.3 mM Calcium Chloride dihydrate (C3881), 0.2 mM Magnesium Sulfate heptahydrate (M1880), and 0.25 mM Magnesium Chloride hexahydrate (M0250). This solution was adjusted to pH 7.35 using HCl/NaOH prior to use. Specimens were rinsed in the Hanks'/HEPES physiological buffer for 30 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">The next stage of the process is designed to degrade DNA and RNA to facilitate their subsequent removal. The Hanks'/HEPES physiological buffer used for the rinse was decanted and replaced with 200 mL of Hanks'/HEPES physiological buffer containing 1330 μL of deoxyribonuclease stock solution (DNAse type II from bovine pancreas (D4527)), 13.3 U/μL, in a 0.175 g NaCl (S9625)/10 mL glycerol (G7757)/10 mL sterile water solution adjusted to pH 7.3) and 1330 μL of ribonuclease stock solution (RNAse type III-A from bovine pancreas (R5125), 85 μg/mL, in a 0.03 g Trizma Base (T87602)/0.22 g NaCl (S9625)/25 mL sterile water solution adjusted to pH 7.5). The tissue was then placed in a shaking water bath, gently mixed (45-60 RPM) at 37° C. for 5 hours. After 5 hours the solution was decanted and replaced with fresh, sterile Hanks'/HEPES physiological buffer, briefly rinsing the tissue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">The next stage of the process was designed to further remove any remaining cellular components (cytoskeletal proteins, DNA, RNA) as TnBP is a “surfactant like” chaotropic solvent. The previous physiological buffer rinse was decanted and replaced by 300 mL of either (i) a 50 mM Tris buffer (Trizma Base, T87602) solution in water adjusted to pH 9 and containing 1% (v/v) Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP, 158615), 5 mL/L of a penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic/antimycotic 100× solution (stock concentration of 10,000 U/mL/10,000 mg/mL) with samples denoted as “Aqueous Decellularization” or (ii) a 50 mM Tris buffer (Trizma Base, T87602) solution in 70% Ethanol adjusted to pH 9 and containing 1% (v/v) Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP, 158615) with samples denoted as “Ethanol Decellularization.” The samples of tissue were then gently mixed on a shaker table (45-60 RPM) at T=20-25° C. for 48 hours with fresh solution changes every 12 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">After treatment, the solutions were decanted and refreshed with 300 mL of 50 mM Tris buffer (Trizma Base, T87602) solution, adjusted to pH 9 and containing 5 mL/L of a penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic/antimycotic 100× solution (stock concentration of 10,000 U/mL/10,000 mg/mL). The container was then allowed to mix gently on a shaker table (at 40-65 RPM), T=20-25° C., for 24 hours with fresh solution changed at 12 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Next, the previous pH 9 Tris buffer solution was decanted and replaced with fresh, sterile, phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) containing 0.14 M sodium chloride (NaCl, S9625), 2.7 mM potassium chloride (KCl, P9541), 6.5 mM sodium phosphate dibasic (S0876), 1.5 mM potassium phosphate monobasic (P5379), adjusted to pH 7.4, and containing 5 mL/L of a penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic/antimycotic 100× solution (stock concentration of 10,000 U/mL/10,000 mg/mL). The container was allowed to mix gently on a shaker table (at 40-65 RPM), T=20-25° C., for 12 hours. After, the tissue specimens were rinsed twice (30 minutes each) with 300 mL of fresh sterile phosphate buffered saline solution containing no antibiotics/antimycotics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">In a final step, each piece of tissue was bottled under sterile conditions in 100 ml of fresh sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution infused with penicillin/streptomycin (6 mL/L of 100× solution with a stock concentration of 10,000 U/mL/10,000 mg/mL), labeled as either “Aqueous Decellularization” or “Ethanol Decellularization” and stored at 4° C. until used for histological, immunohistochemical, DNA content, and Hydrothermal Isometric Tension (HIT) analyses as outlined below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Histology</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">Histology samples were prepared from the central portion of each piece of human skin (Fresh, Aqueous Decellularization, Ethanol Decellularization). Samples were placed in 10% acetate buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, HT50-1-128) for 48 hours, after which they were transferred to 100% ethanol in preparation for paraffin embedding. After embedding, samples were sectioned using a microtome, with section thickness set at 5 μm. Sections were mounted on silinated glass slides and dried for a minimum of two hours. After drying, slides were subjected to a series of wash and staining steps using protocols for Hematoxylin and Eosin (stains cell nuclei blue and collagen pink), Masson's Trichrome (stains cell nuclei blue/black, collagen and proteoglycans blue/green), and Verhoff-Van Gieson (stains cell nuclei black, collagen red/pink, elastin fibres black). After these steps, sections were sealed and covered using glass coverslips. For each sample, two sections were evaluated along their entire length under 10×, 20× and 40× objectives, a thorough description of each slide was recorded and representative images captured with a digital camera. Decellularized human skin prepared using Aqueous Decellularization and Ethanol Decellularization were compared to untreated Fresh human skin (control).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">Immunohistochemistry</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Formalin-fixed, paraffin-mounted tissue sections (5 μm thickness) were prepared and dewaxed using xylenes and ethanol. Slides were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and antigen retrieval was carried out using a citrate buffer (pH=6.1) and pressure cooker (HEIR). After antigen retrieval, samples were then placed in 2% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 minutes for blocking of endogenous peroxidases. After a brief PBS wash, samples were blocked with Protein Block (Dako, X0909) for 10 minutes in a humid chamber. Primary antibody (25 μL) was placed on each sample and incubated for 18 hours in a humid chamber. Primary antibodies included anti-vimentin (Dako, M7020, dilutions of 1:40, 1:80), anti-Beta Actin (Sigma, A5316, dilutions of 1:2000, 1:4000), anti-HLA-DR (Dako, M0746, dilutions of 1:50, 1:100), and anti-HLA-A,B,C (Abeam, ab70328, dilutions of 1:200, 1:400). After incubation, samples were washed in PBS, and treated using a Universal LSAB+Kit/HRP (Dako, K0690) for rabbit/goat/mouse antibodies according to manufacturer's instructions. Samples were washed with PBS, and color was developed using DAB+Chromogen+substrate buffer for 7 minutes. After a brief water wash, samples were counterstained using Mayer's Hematoxylin for 2 minutes, Scott's water for 2 minutes. Samples were then dehydrated (xylenes and ethanol) and mounted with cytoseal and glass coverslips. For each sample, two sections were evaluated along their entire length under 10×, 20× and 40× objectives; a thorough description of each slide was recorded. Representative images at 20× and 40× and a complete scan of one section at 10× were captured with a digital camera. A composite of the complete scan of a section was created by piecing together individual images captured along the sample using the 10× objective. Decellularized human skin prepared using Aqueous Decellularization and Ethanol Decellularization was compared to untreated Fresh human skin Negative controls included sections treated by omitting primary or secondary antibodies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">DNA Quantification</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">The quantity of DNA present in Fresh human skin, Aqueous Decellularized, and Ethanol Decellularized treated human skin was determined using a fluorescence-based assay. Representative tissue samples from each treatment condition were freeze-dried and weighed prior to the assay. To disassociate the DNA from the tissue, a small piece of freeze-dried tissue (9-11 mg dry weight (wt)) from each sample was digested by papain. Papain digest solution was made by preparing buffer solution (50 ml of digestion buffer was prepared by combining 0.130 g ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, A1542), 0.019 g Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA-2H<sub>2</sub>O (Sigma-Aldrich, E5134) and 0.015 g. DL-dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, 43815) in distilled water with pH adjusted to 6.2 and adding lyophilized papain (Sigma-Aldrich, P4762) to a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Digest solution was added to each sample at a ratio of 100 μL per mg dry weight to normalize the quantity of tissue per volume. Following digestion, each sample was briefly centrifuged at 10,000 g to remove insoluble or undigested material. A small aliquot (50 μL) from each digested sample was analyzed using the Quant-iT Picorgreen Assay Kit (Invitrogen, P7581) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Standard curves were created in the range of 0-1,000 ng/ml for Fresh skin and 0-12.5 ng/ml for Aqueous Decellularized and Ethanol Decellularized skin. The fluorescence was measured on a multiplate reader at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 528 nm. All readings were performed in duplicate and in black 96-well plates to prevent ‘cross-talk’ between the wells. Results were normalized to the dry weight of tissue analyzed for each sample.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">Hydrothermal Isometric Temperature (HIT) Test</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">Samples were tested in a custom-built, multisample HIT apparatus, as described by Lee et al. [Lee et al. (1995)]. Samples were tested in groups, up to six at a time. Stainless steel spring clamps were used to grip samples (n=4) of Fresh, Aqueous Decellularized, and Ethanol Decellularized skin 2.5 cm×0.5 cm), leaving cm of tissue between the grips. An initial load of 50 g (0.5 N) was applied to each of the samples, suspended in a 4-liter beaker containing distilled water. The samples were then heated at a rate of ≈1-2° C./min from room temperature to an isotherm maximum temperature of 90° C. Temperatures were measured using a centrally located thermistor probe positioned at midsample height. Load data were acquired using custom-built strain-gauged cantilever load cells. The load cells and temperature probe were interfaced with a conditioning amplifier, and both data acquisition and system control were accomplished via a personal computer equipped with a 12-bit A/D, D/A DAQ board (Model NB-MIO-16L; National Instruments) and custom-written software programmed using LabVIEW 7.1 software (National Instruments). Temperature-time-load data were generated throughout HIT testing. As the water in which the samples were immersed was heated from ambient temperature to the 90° C. maximum, load, temperature, and time data were captured in 1° C. intervals. A key measure of collagen's hydrothermal stability is the temperature at which a triple helix denatures, its denaturation temperature (Td). This is the temperature at which enough thermal energy has been transferred to the sample to overcome the energy barrier to uncoiling and allow change to a new, lower-energy conformation. In HIT testing, samples are held under isometric constraint such, that when enough thermal energy is added, the collagen molecules within the sample become able to uncoil. Their actual uncoiling is prevented as the sample is being held under isometric constraint and the energetic impetus to uncoil generates a tensile force that is recorded as a distinctive increase in the load on the sample. This creates an elbow in the load-temperature plot and the temperature at which this elbow begins is termed the Td of the sample. Different regions within a collagenous sample, and within an individual collagen molecule for that matter, have varying degrees of thermal stability. The Td value recorded in this work therefore is a function of the thermal stability of all of the load-bearing collagen in the sample during testing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">Statistics for HIT</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">Comparisons made between groups were conducted using a one-way ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer HSD test. Comparisons were made at 95% significance (α=0.05). Note that the resolution of the HIT test is 1° C. and that changes in Td from control (fresh) tissue of greater than or equal to 3° C. is deemed practically significant.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">Histology</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Sections of fresh human skin stained with hematoxyin and eosin revealed dense packing of cell nuclei (dark blue) in the epidermis below the keratinized layer and individual and clusters of cell nuclei throughout the dermis (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). After decellularization by both Aqueous and Ethanol Decellularization techniques, there was a complete absence of any staining for cell nuclei as observed under 100×, 200× and 400× magnifications (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Collagen structure, stained pink by eosin, however, appeared well-preserved in all decellularized skin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">Fresh human skin sections stained with Verhoff-Van Gieson stain revealed numerous black cell nuclei in the non-keratinized epidermis, strong black staining elastic fibres within the deeper dermis, and pink collagen matrix in the dermis (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). After decellularization by all methods, the cells in the epidermis were no longer visible, however the relative intensity of both the collagen (pink) and elastin fibres (black) in the dermis were similar to that of fresh skin (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Masson's Trichrome staining of fresh human skin revealed the presence of numerous blue stained cell nuclei and red stained cell cytoplasm in the epidermis and dermis. Features such as blood vessels and residual hair follicles could be observed. The dermis included blue/green stained collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). After decellularization by all treatments, no evidence of dark blue or red staining indicating the presence of cells was present. Green staining, however, indicating the presence of collagen, elastin and glycosaminoglycans was evident (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Fresh human skin stained using antibodies against the cytoskeletal protein Beta-actin revealed strong positive staining throughout the non-keratinized epidermis and strong positive staining of individual and clusters of cells throughout the dermis (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 9 and 10</figref>). After decellularization by Aqueous or Ethanol Decellularization protocols, both the amount and intensity of positive staining for Beta-actin was substantially reduced (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 7 and 8</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) HLA-A,B,C and HLA-DR are major determinants of allograft skin rejection. HLA-A,B,C are present on all nucleated cells in the body and were shown to be present in the non-keratinized epidermis and dermis in Fresh human skin by anti-HLA-A,B,C antibody and peroxidase staining (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref>). Staining was very intense and throughout the tissue.

HLA-DR, which is present on “antigen presenting cells” in the human body, was positively identified by anti-HLA-DR antibody and peroxidase staining mostly in the dermis of Fresh skin samples (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). In contrast, no detectable positive staining for HLA-DR was present at 100×, 200×, and 400× magnification in any of the decellularized skin samples (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">Samples of Fresh skin displayed a thermal denaturation temperature (Td) of 67.0±0.4° C. Decellularized skin processed by Aqueous (Td=67.1±0.8° C.) or Ethanol (Td=65.8±0.9° C.) protocols displayed similar thermal denaturation temperatures (Table 2).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">Conclusions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">Both Aqueous and Ethanol decellularization protocols were able to produce highly decellularized human skin. Analyses revealed that cell nuclei, major immunogenic cell proteins (HLA-DR and HLA-A,B,C), and DNA content were non-detectable using the methods described. Further, significant reductions in the cytoskeletal proteins vimentin and Beta-actin were achieved in decellularized skin. Finally, thermostability analysis of collagen revealed that the decellularization methods employed with human skin preserved the native structure of collagen within the tissue.</div>
<heading id="h-0016">Example 2: Sterilization of Human Skin</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">Tissue banks process and store allografts by washing fresh tissues with antibiotic/antimycotic solutions followed by cryopreservation. These procedures have proven inadequate for sterilization. Cryopreservation has been shown by others to damage connective tissue structure [Kitagawa et al. (2001)]. Other sterilization techniques, such as ethylene oxide or gamma irradiation, have been shown to be deleterious to soft tissue grafts and are not generally used by others [Kearney, J. N. (2005); Azar, F. M. (2009)].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">According to AATB Standards for Tissue Banking under K2.200 “Skin shall not be used for transplant if the following species are determined to be present: <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes </i>(group A strep.), <i>Enterococcus </i>sp., gram negative bacilli, <i>Clostridium</i>, and fungi (yeasts, molds)” [AATB (2006); (2008)]. In a study by Pianigiani et. al. (2009), they noted that the microorganisms responsible for skin allograft discard were all gram positives, the group of organisms most frequently isolated from pre-processing samples and included <i>Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus</i>, and <i>Bacillus </i>species. Four microorganisms were selected to determine if they can be removed and/or destroyed by our decellularization methods based on the American AATB Standards: <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes </i>(group A strep.), <i>Enterococcus </i>sp., and <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>which also was used as a surrogate for <i>Clostridium </i>due to its undesirable properties, such as odor and anaerobic culture conditions. <i>Bacillus </i>has been used as a surrogate for <i>Clostridium </i>in other studies [Stewart, Dunne, Skies, &amp; Hoover, (2000)].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">On the basis of on International Standards, ISO 11737-1 and 11737-2, a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of Bioburden Determination was developed in collaboration with professionals in the field of Microbiology.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">Removing Inhibition from Fresh Frozen Skin</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">Human skin collected by tissue banks is stored in a cocktail of antibiotics including Cefazolin and Gentomycin. To ensure complete removal of any inhibitory effects of the storage antibiotic cocktail, samples of fresh frozen human skin with a broad range of storage times were tested (4-31 days of storage). Inoculants for the four microorganisms used (<i>S. aureus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus</i>, and <i>Bacillus</i>) were prepared by first obtaining a correlation between optical density (OD) measured at 620 nm and the number of colony forming units (CFU)/mL. This was achieved by adjusting the OD value measured at 620 nm to 1 (acceptable range was 0.85 to 1.15) and spot plating the solution to check the concentration. A concentration/dilution factor was calculated from the correlation and used to make 10<sup>8 </sup>CFU/mL inoculants from a one OD suspension of bacteria.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">Sterile PBS rinse and vortexing were chosen as the methods to remove residual antibiotics from skin allografts because these techniques had minimal effect on the number of microorganisms attached to the skin. The frequency of such washing treatments was dependent upon the degree of inhibition. Skin samples were subjected to different frequency of rinses with 10 mL of PBS or three-minute vortexing with 20 mL of PBS. To check the presence of any inhibitory antibiotics after washing with PBS, 100 μL of 10<sup>8 </sup>CFU/mL inoculants were added to a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing human skin and 10 mL sterile PBS. The tube was vortexed for one minute to allow release of antimicrobial substances from the skin. The working solution, which was already a 10<sup>−2 </sup>dilution of the original 10<sup>8 </sup>CFU/mL inoculants, was diluted by serial dilution. From the diluted solutions, six spots were made in Tryptic Soya Agar (TSA) plates by pipetting 100 μL of the solutions with 10<sup>−3 </sup>to 10<sup>−8 </sup>dilutions. The inoculant solution was also directly spot plated with dilutions from 10<sup>−3 </sup>to 10<sup>−8 </sup>for controls. Control plates of inoculants clearly showed the number of viable bacteria that should grow in the absence of inhibition.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">Fresh frozen human skin from a total of four donors was procured, thawed at room temperature in its packaging, and prepared for treatment. From each donor, fifteen 4 cm×5 cm pieces (corresponding to 3 samples for each of the 4 microorganisms to be tested plus a negative control) and one 2 cm×5 cm (for bioburden background check) were prepared. Based upon the results of our inhibition study, fresh human skin to be inoculated with <i>S. aureus, Streptococcus </i>or used as a negative control were vortex for 3 minutes 6 times with 20 ml of sterile PBS; skin to be inoculated with <i>Enterococcus</i>, and <i>Bacillus </i>was vortex once with 20 mL of sterile PBS.</div>

As a negative control, 400 μl, of sterile PBS was added to 3 samples of human skin. The inoculated tissues were then left to stand under laminar flow without drying out (60-75 minutes) to ensure absorption of the bacterial inoculants. Samples of inoculated skin were then transferred to separate 500 mL containers corresponding to <i>S. aureus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Bacillus </i>or the PBS negative control with each container holding three 4 cm×5 cm samples. The samples of skin were then treated with the Aqueous Decellularization or Ethanol Decellularization, with or without Peractic Acid treatment as outlined below.</div>

This solution was adjusted to pH=8 using HCl/NaOH prior to use.

The extent of tissue preparation is dependent upon the quality of the fascia obtained, but usually involves removing extraneous tissue elements and cutting the fascia to size(s) required by end users. For this example, three specimens of human fascia are treated in one container.

To this is added endonucleases, preferred DNAse and RNAse, at preferred quantities of 1330 μL of deoxyribonuclease stock (type II from bovine pancreas, 13.3 U/μL NaCl/glycerol pH 7.3 solution and 1330 μL of ribonuclease stock (type III-A from bovine pancreas, 85 μg/mL). The tissue is then placed in a shaking water bath, gently mixed (45-60 RPM) at 37° C. for 5 hours. After 5 hours the solution is decanted and replaced with fresh Hanks'/HEPES physiological buffer, briefly rinsing the tissue. This stage of the process is designed to degrade DNA and RNA to facilitate their subsequent removal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">The previous physiological buffer rinse is decanted and replaced by 300 mL of a 50 mM Tris buffer solution adjusted to pH 9 and containing 1% (v/v) Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP). To the container is then added 1.5 mL of a penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic/antimycotic 100× solution (stock concentration of 10,000 U/mL/10,000 mg/mL). This step of the decellularization treatment can also be performed using a solution made up as 1% (v/v) TnBP in 70% ethanol without antibiotics/antimycotics. The tissue then gently mixed on a shaker table (45-60 RPM) at T=20-25° C. for 48 hours with fresh solution changes every 12 hours. This stage is designed to further remove any remaining cellular components (cytoskeletal proteins, DNA, RNA) as TnBP is a “surfactant like” chaotropic solvent. Further, TnBP has been shown to deactivate viruses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">After treatment, the solution is decanted and refreshed with 300 mL of 50 mM Tris buffer solution adjusted to pH 9 (containing no TnBP). The same amount of antibiotic/antimycotic solution (penicillin/streptomycin) previous used is added and the container is allowed to mix gently on a shaker table (at 40-65 RPM), T=20-25° C., for 24 hours with fresh solution changed at 12 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">Next, the previous pH 9 Tris buffer solution is decanted and replaced with 300 mL of a 1% (v/v) Peracetic Acid (PAA) solution in ethanol (PAA solution consisted of 2% peracetic acid, 100% ethanol, and sterile water (ratio v/v/v 2/1/1), providing a final sterilization solution of 1% PAA) for 4 hours, mixing gently on a shaker table (at 40-65 RPM), at T=20-40° C. After PAA treatment, fresh sterile phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS, containing 0.14 M sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, 6.5 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, 1.5 mM potassium phosphate monobasic and is adjusted to pH 7.4). The same amount of antibiotic/antimycotic (penicillin/streptomycin) solution used previously is added and the container is allowed to mix gently on a shaker table (at 40-65 RPM), T=20-25° C., for 12 hours. After, the specimen is rinsed twice for 30 minutes each with 300 mL fresh sterile phosphate buffered saline solution at room temperature containing no anitbiotics/antimycotics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">In a final step, the each piece of tissue is bottled under sterile conditions with a minimum volume ratio of solution to tissue of 20:1 to 50:1 in either (i) fresh sterile phosphate buffered saline solution infused with penicillin/streptomycin (6 mL/L of 100× solution with a stock concentration of 10,000 U/mL/10,000 mg/mL) solution or (ii) 70% ethanol and stored at 4° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">These processes produce decellularized and sterilized human fascia. Analyses similar to those employed in the Examples above and/or known in the art reveal that cell nuclei, major immunogenic cell proteins (e.g., HLA-DR and HLA-A,B,C), and DNA content are substantially reduced compared to controls. Further, significant reductions in the cytoskeletal proteins such as, e.g., vimentin and Beta-actin, are achieved compared to controls. Thermostability analysis of collagen reveals that the decellularization methods largely preserve the native structure of collagen within the fascia. Decellularization by, e.g., Aqueous or Ethanol Decellularization protocols, also reduces the amount of bacteria (<i>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes </i>(group A strep.), <i>Enterococcus </i>sp., and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>). Removal of all four bacterial species is obtained via inclusion of a 1% (v/v) peracetic acid rinse. The resulting fascia graft is acceptable for transplant according to the guidelines provided by the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) standards [AATB (2006); (2008)].</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">Tissue (e.g., a human soft tissue) is harvested and prepared for treatment. The extent of tissue preparation is dependent upon the tissue to treated, but usually involves removing extraneous tissue elements and cutting the tissue to size in order to facilitate decellularization. Specimens are then immersed in a hypotonic salt (&lt;300 mol/L) solution, pH=7-9, with anti-proteolytic agents whose concentration are dependent upon inhibitor used (phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF), aprotinin, leupeptin, Ethylenediamineteteraacetic acid (EDTA)), anti-microbial agents (penicillin, vancomycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, kanamycin, neomycin, sodium azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>)) with or without anti-fungal agents (Amphotericin B, Nystain) prepared with at minimum type II cell culture grade deionized water. The tissue is treated with a minimum volume ratio of solution to tissue of 20:1 to 50:1, on a rotating shaker table at 40-65 RPM, for 24-48 hours, T=4-40° C., with solution changes at minimum occurring at 12 hour intervals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">The tissue is then transferred to a high saline (&gt;1 M, NaCl, KCl) buffered solution (pH=8-10) containing 0.2-3% (v/v) of a anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic or cationic detergent (Triton X-100, Triton X-200, Tween 20, Tween 80, sodium deoxycholate, CHAPS, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), N-lauroyl-sarcosinate, Igepal CA630, Sulfobetain-10 and -16) and protease inhibitors (candidates as listed above) prepared with at minimum type II cell culture grade deionized water. The tissue is treated with a minimum volume ratio of solution to tissue of 20:1 to 50:1, on a rotating shaker table at 40-65 RPM, for 24-48 hours, T=4-40° C., with solution changes at minimum occurring at 12 hour intervals.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">In the next stage, the tissue is treated with a sterile solution of 0.2-3% (v/v) anionic, non-ionic, zwitterionic or cationic detergent (Triton X-100, Triton X-200, Tween 20, Tween 80, sodium deoxycholate, CHAPS, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), N-lauroyl-sarcosinate, Igepal CA630, Sulfobetain-10 and -16) or chaotropic agent (Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP)) prepared in either (i) physiological buffer solution (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), HEPES, Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS)) adjusted to pH=7-9 with anti-microbial agents (penicillin, vancomycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, kanamycin, neomycin, sodium azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>)) with or without anti-fungal agents (Amphotericin B, Nystain) or with (ii) 50-70% ethanol, for 24-48 hours at T=4-40° C. Afterward, the tissue is rinsed with a sterile 50 mM Tris buffer solution adjusted to pH 9 (containing no detergent or chaotropic agent) for 12-24 hours at T=4-40° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">Next the tissue is treated with a 0.05-3% (v/v) Peracetic Acid (PAA) solution in ethanol or Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) neutralized to pH=7 to 7.5, for a duration of 30 minutes to 4 hours at T=20-40° C. After, the tissue is rinsed with sterile physiological buffer (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), HEPES, Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS)) with anti-microbial agents (penicillin, vancomycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, kanamycin, neomycin, sodium azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>)) with or without anti-fungal agents (Amphotericin B, Nystain) for 12-24 hours at T=4-40° C.</div>

After decellularization, samples were washed with 10 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and serial dilutions (10<sup>−3 </sup>to 10<sup>−8</sup>) of the PBS wash were spot plated onto Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA plates). The PBS washed skin (labelled “Skin”) and a sample of decellularized skin not washed with PBS (labelled “Direct Plating”) were also direct plated onto TSA plates. All TSA plates were incubated for 7 days. No colonies of bacteria were detected in PBS solutions used to rinse the decellularized skin or by direct plating of decellularized skin.
