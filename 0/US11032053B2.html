<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Carrier aggregation for Long Term Evolution (LTE) was introduced in 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 10. This feature allows a wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU) to transmit and receive on more than one carrier simultaneously, resulting in an increase of its peak data rate over the air interface. The maximum number of carriers that may be aggregated is five (5), for a maximum bandwidth of 100 megahertz (MHz).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Transmission of data in the downlink in LTE may be performed using the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH). This physical channel supports hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) transmission, in which the receiver (at the WTRU) may combine successive transmissions of a transport block to increase the probability of successful decoding at each retransmission. The WTRU may report, for a given reception attempt of a transport block, that the reception has succeeded with an acknowledgement (ACK) or has not succeeded with a negative acknowledgement (NACK). In some cases the WTRU may also report that it did not detect that a transport block was transmitted, such as in discontinuous transmission (DTX).</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A method and apparatus for uplink feedback for operating with a large number of carriers are disclosed herein. A method in a wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU) includes receiving a Downlink Control Information (DCI), wherein the DCI schedules a Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) transmission and the DCI includes an indication, determining whether a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) acknowledgment (ACK)/negative acknowledgement (NACK) (A/N) report is expected for the PDSCH transmission based on the indication in the DCI, and receiving a HARQ A/N report on a condition that one is expected for the PDSCH transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Further examples include a solution for reducing HARQ-ACK payload, increasing Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) payload, increasing uplink control information (UCI) payload in a Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) and determining the resource or sub-resource used for the transmission of a feedback group, or a combination of feedback groups, based on a combination of downlink control signaling that is associated with any PDSCH and of an index or order associated with this feedback group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Additional examples include the dynamic scheduling of UCI on a PUCCH, and an index for each downlink assignment, to enable a dynamic codebook and feedback compression. In an example, the WTRU may make a determination of order of the information bits in the codebook. The WTRU may make a selection of a codebook permutation to optimize decoding performance. A further example includes a codebook indicator. Further, a specific group of carriers to select may be determined based on which carriers assignments are received for. In addition, the codebook may be determined using one or more methods. Also, an A/N resource indicator (ARI) may be used for the determination of a final assignment. Further, multiple channel state information (CSI) reports may be transmitted in a subframe using one or more methods. For example, the WTRU may be configured with a maximum payload for each PUCCH resource that can be used for the transmission of HARQ-ACK, periodic CSI reports and/or scheduling request (SR) in a subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In an example, a WTRU may receive a plurality of transport blocks over a set of a plurality of configured carriers, generate HARQ-ACK feedback for the plurality of transport blocks and determine a number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits to use for the HARQ-ACK feedback. Further, the WTRU may apply, to the HARQ-ACK feedback bits, Reed-Muller coding on a condition that the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits is less than or equal to a threshold. The WTRU may then transmit the encoded HARQ-ACK feedback bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, the WTRU may append cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits onto the HARQ-ACK feedback bits on a condition that the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits is greater than a threshold. Also, the WTRU may apply convolutional coding to the HARQ-ACK feedback bits and the CRC bits on a condition that the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits is greater than a threshold. The WTRU may then transmit the encoded HARQ-ACK feedback bits and CRC bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, the WTRU may determine the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits to use for the HARQ-ACK feedback based on a plurality of downlink assignments for carriers in the set of configured carriers. The set of configured carriers may include more than five configured carriers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In another example, a WTRU may receive a plurality of transport blocks over a set of a plurality of configured carriers and generate HARQ-ACK feedback and CSI feedback for the plurality of transport blocks. The WTRU may then generate a feedback message that includes a number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits to use for the HARQ-ACK feedback and a number of CSI feedback bits to use for the CSI feedback. The WTRU may then determine a PUCCH format based on the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits and the number of CSI feedback bits. In addition, the WTRU may then transmit the feedback message using the determined PUCCH format.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, the WTRU may determine the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits to use for the HARQ-ACK feedback, the number of CSI feedback bits to use for the CSI feedback, or both, based on a plurality of downlink assignments for carriers in the set of configured carriers. In an example, the WTRU may select from four PUCCH formats.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In another example, a WTRU may receive a plurality of transport blocks over a plurality of configured carriers. The WTRU may generate HARQ-ACK feedback for the plurality of transport blocks, CSI feedback for at least one of the plurality of configured carriers, and a CRC. Further, the WTRU may generate a feedback message that includes a number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits for the HARQ-ACK feedback, a number of CSI feedback bits for the CSI feedback, and a number of CRC bits for the CRC. The WTRU may then determine a power to be used for a PUCCH transmission based on the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits, the number of CSI feedback bits, and the number of CRC bits. Moreover, the WTRU may transmit the feedback message in the PUCCH transmission at the determined power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In an example, the number of CRC bits may be based on the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits and the number of CSI feedback bits. In a further example, the WTRU may generate a SR. Also, the feedback message may further include a number of SR bits for the SR. Moreover, the number of CRC bits may be based on the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits, the number of CSI feedback bits and the number of SR bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In another example, the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits for the HARQ-ACK feedback or the number of CSI feedback bits for the CSI feedback may be determined based on at least one of a number of transport blocks or a number of carriers in the plurality of configured carriers. Also, the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits for the HARQ-ACK feedback or the number of CSI feedback bits for the CSI feedback may be determined based on a number of subframes over which the transport blocks are received. Further, the WTRU may transmit the feedback message in the PUCCH transmission at the determined power in a subframe.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Carrier aggregation for LTE was introduced in 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 10. This feature allows a WTRU to transmit and receive on more than one carrier simultaneously, resulting in an increase of its peak data rate over the air interface. In an unmodified form of carrier aggregation, the maximum number of carriers that may be aggregated is five (5), for a maximum bandwidth of 100 megahertz (MHz).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Transmission of data in the downlink in LTE may be performed using the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH). This physical channel supports hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) transmission, in which the receiver (at the WTRU) may combine successive transmissions of a transport block to increase the probability of successful decoding at each retransmission. The WTRU may report, for a given reception attempt of a transport block, that the reception has succeeded with an acknowledgement (ACK) or has not succeeded with a negative acknowledgement (NACK). In some cases the WTRU may also report that it did not detect that a transport block was transmitted, such as in discontinuous transmission (DTX). Such reporting may collectively be referred to as โHARQ-ACK feedbackโ herein. The result of a specific reception attempt of a transport block (ACK or NACK, or in certain solutions ACK, NACK or DTX) may be referred to as a โHARQ A/N reportโ herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">When carrier aggregation is configured, up to 2 transport blocks may be received per carrier (or serving cell) and subframe on the PDSCH channel. In Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode, the WTRU may report 1 bit of HARQ-ACK feedback separately for each transport block where ACK is transmitted if the transport block was received successfully and NACK is transmitted otherwise. In Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode, in some configurations, the WTRU may report 1 bit of HARQ-ACK for each pair of transport blocks received in the same carrier and subframe (for example, spatially multiplexed) or 1 bit of HARQ-ACK for a set of transport blocks received in the same carrier and in a set of subframes, where ACK is transmitted if all transport blocks of a pair or set are received successfully and NACK is transmitted otherwise. Such a scheme, where the WTRU reports ACK on a condition that all of a set of more than one transport block is successfully received, and NACK otherwise, may be referred to as โA/N bundlingโ. A/N bundling may be performed for transport blocks spatially multiplexed (spatial bundling), for transport blocks received in different subframes (time bundling) or for transport blocks received in different carriers or cells (frequency bundling).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In both modes, there is a fixed timing relationship between the reception of a transport block and the transmission of a HARQ-ACK bit dependent on the success or failure of the reception of this transport block. More specifically, in FDD mode a HARQ-ACK bit corresponding to a transport block received in subframe n may be transmitted in subframe n+4. In TDD mode, the timing relationship may depend on the subframe configuration and on the index of the subframe in which the transport block is received.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Transmission of HARQ-ACK bits in a subframe may be performed on either a Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) or a Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) physical channel. PUCCH may be used when no PUSCH transmission is available in a subframe, or when the WTRU is configured to simultaneously transmit PUCCH and PUSCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">PUCCH may occupy a single physical resource block (PRB) in each time slot of a subframe and may be transmitted according to one of a set of possible formats. When more than 4 HARQ-ACK bits need to be transmitted on PUCCH in a single subframe, the WTRU may need to be configured to use PUCCH format 3. PUCCH format 3 may be described as a Discrete Fourier Transform-Spread-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM) transmission where each quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)-modulated symbol occupies a single sub-carrier and is spread in the time domain using one of a set of orthogonal cover codes. In PUCCH format 3, each QPSK-modulated symbol may be spread over one time slot such that 48 coded bits may be accommodated in a subframe (2 time slots times 12 sub-carriers times 2 bits per symbol). Up to 10 HARQ-ACK bits (in FDD mode) or 20 HARQ-ACK bits (in TDD mode) may be multiplexed with up to 1 scheduling request (SR) bit to be encoded into those 48 coded bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Within a cell, up to 4 WTRUs may transmit mutually orthogonal PUCCH format 3 in the same resource block. However, the maximum number of WTRUs that may be configured to use the same resource block may be smaller when inter-cell interference is significant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">When HARQ-ACK bits in a subframe need to be transmitted over PUSCH, the corresponding modulated symbols may be mapped onto resource elements occupying a portion (or all) subcarriers in 4 time symbols adjacent to the time symbols used for the transmission of demodulation reference signals (DM-RSs) in the subframe. The number of resource may be determined based on the size of PUSCH allocation and a parameter configured such that the amount of energy available to HARQ-ACK is sufficient to ensure that an error performance target is met.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">To enhance the carrier aggregation feature, it has been proposed to enable aggregation of up to 32 carriers. This enhancement may be challenging from the perspective of providing HARQ-ACK feedback since reusing the same solutions as in the legacy system may now require the transmission of up to 64 HARQ-ACK bits (for FDD mode) or 128 HARQ-ACK bits (for TDD mode). This may create the following concerns. First, the maximum number of coded bits available in a PUCCH transmission (48) may be lower than the number of HARQ-ACK (and SR) information bits determined using the legacy solutions. Second, the amount of energy used for HARQ-ACK (and SR) transmission in PUSCH may become insufficient to ensure acceptable error performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">It has also been proposed that the WTRU may be configured with PUCCH on one or more Secondary Cells (SCells). In such a case, the WTRU may need to determine whether to transmit some or all of the uplink control information (UCI) using a single transmission and, if so, whether to use a PUCCH transmission on a Primary Cell (PCell) (or Primary SCell (PSCell) if for the Secondary Cell Group (CG) (SCG)), a PUSCH transmission on a cell of the master cell group (MCG) (if available and UCI is associated with the MCG) or a PUSCH transmission on a cell of the SCG (if available and UCI is associated with the SCG).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Methods and solutions are disclosed herein for reducing HARQ-ACK payload, including the following. Conditional generation of a HARQ A/N report may be based on the satisfaction of one or more conditions, such as, for example, conditions regarding the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) and/or reported Channel Quality Indicator (CQI). Also, selective partial bundling may be used where groups of transport blocks (TBs) for which bundling is applied are selected on a subframe basis to minimize unnecessary retransmissions. Further, the down-selection of acknowledgement reports may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Methods and solutions are disclosed herein for increasing PUCCH payload, including the following. For example, methods and solutions are disclosed herein for the use of higher-order modulation, possibly on a subset of sub-carriers to implement unequal error protection. Also, methods and solutions are disclosed herein for the use of more than 1 resource block (RB), using new a DM-RS design allowing multiplexing with legacy formats while maintaining low cubic metric (CM). In addition, methods and solutions are disclosed herein for the use of spatial multiplexing, where the number of information bits on each layer may be dynamically selected. Further, the modulation symbols may be spread over fewer resource elements (REs) than in an unmodified approach, where the number of symbols may be dynamically selected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Methods and solutions are disclosed herein for the efficient use of resources, including the following. Codebook properties may be dynamically determined, based on, for instance, downlink control signaling. Also, a codebook permutation may be selected to optimize decoding performance. In addition, multiple feedback groups may be transmitted and processed separately or jointly, and a feedback group indicator may be used to facilitate decoding. Further, resource selection and mapping, a power setting function of the PUCCH and/or the dynamic scheduling of UCI on PUCCH may be used. Also, an indication of index and/or counter for each downlink assignment may be used to enable a dynamic codebook as well as feedback compression.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Methods and solutions are disclosed herein for increasing UCI payload in the PUSCH, including the following. Modified transport block processing may be used when the number/proportion of REs in PUSCH exceeds a threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Methods and solutions are disclosed herein for resource selection in case of multiple types of transmission in multiple cells. Also, methods and solutions are disclosed herein for the transmission of multiple periodic CSI reports in a subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Methods and solutions are disclosed herein for a codebook determination, which may use an Acknowledgment/Negative Acknowledgement (A/N) resource indicator (ARI) for the determination of the final assignment, and the transmission of multiple CSI reports.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The following solutions address the problem of limited payload (or range) for the transmission of HARQ-ACK by allowing a reduction of the number of information bits used for HARQ-ACK.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In some solutions, the number of information bits generated for HARQ-ACK may be reduced by restricting the generation of a HARQ A/N report (or bit) for a given transport block only when at least one condition is satisfied. The at least one condition may be defined such that unnecessary retransmissions of a transport block by the network are minimized. Generally this may be achieved if the at least one condition is such that the A/N report is generated only when the probability of successful decoding is significant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In legacy LTE systems, the WTRU may typically generate a HARQ A/N report when it receives a transmission on PDSCH and/or when it receives a downlink control information (DCI) that activates or deactivates a configured uplink grant or a configured downlink assignment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In one method, the WTRU may perform further determination when generating a HARQ A/N report. The WTRU may generate a HARQ A/N report for a transmission associated with a specific carrier (or associated with a specific serving cell) of the WTRU's configuration, according to at least one of the following.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The WTRU may receive a DCI, such as a DCI characterized by at least one of the following: a DCI type, an indication inside the DCI, a Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI) used for the successful decoding of the DCI, a search space associated with the received DCI, a location of the DCI in the search space, an aggregation level of the DCI, other DCI contents, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">For DCI type, the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of the type (or format) of DCI associated with the transmission. For example, the WTRU may receive a DCI of a specific type (or format) and determine that a HARQ A/N report may not be generated. Such an association may be based on the DCI format itself. For example, the DCI may also carry the scheduling information for the concerned transmission. Such an association may be based on timing, such as for example, a DCI of a specific type (or format) received in the same subframe as DCI that schedules one or more transmissions in the concerned subframe. Such a type may include a DCI type that may possibly be used to provide โhintsโ in support of WTRU processing of downlink control signaling. Such DCI may indicate that no transmission is applicable for the concerned carrier in the given subframe. Alternatively, such DCI may indicate that the WTRU is not expected to generate HARQ A/N feedback for one or more carriers. Possibly, such DCI may indicate, for example, using a codepoint, a specific format and/or combination of carriers for which a HARQ A/N report is expected for the concerned interval (for example, a subframe). Further examples of such DCI are described herein. Similar to legacy systems, the WTRU may be required to generate HARQ A/N report for a DCI that activates or deactivates a configured grant and/or a configured downlink allocation, while other DCI formats may require additional rules to determine whether or not to generate a HARQ A/N report.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">For indication inside the DCI, the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of the contents of a DCI associated with the transmission. For example, the WTRU may receive a DCI, for example, that schedules a PDSCH transmission. Such DCI may include an indication. The WTRU may determine from such indication whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for the concerned PDSCH transmission. Possibly, such DCI may indicate, for example, using a codepoint, a specific format and/or combination of carriers for which a HARQ A/N report is expected for the concerned interval (for example, subframe). The indication may consist of the value of a field included in the payload of the DCI, or of the value of a field used to mask a subset or all bits of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC). The field may consist, for instance, of a downlink assignment index (DAI) field, or of a dedicated field (HARQ A/N reporting indicator).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">For RNTI used for the successful decoding of the DCI, the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of the RNTI used to successfully decode a DCI associated with the transmission. For example, the WTRU may be configured with a plurality of RNTIs. The WTRU may be configured such that the successful decoding of a DCI when using a given RNTI may indicate that a HARQ A/N report is not required for the associated transmission (or conversely, that a HARQ A/N report is required).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">For search space associated with the received DCI, the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of the search space of the DCI associated with the transmission. For example, the WTRU may be expected to generate HARQ A/N report for a transmission associated with a DCI received in the Common Search Space (CSS) but possibly not for a DCI received in the WTRU-specific Search Space (or UE-specific Search Space (UESS)) and/or the WTRU may apply additional rules in the latter case. For example, the WTRU may be configured with a plurality of UESSs (or similar, for example, the UESS may be portioned) where reception of a DCI in a specific UESS (or portion thereof) may indicate that a HARQ A/N report is not expected while such may be expected for a different UESS (or portion thereof).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">For location of the DCI in the search space, the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of a control channel element (CCE) of a DCI associated with the transmission. For example, such CCE may be the first CCE for the received DCI. For example, CCEs may be organized using a numerological sequence (for example, where the first CCE of a SS is #0, the second CCE corresponds to #2, and the like) such that the WTRU may determine that a HARQ A/N report may be expected when the first CCE of a DCI coincide with a specific CCE in the SS (for example, for even indices) but may not be expected for another CCE in the SS (for example, for odd indices).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">For aggregation level of the DCI (for example, number of CCEs such as 1, 2, 4 or 8 CCEs), the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of the aggregation level (AL) of a DCI associated with the transmission. For example, the WTRU may be expected to generate a HARQ A/N report for a transmission associated with AL of 4 or more, while it may not be required otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">For other DCI contents, for example, scheduling information and/or transmission characteristics may be used (as further described herein). In one method, the WTRU may use any of the above methods to determine if the successfully decoded DCI includes a UCI (or HARQ feedback only) request, such as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">The WTRU may determine that the transmission is characterized according to at least one of the following: an identity of the associated HARQ process, a redundancy version, an initial transmission or retransmission for the concerned HARQ process, a type of scheduling for the transmission, timing associated with the transmission, scheduling parameters, a simultaneous downlink transmission and/or aggregation size of UCI, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">For identity of the associated HARQ process, the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of the identity of the HARQ process associated with the transmission (or indicated in the DCI). For example, the WTRU may be configured such that it may not be expected to generate a HARQ A/N report for a subset of HARQ processes, while it may generate HARQ A/N report for other processes. For example, the WTRU may determine that a HARQ A/N report is always expected for a process configured with a semi-persistent assignment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">For redundancy version (e.g., 0,2,3,1), the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of the redundancy version (RV) associated with the transmission. For example, the WTRU may generate a HARQ A/N report for RV=2, 3, 1 but not for RV=0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">For initial transmission or retransmission for the concerned HARQ process, the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of whether the transmission is the initial transmission for the HARQ process or not. For example, the WTRU may determine that it is expected to generate a HARQ A/N report for HARQ retransmissions only.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">For type of scheduling for the transmission, the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of whether dynamic scheduling information was received for the transmission (for example, DCI on a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) that provided transmission parameters) or whether the transmission is received using a configured assignment For example, the WTRU may determine that a HARQ A/N report may not be required for a transmission dynamically scheduled (for example, it may always be required for semi-persistent assignments), possibly making further determination in combination with other methods described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">For timing associated with the transmission (or with the transmission of the associated UCI), the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of the transmission time interval (TTI) (or subframe, or slot) associated with the downlink transmission. For example, the WTRU may be configured such that it may not be required to generate a HARQ A/N report for one or more subframes (for example, even frames) within a frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">For scheduling parameters (for example, size of TBs, MCS, and the like), possibly in relation to another metric, such as channel quality, the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of the parameters associated with the transmission. For example, the WTRU may determine that a HARQ A/N report is required for a TBS larger than a specific value, and otherwise it may not be required. Similarly, MCS may be used as the determination factor. For example, the WTRU may determine that a HARQ A/N report may be optional if expected BLER is higher than a threshold. The WTRU may use a combination of the last reported CSI and one or more properties of the downlink transmission such as the MCS larger than a threshold function of a CQI and the transmission rank larger than rank indicator (RI).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">For simultaneous downlink transmission(s) and/or aggregation size of UCI, the WTRU may determine whether or not a HARQ A/N report is expected for a transmission as a function of the number of payload bits, total sum for all transport blocks or any other aggregated metric associated with the time interval when the transmission satisfies a specific condition, e.g., is larger than X. The WTRU may perform a similar determination as a function of the aggregated size of the UCI, for example, the sum of the HARQ A/N bits expected according to the legacy behavior may exceed a certain value X bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">A combination of the examples discussed may be used. For example, the WTRU may determine that it is configured such that HARQ A/N report for one (or more) specific HARQ process(es) is generated (possibly at least) upon reception of an explicit feedback request such as reception of a DCI(UCI) described herein, otherwise the WTRU may not generate a HARQ A/N report for the concerned process(es); such behavior may be combined with additional rules such that the WTRU may generate HARQ A/N report under other circumstances. For example, the WTRU may generate HARQ A/N report starting from the xth retransmission for the concerned HARQ process(es) and/or when the WTRU receives dynamic scheduling for uplink resources for UCI reporting such as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Methods described herein may be applicable as a function of the physical channel used for reporting. The WTRU may determine whether or not it may perform the above determination or if the legacy behavior for generation of a HARQ A/N report, as a function of the type of uplink transmission, may be used to convey the UCI. For example, the WTRU may use the legacy behavior when it determines that HARQ A/N reports may be transmitted using one (or more) PUSCH transmission(s). The WTRU may determine that some HARQ A/N reports may be optional when it determines that HARQ A/N reports may be transmitted using one (or more) PUCCH transmission(s). The WTRU may perform such determination as a function of the timing of concerned the uplink transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Methods described herein may be applicable as a function of the carrier associated with the transmission. The WTRU may determine whether or not it may perform the above determination or if the legacy behavior for generation of a HARQ A/N report, as a function the type of carrier, may be associated with the downlink transmission. For example, the WTRU may use a first method for carrier(s) in a licensed band while it may be used a second method for carrier(s) in an unlicensed band. For example, the WTRU may generate a HARQ A/N report (or more generally, a UCI report) for HARQ processes (and/or for CSI) associated with an unlicensed band (for example, for LTE License-Assisted Access (LAA)) when it successfully receives a DCI that includes a UCI (or HARQ feedback only) request (such as described herein). In which case, for example, the WTRU may report the status of the concerned HARQ process(es) where such status may, for example, be determined at (and correspond to) the time of the reception of such request. Otherwise the WTRU may not necessarily generate the concerned UCI feedback (for example, other rules may apply). For example, the WTRU may not generate HARQ A/N report for every received transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">For any of the examples discussed herein, such transmission may be at least one of the following: a PDSCH and DCI of a specific type. The transmission may be a PDSCH transmission. The transmission may be a sidelink. The transmission may be a direct WTRU-to-WTRU transmission, for example, a physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH) (for example, for data), a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH) (for control), and/or a physical sidelink discovery channel (PSDCH) (for example, for discovery).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">The transmission may be a DCI that modifies a semi-persistent downlink assignment or a semi-persistent uplink grant. The transmission may be a DCI(UCI), for example, that includes a UCI request and/or dynamic UCI scheduling information, for example, as described herein. The DCI may be any other DCI, for example, for which any of the above methods may be applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">For any of the examples discussed herein, such transmission may be associated with a serving cell, which serving cell may be at least one of the following: type of serving cell of the WTRU's configuration, cell configuration, group of cells, state of the cell, and quality of the cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">In an example, the serving cell may be the type of serving cell of the WTRU's configuration. For example, the cell may be a Secondary Cell (such as a SCell) of the WTRU's configuration such that conditional HARQ A/N reporting is applied to such transmission for such cell. For example, the WTRU may not apply conditional HARQ A/N reporting to any such transmission for a Primary Cell (such as a PCell) of the WTRU's configuration for a WTRU configured with carrier aggregation or for a WTRU configured with dual connectivity. For example, the WTRU may not apply conditional HARQ A/N reporting to any such transmission for a special cell of a secondary cell group (such as a PSCell) for a WTRU configured with dual connectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">In another example, the serving cell may be configured in a cell configuration. For example, the cell may be configured (such as by radio resource control (RRC), or by medium access control (MAC)) such that conditional HARQ A/N reporting is applied to such transmission for such cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Also, in an example, the serving cell may be part of a group of cells. For example, the cell may be part of a specific group of cells such that conditional HARQ A/N reporting is applied to such transmission for such cells such as a โHARQ A/N group.โ Such group may correspond to a secondary cell group (for example, a service continuity gateway (SCG)) for a WTRU configured with dual connectivity. Such group may correspond to a secondary timing advance group (for example, a secondary Timing Advance Group (sTAG)) for a WTRU configured with carrier aggregation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">In an additional example, the serving cell may be associated with a state of the cell. For example, the cell may be associated with a state for the purpose of controlling whether or not conditional HARQ A/N reporting is applied. The WTRU may modify such a state based on a number of events, for example, reception of L1 signaling or reception of L2/MAC control signaling that indicates a change in the state for the cell. For example, the cell may be in the deactivated state such that conditional HARQ A/N reporting is applied to uplink control signaling associated with the cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">In a further example, the quality of the serving cell may be used. For example, the quality of the cell may be based on WTRU-measurements. For example, the WTRU may determine that the quality of the cell is below (or above) a certain threshold and, until the WTRU determines that the quality changes sufficiently significantly and possibly also for a sufficient amount of time, determine whether or not it may apply condition HARQ A/N reporting for such transmission for the cell. The WTRU may perform such determination only for cells for which it reports a measurement, for example, a channel quality indicator (CQI). The WTRU may perform such determination when it performs the transmission of such measurement for the concerned cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">Additional control information may be located inside the uplink transmission that contains a UCI report. In one method, the WTRU may signal inside the uplink transmission whether or not non-legacy handling of HARQ A/N bits has been applied by, for example, transmitting one bit to indicate whether conditional HARQ A/N has been applied to the uplink control signaling, or it may append a CRC. For example, the WTRU may perform at least one of the following: concatenate one bit (one bit flag indication is added to the transmission); concatenate CRC (for example, a 3-bit CRC may be added to the transmission, whereby different methods may be associated with different CRC calculations); and use different resource/property of PUCCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In one method, the WTRU may use any of the above to associate priority to a HARQ A/N report for such transmission. The WTRU may additionally handle the information bit associated with the HARQ A/N report according to at least one of the following: the WTRU may drop the information bit, the WTRU may set the value of the information bit to a specific value, the WTRU may bundle the information bit with other information bits, the WTRU may encode the information bit with less protection, and the WTRU may transmit the information bit using a different physical layer channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Where the WTRU may drop the information bit, the WTRU may not, for example, transmit any HARQ A/N for a low priority transmission. In such case, the WTRU may select a different (possibly smaller) format if the resulting total number of HARQ A/N bits to transmit is suitable for the selected format. Alternatively, the WTRU may perform the uplink transmission of HARQ A/N signaling, if any, such that the eNode-B may interpret the absence of the concerned HARQ A/N bit as a NACK.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Where the WTRU may set the value of the information bit to a specific value (such as to NACK), the WTRU may use coding for the HARQ A/N bits such that no energy is used for HARQ NACK transmissions and the eNode-B may interpret the absence of HARQ A/N as a NACK.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Where the WTRU may bundle the information bit with other information bits (such as of similar priority), the WTRU may bundle, for example, a plurality of HARQ A/N information bits based on an activation state of the SCell associated with the transmission for which HARQ feedback was generated. For example, feedback for carriers of similar priority may be bundled together. Possibly, only for carriers associated with uplink control information of low priority.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Where the WTRU may encode the information bit with less protection, for example, the WTRU may do so in cases where unequal error protection is applied to transmission of information bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">Where the WTRU may transmit the information bit using a different physical layer channel, the WTRU may transmit the information bits using a different physical layer channel than was used for transmission of bits of higher priority.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The solutions described in the above may also be used to determine whether the WTRU transmits HARQ A/N over a specific resource or channel. For example, in case the WTRU may determine that transmission over PUCCH or over a specific PUCCH resource takes place only if at least one HARQ A/N bit is transmitted based on one of the solutions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">In some examples discussed herein, selective partial bundling may be used. In some examples, the number of information bits generated for HARQ-ACK may be reduced by applying bundling for a subset of groups of transport blocks that may be dynamically selected to minimize the resulting number of unnecessary retransmissions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">More generally, a WTRU may apply a first solution for generating HARQ-ACK information bits on a first subset of groups of transport blocks, and a second solution on a second subset of transport blocks, where the first and second subsets of transport blocks are selected based on at least one criterion that may change dynamically. For example, the criterion may be that the number of correctly received transport blocks for which the WTRU does not indicate positive acknowledgment is minimized for a given number of HARQ-ACK information bits. The WTRU may generate additional HARQ-ACK information bits to indicate which groups belong to the first and second subsets, using for instance a combinatorial index.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">An example for generating HARQ-ACK information bits on a group of transport blocks may include at least one of the following: no bundling, full bundling, and partial bundling. For no bundling, one bit may be generated for each transport block, where a first value (โACKโ or 1) is generated on a condition that the transport block was correctly received and a second value (โNACKโ or 0) is generated on a condition that the transport block was not correctly received or not received at all. For full bundling, one bit may be generated for all transport blocks, where a first value (โACKโ or 1) is generated on a condition that all transport blocks were correctly received, and a second value (โNACKโ or 0) otherwise. For partial bundling, one bit may be generated for each of a number of subsets of transport blocks of the group, where for each subset of transport blocks, a first value (โACKโ or 1) is generated on a condition that all transport blocks of the subset were correctly received, and a second value (โNACKโ or 0) otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In the above, a subset and/or a group of transport blocks may be, for example, defined as transport blocks that may be received from a certain serving cell (or subset thereof), a certain subframe (or subset thereof), or combination thereof. The groups may be explicitly configured by higher layers, or implicitly derived from the configuration (for example, the group size may be set to a fixed value and groups may be defined from the order of configured serving cells of the configuration).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">For example, a WTRU may be configured with 32 serving cells in FDD and receive up to 64 transport blocks in a subframe. One may define 8 groups of 8 transport blocks, each of which may correspond to the transport blocks that may be received from a set of 4 serving cells. For 2 of the 8 groups, HARQ-ACK information bits may be generated according to the โno bundlingโ solution while for the 6 remaining groups, HARQ-ACK information may be generated according to the โfull bundlingโ solution, resulting in 16 bits plus 6 bits for all groups. In addition, 5 information bits may be generated to represent a combinatorial index of 28 possible combinations of 2 out of 8 groups for which the โno bundlingโ solution is utilized in this subframe. To select which 2 out of 8 groups the โno bundlingโ solution is used on, the WTRU may determine, for each group, the number of successfully received transport blocks with โNACKโ generated if โfull bundlingโ may be used. The WTRU may select the 2 groups that have the largest number of such successfully received transport blocks. For example, in a subframe the number of successfully received transport blocks may be as follows: 8 for groups 1, 4 and 8; 5 for group 2; 4 for group 3; 2 for groups 5, 6; and 0 for group 7. In this case, the WTRU may select groups 2 and 3 for the โno bundlingโ solution and all other groups use โfull bundling.โ</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The selection of the groups for which a given bundling solution is used may be based on at least one of the following criteria. The selection of the groups may be based on the minimization of the number of correctly received transport blocks for which the WTRU does not indicate a positive acknowledgment in the subframe, as described herein. Also, the selection of the groups may be based on the presence or number of correctly received transport blocks for which the WTRU may not indicate a positive acknowledgment in a set of previous subframes for each group. In addition, the selection of the groups may be based on the number of times โACKโ was not reported for a successfully received transport block in a group. For example, the WTRU may use the โno bundlingโ solution for the group for which โNACKโ may be reported otherwise and that has the largest value of this number, or for which this number may go above a threshold. Further, the selection of the groups may be based on an indication from physical layer or higher signaling of the bundling solution to be applied for a certain group. Such an indication may be contained in a field of PDCCH/evolved-PDCCH (E-PDCCH) containing a downlink (DL) assignment for a serving cell of the group, or in a PDCCH/E-PDCCH containing information about DL assignments in the subframe. This may allow the network to override selection of groups by the WTRU; whether the WTRU received a DL assignment from a specific serving cell of a group. Also, the selection of the groups may be based on a property of one of the PDSCH transmissions of the group. Further, the selection of the groups may be based on the DCI format used for scheduling a PDSCH transmission of a group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">In examples disclosed herein, when a bundling solution is used across a group of serving cells, the WTRU may determine if a DL assignment was missed in a serving cell from an indication in a PDCCH/E-PDCCH containing a DL assignment for another serving cell of the group. Such indication may include a number of DL assignments that have been transmitted in the group in this subframe. The WTRU may determine that a DL assignment was missed if the total number of correctly received DL assignments for the group in the subframe is lower that the indicated number, and accordingly report โnackโ for the group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">In some examples, an indication of an index of cells or TBs that are ACKed may be used. Further, in some examples, a WTRU may be configured by higher layers to only use the PUCCH A/N (ACK/NACK) resources to report ACKs. In such an example, the lack of a feedback by the WTRU may be implied to represent a NACK at the eNode-B. TB and HARQ process may be used interchangeably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">In a PUCCH format that enables reporting of multiple transport block HARQ A/N bits (possibly from multiple cells), there may be a pre-determined location within a bit string for each possible TB HARQ A/N report. A WTRU may leave blank (or set to a pre-configured value) any bits that represent TB HARQ A/N for which a NACK may otherwise be transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">In another example, there may be pre-configured locations within the bit string where a set of TB HARQ A/N reports may be located. Such a set of bit locations may be used to report subsets of ACKs for multiple TBs. For example, the HARQ A/N bit string reported in a PUCCH may be composed of sets of x bits each. Each set of x bits may be used to report HARQ A/N for n TBs. In this example, the WTRU may be pre-configured (possibly semi-statically) with a meaning for all the possible 2{circumflex over (โ)}x codepoints of the set of bits, where each codepoint may identify a different subset of TBs for which ACK may be assumed at the eNode-B. As a simple numerical example, the bit string reported in a PUCCH may be composed of 5 sets of 2 bits each. Each set of 2 bits may be used to report ACK for any of 3 TB. For example, the codepoint โ00โ may indicate no ACKs for any of the three TB, โ01โ may indicate ACK for a first TB, โ10โ may indicate ACK for a second TB and โ11โ may indicate ACK for a third TB. The meaning of each codepoint may be set semi-statically by the eNode-B and may also indicate a group of TBs being ACKed (for example, a codepoint may indicate that a first and a second TB are ACK).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">In another example, there may not be pre-determined locations within the bit string for each TB HARQ A/N report. In such an example, there may be no need to reserve a spot within the bit string for TB HARQ A/N reports that are not indicating ACK. This may enable a greater number of possible TB HARQ A/N reports on average, given that capacity may not be wasted for TB HARQ A/N reports of NACK TBs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">In the case where pre-determined (and/or pre-configured) locations within a bit string of HARQ A/N reports are not used for each TB HARQ A/N, the WTRU may indicate to the eNode-B the TB for which an ACK is transmitted. A WTRU may be provided with a unique identifier (possibly a bit string) for each TB from all possible cells. The WTRU may report back the identifier as an ACK within a PUCCH. For example, for the case where a WTRU may have up to 64 TBS transmitted within a subframe, the WTRU may be provided with an identifier for each TB made up of 6 bits. In such a case, the HARQ A/N report may simply be for the WTRU to include the 6-bit strings of any TB for which an ACK is transmitted. In one example, the TB identifier may be provided when a WTRU is scheduled with a transport block. In another example, the WTRU may determine the TB identifier as a function of an identifier of the cell transmitting the TB (such as the cell identity (ID)) and a HARQ process ID.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">In some examples presented herein, a WTRU may have multiple ACKs to transmit in a PUCCH resource. For solutions where each TB HARQ A/N is not configured with a specific bit location in the HARQ A/N bit string, there may be situations where more ACKs are required to be transmitted in a PUCCH instance than the PUCCH capacity allows. In such a situation, the WTRU may down-select the TBs for which ACK is to be fed back in any PUCCH instance. Any TB for which an ACK is not transmitted may be assumed to be a NACK at the eNode-B, possibly erroneously so.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The WTRU may indicate to the eNode-B that a PUCCH feedback does not include all the ACKs and down-selection was used by the WTRU. In another example, the WTRU may include an indication along with any ACK transmission to inform the eNode-B whether the ACK for that TB is relative to the most recently transmitted PDSCH or to a previous version. For example, the WTRU may only be able to transmit an ACK after a second retransmission, when in reality it was ACKed after the first retransmission. Indicating to the WTRU whether the ACK occurred for a previous retransmission and/or also possibly indicating for what retransmission the ACK occurred may enable the eNode-B with link adaptation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The down-selection of ACKs to transmit may be done autonomously by the WTRU following some pre-configured rules. The WTRU may determine the subset of ACKs to transmit by at least one of: a priority list and a semi-statically configured set of rules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The priority list may be pre-configured by the eNode-B and may be determined as a function of the TBs and/or SCells transmitting the TB. The WTRU may rank the ACKed TB and transmit ACK feedback for the first TB, assuming the PUCCH has capacity to transmit n ACKS in any instance. The priority ranking may be determined by the WTRU as a function of the content of the PDSCH. For example, PDSCH used for control plane transmissions (such as RRC reconfiguration messages) may have higher ACK reporting priority than that of PDSCH used for user plane transmissions. The priority ranking may be dependent on the type of scheduling used for the PDSCH. For example, cross-carrier scheduled PDSCH may have higher/lower priority than self-scheduled PDSCH. Or semi-persistently scheduled PDSCH may have higher/lower priority than single scheduled PDSCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">A semi-statically configured set of rules may enable the WTRU to determine the TBs for which ACK may be transmitted in a PUCCH instance up to the allowed ACK capacity in any one instance. For example, report ACKs for ACKed processes who may have had the highest number of retransmissions. For example, the WTRU may order the TB ACK reporting priority in terms of number of retransmissions per HARQ process and feedback ACK for the n processes with highest number of retransmissions. For example, report ACKs for ACKed processes whose ACK reports were previously skipped. These may possibly be ordered by how many times an ACK report was skipped for a process (such as the most skips leading to highest ranking). For example, report ACKs for ACKed TBs with highest/lowest data rate, and/or highest/lowest MCS, and/or highest/lowest number of PRBs and/or, highest/lowest RI. For example, report ACKS for ACKed TBs transmitted with/without spatial multiplexing. The above rules may be used in any combination and the order that the rules may be followed may be pre-configured. For example, a first rule may be to report ACKs for ACKed processes whose ACKs were previously skipped. If fewer than n processes qualify, the PUCCH feedback may be further filled with ACKs for processes that fulfill another rule (such as processes with the highest number of retransmissions).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">The priority lists and/or sets of rules may be semi-statically configured and may also depend on the timing of the PDSCH and/or PUCCH. There may be subsets of subframes such that in a first subset of subframes a first set of rules is used to down-select ACK feedback and in a second subset of subframes a second set of rules is used to down-select ACK feedback.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">In a given subframe or group of subframes, the WTRU may determine a method for the generation of HARQ-ACK information according to at least one of the following: no bundling, wherein HARQ-ACK may include concatenated HARQ A/N reports in a pre-determined order; fixed bundling of HARQ A/N reports for determined subsets of transport blocks (such as in spatial, frequency and/or time domain); conditional HARQ A/N report generation as described herein; selective partial bundling as described herein; and down-selection of ACK transmissions as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">The selection of a method for the generation of HARQ-ACK to apply in a particular subframe, and possibly of parameters thereof, may be determined according to at least one of the following: payload of HARQ-ACK information bits, maximum payload accommodated by the PUCCH format, maximum payload accommodated by the PUSCH transmission, and an indication from a physical layer, MAC, or RRC signaling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Payload of HARQ-ACK information bits may be used to determine a method to apply in a particular subframe. The payload may be determined for either: the number of received transport blocks concerned by the HARQ-ACK transmission (based on received DL assignments) or the maximum number of transport blocks that may be received and concerned by the HARQ-ACK transmission (such as based on the maximum possible number of received DL assignments and maximum number of transport blocks for each assignment).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Maximum payload that may be accommodated by the PUCCH format configured to be use in this subframe on a condition that no PUSCH transmission takes place in the subframe may be used to determine a method to apply in a particular subframe. For example, the WTRU may select the method that generates a number of HARQ-ACK information less than the maximum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Maximum payload that may be accommodated by the PUSCH transmission in this subframe may be used to determine a method to apply in a particular subframe, such that the number of REs required to transmit HARQ-ACK information does not exceed a threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">An indication from physical layer, MAC or RRC signaling may be used to determine a method to apply in a particular subframe. For example, a field from a PDCCH/E-PDCCH containing a downlink assignment, an uplink grant or containing information on a set of downlink assignments and uplink grants may be used to indicate how HARQ-ACK information may be generated or the maximum number of HARQ-ACK bits that may be generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">The following solutions address the issue of insufficient maximum payload for UCI in PUCCH, including at least one of HARQ-ACK, channel state information (CSI) and SR. In an example, an the available number of coded bits in a PUCCH may be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">In some solutions, PUCCH payload may be increased by using high modulation order symbols, for example, using modulation order higher than that of QPSK such as 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), 64-QAM, 256-QAM, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">As an example, the number of coded bits carried in a single 16-QAM symbol is 4 bits, which is twice as much compared to those of carried in a single legacy PUCCH (such as, PUCCH format 3) QPSK symbol. A legacy PUCCH format 3 payload may be encoded into 48 bits and then may be mapped into 24 QPSK symbols. As an example, if 16-QAM symbols may be used instead of QPSK, for the same number of symbols, such as, 24 symbols, the PUCCH may carry 4ร24=96 coded bits, which in comparison may be twice as much of the maximum encoded bits of legacy PUCCH format 3 using QPSK modulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">The WTRU may use different modulation orders for different symbols which may be mapped to different PUCCH REs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">The WTRU may use different modulation orders for different symbols which may be mapped to different subcarriers. For example, out of 12 subcarriers per PUCCH RB n subcarriers, such as, n=4, may carry QPSK modulated symbols and (12-n) subcarrier, such as, 8, may carry 16-QAM modulated symbols. The total number of coded bits for a PUCCH with two PRBs (assuming all SC-FDMA symbols within the same PRB may carry the same information) may be calculated as follows:

All symbols mapped to the same subcarrier within the same PUCCH PRB may be modulated using the same modulation order, for example, QPSK, 16-QAM, and the like.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">A WTRU may use different encoders and/or may generate different sets of encoded bits. Different sets of encoded bits may be mapped to different sets of PUCCH symbols where each set of PUCCH symbols may be modulated using a different modulation technique, for example, QPSK, 16-QAM, and the like. As an example, two encoders may be used to encode the information bits to be carried in a single PUCCH PRB, which may be referred to as the โEncoder Aโ and โEncoder Bโ. Each encoder may have a different set of information bits as the encoder input. The output of the Encoder A may be modulated using a certain modulation technique, for example, QPSK, and may be mapped to a certain number of PUCCH subcarriers, such as, 4 subcarriers. The output of Encoder B may be modulated using a different modulation technique, for example, 16-QAM, and may be mapped to a different set of PUCCH subcarriers, such as, 12โ8=4 subcarriers. The total number of coded bits for a PUCCH with two PRBs (assuming all SC-FDMA symbols within the same PRB may carry the same information) may be calculated as 88, per the formula described earlier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Each PUCCH encoder, for which the encoded bits may be mapped to different modulation orders/techniques, may have a different protection level and/or robustness against channel/decoding impairments.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">The WTRU may have two or more different sets of information bits with the possibility for two or more different performance requirements. The two or more different sets of information bits may be encoded using two or more encoders and/or the encoded bits may be modulated by two or more modulation techniques, for example, QPSK, 16-QAM, and the like. The two or more sets of modulated symbols may be mapped to two or more sets of subcarriers and/or REs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">As an example, the WTRU may use HARQ ACK/NACK bundling to bundle the HARQ ACK/NACK bits of some of the component carriers and/or the WTRU may not bundle the HARQ ACK/NACK of some other component carriers. Since an error in the reception of the bundled HARQ ACK/NACK bit may impact the operation of more component carriers compared to that of the error in a non-bundled HARQ ACK/NACK bit, the WTRU may assign the bundled HARQ ACK/NACK bits to the encoder which may be ultimately mapped to the QPSK symbols, whereas the WTRU may assign the non-bundled HARQ ACK/NACK bits to the encoder which may be ultimately mapped to the 16-QAM symbols. Consequently, the bundled HARQ ACK/NACK bits may have a higher protection against channel/decoding impairments compared to non-bundled HARQ ACK/NACK bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">The WTRU may determine a modulation scheme based on a number of coded bits that needs to be transmitted in a subframe. For example, assuming that the same spreading scheme and number of RBs as PUCCH format 3 would be used (i.e. 2 symbols per sub-carrier and 1 RB), the WTRU may transmit using QPSK if the required number of coded bits is 48 bits, and using 16-QAM if the required number of coded bits is 92 bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">In some solutions, PUCCH payload may be increased by allocating more than 1 resource block to a single PUCCH resource. Such solutions may be referred to as โextended PUCCHโ when described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of an example of possible RE mapping for extended PUCCH design utilizing two contiguous RBs.

In an example in mapping <b>200</b>, RB #1 <b>210</b> and RB #2 <b>220</b> are contiguous and transmitted in the same timeslot. This design may have the benefit of preserving single-carrier property of the uplink transmission.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Different solutions may be envisioned for determining the sequence of the DM-RS, as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">In a first solution, the DM-RS sequence for an extended PUCCH may be generated from base sequences <o>r</o> <sub>u,v</sub>(n) of length 24 that are used in legacy systems for the DM-RS sequence of a PUSCH allocation of 2 RBs. Such base sequences may be different from the base sequences of length 12 used for PUCCH. The sequence itself may be defined as a cyclic shift c of the base sequence
<br/>
<i>r</i> <sub>u,v</sub> <sup>(+)</sup>(<i>n</i>)=<i>e</i> <sup>jฮฑn</sup> <i> <o>r</o> </i> <sub>u,v</sub>(<i>n</i>)โโEquation (2)
<br/>
The benefits of this solution may be that the DM-RS sequence has low peak-to-average power ratio and it allows multiplexing of other extended PUCCH resources using the same pair of RBs by use of different cyclic shifts of the same base sequence.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">In a second solution, the DM-RS sequence for an extended PUCCH may be generated from two concatenated base sequences of length 12. In other words, the DM-RS sequence used for the extended PUCCH, r<sub>u,v</sub> <sup>(ฮฑ)ext</sup>(n), may be expressed as:
<br/>
<i>r</i> <sub>u1,u2,v</sub> <sup>(ฮฑ)ext</sup>(<i>n</i>)=<i>e</i> <sup>jฮฑn</sup> <i> <o>r</o> </i> <sub>u1,v</sub>(<i>n</i>) for 0โค<i>nโค</i>12 andโโ Equation (3)
<br/>
<i>r</i> <sub>u1,u2,v</sub> <sup>(ฮฑ)ext</sup>(<i>n</i>)=<i>Ke</i> <sup>jฮฑn</sup> <i> <o>r</o> </i> <sub>u2,v</sub>(<i>n</i>) for 120โค<i>nโค</i>24โโ Equation (4)
<br/>
where K may be a constant of unity amplitude, possibly dependent on the group-sequence numbers u1 and u2, configured such that the peak-to-average ratio of the DM-RS sequence is kept to a low value. The group-sequence numbers u1 and u2 may be set to the same value u. In this case, the extended DM-RS sequence in this solution may be equivalent to two concatenated DM-RS sequences of length 12 generated from the same base sequence with different cyclic shifts ฮฑ<sub>1 </sub>and ฮฑ<sub>2 </sub>and a phase offset f for the second sequence, Kโกe<sup>jฮฒ</sup>, for example:
<br/>
<i>r</i> <sub>u,v</sub> <sup>(ฮฑ</sup> <sup> <sub2>1</sub2> </sup> <sup>,ฮฑ</sup> <sup> <sub2>2</sub2> </sup> <sup>)ext</sup>(<i>n</i>)=<i>e</i> <sup>jฮฑ</sup> <sup> <sub2>1</sub2> </sup> <sup>n</sup> <i> <o>r</o> </i> <sub>u,v</sub>(<i>n</i>) for 0โค<i>nโค</i>12โโ Equation (5)
<br/>
and
<br/>
<i>r</i> <sub>u,v</sub> <sup>(ฮฑ</sup> <sup> <sub2>1</sub2> </sup> <sup>,ฮฑ</sup> <sup> <sub2>2</sub2> </sup> <sup>)ext</sup>(<i>n</i>)=<i>e</i> <sup>jฮฑ</sup> <sup> <sub2>2</sub2> </sup> <sup>n+jฮฒ</sup> <i> <o>r</o> </i> <sub>u,v</sub>(<i>n</i>) for 12โค<i>nโค</i>24โโ Equation (6)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">An example benefit of this solution may be that it allows multiplexing of an extended PUCCH resource with PUCCH format 3 resources on the same RBs, as long as the cyclic shift of the PUCCH format 3 on the first RB (or second RB) is different than ฮฑ<sub>1 </sub>(or ฮฑ<sub>2</sub>) respectively, and provided that orthogonality is also ensured for the resources carrying information. Multiplexing with other extended PUCCH resources on the same pair of RBs may also be possible with appropriate selection of cyclic shifts. The set of possible combinations of cyclic shifts ฮฑ<sub>1 </sub>and ฮฑ<sub>2 </sub>and phase offset f may be restricted such that desirable properties of the DM-RS sequence are maintained (for example, low peak-to-average power ratio). For example, utilizing a phase offset of pi/4 may result in a lower peak-to-average power ratio than using no phase offset.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">In all the above solutions, the cyclic shifts used for DM-RS as well as the value of the phase offset ฮฒ may be a function of the time symbol in which DM-RS is transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">Processing for the information carried by the extended PUCCH may be similar to processing used for PUCCH format 3 after modulation. Each modulated symbol may be spread over one sub-carrier and one time slot, resulting in a total of 48 modulated symbols or 96 coded bits if QPSK is used. This approach may have the benefit of enabling multiplexing of the extended PUCCH with PUCCH format 3 on a same RB, provided that orthogonality of DM-RS is also achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">The WTRU may determine a number of RBs based on a number of coded bits that needs to be transmitted in a subframe. For example, assuming that the same spreading and modulation schemes as PUCCH format 3 would be used (i.e. 2 symbols per sub-carrier and QPSK), the WTRU may transmit over 2 RBs if the required number of coded bits is 96 bits, and over 3 RBs if the required number of coded bits is 144 bits. When the number of RB's used for PUCCH is more than 1, the WTRU may apply transform precoding using one of the following solutions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">In a solution, the WTRU may apply discrete Fourier transform (DFT) over the set of all transmitted sub-carriers. In case the WTRU does not transmit over one of the RBs defined for the PUCCH transmission (according for instance to one of the solutions described in subsequent paragraphs) the DFT may not be applied to the corresponding sub-carriers. This solution may ensure that the output signal maintains as much as possible the desirable properties of SC-FDMA (e.g., low cubic metric).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">In another solution, the WTRU may apply DFT separately over each RB. This solution may reduce receiver complexity in case there is uncertainty about whether the WTRU transmits or not on each RB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">In some solutions, PUCCH payload may be increased by spatial multiplexing. Such solutions may be referred to as โRank-n PUCCHโ herein, where n is the number of layers. With such solutions, for the same number of REs available for the transmission of information, the number of modulation symbols (and coded bits) may be increased by a factor n. The WTRU may transmit distinct DM-RS sequences for each antenna port corresponding to a layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">In some solutions, each DM-RS sequence transmitted for each antenna port may be generated from a same base sequence of length 12 <o>r</o> <sub>u,v</sub>(n). The DM-RS sequences
<br/>
<i>r</i> <sub>u,v</sub> <sup>(ฮฑ)</sup>(<i>n</i>)=<i>e</i> <sup>jฮฑn</sup> <i> <o>r</o> </i> <sub>u,v</sub>(<i>n</i>)โโEquation (7)
<br/>
used in a time symbol may use a different cyclic shift c for each antenna port p. This approach may have the benefit that multiplexing with legacy PUCCH format 3 transmissions in the same resource block may be achievable.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">When spatial multiplexing is used, the channel quality as seen by the eNode-B receiver, may be different between the two antenna ports. In some solutions, the WTRU may therefore utilize different coding rates, coding schemes and/or modulation schemes between the two transmission layers to ensure that the error performance target of the at least one type of uplink control information is met for a transmission power as low as possible. For example, in the case of a Rank-2 PUCCH (n=2) at least one of the following solutions may be applied: processing k information bits of a given type, wherein k1 information bits are encoded, modulated and mapped on a first antenna port and k2 information bits are encoded, modulated and mapped on a second antenna port; encoding, modulating and mapping information bits of a first type on a first antenna port and of a second type of a second antenna port; determining a modulation order (for example, QPSK or 16-QAM) for use on each antenna port; determining a number of coded bits available on each antenna port; and determining coding scheme (for example, block code, convolutional code, turbo) for use on each antenna port.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">For example, a WTRU may have to transmit k=30 bits of a given information type (such as HARQ-ACK) on a Rank-2 PUCCH. The WTRU may determine that k1=20 bits and k2=10 bits are encoded, modulated and mapped on the first and second antenna port respectively. The WTRU may also determine that QPSK is used on each antenna port, such that 48 coded bits are determined to be available for each antenna port. The WTRU may then encode 20 information bits using a coding rate of 20/48 to be mapped on the first antenna port and 10 information bits using a coding rate of 10/48 to be mapped on the second antenna port.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">The WTRU may determine at least one of the above parameters using at least one of the following solutions. The WTRU may use an indication received from higher layer signaling. The WTRU may use an indication received from at least one field of DCI received on PDCCH or E-PDCCH. For example, the DCI may be a DCI containing one of the downlink assignments indicating a transport block for which HARQ-ACK is to be transmitted in the PUCCH transmission. The indication may include one or more of the following: an indication of a number or ratio of information bits to be encoded and mapped on each layer, (for example, a 2-bit field may indicate that the ratio is either one third, one half, two thirds or three fourth on the first antenna port and the remaining on the second antenna port (where the number of bits may be rounded up or down)); the A/N resource indicator (ARI) field, overloaded to include the above (the ARI field may be equivalent to, or may reuse the same resources as, a transmitter power control (TPC) field received in downlink control information for an SCell); an indication of whether QPSK or 16-QAM may be used for each antenna port; and an indication of the channel quality imbalance between the two antenna ports, expressed, for example, in terms of signal-to-interference ratio (SINR) ratio or difference in dB, or in terms of required difference between transmitted energy per information bit on each antenna port. The WTRU may use at least one resource index associated with the N-rank PUCCH, which may be indicated using an ARI field in combination with higher layer signaling. The number of information bits and modulation to for each antenna port may be configured as part of a resource configured by higher layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">In examples, pre-coding may be used. In some examples, a WTRU equipped with more than one antenna port for the uplink may employ precoding similar to precoding applied to PUSCH. This may allow spatial multiplexing of PUCCH transmissions of multiple WTRU's on the same frequency and time resource. The pre-coding matrix applicable to the PUCCH transmission may be provided with downlink control signaling, such as in at least one PDCCH/E-PDCCH containing PDSCH assignments for which feedback is being provided in the subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">In some examples, DFT-S-OFDM with a smaller spreading factor may be used. In some solutions, PUCCH payload may be increased by spreading a modulation symbol over a smaller number of resource elements in a DFT-S-OFDM structure. For example, 48 modulation symbols spread over 3 time symbols may be mapped on the PUCCH and where the number of time symbols used for DM-RS is reduced to 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">In some solutions, the time symbols used for DM-RS may be maintained in the same time symbols as in legacy PUCCH format 3 to maintain the possibility of multiplexing with legacy PUCCH transmissions of this format in the same RB. In such a framework several possibilities may be envisioned for the spreading of modulation symbols to time symbols over a subcarrier, such as but not limited to: 10 modulation symbols, each on a single time symbol (for example, no spreading); 5 modulation symbols, each spread over 2 time symbols; 4 modulation symbols, of which 2 may be spread over 3 time symbols and 2 over 2 time symbols; and 3 modulation symbols, of which 2 may be spread over 3 time symbols and 1 over 4 time symbols.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">In case of a shortened PUCCH transmission, where the last time symbol is not available, the number of time symbols onto which a modulation symbol is spread may be reduced by 1 for one of the modulation symbols. The impacted modulation symbol is preferably one that is spread over a larger number of time symbols in a non-shortened PUCCH transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">The exact mapping of modulation symbols to time symbols within a sub-carrier (and therefore the spreading factor) may be parameterized to support a maximum payload value for PUCCH depending on this parameter value. The parameter may be derived from a PUCCH resource index or configured along with a PUCCH resource index.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">Where separate coding is applied to a different subset of UCI bits, modulation symbols spread over a larger number of time symbols within the PUCCH (for example, the 2 modulation symbols per subcarrier which are spread over 3 time symbols instead of 2) may be used to carry coded bits for the UCI requiring higher robustness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">The WTRU may determine a spreading scheme based on a number of coded bits that needs to be transmitted in a subframe. For example, the WTRU may spread 5 modulation symbols per sub-carrier if the required number of coded bits is 120 bits, and 3 modulation symbols per sub-carrier if the required number of coded bits is 72 bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">In an example, selection of codebook, resource and transmission format and parameters may be used. The WTRU may determine a PUCCH transmission format and possibly associated parameters for use in a particular subframe. A PUCCH transmission format may be characterized by a total number of coded bits and how the set of coded bits (or each subset of coded bits, if applicable) may be modulated, spread and mapped to physical resources (possibly including spatial multiplexing).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">The PUCCH transmission format may include at least one of: a legacy PUCCH format such as 1, 1a, 1b, 2, 3, and the like; and a new PUCCH format supporting higher payload, such as a format based on one or a combination of techniques described in the above (higher order modulation, larger BW, spatial multiplexing or reduced spreading).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">The selection of a format and associated parameters may be based on at least one of the following. The selection may be based on the number of information bits for different types of UCI to be transmitted on PUCCH (including multiple types of HARQ-ACK, CSI, SR). For example, the selection may be based on the presence or not of different types of UCI to be transmitted on PUCCH. Also, the selection may be based on an indication received from physical layer or higher layer signaling, such as a PDCCH/E-PDCCH containing a DL assignment or information about DL assignments. For example, the indication may contain a parameter indicating a number of modulation symbols to be mapped per subcarrier (or a spreading factor or set of spreading factors), a parameter indicating a modulation type (such as QPSK or 16QAM), and/or a parameter indicating a number of layers for the PUCCH transmission (rank). Further, the selection may be based on the method used for generating HARQ-ACK information bits to be transmitted in the PUCCH. In addition, the selection may be based on an indication received from physical layer or higher layer signaling of at least one codebook property, as described herein. The selection may also be based on a subset of feedback groups transmitted in a subframe, as described herein. Further, the selection may be based on dynamic scheduling of uplink resources for UCI feedback such as described herein, including methods related to UCI scheduling information as described herein, for example, using DCI(UCI) similar to that described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">In some solutions, the WTRU may determine all properties of a transmission format (including at least one of modulation, number of RBs, spreading, spatial multiplexing) based on a required number of coded bits and a mapping based on a pre-determined set of number of coded bits, number of information bits and/or subsets of feedback groups. For example, the WTRU may determine the transmission format based on a table similar to Table 1.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">In this example, the WTRU may determine a number of coded bits based for instance on a total number of information bits and a maximum coding rate, as described in subsequent paragraphs. For example, if the WTRU determines that the required number of coded bits is 144, the WTRU may employ QPSK modulation on the coded bits, spread the modulated symbols such that 3 symbols are spread over each sub-carrier, and map the resulting signal over 2 RBs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">In some solutions, the WTRU may select some properties of the transmission format based on a dynamic indication, such as receiving an ARI or another field from PDCCH/E-PDCCH. For example, a resource indicated by a received ARI may have 1 RB. If the required number of coded bits is 96 bits, the WTRU may determine that the spreading should be such that 4 modulation symbols are spread per sub-carrier, allowing for 96 coded bits in the RB. In case the resource indicated by the received ARI would have 2 RBs, the WTRU may determine that the spreading should be such that 2 modulation symbols are spread per sub-carrier, allowing for 96 coded bits in 2 RBs. Further examples of such dynamic aspects are described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">In an example, a dynamic determination of codebook properties may be used. In some solutions, the WTRU may determine at least one property of the set of information bits for HARQ feedback and possibly other UCI (e.g., the codebook) based on semi-static and/or dynamic aspects. The solutions may allow minimization of the amount of resources used for the transmission of such information. Further examples of such dynamic aspects are described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">By extension, the solutions described below may also be used to determine a PUCCH format, a PUCCH resource or a power control method that may be associated with a codebook property (such as the codebook size). For example, the WTRU may determine that a first PUCCH format (and/or power control method) is used if the codebook size is smaller than a first value and that a second PUCCH format is used if the codebook size is larger than or equal to a first value but smaller than a second value, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">At least one of the following codebook properties may be determined. The number of information bits of the codebook may be determined. The order of the information bits of the codebook, for example in terms of which transport block(s) of which cell(s) or cell group(s) are mapped to a given position of the codebook, may be determined. The interpretation of each information bit (or set thereof) may be determined, such as whether the bit(s) represents: the ACK or NACK outcome of the decoding of a transport block received on a specific cell, cell group, and/or subframe; and/or an indication of cell(s) or cell group(s) or subframe(s) over which bundling is applied or not. A source coding scheme that may be applied (e.g., Huffmann encoding) may be determined. A channel coding scheme applied to the codebook (e.g., Reed-Muller, turbo or convolutional) may be determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram of an example selection process for a PUCCH format based on the size and type of feedback. In an example shown in process <b>300</b>, a WTRU may receive a plurality of transport blocks over a set of a plurality of configured carriers and generate HARQ-ACK feedback <b>310</b> and CSI feedback <b>320</b> for the plurality of transport blocks. Further, the number of information bits needed for HARQ-ACK feedback <b>310</b>, which may be represented by n, and the number of information bits needed for CSI feedback <b>320</b>, which may be represented by m, may be combined (e.g., concatenated) by the WTRU <b>330</b>. The WTRU may generate a feedback message that includes the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits to use for the HARQ-ACK feedback and the number of CSI feedback bits to use for the CSI feedback. The WTRU may then determine the possible PUCCH format based on the content of the feedback <b>340</b>. For example, this PUCCH format determination may be made based on the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits and the number of CSI feedback bits. The WTRU may transmit the feedback message using the determined PUCCH format.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">For example, if HARQ-ACK feedback is present and therefore n&gt;0 and if CSI feedback is present and therefore m&gt;0, then a first PUCCH format, such as PUCCH format x, or a second PUCCH format, such as PUCCH format y, may be selected <b>350</b>. Also, if HARQ-ACK feedback is not present and therefore n=0 and only CSI feedback is present and therefore m&gt;0, then PUCCH format x or a third PUCCH format, such as PUCCH format z, may be selected <b>360</b>. Further, if HARQ-ACK feedback is present and therefore n&gt;0 and if CSI feedback is not present and therefore m=0, then PUCCH format x or a fourth PUCCH format, such as PUCCH format w may be selected <b>370</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">In the case that PUCCH format x or PUCCH format y is selected <b>350</b>, the WTRU may then compare the number of information bits of the feedback payload to a first threshold <b>355</b>, such as B<sub>1</sub>. If the feedback payload is greater than the first threshold and therefore n+m&gt;B<sub>1</sub>, then PUCCH format x may be selected <b>356</b>. Further, if the feedback payload is less than or equal to the first threshold and therefore n+mโคB<sub>1</sub>, then PUCCH format y may be selected <b>358</b>. The WTRU may transmit the feedback message using the determined PUCCH format.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">In the case that PUCCH format x or PUCCH format z is selected <b>360</b>, the WTRU may then compare the number of information bits of the feedback payload to a second threshold <b>365</b>, such as B<sub>2</sub>.

Further, if the feedback payload is less than or equal to the second threshold and therefore mโคB<sub>2</sub>, then PUCCH format z may be selected <b>369</b>. The WTRU may transmit the feedback message using the determined PUCCH format.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">In the case that PUCCH format x or PUCCH format w is selected <b>370</b>, the WTRU may then compare the number of information bits of the feedback payload to a third threshold <b>375</b>, such as B<sub>3</sub>.

The WTRU may transmit the feedback message using the determined PUCCH format.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">A codebook property may be dependent at least on semi-static (or static) information, such as a number of configured carriers (or cells), a subframe configuration, a grouping of cells in cell groups, a number of transport blocks that may be received in a given cell, a transmission mode used in a given cell, and a HARQ feedback scheme configured to be utilized in a cell or group of cells (such as whether bundling within or across subframes or cells is applied, or whether a HARQ feedback solution as described earlier is applied).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">The WTRU may also determine a codebook property as a function of information that may change more dynamically, such as: the activation state of a cell or a cell group; whether radio link problems or radio link failure occurred for a cell group or was reported for a cell group; whether PDSCH is known to not have been transmitted from the network for a cell or a group of cells, or alternatively known to have been transmitted from the network; the dynamic subframe configuration (uplink (UL) or DL) in a cell; and DL control information received in a subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">For example, the WTRU may determine that a codebook only includes HARQ feedback for cells or groups of cells that are in an activated state or for which radio link failure was not reported. The WTRU may also determine that a codebook only includes HARQ feedback for cells, groups of cells or subframes from which the WTRU determines that PDSCH may have been transmitted. In this case the WTRU may determine the codebook size and the bit position(s) accordingly. For example, in case of 10 configured cells and 2 transport blocks per cell, if the WTRU determines that PDSCH may have been transmitted from cells 2, 3 and 6 only, the first two bits may correspond to HARQ feedback for cell 2, the two next bits may corresponding to HARQ feedback for cell 3, and so on for a codebook size of 6 bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">The WTRU may make the determination that PDSCH may have been transmitted by using one of the following solutions. The WTRU may receive an indication of the cells, cell groups, transport blocks and/or subframes in which PDSCH may be transmitted from downlink control signaling included in PDCCH or E-PDCCH. The indication may consist of a field of which each possible value indicates a subset of cells, cell groups and/or subframes in which PDSCH may be transmitted (or may not be transmitted). The subset associated with each value may be predetermined or configured by higher layers. The subset may also be a function of the cell or cell group in which the signaling is received, or of the cell(s) or cell group(s) indicated in the same PDCCH or E-PDCCH in which the field is contained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">For example, if the field size is two bits, the value โ00โ may indicate that PDSCH may be received only in the cell(s) or cell group(s) for which PDSCH is scheduled in this PDCCH or E-PDCCH; the value โ11โ may indicate that PDSCH may be received in any configured cell or cell group; the value โ01โ may indicate that PDSCH may be received in a first set of cell groups configured by higher layers, and the value โ10โ may indicate that PDSCH may be received in a second set of cell groups configured by higher layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">In another example, the cell index of one (or more) serving cell where PDSCH is transmitted may be used in combination with the indication value to determine the codebook. In this example, every DCI with a downlink assignment may transmit the same indication. The indication value may be mapped to different sets of cells and/or carriers and/or transport blocks for which a WTRU may be expected to feedback A/N. The determination of the appropriate set based on the indication, may be a function of the serving cell ID of at least one cell where a PDSCH is transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">Table 2 provides an example of a relationship between an indication and sets of cells for which a WTRU may report A/N, as a function of the serving cell. Basically, the WTRU may determine the appropriate set as a function of the indication and that of the set of which at least one serving cell where a PDSCH is transmitted.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">In case HARQ-ACK is to be reported for more than 1 subframe (e.g., in case of TDD), in one solution, the indication may represent the entire codebook over all subframes and cells regardless of the subframe in which it is received. Alternatively, the indication may represent the portion of the codebook corresponding to the subframe in which it is received. Alternatively, the indication may represent the portion of the codebook corresponding to subframe(s) up to and including the subframe in which it is received. For example, the indication may represent the a set of cell(s) or cell group(s) where PDSCH may be received in any subframe up to and including the subframe in which the indication is received.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">The meaning of an indication (e.g., the set of transport blocks and/or cells and/or carriers and/or subframes for which a WTRU is expected to feedback HARQ A/N) may depend on other, possibly implicit, factors. For example, a WTRU may receive a specific codepoint or bitmap in an indication, and the WTRU may map such indication to a different codebook depending on at least one of the following. The WTRU may map such an indication to a different codebook depending on a timing of the transmission of the indication. For example, the subframe number may be used in conjunction with the indication. In another example, the specific subframe of a set of subframes for which feedback is reported in a specific subframe (in TDD) may be used. The WTRU may also map such an indication to a different codebook depending on another parameter of a DCI including the indication. For example, a combination of a TPC command and a new indication may be used. In another example, a parameter of the search space (e.g., whether it is common search space or WTRU-specific search space, or the CCE of the search space) of a DCI may be used in combination with the indication value. Further, the WTRU may also map such an indication to a different codebook depending on the PUCCH format and/or resources indicated in a downlink assignment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">In the above, the indication may be contained in a subset or all downlink assignments. The indication may also be contained in one or more PDCCH/E-PDCCH (or DCI(s)) dedicated to the provision of scheduling information for UCI as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">In another example, the network may indicate which pre-configured group(s) of carriers contain at least one downlink assignment. Thus, the number of NACK bits corresponding to non-scheduled carriers (the โknownโ NACKS) may be reduced when there is no downlink assignment scheduled in certain groups of carriers. The size of the codebook can therefore be dramatically reduced, although it may still contain a (smaller) number of NACKS from non-scheduled carriers. The reduction of the size of the codebook improves not only performance from a power perspective but also PUCCH resource usage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">Another example is illustrated in Table 3 for a WTRU configured with 32 carriers. In this example, one of the codepoints of the indicator (00) may indicate โall carriersโ to allow the WTRU be scheduled on all carriers. Another codepoint (01) may indicate 4 disjoint groups of 8 carriers. The specific group to select may be determined based on which carriers the assignments are received for. The two other codepoints (10) and (11) may indicate different groups of 16 carriers, or possibly groups where the order of carriers is modified as in Option 1. The exact mapping may be configured by higher layers to maximize scheduling flexibility and performance. Additional flexibility may also be obtained using a field with more than 2 bits. One possibility to minimize additional overhead may be to use a single field for ARI and Codebook Indicator.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">In an example, not all carriers of an indicated group may need to be scheduled. The WTRU may indicate โNACKโ when no DL assignment is detected for a carrier included in the indicated group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram of an example of a HARQ A/N codebook determination. In an example shown in diagram <b>400</b>, the WTRU may receive downlink assignments for a sub-set of carriers within a set of carriers <b>410</b>. For example, the WTRU may receive downlink assignments for the sub-set of carriers 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 with codebook indicator โ01โ in every DL assignment. The WTRU may miss DL assignment for carrier 12. The WTRU may not receive an assignment for carrier 11, which may have no assignment. The WTRU may use the codebook carrying HARQ A/N for carriers <b>420</b>, such as carriers {9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}, and include NACK for carriers 11 and 12.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">An indication may include at least one downlink assignment index (DAI) received as part of downlink control information associated with each PDSCH transmission. In this case, the WTRU may order the received PDSCH for each cell and subframe according to a pre-determined rule (for example, by cell index first and subframe second, or vice-versa). The WTRU may include HARQ A/N bits in the codebook for each received PDSCH (unless it was determined that HARQ A/N should not be included based on previously described solutions), and include HARQ A/N bits (with value โNACKโ) for each PDSCH determined to be missing based on the difference between consecutive DAI values in the sequence. For example, the number of missing PDSCH may be determined to be (Nโ1) mod M where N is the difference between consecutive DAI values in the sequence and M is the number of possible DAI values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">An indication may include a field received as part of downlink control information associated with at least one PDSCH transmission. The field may indicate the final downlink assignment of a group of downlink assignments, possibly assigned in or for a specific subframe. One value of the field (for example, โ0โ) may indicate that the assignment is not the final assignment, and another value of the field (for example, โ1โ) may indicate that the assignment is the final assignment of the group and/or subframe and/or component carrier. This may enable the WTRU to know when to stop blind detection in a subframe and also to know if it has detected the final assignment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">In some solutions, the indication associated with the final (or last) assignment may be derived from the value of a field that may also be used to indicate other types of information. For example, the indication may be derived from at least one value of the ARI and/or of the TPC command for the PUCCH received in one or more PDCCH/E-PDCCH(s), or from at least one value of a PUCCH format indicator, according to at least one of the following.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">The WTRU may identify an assignment as the final assignment if the value of the ARI for this assignment is different from at least one other assignment of a set. The set may consist of all assignments of a subframe or all assignments. In this case, the value of the ARI (or of the TPC command for the PUCCH) for this assignment may not be directly used to indicate an index to a PUCCH resource. The determination of an assignment as the final assignment may be subject to at least one of the following additional conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">In an example, the number of other assignments, possibly only in the same subframe, may be at least one. In another example, the at least one other assignment may be assignments that are preceding the final assignment according to a pre-defined sequence (e.g., carrier first, subframe second). In a further example, the at least one other assignment may include at least one assignment that does not correspond to the primary cell. In still another example, the value of the ARI for the final assignment may be a fixed or configured value. In yet another example, the value of the ARI for the final assignment may be related to the value of the ARI in other assignments. For example, the value of the ARI of the final assignment may indicate a PUCCH resource with a number of RB's smaller than or equal to the PUCCH resource indicated by the value of the ARI in other assignments. Further, the value of the ARI of the final assignment may be the sum of the ARI decoded in other assignments, plus a fixed or configured value (or XOR'ed with a fixed or configured value). For instance, the value of the ARI of the final assignment may be one (1) plus the value of the ARI in other assignments (modulo the number of possible ARI values).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">In case the WTRU does not detect the final assignment based on one of the above solutions, the WTRU may consider that the codebook is undetermined and apply actions according to solutions described in other paragraphs. Alternatively, the WTRU may append at least one NACK (or โ0โ) to the codebook such that the total size of the codebook corresponds to a valid size among a set of pre-defined or configured valid sizes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">An indication may consist of a field received as part of downlink control information associated with each PDSCH transmission. The field may indicate to the WTRU the remaining number of assignments to be expected after the detection of a current assignment, within a group of downlink assignments (possibly for a subframe and/or a component carrier). The WTRU may better determine missing PDSCH and may also a NACK value for any missing PDSCH in the appropriate location of a feedback report. In another solution, the field may indicate the total number of downlink assignments in a group of downlink assignments and/or a subframe and/or a component carrier. The WTRU may determine the total number of missing PDSCH and may indicate this to the serving cell in a feedback report.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">An indication may consist of a field received as part of downlink control information associated with each PDSCH transmission, for example a DAI. The DAI may serve as an ascending counter ordered along a parameter of the serving cells (e.g., the DAI may serve as a cumulative counter of total assignments up to a current assignment, counted in the direction of increasing serving cell index). For example, assuming a 2-bit DAI, and with serving cells ordered in increasing serving cell index, a first assignment on a first serving cell (e.g., a serving cell with lowest serving cell index) may have DAI=00, a second assignment on a second serving cell (e.g., a serving cell with second lowest serving cell index) may have DAI=01, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">In another solution, the DAI may serve as a descending counter ordered along a parameter of the serving cells (e.g., the DAI may serve as a counter of the remaining assignments in the direction of increasing serving cell index). For example, assuming a 2-bit countdown DAI, and with serving cells ordered in increasing serving cell index, a last assignment (e.g., an assignment on a serving cell with highest serving cell index) may have countdown DAI=00, a second to last assignment (e.g., an assignment on a serving cell with highest serving cell index remaining) may have countdown DAI=01, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">The counters may increment by unit values or may not have unit counting steps. For example, the decreasing counter of remaining assignments may repeat a DAI value for some consecutive assignments. For example the decreasing counter of remaining assignments may repeat the same value for P consecutive assignments. In an example, if we assume 10 serving cells with assignments, and P=3, the countdown DAI may be assigned as follows (in order of increasing serving cell index): 11 10 10 10 01 01 01 00 00 00. In such a solution, a WTRU may expect the final P=3 assignments to have a countdown DAI of 00. In such a solution, a WTRU may be able to resolve whether it has successfully received a last downlink assignment. However, if one of the assignments with a countdown DAI is missing, a WTRU may have to report NACK for all P=3 consecutive assignments sharing the same countdown DAI given that it may not know which of the P=3 consecutive assignments is missing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">A hybrid solution may be possible, where both an increasing cumulative counter of assignments, and a decreasing counter of remaining assignments are used. For example a unit step increasing counter may be used (e.g., a cumulative counter of assignments where the DAI is increased by one for every assignment) and a repeating counter of remaining assignments may be used (with P repetitions). For example, assuming 2-bit cumulative and countdown DAIs, ten assignments may have the following total DAI values (where the first two bits represent the cumulative DAI using unit step increments and the last two bits represent the countdown DAI using P=3): 0011 0110 1010 1110 0001 0101 1001 1100 0000 0100. In this case, from the cumulative counter the WTRU may determine what, if any, assignment is missing, except for any 2<sup>N+i </sup>consecutive missing assignments (where N is the size in bits of the cumulative DAI and i is an integer greater than or equal to 0) and/or any last missing assignment. Also, from the repeating and decreasing counter of remaining assignments, the WTRU may determine if up to P*2<sup>M </sup>consecutive assignments are missing (where M is the size in bits of the countdown DAI), as well as if the last downlink assignment is missing. Combining the two DAIs, the WTRU may resolve any consecutive assignments except for those that are greater than the lowest common multiples of P*2<sup>M </sup>and 2<sup>N</sup>. The values of M and N need not be equal. For example, a situation where the cumulative counter uses N=2 bits, and the decreasing counter of remaining assignments uses M=1 bit and a repetition of P=3, may lead to a WTRU being able to resolve whether a last assignment is missing, and any other missing assignments except for 12 or more consecutive assignments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">The field may also indicate other information relevant to HARQ feedback for each value, such as an indication of the format and/or resource index of the PUCCH to transmit on (โACK/NACK resource indicatorโ). For example, if the field size is three bits, the value โ010โ may indicate that PDSCH may be received in a first set of cell groups configured by higher layers and that transmission of HARQ feedback takes place over a certain PUCCH format and a first value of the resource index configured by higher layers; the value โ011โ may indicate that PDSCH may be received in first set of cell groups configured by higher layers and that transmission of HARQ feedback takes place over a second value of the resource index configured by higher layers, and so on. Alternatively, information about PUCCH resource index or indices to use may be provided in a separate field or in a separate PDCCH or E-PDCCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">The same value of the indication may be received from more than one PDCCH or E-PDCCH (i.e., in any cell from which the WTRU receives a PDSCH assignment), to ensure robustness against missed detections. The indication may also be contained in a PDCCH or E-PDCCH of a specific DCI format in a specific cell or search space independently of other PDCCH or E-PDCCH containing PDSCH assignments for this WTRU. For example, the indication may be contained in a PDCCH received in a common search space. The indication may be valid for a duration of one subframe or more than one subframe (such as one frame).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">In an example, a generalized indicator may be used. An indication may consist of a field which may be interpreted either as a downlink assignment index (DAI) or as a codebook indicator or codebook size indicator depending on its specific value, or depending on the value of an associated flag or field. For example, the indication may consist of a field of N bits, where the interpretation of Nโ1 bits depends on the value of a specific bit. Table 4 provides an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">In a further example, the codebook size values may be pre-defined or configured by higher layers.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">In another example, the codebook determination may use DAI and size indicators. In some examples, the WTRU may determine a codebook based on zero or more DAI(s), and zero or more codebook indicator(s) or codebook size indicator(s) received from downlink assignment(s). In such solutions, the WTRU may determine a codebook (or portion thereof) based on the received DAI(s) and verify that this codebook (or portion thereof) is consistent with any applicable received codebook indicator. In case the WTRU determines that the DAI-codebook is consistent with the received codebook indicator, the WTRU may transmit HARQ-ACK according to the DAI-codebook. Otherwise, the WTRU may transmit other information and/or perform other actions as will be described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">A received codebook indicator may be applicable to the entire HARQ-ACK codebook or to a subset of the HARQ-ACK codebook. In the latter case, the subset may correspond to the downlink assignment(s) received in the same subframe as the one where the codebook indicator is received. Alternatively, the subset may correspond to the downlink assignments(s) received in the subframe(s) preceding and including the subframe where the codebook indicator is received. Similarly, a DAI-codebook may be applicable over the entire HARQ-ACK codebook or to a subset.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">A codebook indicator may indicate a range of possible codebook sizes, a set of possible codebook sizes or a specific size. For example, a specific codepoint of the indicator may correspond to a range of sizes between 21 bits and 50 bits. In this case, the WTRU may determine that the DAI-codebook is consistent with an applicable received codebook indicator if its size is within the indicated range, or if it is equal to the indicated size. A codebook indicator may correspond to a PUCCH format indicator, where the indication of a PUCCH format implicitly indicates a range of possible sizes for the codebook. For example, an indication of PUCCH format 3 may implicitly indicate that the codebook size is below or equal to 21 bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">In some examples, the WTRU may implicitly derive a range or set of codebook sizes from other properties or fields of downlink control signaling instead of an explicit codebook indicator. For example, the WTRU may derive a range of possible codebook sizes from an indication of the number of RBs allocated to PUCCH, or from a resource indication (for example, an ARI) for a PUCCH, possibly in combination with a PUCCH format indicator. The set of possible codebook sizes for a certain number of RB's of a PUCCH or for a certain value of ARI may be pre-defined or configured by higher layers. For example, the set of possible codebook sizes may be configured as {16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128} for ARI=2 and as {24, 40, 56, 72, 88, 104, 120} for ARI=3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">A specific downlink assignment may contain a codebook indicator, a DAI or both a codebook indicator and a DAI. When a downlink assignment does not indicate a DAI (for instance, when a generalized indicator has a value not corresponding to a DAI), the expected DAI value in the next received downlink assignment may be incremented as if a DAI was received.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">When the WTRU determines that the DAI-codebook is not consistent with the codebook indicator for at least one portion of the codebook, the WTRU may adjust the size of the codebook for the at least one portion to a value corresponding with the codebook indicator, if such indicator indicates a specific size. The WTRU may indicate NACK for all bits of the at least one portion. In case the WTRU determines that the DAI-codebook is not consistent with the codebook indicator for at least one portion of the codebook but cannot determine the correct size of the codebook (e.g., if the indicator only indicates a range of sizes), the WTRU may consider that the codebook is undetermined and may perform actions described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">In the above, an indication may consist of the value of a field included in the payload of the DCI, or of the value of a field used to mask a subset or all bits of the CRC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">In some examples, the codebook may be indicated by the network to the WTRU in a dynamic manner. For example, a codebook indicator may be included in at least one of all the downlink assignments whose transmissions map to a single HARQ A/N feedback resource. The meaning of the codepoints in the codebook indicator may be configured by the network, possibly semi-statically. For example, an RRC command may be used to indicate to the WTRU the possible codebooks for each codepoint (where the WTRU may select the appropriate codebook based on the indicator and at least one serving cell). In order to improve the granularity of the codebook, and thus possibly augment the gains of using a dynamic codebook, the number of indicator bits may be increased. For example, 4 indicator bits may be used, and each one of the 16 possible codepoints may map to a plurality of codebooks depending on the serving cell of at least one assignment. Such configuration may require large RRC payload and may not be tenable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">The meaning of a codebook indicator for a codebook may be determined by a combination of the configuration of a subset of codepoints and of at least one serving cell. For example, a WTRU may be configured, possibly by the RRC with a number of sets of carriers (e.g., 4 sets of up to 8 carriers each, or 8 sets of up to 4 carriers each, or 16 sets of up to 2 carriers each, or 32 sets of 1 carrier each). The sets may be pre-determined, or may be explicitly configured by the network. Or the sets may be determined at the WTRU by a network-transmitted indicator of total number of sets, and the WTRU splitting up the configured carriers in a pre-determined or pre-configured manner (e.g., the WTRU may order the carriers by an index such as cell index and then may evenly split the carriers into the configured number of sets). The WTRU may also be configured (possibly semi-statically) with a table mapping the first x (e.g., x=2) bits of the indicator to sets of carriers. The other remaining y bits of the indicator (e.g., y=2) may be determined as a function of the table used for the first x bits, and possibly as a function of at least one serving cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">As an example, the network may indicate to the WTRU that it is to use 4 sets of carriers. Each set of carriers may include up to 8 carriers (e.g., set A={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, set B={9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}, set C={17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24} and set D={25,26,2,28,29,30,31,32}). The WTRU may also be configured (possibly semi-statically) with a table mapping the first 2 bits of the indicator to different sets, for example, as shown in Table 5.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0225">For example, a WTRU configured with Table 5 for the first two bits of the indicator and receiving an assignment from a cell in set A may interpret the first two bits of the indicator from Table 7 and may then interpret the last two bits of the indicator from Table 8.

In this example, if the WTRU decodes an assignment from a cell in set A and is also given the codebook indicator codepoint 0110, then from the fact that it has at least one cell in set A, the meaning of the first two bits (01) may mean set AB and the meaning of the last two bits (10) may mean set BD.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0229">In another example, the sets for every codepoint in Table 5 may be determined by a WTRU as a function of the total number of sets and of a pre-configured or pre-determined formula. For example, codepoint โ00โ may be any single set, whereas codepoint โ01โ may be pairs of two sets (e.g., elect the set that includes at least one cell transmitting the index from: AB or CD or EF or GH or . . . ), codepoint โ10โ may be groups of three sets (e.g., select the set that includes at least one cell transmitting the index from: ABC or DEF or GHI or . . . ), codepoint โ1โ may be groups of four sets (e.g., select the set that includes at least one cell transmitting the index from: ABCD or EFGH or . . . ).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0230">In a further example, the WTRU may make a determination of order of the information bits in the codebook. The WTRU may make a selection of a codebook permutation to optimize decoding performance. In some solutions, the WTRU may determine or select an order (or sequence) for the transmission of HARQ-ACK bits in a subframe. The selection of an appropriate order may enhance decoding performance of HARQ-ACK at the network side by avoiding those HARQ-ACK bits that are known by the network to be NACK (e.g., because they correspond to cells/subframe where PDSCH was not transmitted) that are in consecutive positions of the codebook.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0231">The order may be selected based on an indication from downlink control signaling (such as a codebook indication or a shuffling indication). Alternatively, the order may be determined based on the set of PDSCH received or not received in cells and/or subframes for which HARQ-ACK is to be reported. Further, the order may be dependent on the total size of the HARQ-ACK codebook in a particular subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">In some examples, the WTRU selects one of a number of possible codebooks which may comprise the same number of bits but where the position of each bit corresponds to the ACK or NACK outcome of PDSCH for different cells, subframes and/or transport blocks of a cell. For example, in a first codebook the 23rd bit may correspond to the 1st transport block received from the 12th configured cell, while in a second codebook the 23rd bit may correspond to the 2nd transport block received from the 18th configured cell. The total number of bits of each codebook may be determined based on the number of configured cells, the number of transport blocks that can be received in each cell (depending on the transmission mode) and the subframe configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0233">In some examples, a set of codebooks may be constructed from interleaving or re-ordering bits from a base codebook whose bit order is determined based on pre-defined rules. For example, the base codebook order may be first by order of transport block(s) within a cell, then by order of subframe index (for TDD) second and lastly by order of configured cells. Another possible rule for a base codebook may be first by order of cells, then by order of subframe index (for TDD) and lastly by order of transport blocks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">A specific codebook of the set may correspond to a defined permutation of the bits from the base codebook. A set of permutations may be defined explicitly (e.g., using a Table) for each possible number of codebook sizes. For example, for a codebook size of 64 bits, 2 permutations may be defined as [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; . . . 64] and [1; 33; 2; 34; 3; 35; . . . 32; 64]. Alternatively, a set of permutations may be defined using a formula that may be dependent on the codebook size. The formula may implement a set of pseudo-random permutations, or a set of permutations where each permutation is characterized by a specific difference between consecutive entries, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">The codebook to use in a given subframe may be indicated by downlink control signaling. For example, the codebook may be indicated in a field of a DCI or the set of DCI's containing downlink assignments for the PDSCH for which HARQ-ACK is being reported. In another example, the codebook may be indicated in a field of a DCI used for providing dynamic scheduling information on the transmission of uplink control information on the PUCCH or PUSCH. In case only two codebooks are defined, the field may consist of a single bit, indicating whether the base codebook or the permuted (or โshuffledโ) codebook is to be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236">Alternatively, the codebook to use in a given subframe may be determined such that a certain metric dependent on the set of received PDSCH is optimized. For example, the codebook may be selected such that the maximum number of consecutive bits corresponding to A/N bits of the PDSCH that were not assigned (or not detected to be assigned) is minimized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0237">In some examples, the WTRU may not determine at least one property of the codebook based on the received downlink assignments, such that there would be certainty that it matches with the codebook assumed at the network side. In such a situation the codebook may be considered โundeterminedโ by the WTRU.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">The WTRU may consider that the codebook is undetermined when one of the following occurs: the WTRU did not receive at least one codebook indicator (or codebook size indicator) from the set of downlink assignments; a field in the last received downlink assignment of a pre-defined sequence of cells/carriers and subframes, indicates that further downlink assignments should be received; the WTRU did not receive at least one codebook indicator from the set of downlink assignments for a subframe, where the codebook indicator indicates a set of cells, cell groups and/or transport blocks for this subframe only (possibly, only if a field received in the last subframe where a downlink assignment was received indicates that further downlink assignments may be present in the next subframe(s)); the WTRU did not receive at least one codebook indicator from the set of downlink assignments for the last subframe, where the codebook indicator indicates a set of cells, cell groups and/or transport blocks for all subframes up to and including the subframe where it is received (possibly, only if a field received in a downlink assignment in the same subframe as the last received codebook indicator indicates that further downlink assignments may be present in the next subframe(s)); and/or the DAI-codebook is not consistent with the codebook indicator for at least one portion of the codebook but cannot determine the correct size of the codebook (e.g., if the indicator only indicates a range of sizes).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0239">When the WTRU considers that the codebook is undetermined, the WTRU may transmit HARQ-ACK using a default codebook defined from higher-layer configuration only; transmit an indication that the codebook is undetermined over a specific PUCCH resource and format or possibly over PUSCH if a PUSCH transmission is present (the specific PUCCH resource and/or format may be configured by higher layers, or may be obtained from downlink control signaling (e.g., ARI); the indication may consist of a single bit (e.g., corresponding to NACK) and may be multiplexed with HARQ-ACK of the default codebook, if transmitted); and/or refrain from transmitting any HARQ-ACK in either PUCCH or PUSCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0240">In an example, a transmission of HARQ feedback using multiple feedback groups may be used. In some solutions, the HARQ feedback information that needs to be transmitted in a given uplink subframe may be represented by more than one set of information bits. Each such set may be referred to as a โfeedback groupโ herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0241">A feedback group may be defined based on cells, cell groups and/or subframes. For example, a first feedback group may include HARQ feedback from a first group of cells (e.g., a first group of 8 configured cells), a second feedback group may include HARQ feedback from a second group of cells (e.g., a second group of 8 configured cells), and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0242">In another example, a feedback group may be defined based on at least one of: the total number of information bits that needs to be transmitted in the subframe based on at least semi-static information, and an order of such information bits; a maximum or target number of information bits per feedback group; a maximum or target number of feedback groups; targeting an equal number of bits (or at most a difference of one bit) for each group; and minimizing the number of feedback groups. For example, in case the total number of information bits to be transmitted in a subframe would be 36 and the maximum number of information bits per feedback group would be 10, the feedback groups may consist of 4 groups of 9 bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">In some solutions, the WTRU may encode and transmit information from a feedback group only if at least one PDSCH (or transport block) pertaining to this feedback group was received. In case at least one PDSCH was received for this feedback group, the WTRU may report โNACKโ for cells and/or subframes from which PDSCH was not received and that pertain to this feedback group. Alternatively, the WTRU may report โDTXโ. For example, if a feedback group consists of HARQ feedback for a group of 3 cells with two transport blocks per cell, and PDSCH was received on the second cell only, there may be 6 information bits in the feedback group. The two first and two last information bits (corresponding to the cell from which PDSCH was not received) may indicate โNACKโ while the two middle information bits (corresponding to the cell from which PDSCH was received) may indicate โACKโ if the transport block was decoded successfully and โNACKโ otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">In some solutions, the combinations of subsets of feedback groups may be limited to a set of valid combinations of feedback groups. For example, it may not be possible to transmit exactly one feedback group, such as group #2 only, but some combinations of 2 feedback groups may be possible (such as #1 and #2). The WTRU may transmit information from a feedback group to obtain a valid combination of groups even if no PDSCH pertaining to this feedback group was received. The set of valid combinations may be pre-defined or provided by higher layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">In an example, separate processing of transmitted feedback groups may be used. In a solution, the information bits of each feedback group for which transmission takes place may be separately encoded. For example, if a first feedback group consists of 8 bits and a second feedback group consists of 10 bits, each feedback group may be encoded into 24 coded bits (using, for instance, a Reed-Muller block code). Subsequent modulation, spreading and mapping to physical resources may also be performed separately for each feedback group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">The number of coded bits to use for each feedback group may be a function of the number of bits of each feedback group. Each number of coded bits may be selected among a set of pre-determined values for the number of coded bits (such as 24 or 48). In some solutions, the selected number of coded bits may be selected to be the smallest number among the pre-determined values that achieves up to a maximum coding rate (e.g., ratio of the number of information bits to number of coded bits).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">In an example, joint processing of transmitted feedback groups may be used. In a solution, the information bits of each feedback group for which transmission takes place may be jointly processed and mapped to a single resource. For example, there may be 4 defined feedback groups (labeled #1, #2, #3 and #4) consisting of 8, 12, 10 and 14 bits respectively. In a subframe where feedback groups #1, #3 and #4 are transmitted, a total of B=32 bits (=8+10+14) may be encoded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">The encoding may consist of multiple Reed-Muller block codes where the set of B bits may be equally split into M subsets of up to N information bits and where each subset is independently encoded. The coded bits from the M subsets may then be multiplexed prior to subsequent processing (which possibly includes modulation, spreading and mapping to physical resources). Such type of encoding may improve performance at the receiver by reducing the total number of codeword candidates to be tested. The number M of subsets may be a function of the number B of bits according to a pre-defined function. For example, M may be set to the smallest integer larger than the ratio B/N.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">In another example, the encoding may use other types of codes such as convolutional or turbo encoding. The type of encoding used in a specific subframe may be a function of the number B of bits to be transmitted given the subset of feedback groups for which transmission takes place. For example, in a subframe where the subset of feedback groups results in B&lt;=B0 bits to be transmitted (where B0 could be a fixed value such as 40), the WTRU may use multiple Reed-Muller block codes. In a subframe where B is larger than B0 but smaller or equal than B1 (where B1 could be a fixed value such as 100), the WTRU may use convolutional encoding. In a subframe where B is larger than B <b>1</b> the WTRU may use turbo encoding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">A set of CRC bits may be appended to the set of B bits prior to encoding to improve reliability. The number of CRC bits may depend on the number of bits B, or may depend on the type of encoding applied. For example, zero (0) CRC bits may be appended when B is smaller or equal than B0 bits, or when convolutional or turbo encoding is not used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram of an example selection process for channel coding and inclusion of CRC based on the number of feedback bits to be transmitted. As shown in process <b>500</b>, the WTRU may receive a plurality of transport blocks over a set of a plurality of configured carriers <b>510</b> and generate HARQ-ACK feedback <b>520</b> for the plurality of transport blocks. The inclusion of HARQ-ACK feedback for a carrier may be based on a DAI field present in a downlink assignment for that carrier. Further, supplemental HARQ-ACK feedback bits may be inserted in the HARQ-ACK Codebook, depending on the value of successive DAIs detected by the WTRU. Further, there may be no downlink assignment for a carrier. The HARQ-ACK feedback <b>520</b> may use HARQ-ACK feedback bits <b>525</b>. The WTRU may determine the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits used. The WTRU may compare the number of HARQ-ACK feedback bits, which may be represented by n, to a threshold, such as threshold B <b>530</b>. In an example, if the number of feedback bits is less than or equal to the threshold and therefore nโคB, then Reed-Muller coding may be used <b>540</b>. The set of encoded feedback bits <b>545</b> may result from the Reed-Muller coding. Further, if the number of feedback bits is greater than the threshold and therefore n&gt;B, then the WTRU may insert or append CRC <b>550</b>. Also, if the number of feedback bits is greater than the threshold and therefore n&gt;B, then the WTRU may use convolutional coding <b>560</b>. The set of encoded feedback bits <b>565</b> may result from the convolutional coding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">In some solutions, a finite set of possible number of information bits Bโฒ (or payload sizes) prior to encoding may be allowed to simplify decoding at the receiver. This set may be pre-defined or be determined from the configuration (such as the number of cells, groups of cells, number of transport blocks per cell, and so on). The specific payload size Bโฒ to use in a specific subframe may also be determined dynamically from downlink control signaling. For example, a field in a PDCCH/E-PDCCH may indicate one of a set of possible payload sizes Bโฒ that are pre-defined or configured by higher layers. In another example, a field may indicate one of a set of possible PUCCH formats, each of which corresponding to a payload size depending on the configuration (number of cells, cell groups, and so on). The WTRU may use padding bits when the number B of bits to transmit is lower than an allowed number of information bits Bโฒ. For example, a set of possible payload sizes may be 20 bits, 50 bits and 100 bits. In case the number of bits to be transmitted B, based on a selected subset of feedback groups, would be 60 bits, the WTRU may employ padding bits such that the total payload is 100 bits. The WTRU may also transmit information from additional feedback groups (not initially selected) such that the total number of bits matches a valid payload size.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">The number of coded bits to use may be a function of the total number of bits B or the payload size Bโฒ. It may be selected among a set of pre-determined values for the number of coded bits. In some solutions, the selected number of coded bits may be selected to be the smallest number among the pre-determined values that achieves up to a maximum coding rate (i.e., the ratio of the number of information bits to number of coded bits).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">In an example, a determination of a resource may be used. As described herein, a resource may refer to a set of transmission properties for the transmission of feedback (e.g., over PUCCH). The resource may be identified by an index from which all properties are derived, such as a set of RBs, properties of one or more DM-RS sequence(s), at least one spreading sequence, and the like. In case PUCCH is configured on multiple cells, a resource may include the cell on which PUCCH is to be transmitted, or a set of cells. A sub-resource may refer to a portion of such resourceโfor example, one RB in case the resource consists of a set of more than one RB, or one spreading sequence in case the resource consists of a set of more than one spreading sequence, or one cell in case the resource consists of multiple cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">The WTRU may determine the resource or sub-resource used for the transmission of a feedback group, or a combination of feedback groups, based on downlink control signaling that may be associated with at least one of the PDSCH pertaining to the feedback group. For example, the resource or sub-resource may be indicated by an ARI field in a PDCCH/E-PDCCH scheduling a PDSCH pertaining to the feedback group or to a feedback group part of the combination. In another example, the resource or sub-resource may depend on the cell or cell group from which the PDCCH/E-PDCCH is decoded, or the cell or cell group of a corresponding PDSCH. For example, the cell on which PUCCH is transmitted may be the cell in the same cell group as the cell group from which PDCCH/E-PDCCH is decoded. In another example, signaling such as described herein may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">The resource used for the transmission of a combination of feedback groups may depend on the number of coded bits and/or associated PUCCH format, possibly in combination with an ARI. For example, the WTRU may select a first resource if the number of coded bits is a first number and the received ARI is a first value, and a second resource if the number of coded bits is a second number and the received ARI is a first value. The mapping between the resource and a combination of ARI and number of coded bits may be configured by higher layers. In another example, the WTRU may be configured with a single resource for each PUCCH format or for each possible number of information bits or coded bits. In this case, the WTRU may select the PUCCH resource corresponding to the number of information bits or coded bits that needs to be transmitted (or the PUCCH format that needs to be used).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">In an example, fixed mapping of a feedback group to a sub-resource with possible zero-power transmission may be used. The WTRU may determine the resource or sub-resource used for the transmission of a feedback group (or a combination of feedback groups) based on a combination of downlink control signaling that may be associated with any PDSCH and of an index or order associated with this feedback group. For example, the combination of an index received from an ARI field and of an index to the feedback group may determine the resource or sub-resource for the transmission of this feedback group. For example, a specific value of ARI may indicate a resource spanning two (2) contiguous RBs, and there may be two feedback groups to be transmitted. In this case the sub-resource used for the first feedback group may be the first of the two RBs, and the sub-resource used for the second feedback group may be the second of the two RBs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">In case no transmission needs to take place for a feedback group, the WTRU may transmit with zero power (i.e., may not transmit) on the corresponding sub-resource. In some solutions, the WTRU may transmit on a sub-resource even if no transmission needs to take place for the corresponding feedback group to ensure that the signal transmitted by the WTRU spans contiguous RBs. The WTRU may perform such transmission, for instance, if the sub-resource is over a RB and non-zero-power transmission takes place on both adjacent RBs. In this case, the WTRU may encode the information for the corresponding feedback group according to a pre-determined rule, for instance as if the WTRU reports โNACKโ or โDTXโ for all corresponding transmissions of the feedback group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">In an example, flexible mapping of a feedback group to a resource with a possible indication may be used. The resource used for the transmission of a specific feedback group may also be determined based on the subset (or combination) of feedback groups that are transmitted in the subframe. This solution may ensure that the combination of resources used for the transmission of all feedback groups results in a signal with desirable properties, such as a signal which spans contiguous resource blocks. For example, there may be 4 defined feedback groups (labeled #1, #2, #3 and #4) and the value received from downlink control signaling (e.g., ARI) may determine a set of resources spanning 4 contiguous resource blocks (labeled #a, #b, #c and #d). When all 4 feedback groups are transmitted, groups #1, #2, #3 and #4 may be mapped to resources #a, #b, #c and #d respectively. On the other hand, if only groups #1, #2 and #4 are transmitted, these groups may be mapped to resources #a, #b and #c such that only contiguous resource blocks are used. When there is possible ambiguity for the network on the identity of the feedback group transmitted on a given resource, the WTRU may include an indication of the feedback group in at least this resource, such as a bit indicating whether the feedback group transmitted over resource #c is #3 or #4. Such indication may be jointly or separately encoded with the information bits from the feedback group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">In an example, a transmission of a feedback group indicator may be performed. In some solutions, the WTRU may transmit at least one indication of the subset of feedback groups transmitted in a subframe to facilitate decoding at the receiver. Such indication may be referred to as โfeedback group indicationโ (FGI) in the following. A value of FGI may indicate one of a set of valid possible combinations of feedback groups, including a codebook size. The mapping between each possible FGI value and a combination of feedback groups may be provided by higher layers or pre-defined. The mapping may be dependent on the total number of information bits B, and/or the payload size Bโฒ for the transmission in the subframe. In some solutions the FGI may consist of an indication of a transmission format for PUCCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">In a solution, a FGI may be processed separately from other feedback bits and mapped to specific physical resources. For example, FGI bits may be encoded, modulated, spread and mapped to specific sub-carriers and/or slots of a resource block. This solution has the benefit that multiple possible numbers of information bits (B) may be supported without excessively increasing complexity at the receiver, since the receiver can first determine the number of information bits by first decoding the FGI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">In a solution, FGI bits may be concatenated to other feedback bits (and possibly interleaved) prior to subsequent joint processing (possibly including at least one of coding, modulation, spreading and mapping to physical resources). This solution may be particularly beneficial if the possible set of payload size(s) is known at the receiver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">In a solution, FGI bits may be used to mask a CRC appended to the set of feedback bits. This solution has the benefit of providing increased reliability through error detection while at the same time reducing the possibility of error in the feedback transmission due to missed PDSCH assignments or falsely detected PDSCH assignments. At the receiver, the network may attempt decoding assuming a given payload size (or a set of possible payload sizes) and checking if the CRC masked by the expected FGI value given the transmitted PDSCH is valid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">In a solution, the resource used for the transmission of feedback may be a function of the FGI, possibly in combination with information received from downlink control signaling (such as ARI) and higher layers. This solution provides an implicit FGI signaling mechanism since the receiver can determine the FGI from the resource from which the feedback information could be decoded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">In an example, power setting may be used. The WTRU may determine the power to apply for a transmission containing feedback information (including a transmission only containing feedback information, such as a PUCCH transmission) based on at least a path loss estimate PL<sub>c</sub>, a configured maximum power P<sub>CMAX,c</sub>, parameters provided by higher layers such as P<sub>0_PUCCH</sub>, Delta<sub>F_PUCCH </sub>and Delta<sub>TxD</sub>, a parameter dependent on received TPC commands g(i) and/or a power offset h that is a function of parameters that may change on a subframe basis as described in the following.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">In some solutions, a power offset may be a function of at least one of: a total number of information bits B based on the subset of feedback groups selected for transmission, possibly including feedback groups transmitted to ensure transmission over contiguous RBs; the largest number of information bits of a feedback group among a subset selected for transmission; a number of transport blocks based on received PDSCH; a number of transport blocks based on received PDSCH in each feedback group, or the maximum thereof among feedback groups; a maximum number of transport blocks that may be received based on configuration; a payload size Bโฒ for the transmission of feedback information in the subframe; the type of coding employed in the subframe (Reed-Muller, convolutional, turbo); whether CRC and/or FGI is appended to the set of transmitted feedback bits; a number of subsets M of bits independently encoded prior to multiplexing; and a number of bits transmitted in each subset of independently encoded bits, or the maximum thereof among all subsets, where the number of bits may or may not be restricted to those corresponding to received PDSCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0267">The power offset function may depend on different parameters depending on the type of coding that is being utilized, or more generally depending on the transmission format being used. For example, in case coding is based on a block code such as Reed-Muller, the power offset may be a function of the number of transport blocks based on received PDSCH in the subframe, or perhaps the maximum number thereof among independently encoded subsets. On the other hand, in case coding is based on a convolutional code or a turbo code, the power offset may be a function of the maximum number of transport blocks that may be received based on configuration. This solution may be appropriate since, in case block coding based on small codebooks is used, the receiver can utilize the knowledge of information bits that are known to be set to NACK (based on scheduled PDSCH) to improve the likelihood of correct detection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">In legacy systems, the number of coded modulation symbols per layer Qโฒ for HARQ-ACK may be set to a value proportional to the number of information bits for HARQ-ACK, the number of sub-carriers of the initial PUSCH transmission and a factor ฮฒ<sup>HARQ-ACK</sup>, but not larger than 4 times the number of sub-carriers of the PUSCH. Coding, interleaving, multiplexing and mapping of higher layer data is performed independently of the presence or absence of HARQ-ACK. When HARQ-ACK is transmitted, its coded modulation symbols may overwrite the symbols used for higher layer data in certain resource elements, resulting in modest performance degradation for higher layer data due to puncturing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">When a large number of HARQ-ACK bits need to be transmitted, it may be possible that the limit of 4 times the number of sub-carriers of the PUSCH becomes insufficient, for example in power-limited scenarios where it may not be possible to have very large bandwidth for PUSCH. In some solutions, the limit of 4 times the number of sub-carriers of the PUSCH allocation may be lifted such that modulation symbols for HARQ-ACK may be mapped to additional resources (for example, time symbols) on PUSCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0270">In some solutions, to prevent performance degradation due to excessive puncturing, the WTRU may process higher layer data taking into account that at least some resource elements are not available for higher data due to the transmission of HARQ-ACK, or of a minimum number of bits thereof. More specifically, the following parameters or procedures may be affected. The transport block size of the higher layer data may be affected. For example, the calculation of the transport block size as a function of the signaled modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and of the size of the PUSCH allocation (in resource blocks) may take into account a number of time symbols that are not available due to the transmission of HARQ-ACK. For example, in case the number of modulation symbols required for HARQ-ACK exceeds 4 times the number of subcarriers of the PUSCH, the transport block size may be scaled down by a factor (12โ4)/12=2/3 to take into account the fact that at least โ of the time symbols (not used for DM-RS) are not available for higher-layer data when HARQ-ACK may need to be transmitted. The procedure of mapping to REs for PUSCH may be changed such that a subset or all of the REs on which symbols for HARQ-ACK are mapped are excluded from the set of REs on which symbols for PUSCH may be mapped. For example, the REs on the 4 first time symbols on which symbols for HARQ-ACK may be mapped may be excluded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0271">The WTRU may determine that higher layer data is processed according to the above based on at least one of the following conditions. The WTRU may determine higher layer data is processed according to explicit signaling from a received PDCCH/E-PDCCH. The received PDCCH/E-PDCCH may be the PDCCH/E-PDCCH containing the uplink grant for the concerned PUSCH transmission, or another received PDCCH/E-PDCCH possibly indicating information about a set of PDSCH and/or PUSCH transmissions. A new or existing field of a DCI may be used for this purpose. This solution has the benefit of robustness against the loss of downlink assignments. The WTRU may determine higher layer data is processed according the number of HARQ-ACK information bits to be transmitted in the PUSCH. The WTRU may also determine higher layer data is processed according to whether the number of symbols for HARQ-ACK exceeds a threshold, such as 4 times the number of sub-carriers of the PUSCH transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0272">In an example, a WTRU may select an uplink resource for UCI transmission. In examples, the WTRU may determine a resource for transmission UCI in the following situations: possibly multiple types of physical channels available for transmission of UCI, e.g., both PUSCH and PUCCH; possibly multiple types of UCI available for transmission, e.g., HARQ-ACK, CSI or SR; and/or possibly some cells on carriers operating in an unlicensed frequency band (for example, LAA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0273">In an example, a WTRU may split UCI across PUSCH and PUCCH. In one example method, the WTRU may determine that a first amount of UCI may be applicable to a first type of transmission, e.g., PUCCH while a second amount may be applicable to a second type of transmission (e.g., PUSCH). Possibly, such method may be applicable per group of cells e.g., for a PUCCH group or for a cell group (e.g., a CG).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0274">For example, the first amount of UCI may correspond to a specific type of UCI e.g., HARQ A/N bits. For example, the second amount of UCI may correspond to other type of UCI e.g., CSI such as CQI, precoding matrix indicators (PMI) or RI bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">In a subframe in which the WTRU is expected to transmit UCI, the WTRU may determine whether or not at least one PUSCH resource is available for the concerned subframe. The WTRU may also determine whether or not it is configured for simultaneous transmissions on PUCCH and PUSCH for a given serving cell or group of cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0276">If the WTRU may perform transmission simultaneously on PUSCH and PUCCH (e.g., resources are available and the WTRU is configured for such operation), the WTRU may determine that a first type of the UCI e.g., HARQ-ACK may be transmitted on a PUSCH transmission while the second type of UCI e.g., the CSI may be transmitted on a PUCCH transmission, or vice-versa. The WTRU may also determine that a first portion of a given type of UCI (e.g., HARQ-ACK) may be transmitted on a PUSCH transmission while a second portion may be transmitted on a PUCCH transmission. according to at least one of the following: reception of downlink control signaling e.g., using similar methods as described herein (such signaling may indicate that UCI shall be split using the PUSCH and PUCCH transmissions); reception of downlink control signaling, e.g., using similar methods as described herein (such signaling may include a UCI request where the indicated UCI may be routed to a first specific resource and/or transmission (e.g., PUCCH, or possibly the resource indicated by dynamic scheduling, e.g., according to that described herein) while other feedback may be routed to a second specific resource and/or transmission (e.g., PUSCH, or possibly dropped), or vice-versa); the PUSCH allocation (e.g., the size of the grant) is smaller (or equal to) a (possibly configurable) threshold; the resulting ratio of the number of (non-UCI) payload bits and the number of UCI bits for the concerned PUSCH transmission is equal or higher than a specific threshold for the concerned amount of UCI bits; the resulting ratio of the number (non-UCI) payload bits and the number of HARQ A/N bits for the concerned PUSCH transmission is equal or higher than a specific threshold; the number of modulation symbols Qโฒ per layer for a UCI type and the concerned PUSCH transmission would exceed a threshold (for example, the threshold may be 4 times the number of sub-carriers of the PUSCH in case of HARQ-ACK).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0278" num="0277">When at least one of the above conditions is met, the WTRU may determine the portion of UCI bits transmitted on each channel according to at least one of the following. The WTRU may determine the portion according to information including a first type of UCI (e.g., the HARQ ACK bits) in the concerned PUSCH transmission up to the required number of symbols for the concerned UCI. The WTRU may transmit remaining UCI (e.g., of the second type e.g., the CSI bits) using a transmission on PUCCH. Also, the WTRU may determine the portion according to information including a number of UCI bits in the PUSCH transmission based on the PUSCH allocation (e.g., the size of the grant); the remaining UCI bits may then be transmitted using a different transmission. For example, the WTRU may determine a number of HARQ-ACK bits which would results in a number of modulation symbols Qโฒ per layer no larger than a threshold that may be dependent on the size of the PUSCH, such as N times the number of sub-carriers. In another example, the number of UCI bits in the PUSCH transmission (possibly of a given type) may be set to zero and all bits may be transmitted over a different transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0279" num="0278">In an example, a WTRU may split UCI across multiple PUCCHs. In one example method, the WTRU may determine that a first amount of UCI may be applicable to a first type of transmission, e.g., PUCCH on the resources of a first serving cell (e.g., the PCell) while a second amount may be applicable to a first type of transmission (e.g., PUCCH) on the resources of a second serving cell (e.g., SCell configured with PUCCH). Possibly, such method may be applicable per group of cells e.g., for a PUCCH group or for a cell group (e.g., a CG), or across PUCCH groups or CGs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0279">For example, the first amount of UCI may correspond to a specific type of UCI e.g., HARQ A/N bits. For example, the second amount of UCI may correspond to other type of UCI e.g., CSI such as CQI, PMI or RI bits. In such case, the WTRU may determine the cell with PUCCH on which to transmit a first UCI type according to at least one of the following: reception of downlink control signaling e.g., using similar methods as described herein (such signaling may indicate that UCI shall be split using the different PUCCH transmissions and that the first type of UCI is to be transmitted using resources of a specific cell (e.g., the cell on which the control signaling has been received)); reception of downlink control signaling, e.g., using similar methods as described herein (such signaling may include a UCI request where the indicated UCI may be routed to a first specific PUCCH resource and/or PUCCH transmission (e.g., possibly the resource indicated by dynamic scheduling, e.g., as described herein) while other feedback may be routed to a second specific PUCCH resource and/or PUCCH transmission (e.g., according to other methods to determine a PUCCH resource), or vice-versa); the PCell always (or the PSCell if for the MCG) or, alternatively, the SCell always; the WTRU selects the PUCCH with sufficient capacity (and/or with the best expected transmission performance); the WTRU selects the cell for which it has the lowest pathloss estimate; the WTRU selects the cell for which it also has resources for a PUSCH transmission (only if simultaneous PUSCH+PUCCH transmission is configured for the WTRU); and according to a semi-static configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0280">In an example, a WTRU may select a single PUCCH when multiple are available. In a possible example, a WTRU may select a single PUCCH when multiple are available only if the WTRU may perform transmission on different PUCCHs simultaneously. In another example, the WTRU may select the serving cell with the PUCCH according to at least one of the following: the WTRU selects the cell based on received control signaling similar to the above; reception of downlink control signaling, e.g., using similar methods as described herein, (such signaling may include dynamic scheduling for UCI transmission, e.g., according to that described herein); the WTRU selects the PUCCH with sufficient capacity (and/or with the best expected transmission performance); the WTRU selects the cell for which it has the lowest pathloss estimate; and according to a semi-static configuration. In several examples, the WTRU may only consider cells in the activated state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0282" num="0281">The WTRU may be configured with a plurality of PUCCH resources on at least one SCell. Possibly, the WTRU may be configured with a restriction on the number of simultaneous uplink transmissions it may perform. Such restriction may be for all transmissions of the WTRU (e.g., including all transmission for all configured cells or CGs), for all transmission of a given CG of the WTRU's configuration, for all physical transmissions of a specific type (e.g., only for PUCCH transmission) and/or for all transmission of a certain type (e.g., only for UCI transmissions).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0282">In such case, the WTRU may determine what uplink transmission it may use for the transmission of UCI according to solutions described herein. In an example, a WTRU may determine uplink routing as a function of restrictions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0283">In one method, the WTRU may determine how to route transmission of UCI as a function of restrictions applicable to the number of simultaneous uplink transmissions (and, possibly, only for simultaneous PUCCH transmissions). For example, the WTRU may determine that transmission of at least some of the UCI should be performed in a given subframe according (and possibly for a given CG) to at least one of the following: the WTRU may perform at most a number X of transmission on PUCCH (for example, the WTRU may determine the applicable X number of serving cells with PUCCH resources according to at least one of the following: in decreasing order of required transmit power for the PUCCH transmission; in increasing order of the estimated pathloss reference for the corresponding carrier; and in decreasing order of the PUCCH capacity); and the WTRU may perform at most a number X of transmission on PUCCH for a given group of cells (e.g., at most one PUCCH transmission per PUCCH group if a group may be configured using more than one PUCCH resource. The WTRU may use similar methods as for the previous case possibly applied per group of cells).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0284">The WTRU may be configured with at least one serving cell using a carrier that is operating in an unlicensed frequency band (hereafter โLAA-Cellโ). The following solutions describe how the WTRU may determine what uplink resource to use for the transmission of at least some (or all) of the generated UCI as a function of the type of access, type of band (e.g., licensed or unlicensed), the type of UCI itself (e.g., HARQ A/N, CQI, PMI/RI or the like) and/or received control signaling (e.g., similar as the signaling aspects described herein).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0285">In an example, such as an example method, the WTRU may route UCI on resources of a serving cell of a licensed band. The WTRU may determine that the applicable UCI may be transmitted using uplink resources of a serving cell of the WTRU's configuration associated with a carrier in a frequency band used for licensed operation. The WTRU may make such determination independently of whether or not the WTRU has an uplink transmission scheduled for uplink resources of a LAA-Cell. Alternatively, the WTRU may transmit at least part of the UCI on a PUSCH transmission of the LAA-Cell (if available) such that the WTRU may make such routing determination only when there is no PUSCH transmission for the LAA-Cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0287" num="0286">Such applicable UCI may be determined according to at least one of the following. The WTRU may not transmit any UCI using resources of a LAA-Cell. For example, the WTRU may route any UCI related to the LAA operation to a transmission associated with a carrier in the licensed domain independently of whether or not the WTRU has a resource for a PUSCH transmission for a LAA-Cell. In another example, the WTRU may transmit only UCI associated with the LAA-Cell using resources of a LAA-Cell when available, otherwise the UCI may be routed to a resource of a cell in the licensed domain. For example, the WTRU may route only UCI related to a LAA-Cell to a transmission on a resource of a LAA-Cell, if such transmission is available (e.g., a PUSCH transmission is scheduled). In a further example, the WTRU may perform any of the above, but only for the transmission of a specific type of UCI. For example, the WTRU may transmit (the more time-sensitive) HARQ A/N feedback related to the operation in the unlicensed domain only using resources of a cell in the licensed domain; in such case, other type of UCI may be transmitted using a PUSCH transmission in the unlicensed domain (if available) or using resources in the licensed domain (otherwise).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0287">In a further example, applicable UCI may be determined by reception of downlink control signaling, e.g., using similar methods as described herein. Such signaling may include a UCI request where the indicated UCI may be generated based on the status of the HARQ processes at the time of the reception of the control signaling, e.g., the UCI may be associated with the most recent state of the respective HARQ process(es) and not necessarily associated with transmissions received simultaneously and/or during the time interval associated with the reception of such control signaling. In addition, the WTRU may receive UCI scheduling information similar to that described herein for UCI feedback associated with such a cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0288">Methods are described herein for determination of uplink resources for UCI transmission. Methods are described herein such that the WTRU may determine, at least in part, what resource to use for at least some UCI based in downlink control information, for example, dynamic scheduling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0289">Methods are described herein for downlink control signaling with DCI(UCI). In an example, the WTRU may receive dynamic scheduling information for the UCI. Such dynamic scheduling information may be received on PDCCH using DCI. Such scheduling information may be included in an existing DCI format (e.g., using one of more indices to refer to specific control information) or in a dedicated DCI format. Such DCI may be further referred to herein as DCI(UCI).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0290">Dynamic scheduling may include UCI request and/or resource allocation. Such DCI(UCI) may indicate at least one of: a UCI request (e.g., by which the WTRU may determine what UCI to include in a given transmission); and UCI scheduling information (e.g., by which the WTRU may determine what uplink resource and how to transmit applicable UCI using the dynamically scheduled information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0291">In an example, DCI(UCI) may indicate a UCI request. A UCI request may be used to determine what UCI to generate for transmission. In an example, the WTRU may determine, as a function of the UCI request, what feedback to include in a UCI transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0292">Further, a UCI request may be used to create a smaller UCI payload. In an example, the UCI request may be used to prioritize transmission of the requested UCI and possibly to drop (or down-prioritize) other UCI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0294" num="0293">Also, a UCI request may be used to route a subset of UCI to a specific resource, scheduled or not. In an example, the UCI request may be used to assign the indicated UCI to a specific uplink resource, e.g., such as a resource indicated by the UCI scheduling information (if applicable, see examples herein).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0295" num="0294">A UCI request contents may include at least one of the following information: a type of UCI, a serving cell identity, a downlink HARQ process identity, a UCI size reduction method, a feedback group, and aperiodic requests. For example, the UCI request contents may include a type of UCI. The WTRU may determine what type of UCI in shall include in the UCI transmission, e.g., HARQ A/N only or also in combination with any applicable CSI. For example, the type may be implicit to the format of the DCI(UCI), e.g., based on the field arrangement in the DCI(UCI) format. For example, the DCI(UCI) format may include one field for a CSI request and one field for a HARQ A/N request (e.g., as separate bitmap fields).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0296" num="0295">In another example, the UCI request contents may include a serving cell identity. The WTRU may determine the identity of the serving cell(s) for which the request is applicable, e.g., the request for the concerned UCI may be applicable to all configured (and/or also possibly active) serving cells of the WTRU's configuration, or to a subset thereof, e.g., as indicated by the signaled identities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0296">For example, the identities may correspond to the serving cell identity configured by higher layer, to cells that are part of a group of cells (e.g., based on a configured grouping, based on grouping for PUCCH transmissionโPUCCH group, based on Timing Advance Grouping (TAGs), only for a special cellโe.g., PCell of MCG or PSCell of SCG, or the like). Such identity may be based on the Carrier Field Indicator (CFI) used for cross-carrier scheduling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0298" num="0297">In an example, the UCI request may indicate CSI only for subset of cells on a dynamically scheduled PUSCH, HARQ per legacy. For example, the UCI request may indicate that only CSI for a subset of serving cells is being requested e.g., for serving cell IDs <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>. Such indication may be received using a bitmap arrangement similar to the example shown in Table 9. The WTRU may then include CSI for those cells with the applicable UCI for the uplink transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0299" num="0298">The WTRU may perform such uplink transmission, e.g., using dynamic scheduling (e.g., possibly on PUSCH). In an example, such UCI request signaling for CSI may be only applicable to periodic CSI (e.g., periodic CQI reporting) or, preferably, for any type of CSI including aperiodic CSI. Table 9 is an example of a bitmap arrangement for a CSI feedback request.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0303" num="0302">In an example, HARQ feedback may be included only for specific processes for all applicable cells. For example, the WTRU may determine from the reception of a UCI request that it shall include HARQ feedback for processes x1, x3 and x7 for serving cell ID=0, x0 and x4 for serving cell ID=1 and x0, x2, x3, x4 and x5 for serving cell ID=3 as shown in Table 10. In such case, the WTRU may generate 10 bits of HARQ feedback for transmission on an uplink resource. The WTRU may then determine the applicable coding and the applicable uplink resource using any of the methods described herein or using legacy methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0303">In an example, an overload may indicate the presence or absence of dynamic scheduling information for the processes. In an example, the HARQ feedback may correspond only to transmissions for which the WTRU has scheduling information (e.g., dynamic and/or configured/semi-persistent) such that the request may also indicate that the concerned processes have been scheduled. In such case, the WTRU may perform a verification to determine if (and possibly also for what serving cell) the WTRU has failed to successfully decode one (or more) PDCCH(s) for the concerned interval (e.g., โmissed PDCCHโ), if it has incorrectly decoded one (or more) PDCCH(s) successfully (e.g., โfalse positiveโ).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0304">In an example, a special case may be used for configured DL assignments. For a HARQ process configured with a downlink assignment for the concerned interval, the WTRU may determine that the UCI is always requested: in this case, the absence of a request for the concerned HARQ process may indicate that no dynamic scheduling was associated with the process while the presence of such request may additionally indicate that dynamic scheduling was associated with the process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0306" num="0305">In an example, an overload may be used as PDCCH decoding help. In an example, the WTRU may determine that UCI request corresponds to all cells of the WTRU's configuration (and possible, activated cells only) and/or for all such cells associated with such control signaling, such that the WTRU may use the UCI-request information to perform decoding attempts only for cells for which HARQ feedback is requested.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0307" num="0306">In another example, a HARQ feedback request may be independent of DL scheduling, e.g., state of process. In an example, the HARQ feedback may correspond to the state of the concerned HARQ process(es) independently of the scheduling activity for the concerned process(es). In such case, no further verification may be performed by the WTRU regarding detection of missed PDCCH(s) and/or the possible occurrence of any false positive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0308" num="0307">In a further example, the UCI request contents may include a UCI size reduction method. In an example, the WTRU may additionally determine what size reduction method to apply to the requested UCI, e.g., any other method described herein. For example, the UCI request may indicate that for cells for which HARQ A/N is to be reported, the WTRU should use bundling for HARQ A/N for cells configured with spatial multiplexing (e.g., multiple transport blocks per interval).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0309" num="0308">In yet a further example, the UCI request contents may include a feedback group, for example, as described herein. In an example, the WTRU may determine the set of PDSCH transmissions and/or HARQ processes for which it should provide feedback based on a dynamic feedback request field. Different codepoints of the field may map to different feedback groups (e.g., sets of PDSCH transmissions and/or HARQ processes) and these codepoint mappings may be configured semi-statically, possibly by RRC configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0310" num="0309">In yet another example, the UCI request contents may include aperiodic requests. In an example, the WTRU may additionally determine from the UCI request that aperiodic uplink feedback should be sent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0311" num="0310">The WTRU may implement additional behavior for HARQ A/N generated from the reception of one or more DCI(s) that activate or deactivate a configured downlink assignment and/or a configured uplink grant. In one method, the WTRU may always generate HARQ A/N report for such signaling independently of the UCI request. In one method, the WTRU may generate HARQ A/N report for such signaling if the serving cell on which the WTRU received the control signaling is included in the UCI request (e.g., let the network coordinate transmission of semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) commands and UCI requests coherently).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0312" num="0311">In another example, the WTRU may determine that the UCI indicated, e.g., using methods described herein, is not to be generated and/or not to be included in an uplink transmission. In other words, such signaling may be used to subdue some (or all) of the applicable UCI instead of being considered as a UCI request.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0313" num="0312">In an example, DCI(UCI) may indicate scheduling information for UCI. A UCI request may be used to determine what UCI to generate for transmission. In an example, the WTRU may determine, as a function of the UCI scheduling information, some or all the properties of the uplink transmission for at least some of the applicable UCI, e.g., possibly including the applicable transmission resources and/or the applicable transmission format (including one of modulation, (starting) resource block(s), number of resource blocks, spreading, spatial multiplexing, possibly timing and/or timing offset, one or more DM-RS sequence, or the like).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0314" num="0313">UCI scheduling information may include at least one of the following information: a physical channel type (PUCCH, PUSCH), physical channel type identity (e.g., PUCCH on PCell, PUCCH on SCell), serving cell identity, PUCCH/UCI feedback group identity, PUCCH format, PUSCH transmission parameters, PUCCH transmission parameters, channel coding, payload size, TPC command (power control information), and CSI request. Further, different combinations of the above scheduling information are possible, such as depending on whether the indicated resource is a PUSCH resource or a PUCCH resource.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0315" num="0314">UCI scheduling information may include a physical channel type (PUCCH, PUSCH). The WTRU may determine what type of physical channel to use for the transmission of UCI as a function of an indication inside the scheduling information. When no such indication is present, the WTRU may determine to use the PUCCH. When PUSCH is scheduled for transmission of UCI (possibly only), the WTRU may not perform any WTRU-autonomous retransmission for the concerned HARQ process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0316" num="0315">UCI scheduling information may include a physical channel type identity (e.g., PUCCH on PCell, PUCCH on SCell). The WTRU may determine what physical channel of a certain type (e.g., PUCCH) to use for the transmission of UCI as a function of an indication (e.g., PUCCH on PCell, PUCCH on SCell) inside the scheduling information. When no such indication is present, the WTRU may determine to use a default PUCCH channel e.g., PUCCH on PCell. This may be applicable also to the transmission of feedback on PUSCH, e.g., when the PUSCH of the serving cell configured with PUCCH may be scheduled for UCI transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0317" num="0316">UCI scheduling information may include a serving cell identity. The WTRU may determine the identity of the serving cell corresponding to the physical uplink resource. Serving cell identity, or CFI, may be used for PUSCH scheduling for UCI. For example, the WTRU may receive a value that corresponds to an identity of a serving cell. Such identity may be based on the serving cell identity used by other layers, e.g., servCell-ID in RRC. Alternatively, such identity may be based on a configured value for cross-carrier scheduling, e.g., a CFI. In an example, this may be applicable when the scheduling information may indicate resources on a PUSCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0318" num="0317">UCI scheduling information may include a PUCCH/UCI feedback group identity. The WTRU may determine the identity of the uplink feedback channel corresponding to the physical uplink resource as a function of an identity of a group of cells associated with a single uplink channel (e.g., a PUCCH group). This may be applicable also to the transmission of feedback on PUSCH, e.g., when the PUSCH of the serving cell configured with PUCCH may be scheduled for UCI transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0318">UCI scheduling information may include a PUCCH format. The WTRU may receive an indication of the PUCCH format to use inside the scheduling information, e.g., PUCCH format 3 or other formats.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0319">UCI scheduling information may include PUSCH transmission parameters. The WTRU may receive similar information as for a grant for an uplink PUSCH transmission for the transmission on UCI feedback. In an example, such grant may be only for transmission of UCI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0321" num="0320">UCI scheduling information may include PUCCH transmission parameters. The PUCCH transmission parameters may be similar to the parameters that the WTRU determines for existing PUCCH formats, e.g., PRB allocation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0322" num="0321">UCI scheduling information may include channel coding. The WTRU may determine whether it should transmit one or a specific combination of UCI type as a function of the indicated channel coding method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0323" num="0322">UCI scheduling information may include payload size. The WTRU may determine the amount of UCI to include in the uplink transmission as a function of the indicated payload size for the scheduled UCI transmission. In an example, if such information is absent, the WTRU may use any other methods such as those described herein and include the UCI request as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0324" num="0323">UCI scheduling information may include a TPC command (power control information). This TPC command may be similar to the legacy TPC command but may be interpreted as a function of whether the scheduling information is for PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0325" num="0324">UCI scheduling information may include a CSI request. This CSI request may be similar to the legacy request. In an example, such a CSI request may override other CSI reporting for the concerned time interval (e.g., periodic CSI).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0326" num="0325">Further, different combinations of the above scheduling information is possible as part of PUCCH or PUSCH. For example, the WTRU may receive a DCI(UCI) that schedules transmission of UCI on PUSCH which DCI(UCI) may include the type of physical channel (i.e., PUSCH), the identity of the serving cell for the uplink transmission (e.g., serving cell 0-PCell), PUSCH transmission parameters, e.g., including a resource block assignment, a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and a TPC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0327" num="0326">For example, the WTRU may receive a DCI(UCI) that schedules transmission of UCI on PUCCH of the PCell which DCI(UCI) may include the type of physical channel (i.e., PUCCH), PUCCH transmission parameters, e.g., including a resource block assignment, and a TPC. Additionally, the DCI(UCI) may include a UCI request such that the WTRU determines what UCI to include in such transmissions. The WTRU may determine that the PUCCH of the PCell is being scheduled based on the identity of the cell on which the PDCCH for the DCI(UCI) was received.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0328" num="0327">In an example, DCI for UCI, or DCI(UCI) may be used. In an example, a dedicated DCI may be used. In another example, extensions to existing DCIs may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0328">In an example, DCI(UCI) may indicate any of the information described herein using a dedicated format that includes one (or more) field(s) for any of the aspects described herein or using one (or more) ind(ex/ices) inside the DCI(UCI) format.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0330" num="0329">In an example, no HARQ A/N may be generated by DCI, if transient. In an example, the WTRU may receive DCI(UCI). The WTRU may not generate and/or include any HARQ A/N to report feedback for the DCI itself. The WTRU may not do so if such DCI(UCI) is applied per subframe and/or per TTI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0331" num="0330">In another example, HARQ A/N may be generated by DCI, if configured/activated over a period of time or deactivated. In an example, the WTRU may receive DCI(UCI). The WTRU may determine that the DCI(UCI) configures UCI reporting for a period longer than one subframe (or longer than one TTI), e.g., until it receives another DCI(UCI) that either modify or deactivate the configured UCI reporting. In such case, the WTRU may generate and/or include HARQ A/N feedback for such DCI(UCI), e.g., to report feedback for the reception of the DCI(UCI) itself. In one method, the WTRU may use the UCI reporting method(s) applicable prior to the reception of such DCI(UCI) for HARQ A/N report of the concerned DCI(UCI). The WTRU may start using the new configuration in subframe n+x+1 when such DCI(UCI) is received in subframe n. For example, x may be equal to 4 and the WTRU may apply the new configuration starting from the subframe following the transmission of the HARQ A/N report for the concerned DCI(UCI). In one example, the WTRU may use the new configuration indicated in the DCI(UCI) itself for HARQ A/N reporting of the concerned DCI(UCI). The WTRU may start using the new configuration in subframe n+x when such DCI(UCI) is received in subframe n. For example, x may be equal to 4 and the WTRU may apply the new configuration starting from the subframe of the transmission of the HARQ A/N report for the concerned DCI(UCI).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0332" num="0331">In an example, UCI not requested for an indicated type may be subdued/dropped. In an example, the WTRU may determine that it may not transmit any UCI that is not part of a UCI request, when such request is received.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0333" num="0332">In another example, other methods may be used if UCI not part of any UCI request. In an example, the WTRU may determine that it may transmit any UCI that is not part of a UCI request, when such request is received, using other methods, e.g., such as legacy methods. For example, when UCI scheduling indicates a transmission on PUCCH, the WTRU may route remaining UCI to a PUSCH transmission (if such is available) according to legacy methods. For example, when UCI scheduling indicates a transmission on PUSCH, the WTRU may route remaining UCI to a PUCCH transmission according to legacy methods, if both PUSCH and PUCCH are simultaneous and possibly also for the same serving cell, only if the WTRU is configured for simultaneous PUSCH/PUCCH transmissions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0334" num="0333">In another example, the WTRU may determine that it may not transmit any UCI unless it receives a DCI(UCI) that includes a UCI request. In an example, the WTRU may include UCI to any PUSCH transmission, e.g., according to legacy methods even when it does not receive a DCI(UCI) that includes a DCI request.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0335" num="0334">In another example, a UCI type not part of the request may be either subdued/dropped or legacy transmission methods may be used. In an example, the WTRU may determine that it may not transmit any UCI that is not part of a UCI request, when such request is received.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0336" num="0335">In another example, a DCI(UCI) request may be for HARQ feedback only. For example, the WTRU may receive a DCI(UCI) that requests HARQ A/N feedback for specific HARQ processes and/or for specific serving cells only.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0337" num="0336">In another example, an alternative determination may be made. In some examples, any of the information described herein for the UCI request or for the UCI scheduling information may be implicitly derived by other means. For example, a specific RNTI may be assigned to indicate the type of the DCI (e.g., DCI formats 0, 1, etc. compared with DCI format DCI(UCI)), to indicate the type of UCI request, to indicate the type of physical channel (e.g., PUSCH vs PUCCH), to indicate the identity of the cell, or the like. Similarly, specific regions of the PDCCH Search Space or specific DCI Aggregation Levels or specific size for the CRC of the DCI may be assigned and may be used to determine similar information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0338" num="0337">In another example, a semi-persistent allocation may be made. Scheduling information may be semi-persistently configured. In such case, the configured information may be used as the default scheduling information. In such case, the WTRU may receive a DCI(UCI) that overrides configured scheduling information for the applicable serving cell. In such case, the WTRU may refrain from performing any transmission using a configured allocation when no UCI is generated and/or available for transmission for the concerned time interval. Alternatively, for HARQ feedback the WTRU may report the value of the HARQ feedback following the last reception for the concerned processes, while for CSI feedback the WTRU may consider this as a periodic reporting configuration (e.g., if an aperiodic CSI configuration is also present).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0339" num="0338">In another example, the selection of channel coding may be as a function of dynamic scheduling information. The WTRU may select the appropriate channel coding as a function of the UCI requested (e.g., channel coding may be selected as per any of the methods described herein or using legacy methods for a different combination of at least one of HARQ A/N, periodic CSI, CQI/PMI and scheduling request) and/or the scheduling parameters for UCI (e.g., whether it is on PUCCH or on PUSCH (if applicable)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0340" num="0339">In another example, the scheduling information for UCI may indicate a resource corresponding to a PUCCH transmission even if the WTRU is expected to perform a transmission on PUSCH simultaneously, e.g., for a given cell group (CG). In such case, the WTRU may perform the transmission of the applicable UCI using the indicated resource if simultaneous PUCCH and PUSCH transmission is configured, e.g., for the concerned CG. Otherwise, if the WTRU does not perform simultaneous PUCCH/PUSCH transmissions it may include the applicable UCI information (e.g., such as UCI requested in the dynamic scheduling information) in a PUSCH transmission according to legacy behavior. In an example, the WTRU may include SR in the scheduled UCI transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0341" num="0340">In some examples, the WTRU may be configured to transmit periodic CSI reports for more than one cell (multiple periodic CSI reports) in a single subframe over PUCCH or PUSCH. The WTRU may also be configured to transmit HARQ-ACK and/or SR in the same subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0342" num="0341">In some examples, a maximum payload may be configured in case of transmission of HARQ-ACK and periodic CSI. The WTRU may be configured with a maximum payload for each PUCCH resource that can be used for the transmission of HARQ-ACK, periodic CSI reports and/or SR in a subframe. The maximum payload may be expressed in terms of bits or in terms of a maximum code rate, in conjunction with the known number of available coded bits for the configured resource. Such maximum payload may be dependent on the combination of UCI being transmitted, e.g., whether HARQ-ACK alone or a combination of HARQ-ACK, periodic CSI and SR is transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0343" num="0342">Alternatively or in addition, the WTRU may be configured with a maximum payload of periodic CSI reports for each PUCCH resource which is applicable independently of the number of HARQ-ACK and SR bits that are transmitted in the resource. Such maximum payload of periodic CSI reports may be the same as the configured maximum payload of the PUCCH resource that is used in the subframe or that would be used for the transmission of periodic CSI only in the subframe according to one of the solutions described herein. Alternatively, the maximum payload of periodic CSI reports in case a simultaneous transmission with HARQ-ACK and/or SR may be configured independently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0344" num="0343">The WTRU may transmit a smaller number of periodic CSI reports than the configured number in a subframe where HARQ-ACK and/or SR are also transmitted in case the payload of periodic CSI reports would exceed a configured maximum payload of periodic CSI reports, or in case the total payload of HARQ-ACK, SR and periodic CSI reports would exceed a configured maximum payload for the PUCCH resource (or the total number of UCI bits). The subset of periodic CSI reports that is transmitted may be determined according to one of the solutions described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0345" num="0344">In some examples, when transmission of HARQ-ACK collides with transmission of multiple periodic CSI reports, the WTRU may transmit on one of the PUCCH resources configured for the transmission of multiple periodic CSI according to a solution described herein. Alternatively, the WTRU may transmit on a periodic PUCCH resource indicated by downlink control information (i.e., a TPC field of SCell assignments/ARI).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0346" num="0345">The WTRU may be configured with more than one PUCCH resource for the transmission of multiple periodic CSI reports in a subframe. In this case, the WTRU may determine the PUCCH resource according to at least one of the following solutions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0347" num="0346">In an example, the WTRU may select a PUCCH resource based on at least one priority criterion. For example, the WTRU may select the resource associated with the serving cell whose periodic CSI report has the highest priority in the subframe among all serving cells for which a periodic CSI report is being transmitted in the subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0348" num="0347">In another example, the WTRU may select a PUCCH resource based on the total payload of the periodic CSI reports to be transmitted in the subframe, or the total payload of HARQ-ACK (if applicable), SR (if applicable) and periodic CSI reports. For example, the WTRU may select a first PUCCH resource if the total payload does not exceed a threshold, and a second PUCCH resource otherwise. The threshold may correspond to, or be a function of, the maximum payload that can be supported for the first PUCCH resource, which may be less than the maximum payload that can be supported for the second PUCCH resource.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0349" num="0348">In a further example, the WTRU may select a PUCCH resource as a function of the required transmission power based on the power control parameters and formulas associated with each resource. The transmission power may be a function of at least one of resource-specific parameters, format-specific parameters, payload, number of resource blocks, code rate, power control adjustment, and/or path loss. For example, the WTRU may select the resource that minimizes the required transmission power. In another example, the WTRU may select a first resource if the required transmission power for this resource is below a threshold, and a second resource otherwise, possibly only under the condition that the required transmission power for the second resource is lower than the required transmission power for the first resource plus a configured offset in dB terms. In the above, the required transmission power for each resource may be adjusted to correspond to a peak transmission power to account for possible differences in cubic metric (CM) and/or peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) between different resources. The adjustment may be a function of at least one property associated with the PUCCH resource, such as the PUCCH format or the number of resource blocks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0349">The WTRU may select a PUCCH resource based on whether HARQ-ACK and/or SR are also transmitted in the same subframe. The PUCCH resource to use in case HARQ-ACK and/or SR are also transmitted may be signaled from downlink control information, or configured by higher layers only.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0351" num="0350">In still another example, the WTRU may select a PUCCH resource based on the timing of the subframe. For example, a first set and a second set of subframes may be associated with a first and a second PUCCH resource, respectively. Each set may be defined in terms of period and offset relative to the frame number and/or subframe number, or in terms of an index representing the period and offset. For example, one set may correspond to subframes occurring with a period of 20 ms which include subframe #3 of frame #0. The WTRU may select the first PUCCH resource in a subframe belonging to the first set only, and the second PUCCH resource in a subframe belonging to the second set only. For a subframe belonging to both sets, the WTRU may select the PUCCH resource based on at least one of the following. In an example, the WTRU may select the PUCCH resource based on a priority criterion. The priority may be pre-defined, or may be based on a property of the resource such as the maximum payload (or code rate) supported, the number of resource blocks, the starting resource block number or the format. For example, the priority may be given to the PUCCH resource that can support the highest maximum payload. In another example, the WTRU may select the PUCCH resource based on a solution already described elsewhere herein, such as based on the total payload to be transmitted, the required transmission power and/or the priorities of associated serving cells for which a report is being transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0352" num="0351">In some examples, the WTRU may transmit a smaller number of periodic CSI reports than the configured number due to a power limitation. The WTRU may first determine a maximum payload for periodic CSI reports and CRC (if applicable) or for the combination of periodic CSI reports, SR, HARQ-ACK feedback and CRC (if applicable) based on the maximum power available for the transmission, the type of channel (PUCCH or PUSCH), the format in case of PUCCH, and other parameters and measurements (e.g., path loss) used for power control. The maximum payload may take into account the number of bits required for CRC addition, if applicable. Such maximum payload may be referred to as power-limited payload. In case the WTRU is configured with more than one PUCCH resource, the WTRU may first determine the PUCCH resource based on a solution described herein and then determine the power-limited payload associated with the resource. Alternatively, the WTRU may select the PUCCH resource which results in the highest possible power-limited payload.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0353" num="0352">The power-limited payload may be constrained to correspond to one of a finite set of allowed values for the maximum payload or to a parameter from which the maximum payload can be derived (such as a maximum number of periodic reports or a maximum code rate). Such a set of allowed values may correspond the set of possible values that can be configured as part of a PUCCH resource.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0354" num="0353">The maximum power available for the transmission may be determined using existing power scaling and allocation solutions when multiple cells and/or cell groups are configured. In some solutions, the WTRU may be configured with a maximum power specific to a PUCCH transmission containing periodic CSI. In this case the maximum power available for the transmission may be the smallest value between this configured maximum power for periodic CSI and the maximum available power obtained from existing solutions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0355" num="0354">The maximum payload in case of PUCCH may be determined using a relationship between a number of information bits and a power offset applicable to the PUCCH format used for transmitting periodic CSI reports. The maximum payload in case of PUSCH may be determined from a maximum number of symbols (or ratio of symbols) that may be used for the encoding of the different types of CSI reports (RI, CQI and PMI).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0356" num="0355">When the number of bits required to transmit a set of periodic CSI reports according to configuration exceeds a maximum payload according to one of the solutions described herein, the WTRU may transmit a subset of CSI reports based on a priority rule. The priority rule may be based on legacy priority rules (i.e. type of report and serving cell index). The priority rule may also be based on at least one of the following: the time since the last transmission of a periodic report for a cell; the value of the CQI and/or RI. Possibly, only reports for which CQI/RI is above or below a configured threshold may be transmitted; and/or the change of value of the CQI and/or RI since the last transmission of the corresponding report for a cell (in an example, reports with highest change of CQI and/or RI may be prioritized).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0357" num="0356">The WTRU may include a cell identity along with each set of CSI reports for a cell at least in case the priority cannot be known in advance by the network or when only a subset of the reports are transmitted. The WTRU may also transmit an indication, possibly encoded separately, that only a subset of the reports are transmitted due to power limitation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0358" num="0357">In case the power-limited payload is lower than the number of bits required for the transmission of only HARQ-ACK bits or HARQ-ACK and SR bits (plus CRC bits if applicable), the WTRU may not include any periodic CSI report in the transmission. In some solutions, the WTRU may not include any periodic CSI in the transmission whenever the power-limited payload is lower than what would be required for the transmission of all periodic CSI reports, HARQ-ACK (if applicable), SR (if applicable) and CRC (if applicable) according to a configuration. In such a case, the WTRU may transmit only HARQ-ACK, SR and CRC, if applicable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0358">In some examples, the payload may be set to one of a finite set of possible value. For example, the WTRU may use padding (e.g. append the payload with a number of โ0โ bits) such that the payload matches one of a set of possible payload values that may be pre-defined or configured by higher layers. This may facilitate blind detection of the payload by the receiver at the network side. Such padding may occur after reduction of payload (for periodic CSI or other UCI) according to one of the above solutions. Possibly, padding may be performed only in case payload reduction occurred due to a power limitation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0360" num="0359">Although features and elements are described above in particular combinations, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that each feature or element can be used alone or in any combination with the other features and elements.
