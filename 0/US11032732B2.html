<heading id="h-0004">II. Background</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as voice, data, and so on. These systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., bandwidth and transmit power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced systems and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, a wireless multiple-access communication system can simultaneously support communication for multiple wireless terminals. Each terminal communicates with one or more base stations via transmissions on the forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. This communication link may be established via a single-input single-output, multiple-input single-output or a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">To enhance coverage of certain devices, such as machine type communication(s) (MTC) devices, “bundling” may be utilized in which certain transmissions are sent as a bundle of transmissions over multiple transmission time intervals (TTIs), for example, with the same information transmitted over multiple subframes.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Aspects of the present disclosure provide techniques that may help enable efficient communication between a base station and machine type communication (MTC)-based user equipments (UEs). For example, the techniques may help a UE that supports a reduced peak data rate (e.g., an MTC UE) to determine a transport block size (TBS) for use in communication between the UE and its serving base station (BS).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">According to certain aspects, a TBS table with a reduced number of entries (relative to a TBS table for an existing or “legacy” UE type) may be provided. In some cases, a TBS table may have a same number of entries as a legacy TBS table, but with a reduced maximum TBS. In such a case, the TBS values in the table may not be monotonically increasing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication networks such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA and other networks. The terms “network” and “system” are often used interchangeably. A CDMA network may implement a radio technology such as universal terrestrial radio access (UTRA), cdma2000, etc. UTRA includes wideband CDMA (WCDMA), time division synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA), and other variants of CDMA. cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA network may implement a radio technology such as global system for mobile communications (GSM). An OFDMA network may implement a radio technology such as evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), ultra mobile broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM®, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced (LTE-A), in both frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD), are new releases of UMTS that use E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE, LTE-A and GSM are described in documents from an organization named “3rd Generation Partnership Project” (3GPP). cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named “3rd Generation Partnership Project 2” (3GPP2). The techniques described herein may be used for the wireless networks and radio technologies mentioned above as well as other wireless networks and radio technologies. For clarity, certain aspects of the techniques are described below for LTE/LTE-Advanced, and LTE/LTE-Advanced terminology is used in much of the description below. LTE and LTE-A are referred to generally as LTE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">A wireless communication network may include a number of base stations that can support communication for a number of wireless devices. Wireless devices may include user equipments (UEs). Some examples of UEs may include cellular phones, smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), wireless modems, handheld devices, tablets, laptop computers, netbooks, smartbooks, ultrabooks, wearables (e.g., smart watch, smart bracelet, smart glasses, smart ring, smart clothing), etc. Some UEs may be considered machine-type communication (MTC) UEs, which may include remote devices, such as drones, robots, sensors, meters, location tags, etc., that may communicate with a base station, another remote device, or some other entity. Machine type communications (MTC) may refer to communication involving at least one remote device on at least one end of the communication and may include forms of data communication which involve one or more entities that do not necessarily need human interaction. MTC UEs may include UEs that are capable of MTC communications with MTC servers and/or other MTC devices through Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMN), for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example wireless communication network <b>100</b>, in which aspects of the present disclosure may be practiced. For example, techniques presented herein may be used to help UEs shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> determine a transport block size (TBS) to use when communicating with their serving base station (BS).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The network <b>100</b> may be an LTE network or some other wireless network. Wireless network <b>100</b> may include a number of evolved Node Bs (eNBs) <b>110</b> and other network entities. An eNB is an entity that communicates with user equipments (UEs) and may also be referred to as a base station, a Node B, an access point, etc. Each eNB may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In 3GPP, the term “cell” can refer to a coverage area of an eNB and/or an eNB subsystem serving this coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">An eNB may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a pico cell, a femto cell, and/or other types of cell. A macro cell may cover a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscription. A pico cell may cover a relatively small geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscription. A femto cell may cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and may allow restricted access by UEs having association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs in a closed subscriber group (CSG)). An eNB for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro eNB. An eNB for a pico cell may be referred to as a pico eNB. An eNB for a femto cell may be referred to as a femto eNB or a home eNB (HeNB). In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an eNB <b>110</b> <i>a </i>may be a macro eNB for a macro cell <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, an eNB <b>110</b> <i>b </i>may be a pico eNB for a pico cell <b>102</b> <i>b</i>, and an eNB <b>110</b> <i>c </i>may be a femto eNB for a femto cell <b>102</b> <i>c</i>. An eNB may support one or multiple (e.g., three) cells. The terms “eNB”, “base station” and “cell” may be used interchangeably herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Wireless network <b>100</b> may also include relay stations. A relay station is an entity that can receive a transmission of data from an upstream station (e.g., an eNB or a UE) and send a transmission of the data to a downstream station (e.g., a UE or an eNB). A relay station may also be a UE that can relay transmissions for other UEs. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a relay station <b>110</b> <i>d </i>may communicate with macro eNB <b>110</b> <i>a </i>and a UE <b>120</b> <i>d </i>in order to facilitate communication between eNB <b>110</b> <i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b> <i>d</i>. A relay station may also be referred to as a relay eNB, a relay base station, a relay, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Wireless network <b>100</b> may be a heterogeneous network that includes eNBs of different types, e.g., macro eNBs, pico eNBs, femto eNBs, relay eNBs, etc. These different types of eNBs may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, and different impact on interference in wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro eNBs may have a high transmit power level (e.g., 5 to 40 Watts) whereas pico eNBs, femto eNBs, and relay eNBs may have lower transmit power levels (e.g., 0.1 to 2 Watts).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">A network controller <b>130</b> may couple to a set of eNBs and may provide coordination and control for these eNBs. Network controller <b>130</b> may communicate with the eNBs via a backhaul. The eNBs may also communicate with one another, e.g., directly or indirectly via a wireless or wireline backhaul.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">UEs <b>120</b> (e.g., <b>120</b> <i>a</i>, <b>120</b> <i>b</i>, <b>120</b> <i>c</i>) may be dispersed throughout wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE may be stationary or mobile. A UE may also be referred to as an access terminal, a terminal, a mobile station, a subscriber unit, a station, etc. A UE may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a tablet, a smart phone, a netbook, a smartbook, an ultrabook, etc. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a solid line with double arrows indicates desired transmissions between a UE and a serving eNB, which is an eNB designated to serve the UE on the downlink and/or uplink. A dashed line with double arrows indicates potentially interfering transmissions between a UE and an eNB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of a design of base station/eNB <b>110</b> and UE <b>120</b>, which may be one of the base stations/eNBs and one of the UEs in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Base station <b>110</b> may be equipped with T antennas <b>234</b> <i>a </i>through <b>234</b> <i>t</i>, and UE <b>120</b> may be equipped with R antennas <b>252</b> <i>a </i>through <b>252</b> <i>r</i>, where in general T≥1 and R≥1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">At base station <b>110</b>, a transmit processor <b>220</b> may receive data from a data source <b>212</b> for one or more UEs, select one or more modulation and coding schemes (MCS) for each UE based on CQIs received from the UE, process (e.g., encode and modulate) the data for each UE based on the MCS(s) selected for the UE, and provide data symbols for all UEs. Transmit processor <b>220</b> may also process system information (e.g., for SRPI, etc.) and control information (e.g., CQI requests, grants, upper layer signaling, etc.) and provide overhead symbols and control symbols. Processor <b>220</b> may also generate reference symbols for reference signals (e.g., the CRS) and synchronization signals (e.g., the PSS and SSS). A transmit (TX) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processor <b>230</b> may perform spatial processing (e.g., precoding) on the data symbols, the control symbols, the overhead symbols, and/or the reference symbols, if applicable, and may provide T output symbol streams to T modulators (MODs) <b>232</b> <i>a </i>through <b>232</b> <i>t</i>. Each modulator <b>232</b> may process a respective output symbol stream (e.g., for OFDM, etc.) to obtain an output sample stream. Each modulator <b>232</b> may further process (e.g., convert to analog, amplify, filter, and upconvert) the output sample stream to obtain a downlink signal. T downlink signals from modulators <b>232</b> <i>a </i>through <b>232</b> <i>t </i>may be transmitted via T antennas <b>234</b> <i>a </i>through <b>234</b> <i>t</i>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">At UE <b>120</b>, antennas <b>252</b> <i>a </i>through <b>252</b> <i>r </i>may receive the downlink signals from base station <b>110</b> and/or other base stations and may provide received signals to demodulators (DEMODs) <b>254</b> <i>a </i>through <b>254</b> <i>r</i>, respectively. Each demodulator <b>254</b> may condition (e.g., filter, amplify, downconvert, and digitize) its received signal to obtain input samples. Each demodulator <b>254</b> may further process the input samples (e.g., for OFDM, etc.) to obtain received symbols. A MIMO detector <b>256</b> may obtain received symbols from all R demodulators <b>254</b> <i>a </i>through <b>254</b> <i>r</i>, perform MIMO detection on the received symbols if applicable, and provide detected symbols. A receive processor <b>258</b> may process (e.g., demodulate and decode) the detected symbols, provide decoded data for UE <b>120</b> to a data sink <b>260</b>, and provide decoded control information and system information to a controller/processor <b>280</b>. A channel processor may determine RSRP, RSSI, RSRQ, CQI, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">On the uplink, at UE <b>120</b>, a transmit processor <b>264</b> may receive and process data from a data source <b>262</b> and control information (e.g., for reports comprising RSRP, RSSI, RSRQ, CQI, etc.) from controller/processor <b>280</b>. Processor <b>264</b> may also generate reference symbols for one or more reference signals. The symbols from transmit processor <b>264</b> may be precoded by a TX MIMO processor <b>266</b> if applicable, further processed by modulators <b>254</b> <i>a </i>through <b>254</b> <i>r </i>(e.g., for SC-FDM, OFDM, etc.), and transmitted to base station <b>110</b>. At base station <b>110</b>, the uplink signals from UE <b>120</b> and other UEs may be received by antennas <b>234</b>, processed by demodulators <b>232</b>, detected by a MIMO detector <b>236</b> if applicable, and further processed by a receive processor <b>238</b> to obtain decoded data and control information sent by UE <b>120</b>. Processor <b>238</b> may provide the decoded data to a data sink <b>239</b> and the decoded control information to controller/processor <b>240</b>. Base station <b>110</b> may include communication unit <b>244</b> and communicate to network controller <b>130</b> via communication unit <b>244</b>.

The PSS and SSS may be transmitted in symbol periods <b>6</b> and <b>5</b>, respectively, in subframes <b>0</b> and <b>5</b> of each radio frame with the normal cyclic prefix, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The PSS and SSS may be used by UEs for cell search and acquisition. The eNB may transmit a cell-specific reference signal (CRS) across the system bandwidth for each cell supported by the eNB. The CRS may be transmitted in certain symbol periods of each subframe and may be used by the UEs to perform channel estimation, channel quality measurement, and/or other functions. The eNB may also transmit a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) in symbol periods <b>0</b> to <b>3</b> in slot <b>1</b> of certain radio frames. The PBCH may carry some system information. The eNB may transmit other system information such as system information blocks (SIBs) on a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) in certain subframes. The eNB may transmit control information/data on a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in the first B symbol periods of a subframe, where B may be configurable for each subframe. The eNB may transmit traffic data and/or other data on the PDSCH in the remaining symbol periods of each subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows two exemplary subframe formats <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> with the normal cyclic prefix. The available time frequency resources may be partitioned into resource blocks. Each resource block may cover 12 subcarriers in one slot and may include a number of resource elements. Each resource element may cover one subcarrier in one symbol period and may be used to send one modulation symbol, which may be a real or complex value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Subframe format <b>410</b> may be used for two antennas. A CRS may be transmitted from antennas <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> in symbol periods <b>0</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>11</b>. A reference signal is a signal that is known a priori by a transmitter and a receiver and may also be referred to as pilot. A CRS is a reference signal that is specific for a cell, e.g., generated based on a cell identity (ID). In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for a given resource element with label Ra, a modulation symbol may be transmitted on that resource element from antenna a, and no modulation symbols may be transmitted on that resource element from other antennas. Subframe format <b>420</b> may be used with four antennas. A CRS may be transmitted from antennas <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> in symbol periods <b>0</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>11</b> and from antennas <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> in symbol periods <b>1</b> and <b>8</b>. For both subframe formats <b>410</b> and <b>420</b>, a CRS may be transmitted on evenly spaced subcarriers, which may be determined based on cell ID. CRSs may be transmitted on the same or different subcarriers, depending on their cell IDs. For both subframe formats <b>410</b> and <b>420</b>, resource elements not used for the CRS may be used to transmit data (e.g., traffic data, control data, and/or other data).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The PSS, SSS, CRS and PBCH in LTE are described in 3GPP TS 36.211, entitled “Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical Channels and Modulation,” which is publicly available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">An interlace structure may be used for each of the downlink and uplink for FDD in LTE. For example, Q interlaces with indices of 0 through Q−1 may be defined, where Q may be equal to 4, 6, 8, 10, or some other value. Each interlace may include subframes that are spaced apart by Q frames. In particular, interlace q may include subframes q, q+Q, q+2Q, etc., where q∈{0, . . . , Q−1}.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The wireless network may support hybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ) for data transmission on the downlink and uplink. For HARQ, a transmitter (e.g., an eNB) may send one or more transmissions of a packet until the packet is decoded correctly by a receiver (e.g., a UE) or some other termination condition is encountered. For synchronous HARQ, all transmissions of the packet may be sent in subframes of a single interlace. For asynchronous HARQ, each transmission of the packet may be sent in any subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">A UE may be located within the coverage of multiple eNBs. One of these eNBs may be selected to serve the UE. The serving eNB may be selected based on various criteria such as received signal strength, received signal quality, pathloss, etc. Received signal quality may be quantified by a signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR), or a reference signal received quality (RSRQ), or some other metric. The UE may operate in a dominant interference scenario in which the UE may observe high interference from one or more interfering eNBs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">As noted above, techniques presented herein may be used to help UEs (e.g., MTC or eMTC UEs) determine a transport block size (TBS) to use when communicating with a BS (e.g., an eNodeB).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The focus of traditional LTE design (e.g., for legacy “non MTC” devices) is on the improvement of spectral efficiency, ubiquitous coverage, and enhanced quality of service (QoS) support. Current LTE system downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) link budgets are designed for coverage of high end devices, such as state-of-the-art smartphones and tablets, which may support a relatively large DL and UL link budget.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">However, low cost, low rate devices need to be supported as well. For example, certain standards (e.g., LTE Release 12) have introduced a new type of UE (referred to as a category 0 UE) generally targeting machine type communications or low cost designs, generally referred to as machine type communication(s) (MTC) UEs. For MTC, various requirements may be relaxed as only a limited amount of information may need to be exchanged. For example, maximum bandwidth may be reduced (relative to legacy UEs), a single receive radio frequency (RF) chain may be used, peak rate may be reduced (e.g., a maximum of 100 bits for a transport block size), transmit power may be reduced, Rank 1 transmission may be used, and half duplex operation may be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In some cases, if half-duplex operation is performed, MTC UEs may have a relaxed switching time to transition from transmitting to receiving (or receiving to transmitting). For example, the switching time may be relaxed from 20 μs for regular/legacy UEs to 1 ms for MTC UEs. Release 12 MTC UEs may still monitor downlink (DL) control channels in the same way as regular UEs, for example, monitoring for wideband control channels in the first few symbols (e.g., PDCCH) as well as narrowband control channels occupying a relatively narrowband, but spanning a length of a subframe (e.g., ePDCCH).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Certain standards (e.g., LTE Release 13) may introduce support for various additional MTC enhancements, referred to herein as enhanced MTC (or eMTC). For example, eMTC may provide MTC UEs with coverage enhancements up to 15 dB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in the subframe structure <b>500</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, eMTC UEs can support narrowband operation while operating in a wider system bandwidth (e.g., 1.4/3/5/10/15/20 MHz). In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a conventional legacy control region <b>510</b> may span system bandwidth of a first few symbols, while a narrowband region <b>530</b> of the system bandwidth (spanning a narrow portion of a data region <b>520</b>) may be reserved for an MTC physical downlink control channel (referred to herein as an mPDCCH) and for an MTC physical downlink shared channel (referred to herein as an mPDSCH). In some cases, an MTC UE monitoring the narrowband region may operate at 1.4 MHz or 6 resource blocks (RBs).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">As noted above, eMTC UEs may be able to operate in a cell with a bandwidth larger than 6 RBs. Within this larger bandwidth, each eMTC UE may still operate (e.g., monitor/receive/transmit) while abiding by a 6-physical resource block (PRB) constraint. In some cases, different eMTC UEs may be served by different narrowband regions (e.g., with each spanning 6-PRB blocks).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In any case, a transport block size (TBS) for communicating within this narrowband region may not be fixed. Thus, a mechanism may be needed to assist a UE, communicating within this narrowband region, to determine a TBS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">In certain systems (e.g., LTE), a transport block size (TBS) is determined by using TBS tables that are defined for one layer or multiple transmission layers. The term layer generally refers to a number of spatial multiplexing layers, which generally depends on a rank indication (RI) feedback from the UE that identifies how many transmission layers the UE is able to discern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Using a TBS table, a base station (e.g., an eNodeB <b>110</b>) may signal information that the UE uses to look up a value from an entry in the TBS table. For example, for broadcast transmissions via a downlink control information (DCI) format 1A, one bit in the DCI may indicate a second or third column index of the TBS table, while a five-bit MCS in the DCI may indicate the row index. Additionally, for broadcast transmissions via DCI format 1C, a separate TBS table may be defined and a five-bit MCS in the DCI may indicate which entry, out of 32 entries, of the TBS table should be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">According to certain aspects, for unicast transmissions, a number of assigned RBs may be mapped to a column index and a five-bit MCS may be mapped to a row index. In some cases, the column index may be equal to the number of assigned RBs. For some special cases (e.g., for special subframes in TDD), some scaling may be performed, for example:
<br/>
column index=alpha*(# of assigned RBs)
<br/>
where alpha is a scaling value less than 1. In some cases, the MCS to index row mapping may be many-to-one. That is, there may be cases when two or more MCS values map to the same row index. Additionally, in some cases, if the unicast transmission contains a transmission block with two or more layers, the TBS may further be determined based on the number of layers.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">However, for MTC (or eMTC) UEs, certain issues may make it difficult to determine a TBS. For example, MTC UEs may be expected to support a limited set of transport block sizes. There may also be a limit on a maximum TBS size supported (e.g., 1000 bits, 500 bits, 300 bits, etc.). Additionally, MTC UEs may have certain coverage requirements, for example, as high at 15 dB. In some cases, TTI bundling operation may also be supported by MTC UEs, where a TB is transmitted in multiple transmission time intervals (e.g., over multiple subframes).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Due to these issues, the number of RBs associated with an MTC UE, especially under coverage enhancement (e.g., eMTC), may not serve as a good input parameter for TBS determination. Thus, aspects of the present disclosure provide solutions that may be utilized for determining a TBS for eMTC UEs and help address these issues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates example operations <b>600</b>, performed by a base station (BS) (e.g., BSs <b>110</b>), for determining a TBS for communications involving machine-type-communication user equipments (e.g., eMTC UEs).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Operations <b>600</b> begin, at <b>602</b> by using a first transport block size (TBS) table to communicate with a first type of user equipment (UE).

At <b>608</b>, the base station communicates with the first type of UE with one or more transmissions having a payload with a number of bits determined based on a TBS value from the first TBS table selected based, at least in part, on the signaled information.</div>

Operations <b>700</b> may be considered complementary (UE-side) operations to (BS-side) operations <b>600</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Operations <b>700</b> begin, at <b>702</b>, by using a first transport block size (TBS) table to communicate with a base station (BS), wherein the first TBS table has a reduced maximum TBS value relative to a second TBS table used by the BS to communicate with a second type of UE and wherein the first type of UE supports a reduced peak data rate relative to the second type of UE. At <b>704</b>, the UE receives information from the BS for use in determining a TBS from the second TBS table. At <b>706</b>, the UE communicates with the BS with one or more transmissions having a payload with a number of bits determined based on a TBS value from the first TBS table selected based, at least in part, on information signaled from the BS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The particular content and size of the TBS tables, as well as the information used to select a TBS value from such tables, may vary according to different aspects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, a TBS table of a limited amount of entries may be associated with eMTC unicast traffic. For example, a new table may be defined with limited entries specifically defined for eMTC UEs or that reuse some entries from existing TBS tables.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">As an example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example of an existing TBS table for DCI format 1C for scheduled broadcast traffic. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, on the other hand, illustrates a new example TBS table for eMTC broadcast traffic having a maximum TBS of 1000 bits (e.g., less than the maximum TBS for existing TBS tables), which may be based on the 1C table illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> with truncation (e.g., with entries above 1000 bits deleted). In other words, the TBS table illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> may share a common set of entries as the TBS table illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> but, in some cases, may truncate TBSs above 1000 bits. In some cases, the TBS tables illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9A</figref> may (each) be subset of a larger TBS table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Entries in the example table illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> may be accessed via a five-bit index (e.g., a five-bit MCS).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">As an alternative, rather than simply truncate entries for TBS values above 1000 bits, these entries may be re-used to provide different TBS granularity. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> illustrates an example of a new TBS table for eMTC unicast, which may be based on the 1C table illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, but with different values (below 1000 bits) used in the final entries. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, TBS indices <b>24</b>-<b>31</b> may be added with corresponding TBS values to provide different TBS granularity. Again, entries in the example table illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> may be accessed via a five-bit index.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In some cases, however, a table may be designed with fewer entries allowing for a smaller bit index to be used. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> illustrate exemplary new TBS tables for eMTC broadcast and unicast, assuming a max TBS of 300 bits. While the example table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> simply deletes entries above 300 bits, the example table of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> allows for entries with greater granularity. In either case, by limiting entries to 16 or less, a four-bit index may be sufficient rather than the five-bit index needed for TBS tables with more than 16 entries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> illustrates a exemplary new TBS table for eMTC broadcast, which may be based on the 1C table illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> with truncation (relative to existing legacy TBS tables). As illustrated, the table illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> may be for a four-bit MCS. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> illustrates a exemplary new TBS table for eMTC unicast, which based on the 1C table illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> with modified entries (relative to existing legacy TBS tables). For example, as illustrated, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> includes TBS indices <b>24</b>-<b>31</b> and corresponding TBS values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Note that the ordering of TBS values for entries of the TBS tables illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-11B</figref> is not monotonically increasing. This may allow for greater reuse of certain portions (e.g., the first entries) of an existing table (e.g., format 1C table), and between broadcast/unicast.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">From the limited (or modified) TBS tables described above, the determination of TBS for an eMTC for unicast transmissions may be based on an explicit index to the TBS table, while the number of RBs assigned to the MTC UES may not be used for TBS determination. That is, a base station may signal to the UE an explicit index to the TBS table, informing the UE of the TBS to use for transmissions between the UE and the BS. According to certain aspects, a payload of the transmissions (e.g., a number of bits) between the UE and BS may be determined based on a TBS value from the TBS table selected based, at least in part, on the signaled information (e.g., the explicitly signaled index).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In some cases, the base station may determine the explicit index based on a mapping to the TBS table. Additionally, in some cases, different mappings may be used for different operating modes of the UE. For example, there may be one mapping used for a receiving unicast transmissions mode while another mapping may be used for a receiving broadcast transmissions mode. Additionally, there may be different mappings for a downlink transmission mode versus uplink transmission mode. It should be noted that the operating modes noted above is not an exhaustive list of operating modes and that other operating modes not listed may exist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">According to certain aspects, TBS determination may be the same between broadcast and unicast for eMTC UEs. For example, the TBS determination for both broadcast and unicast may be based on the same TBS table and the same indexing approach. According to certain aspects, TBS determination for broadcast and unicast may be different (e.g., based on different TBS tables or indexing mechanism). Similarly, TBS determination may be the same, or different, for uplink and downlink.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Similarly, TBS determination may be the same, or different, for unicast/broadcast and Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (MBMS). According to certain aspects, TBS for MBMS may be determined differently, for example, using different indexing or TBS tables (e.g., MBMS TBS using a legacy TBS table).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">According to certain aspects, TBS determination for eMTC UEs may be dependent on whether or not transmission time interval (TTI) bundling is enabled and/or may be dependent on a bundling length, where the bundling length indicates a number of subframes over which a payload is transmitted. For example, according to certain aspects, if TTI bundling is not enabled, a first TBS determination approach may be used, whereas if TTI bundling is not enabled, a second TBS determination approach may be used. According to certain aspects, the first TBS determination approach may involve determining TBS in the same fashion as for regular UEs, where the unicast TBS is determined based on MCS and the number of assigned RBs. The second TBS determination approach may involve determining the TBS based on explicit index to a TBS table of limited entries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Additionally, as noted above, the TBS determination may be based on a bundling length. For example, if TTI bundling length is small, the first TBS determination approach above may be use, whereas if the TTI bundling length is large, the second TBS determination approach above may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">According to certain aspects, if two or more TBS determination approaches are associated with unicast traffic, there may be a default approach to use for fallback operation. For example, for fallback operation, a common search space scheduled DCI may always be associated with a fixed TBS determination scheme, while a UE-specific search space may be associated with a TBS scheme based on a configuration or implicit determination (e.g., based on TTI bundling).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">The various mechanisms described above provide techniques for TBS value determination for UEs (e.g., eMTC UEs) that may support different maximum TBS values than existing (legacy UEs). Additionally, aspects of the present disclosure may also apply to other use cases. For example, if a regular UE needs to use TTI bundling for coverage enhancement (e.g., certain channels being repeated over a long time), a different mapping (e.g., one in accordance with the present disclosure) of TBS may also be used. Additionally, LTE Release 13 introduces a new narrowband internet of things (NB-IOT) work item, which may use one RB as a maximum bandwidth and long bundling. Thus, TBS may be determined in a similar fashion.</div>
