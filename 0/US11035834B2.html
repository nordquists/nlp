<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to gas chromatography and in particular, but not exclusively, to gas chromatography with gas analyte spectrum sharpening and separation using individual, cascaded and/or multi-dimensional micro gas chromatographs (micro-GCs).</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Gas analysis can be an important means for detecting the presence and concentration of certain chemicals in the gas and determining the meaning of the particular combination of chemicals present. In health care, for example, the presence of certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled human breath are correlated to certain diseases, such as pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), asthma, lung cancer, liver diseases, kidney diseases, etc. The correlations are especially evidential for lung-related diseases. In other applications, gas analysis can be used to determine the presence of dangerous substances incompatible with human presence, such as methane, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide in a mine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Current gas analytical systems still rely heavily on large and expensive laboratory instruments, such as gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). Most of these instruments (mass spectrometers in particular) have operational characteristics that prevent significant reductions in their size, meaning that current gas analysis systems are large and expensive bench devices. In addition to being expensive and unwieldy, the large size of current gas analysis devices makes widespread use of these instruments impossible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">GC column coatings are usually optimized for specific temperatures and chemicals, so that no single GC can separate a large array of chemicals, even by varying its temperature. Because existing GCs are large, heavy units housed in labs, a carrier gas with many chemicals may need to be sent to multiple locations for separation, which substantially increases cost. The gas analyte/volatile organic compound (VOC) concentration distribution (spectrum) usually is broadened when injected into the GC column. In the application of portable gas analysis, there is no viable solution to sharpen the analyte/VOC spectrum without loss of detection limit. Moreover, the current column focusing can only be achieved by direct impinging liquid nitrogen or dry ice to a small section of bulky GC column for focusing effect. Such approach is expensive and cannot be implemented as a portable gas analysis system.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Embodiments of an apparatus, process and system for gas analysis in point-of-care medical applications are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail but are nonetheless encompassed within the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Reference throughout this specification to โone embodimentโ or โan embodimentโ means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases โin one embodimentโ or โin an embodimentโ in this specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> together illustrate an embodiment of a small scale (e.g., handheld) gas analysis device <b>100</b>. Device <b>100</b> includes a substrate <b>102</b> on which are mounted a fluid handling assembly <b>101</b>, a controller <b>126</b> coupled to the individual elements within fluid handling assembly <b>101</b>, and a reading and analysis circuit <b>128</b> coupled to detector array <b>110</b> and to controller <b>126</b>. The embodiment shown in the Figs. illustrates one possible arrangement of the elements on substrate <b>102</b>, but in other embodiments the elements can, of course, be arranged on the substrate differently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Substrate <b>102</b> can be any kind of substrate that provides the required physical support and communication connections for the elements of device <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, substrate <b>102</b> can be a printed circuit board (PCB) of the single-layer variety with conductive traces on its surface, but in other embodiments it can be a PCB of the multi-layer variety with conductive traces in the interior of the circuit board. In other embodiments, for example an embodiment where device <b>100</b> is built as a monolithic system on a single die, substrate <b>102</b> can be chip or wafer made of silicon or some other semiconductor. In still other embodiments, substrate <b>102</b> can also be a chip or wafer in which optical waveguides can be formed to support optical communication between the components of device <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Fluid handling assembly <b>101</b> includes a filter and valve assembly <b>104</b>, a pre-concentrator <b>106</b>, a gas chromatograph <b>108</b>, a detector array <b>110</b> and a pump <b>112</b>. Elements <b>104</b>-<b>112</b> are fluidly coupled in series: filter and valve assembly <b>104</b> is fluidly coupled to pre-concentrator <b>106</b> by fluid connection <b>116</b>, pre-concentrator <b>106</b> is fluidly coupled to gas chromatograph <b>108</b> by fluid connection <b>118</b>, gas chromatograph <b>108</b> is fluidly coupled to detector array <b>110</b> by fluid connection <b>120</b>, and detector array <b>110</b> is coupled to pump <b>112</b> by fluid connection <b>122</b>. As further described below, in one embodiment of device <b>100</b> elements <b>104</b>-<b>112</b> can be micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) elements or MEMS-based elements, meaning that some parts of each device can be MEMS and other parts not. In other embodiments of device <b>100</b>, some or all of elements <b>104</b>-<b>112</b> need not be MEMS or MEMS-based, but can instead be some non-MEMS chip scale device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">As indicated by the arrows in the Figs., the fluid connections between elements <b>104</b>-<b>112</b> allow a fluid (e.g., one or more gases) to enter filter and valve assembly <b>104</b> through inlet <b>114</b>, flow though elements <b>104</b>-<b>112</b>, and finally exit pump <b>112</b> through outlet <b>124</b>. Fluid handling assembly <b>101</b> also includes a shroud or cover <b>125</b> that protects individual elements <b>104</b>-<b>112</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, channels formed in shroud <b>125</b> provide the fluid connections between the elements, but in other embodiments the fluid connections between elements can be provided by other means, such as tubing. In still other embodiments shroud <b>125</b> can be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Filter and valve assembly <b>104</b> includes an inlet <b>114</b> and an outlet coupled to fluid connection <b>116</b> such that fluid exiting filter and valve assembly <b>104</b> flows into pre-concentrator <b>106</b>. Filter and valve assembly <b>104</b> includes a filter to remove particulates from fluid entering through inlet <b>114</b>. In embodiments of device <b>100</b> where one or more of elements <b>104</b>-<b>112</b> is a MEMS element, the small scale of parts within the MEMS elements means that fluid entering through inlet <b>114</b> might need to be filtered to remove these particles so that the particles do not enter the MEMS elements and either them or render them inoperative. In embodiments of device <b>100</b> that include no MEMS components, or where fluid entering inlet <b>114</b> contains no particles, for instance because it has been pre-filtered externally to device <b>100</b>, the filter portion of filter and valve assembly <b>104</b> can be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Filter and valve assembly <b>104</b> also includes a valve so that further flow through inlet <b>114</b> into fluid handling assembly <b>101</b> can be stopped once sufficient fluid has passed through the device. Stopping further flow through inlet <b>114</b> prevents dilution of fluids that will flow out of pre-concentrator <b>106</b> during later operation of device <b>100</b> (see description of operation below). In other embodiments, filter and valve assembly <b>104</b> can also include a de-humidifier to remove water vapor from the fluid entering through inlet <b>114</b>, thus improving the accuracy and sensitivity of device <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Pre-concentrator <b>106</b> includes an inlet coupled to fluid connection <b>116</b> and an outlet coupled to fluid connection <b>118</b>. Pre-concentrator <b>106</b> receives fluid from filter and valve assembly <b>104</b> through fluid connection <b>116</b> and outputs fluid to gas chromatograph <b>108</b> through fluid connection <b>118</b>. As fluid flows through pre-concentrator <b>106</b>, the pre-concentrator absorbs certain chemicals from the passing fluid, thus concentrating those chemicals for later separation and detection. In one embodiment of device <b>100</b> pre-concentrator <b>106</b> can be a MEMS pre-concentrator, but in other embodiments pre-concentrator <b>106</b> can be a non-MEMS chip scale device. Further details of an embodiment of a MEMS pre-concentrator are described below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Gas chromatograph <b>108</b> includes an inlet coupled to fluid connection <b>118</b> and an outlet coupled to fluid connection <b>120</b>. Gas chromatograph <b>108</b> receives fluid from pre-concentrator <b>106</b> through fluid connection <b>118</b> and outputs fluid to detector array <b>110</b> through fluid connection <b>120</b>. As fluid received from pre-concentrator <b>106</b> flows through gas chromatograph <b>108</b>, individual chemicals in the fluid received from the pre-concentrator are separated from each other in the time domain for later input into detector array <b>110</b>. In one embodiment of device <b>100</b> gas chromatograph <b>108</b> can be a MEMS gas chromatograph, but in other embodiments gas chromatograph <b>108</b> can be a non-MEMS chip scale device. Further details of an embodiment of a MEMS gas chromatograph <b>108</b> are described below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. Although shown in the drawing as a single chromatograph, in other embodiments gas chromatograph <b>108</b> can be any of the gas chromatographs shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> et seq. In an embodiment in which gas chromatograph <b>108</b> includes multiple chromatographs, it can be necessary to adjust the number of downstream and/or upstream components in device <b>100</b> to coincide with the input or output configuration of the gas chromatograph. For instance, if the chromatograph <b>1400</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> is used as chromatograph <b>108</b> in device <b>100</b>, it can be necessary to adjust the number of detector arrays <b>110</b>, pumps <b>112</b>, and so forth, to correspond to the number of outputs of chromatograph <b>1400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Detector array <b>110</b> includes an inlet coupled to fluid connection <b>120</b> and an outlet coupled fluid connection <b>122</b>. Detector array <b>110</b> receives fluid from gas chromatograph <b>108</b> through fluid connection <b>120</b> and outputs fluid to pump <b>112</b> through fluid connection <b>122</b>. As fluid flows through detector array <b>110</b>, the chemicals that were time-domain separated by gas chromatograph <b>108</b> enter the detector array and their presence and/or concentration is sensed by sensors within the detector array. In one embodiment of device <b>100</b> detector array <b>110</b> can be a MEMS detector array, but in other embodiments detector array <b>110</b> can be a non-MEMS chip scale device. Further details of an embodiment of a detector array <b>110</b> are described below in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Although shown in the Fig. as a single detector array, in other embodiments detector array <b>110</b> can actually include multiple detector arrays. For example, in an embodiment where gas chromatograph <b>108</b> is a configuration made up of several individual chromatographs, such as chromatograph <b>1400</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, it can be necessary to adjust the number of detector arrays to match the output configuration of the cascaded chromatographs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Pump <b>112</b> includes an inlet coupled to fluid connection <b>122</b>, as well as an outlet coupled to an exhaust <b>124</b>, such that pump <b>112</b> draws fluid from detector array <b>110</b> through fluid connections <b>122</b> and returns it to the atmosphere through exhaust <b>124</b>. Pump <b>112</b> can be any kind of pump that meets the size and form factor requirements of device <b>100</b>, provides the desired flow rate and flow rate control, and has adequate reliability (i.e., adequate mean time between failures (MTBF)). In one embodiment, pump <b>112</b> can be a MEMS or MEMS-based pump, but in other embodiments it can be another type of pump. Examples of pumps that can be used include small axial pumps (e.g., fans), piston pumps, and electro-osmotic pumps. Although shown in the Fig. as a single pump, in other embodiments pump <b>112</b> can actually be made up of multiple pumps. For example, in an embodiment where gas chromatograph <b>108</b> is a cascaded configuration made up of several individual chromatographs, such as chromatograph <b>1400</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, it can be necessary to adjust the number of pumps to match the output configuration of the cascaded chromatographs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Controller <b>126</b> is communicatively coupled to the individual elements within fluid handling assembly <b>101</b> such that it can send control signals and/or receive feedback signals from the individual elements. In one embodiment, controller <b>126</b> can be an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed specifically for the task, for example a CMOS controller including processing, volatile and/or non-volatile storage, memory and communication circuits, as well as associated logic to control the various circuits and communicate externally to the elements of fluid handling assembly <b>101</b>. In other embodiments, however, controller <b>126</b> can instead be a general-purpose microprocessor in which the control functions are implemented in software. In the illustrated embodiment controller <b>126</b> is electrically coupled to the individual elements within fluid handling assembly <b>101</b> by conductive traces <b>130</b> on the surface or in the interior of substrate <b>102</b>, but in other embodiments controller <b>126</b> can be coupled to the elements by other means, such as optical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b> is coupled to an output of detector array <b>110</b> such that it can receive data signals from individual sensors within detector array <b>110</b> and process and analyze these data signals. In one embodiment, readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b> can be an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed specifically for the task, such as a CMOS controller including processing, volatile and/or non-volatile storage, memory and communication circuits, as well as associated logic to control the various circuits and communicate externally. In other embodiments, however, readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b> can instead be a general-purpose microprocessor in which the control functions are implemented in software. In some embodiments readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b> can also include signal conditioning and processing elements such as amplifiers, filters, analog-to-digital converters, etc., for both pre-processing of data signals received from detector array <b>110</b> and post-processing of data generated or extracted from the received data by readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In the illustrated embodiment, readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b> is electrically coupled to detector array <b>110</b> by conductive traces <b>132</b> positioned on the surface or in the interior of substrate <b>102</b>, but in other embodiments controller <b>126</b> can be coupled to the elements by other means, such as optical means. Readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b> is also coupled to controller <b>126</b> and can send signals to, and receive signals from, controller <b>126</b> so that the two elements can coordinate and optimize operation of device <b>100</b>. Although the illustrated embodiment shows controller <b>126</b> and readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b> as physically separate units, in other embodiments the controller and the readout and analysis circuit could be combined in a single unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In operation of device <b>100</b>, the system is first powered up and any necessary logic (i.e., software instructions) is loaded into controller <b>126</b> and readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b> and initialized. After initialization, the valve in filter and valve unit <b>104</b> is opened and pump <b>112</b> is set to allow flow through the fluid handling assembly. Fluid is then input to fluid handling assembly <b>101</b> through inlet <b>114</b> at a certain flow rate and/or for a certain amount of time; the amount of time needed will usually be determined by the time needed for pre-concentrator <b>106</b> to generate adequate concentrations of the particular analytes (e.g., chemicals or VOCs) whose presence and/or concentration are being determined. As fluid is input to the system through inlet <b>114</b>, it is filtered by filter and valve assembly <b>104</b> and flows through elements <b>104</b>-<b>112</b> within fluid handling assembly <b>101</b> by virtue of the fluid connections between these elements.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">As the chemicals released from pre-concentrator <b>106</b> are drawn by pump <b>112</b> through gas chromato graph <b>108</b>, the chromatograph separates different chemicals from each other in the time domainโthat is, different chemicals are output from the gas chromatograph at different times. As the different chemicals exit gas chromatograph <b>108</b> separated in time, each chemical enters MEMS detection array <b>110</b>, where sensors in the detection array detect the presence and/or concentration of each chemical. The time-domain separation performed in gas chromatograph <b>108</b> substantially enhances the accuracy and sensitivity of MEMS detection array <b>110</b>, since it prevents numerous chemicals from entering the detection array at the same time and thus prevents cross-contamination and potential interference in the sensors within the array.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">As individual sensors within MEMS detection array <b>110</b> interact with the entering time-domain-separated chemicals, the detection array senses the interaction and outputs a signal to readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b>, which can then use the signal to determine presence and/or concentration of the chemicals. When readout and analysis circuit <b>128</b> has determined the presence and/or concentration of all the chemicals of interest it can use various analysis techniques, such as correlation and pattern matching, to extract some meaning from the particular combination of chemicals present and their concentrations.</div>

A cover plate <b>304</b> is bonded to substrate <b>302</b> to seal column <b>310</b>. In one embodiment substrate <b>302</b> is a silicon substrate, but in other embodiments substrate <b>302</b> can of course be made of other materials. In an embodiment where substrate <b>302</b> is silicon, inlet <b>306</b>, outlet <b>308</b> and column <b>310</b> can be formed using standard photolithographic patterning and etching, such as deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). Temperature control <b>314</b> is formed on the side of substrate <b>302</b> opposite the side where cover plate <b>204</b> is attached. In one embodiment, temperature control is integrated with chromatograph <b>300</b> and can include heating elements and/or cooling elements, or elements that are capable of both heating and cooling such as a Peltier device or thermo-electric cooler (TEC). In embodiments where GC <b>300</b> is small (ห1 inch range in one embodiment), it can be heated and cooled quickly with these devices. Temperature control <b>314</b> can also include one or more temperature sensors <b>316</b> to allow for monitoring and/or feedback control of temperature control <b>314</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Channel or column <b>310</b> provides a continuous fluid path from inlet <b>306</b> to outlet <b>308</b>, and some or all of the walls of column <b>310</b> are coated with a stationary phase coating that can interact with the chemicals being separated by the chromatograph or, in other words, the column walls are coated with specific materials that have specific selectivity/separation power for the desired gas analysis. How thoroughly and how fast chemicals are separated from the fluid depend on the stationary phase coating, the overall path length of column <b>310</b>, and the temperature. For a given stationary phase coating, the longer the column the better the chemical spectrum separation, but a long column also extends the separation time. For a given application, the required path length will therefore usually be determined by a tradeoff among the coating, the column length and the temperature. The illustrated embodiment shows column <b>310</b> as a spiral column in which the column path length will depend on the number of coils in the spiral. In other embodiments, however, column <b>310</b> can be shaped differently. In one embodiment, column <b>310</b> can be between 1 m and 10 m in length, but in other embodiment can be outside this range. In the illustrated MEMS GC, column <b>310</b> can be formed by micromachining or micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) process on silicon wafer, glass wafer, PCB board, or any type of substrate.</div>

In other words, chemicals that interact strongly with the stationary phase are retained longer in the stationary phase, while chemicals that interacted weakly with the stationary phase retained less time in the stationary phase. In some embodiments of gas chromatograph <b>300</b> this time-domain separation can occur according to molecular weight (e.g., chemicals with the lowest molecular weight are separated first, followed by higher molecular weights), but in other embodiments it can occur according to other chemical characteristics or other separation mechanisms. As the chemicals are time-domain separated, pump <b>112</b> draws them out of MEMS gas chromatograph <b>300</b> through outlet <b>308</b>. Generally, the chemicals exit through outlet <b>308</b> in the reverse order of their separationโthat is, chemicals with low retention time exit first, while chemicals with higher retention times exit later.

In the illustrated embodiment sensors S<b>1</b>-S<b>9</b> form a regularly shaped 3-by-3 array of sensors, but in other embodiments the sensor array can have a greater or lesser number of sensors, and the sensors can be arranged in any pattern, regular or irregular.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">A cover <b>404</b> is bonded to the perimeter of substrate <b>402</b> to form a cavity <b>410</b> within which sensors S<b>1</b>-S<b>9</b> are located. Cover <b>404</b> also includes an inlet <b>406</b> through which fluid can enter from gas chromatograph <b>108</b> and an outlet <b>408</b> through which fluid can exit to pump <b>112</b>.

Although not shown in the Fig., detector array <b>400</b> of course includes outputs by which signals generated by sensors S<b>1</b>-S<b>9</b> can be output for processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Each sensor S<b>1</b>-S<b>9</b> includes a surface with a coating thereon. Each coating used will have an affinity for one or more of the particular chemicals being detected, such that the coating absorbs or chemically interacts with its corresponding chemical or chemicals. The interaction between coating and chemical in turn changes a physical property of the sensor such as resonant frequency, capacitance or electrical resistance, and that changed physical property of the sensor can be measured using a transducer or other measurement device. The particular coatings chosen for sensors S<b>1</b>-S<b>9</b> will depend on the chemicals that sensor array <b>110</b> will be used to detect. The chemical affinity of coatings also varies strongly with temperature, so that the operating temperature range should be considered in selecting coatings. In an embodiment where sensor array <b>110</b> will be used to detect volatile organic compounds in human breathโsuch as benzene, toluene, n-octane, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, ฮฑ-pinene, d-limonene, nonanal, and benzaldehyde, 2-methylhexane, 4-methyloctane, and so onโcoatings that can be used in different applications include amorphous copolymers of 2,2-bistrifluoromethyl-4,5-difluoro-1,3-dioxole (PDD) and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), PtC12 (olefin), C8-MPN, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Although the illustrated embodiment has nine sensors, the number of sensors needed depends on the number of different chemicals to be detected, and on the nature of the coatings used on the sensors. In an embodiment where each coating absorbs or chemically interacts with only one chemical the number of sensors can correspond exactly to the number of chemicals to be detected, but in other embodiments it can be desirable to have a given coating on more than one sensor for redundancy. In most cases, however, there is no one-to-one correlation between chemicals to coatings; in other words, each coating reacts with more than one different chemical and the reaction between different chemicals and a given coating will vary in nature and strength. A detector array having sensors with different coatings is therefore useful because the response of the detector array can have different patterns for different gases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment of sensor array <b>400</b>, sensors S<b>1</b>-S<b>9</b> are MEMS sensors positioned on the surface of substrate <b>402</b>, meaning that they are surface micromachined sensors. In other embodiments using MEMS sensors, however, sensors S<b>1</b>-S<b>9</b> can be bulk micromachined sensors, meaning that at least some of the MEMS sensors are formed within substrate <b>402</b> instead of on the surface. Still other embodiments of sensor array <b>110</b> using MEMS sensors can include combinations of surface-micromachined and bulk-micromachined sensors. Different types of MEMS sensors can be used, depending on the application and the required sensitivity. Examples of MEMS sensors that can be used include chemiresistors, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) sensors, etc. In other embodiments of detector array <b>400</b>, one or more of sensors S<b>1</b>-S<b>9</b> can be a non-MEMS sensor.

Fluid entering cavity <b>410</b> carries time-domain separated chemicals. As each chemical enters cavity <b>410</b> it interacts with one or more sensors whose coating has an affinity for that chemical. The interaction of the chemical with the sensor is sensed and measured, and the presence and concentration of the particular chemical can be extracted.

This process continues until all the time-domain-separated chemicals from gas chromatograph <b>108</b> have flowed through detector array <b>110</b>. In some embodiments where the affinity of the coatings for their chemicals is not strong, detector array <b>110</b> can be re-usable: after all time-domain-separated chemicals have been sensed, heater <b>412</b> can be activated to heat the sensors and cause the coatings to release the respective chemicals with which they interacted, making the interaction reversible.

The top graph illustrates an example of the output of GC <b>108</b>. In this example the fluid flowing through system <b>100</b> contains seven analytes, but GC <b>108</b> could not completely separate all seven: analytes <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> were completely separated by GC<b>108</b>, as indicated by their narrow peaks on the graph, but analytes <b>4</b>-<b>5</b> could not be completely separated, nor could analytes <b>6</b>-<b>7</b>, as indicated by their broad peaks in the graph. In such an example, it can nonetheless be possible to correctly detect analytes <b>4</b>-<b>7</b> by choosing individual detectors S<b>1</b>-S<b>9</b> in detector array <b>400</b> to be selective to the analytes that GC<b>108</b> cannot separate or, put differently, to be unresponsive to analytes that are can be completely separated. For example, the second graph in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates the response of detector S<b>4</b> where detector S<b>4</b> has been chosen to be unresponsive to analytes <b>5</b>-<b>7</b>, so that detector S<b>4</b> can detect analyte <b>4</b> even though it wasn't completely separated by GC <b>108</b>. Similarly, the third graph in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates the response of detector S<b>5</b> where detector S<b>5</b> has been chosen to be unresponsive to analytes <b>4</b> and <b>7</b>, so that detector S<b>5</b> can detect analytes <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> even though they weren't completely separated by GC <b>108</b>.

In each figure, the lower graph illustrates a temperature profile (e.g., a variation of temperature with time) that is applied to a GC, while the upper graph illustrates the response of a detector coupled to that GC. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> illustrates an approach in which the GC begins at an initial temperature that is then ramped up to a target temperature at a desired ramping rate. With this temperature profile, gases <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, are separated, but other gases remain unseparated by the GC. In most situations, the input analytes/VOCs have a broad concentration distribution when entering the GC column. The spectrum becomes wider and lower as analytes are traveling within the GC column while separating from each other in time at output of GC. In most situations, some of the analyte spectrums are too wide and overlap with each other, which results in non-separated gases as show in the figure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> illustrates an alternative approach. The temperature profile is shown in the bottom graph: the temperature of the chromatograph begins at initial temperature and is then cooled (reduced or lowered) to a lower temperature. After reaching the lowest temperature desired, the cooling is followed by heating the chromatograph to an operating temperature. The results of applying the temperature profile shown in the lower graph are shown in the detector response graph. The same gases <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> are separated from the analyte, but because of the focusing effect of cooling the analyte, gases that were previously unseparated are now separated, as shown by the sharp peaks in the detector response. The cooling produces an immediate focusing effect and narrowing (sharpening) of the spectrum profile. The micro-GC is then heated to targeted temperature with the desired ramping rate to achieve analyte/VOC separation. Due to the operation of micro-GC cooling, the output spectrums are sharper compared to non-cooling operation. With sharper spectrums, gases/VOCs overlap at the micro-GC output will be reduced. As a result, more analytes can be resolved with micro-GC cooling.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">First GC <b>1402</b> includes a fluid inlet <b>1404</b> through which the analytes (e.g., volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) enter the GC and a fluid outlet <b>1406</b> through which separated chemicals exit GC <b>1402</b>. Fluid outlet <b>1406</b> is coupled by fluid connection <b>1420</b> to a first Y-splitter Y<b>1</b>. First Y splitter Y<b>1</b> is coupled to second Y-splitter Y<b>2</b> by fluid connection <b>1422</b> and to third Y-splitter Y<b>3</b> by fluid connection <b>1426</b>. Second Y-splitter Y<b>2</b> is further fluidly coupled to fluid inlet <b>1410</b> of second GC <b>1408</b> by fluid connection <b>1424</b>, and fluid outlet <b>1412</b> of GC <b>1408</b> is coupled to a detector <b>1446</b>. Similarly, third Y-splitter Y<b>3</b> is coupled to fluid inlet <b>1416</b> of GC <b>1414</b> by fluid connection <b>1428</b>, and fluid outlet <b>1418</b> of GC <b>1414</b> is coupled to a detector <b>1448</b>.</div>

Similarly, third Y-splitter Y<b>3</b> is coupled by secondary fluid connection <b>1442</b> to flow rate restrictor <b>1440</b>, and flow-rate restrictor <b>1440</b> is coupled by fluid connection <b>1438</b> to three-way valve <b>1436</b>. Three-way valve <b>1436</b> is also coupled to a source of a secondary carrier gas. A flow resistor <b>1444</b> can optionally be fluidly coupled between fluid connections <b>1430</b> and <b>1442</b>. The group of elements including the Y-splitters, the flow rate restrictors, the flow resistor, and the fluid connections among them together form a โDean switch.โ Use of the Dean switch permits the use of โheart-cutting.โ In the heart-cutting technique, one or more unresolved (i.e., un-separated) analytes from a first chromatograph (first dimension) are transferred to one or more additional chromatographs having a different polarity (second dimension) where the separation of the compounds un-separated by the first chromatograph will be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">In operation of multi-dimensional gas chromatograph <b>1400</b>, the carrier gas containing chemicals (analytes) is directed into fluid inlet <b>1404</b> of GC <b>1404</b>. Separated and unseparated analytes exit through fluid connection <b>1420</b> to Y-splitter Y<b>1</b>. At the same time, three-way valve <b>1436</b> is set to direct a secondary carrier gas into fluid connection <b>1438</b>, so that the secondary carrier gas will flow through flow rate restrictor <b>1440</b> to Y-splitter Y<b>3</b>, where a portion of the secondary gas will flow into third GC <b>1414</b> and the remaining portion will flow through Y-splitters Y<b>1</b> and Y<b>2</b> into second GC <b>1408</b>. When flow resistor <b>1444</b> is present, part of the secondary gas flows though the flow resistor. The path taken by the secondary carrier gas is illustrated by the dotted line labeled S. As a result of the flow of secondary carrier gas, the primary flow path, which carries analytes exiting from first GC <b>1402</b>, is directed into second GC <b>1408</b>, as shown by the dotted line labeled P. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> illustrates another mode of operation of multi-dimensional GC <b>1400</b> in which flow is directed into third GC <b>1414</b> instead of second GC <b>1408</b> by switching three-way valve <b>1436</b> to its other position, such that the flow path S of the secondary carrier gas now changes the primary path P. During operation, temperature profiles are applied to the individual GCs to improve separation of the analytes. Because the temperature controls of GCs are independent, in some embodiments different temperature profiles can be applied to each GC.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Embodiments are disclosed of a new method of gas analyte (e.g., chemicals such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) spectrum sharpening and separation enhancement using multi-dimensional miniaturized gas chromatography column (GC) or micro-GC configuration. Unlike the traditional bulky GC system with slow and limited temperature control flexibility, the disclosed embodiments utilizes miniaturized GC/micro-GC columns, which can be cascaded with different coating materials for gas separation analysis. The micro-GCs are small in size (can be fabricated into micro-chip size if necessary) and thus can be promptly cooled down to sub-zero temperature with a simple small cooling device (e.g., thermoelectric cooler, TE cooler), which cannot be achieved using traditional bulky GC unless liquid nitrogen is used. With simple, fast, and direct micro-GC cooling, one can achieve direct column focusing effect, which sharpens the analyte spectrum and improves the column separation power. Furthermore, the disclosed embodiments can also include a cascade of multiple micro-GCs to form a heart-cutting gas chromatography configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">The disclosed embodiments are the first implementation of a direct fast GC cooling on micro-GC with simple cooling device, which allows the possibility of achieving spectrum sharpening without using liquid nitrogen. Meanwhile, they also improve the detection limit. As a result, the disclosed embodiments can be implemented as a portable gas analysis system and significantly improve the system resolution and detection limit.</div>
