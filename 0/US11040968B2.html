<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0001">The present application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/CN2018/073640, filed on Jan. 22, 2018, which claims the priority of the Chinese Patent Application No. CN201710054224.4 filed on Jan. 22, 2017, the contents of which are incorporated herein in the present application.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a compound as shown in formula (II), a tautomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a use thereof in manufacturing a medicament for treating ASK1-related diseases.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">PRIOR ARTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family. ASK1 can be activated by a variety of stimuli including oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), LPS, TNF-α, FasL, endoplasmic reticulum stress, increased intracellular calcium concentration and the like. ASK1 responds to the variety of stimuli by activating JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, and induces a variety of apoptosis through the signals involving the mitochondrial cell death pathway. The activation and the signaling of ASK1 play an important role in a broad range of diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. Therefore, when the patient suffers from a neurodegenerative disease, a cardiovascular disease, an inflammation, an autoimmune disease, and a metabolic disease, the life of the patient can be improved by the use of the ASK1 inhibitors as therapeutic agents.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Definition and Description</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0067">Unless otherwise indicated, the following terms when used in the descriptions and the claims of the present invention have the following meanings. A specific term or phrase should not be considered indefinite or unclear in the absence of a particular definition, but should be understood in the ordinary sense. When a trade name appears herein, it is intended to refer to its corresponding commodity or active ingredient thereof. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” is used herein in terms of those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms, which are suitable for use in contact with human and animal tissues within the scope of reliable medical judgment, with no excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic reaction or other problems or complications, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0068">The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt of the compound of the present invention that is prepared by reacting the compound having a specific substituent of the present invention with a relatively non-toxic acid or base. When the compound of the present invention contains a relatively acidic functional group, a base addition salt can be obtained by bringing the neutral form of the compound into contact with a sufficient amount of base in a pure solution or a suitable inert solvent. The pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt includes a salt of sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amine or magnesium or similar salts. When the compound of the present invention contains a relatively basic functional group, an acid addition salt can be obtained by bringing the neutral form of the compound into contact with a sufficient amount of acid in a pure solution or a suitable inert solvent. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt include an inorganic acid salt, wherein the inorganic acid includes, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, bicarbonate, phosphoric acid, monohydrogen phosphate, dihydrogen phosphate, sulfuric acid, hydrogen sulfate, hydroiodic acid, phosphorous acid, and the like; and an organic acid salt, wherein the organic acid includes, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, benzoic acid, succinic acid, suberic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid, phthalic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, and methanesulfonic acid, and the like; and an salt of amino acid (such as arginine and the like), and a salt of an organic acid such as glucuronic acid and the like (refer to Berge et al., “<i>Pharmaceutical Salts”, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science </i>66: 1-19 (1977)). Certain specific compounds of the present invention that contain both basic and acidic functional groups can be converted to any base or acid addition salt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0069">Preferably, through bringing the salt into contact with a base or an acid in a conventional manner, then separating the parent compound, the neutral form of the compound is thereby regenerated. The difference between the parent form of the compound and its various salt forms lies in specific physical properties, such as different solubility in a polar solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0070">“Pharmaceutically acceptable salt” used herein belongs to a derivative of the compound of the present invention, wherein, the parent compound is modified by forming a salt with an acid or a base.

The so-called ring includes a single ring, a link ring, a spiral ring, a fused ring or a bridged ring. The number of the atom on the ring is usually defined as the member number of the ring, for example, a “5-7 membered ring” means that 5 to 7 atoms are arranged on a ring. Unless otherwise specified, the ring optionally contains 1 to 3 heteroatoms. Therefore, a “5-7 membered ring” includes, for example, phenyl, pyridinyl and piperidinyl; on the other hand, the term “5-7 membered heterocycloalkyl ring” includes pyridyl and piperidinyl, but excluding phenyl.

Nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms can optionally be oxidized (i.e., NO and S(O)p, p is 1 or 2). Nitrogen atom can be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR, wherein R is H or other substituents already defined herein). The heterocycle can be attached to the pendant group of any heteroatom or carbon atom to form a stable structure. If the resulting compound is stable, the heterocycle described herein may have a substitution at a carbon or nitrogen position. Nitrogen atom on the heterocycle is optionally quaternized. In a preferred embodiment, when the total number of S and O atom of the heterocycle is more than 1, the heteroatom is not adjacent to each other. In another preferred embodiment, the total number of S and O atom of the heterocycle is not more than 1. As used herein, the term “aromatic heterocyclic group” or “heteroaryl” refers to a stable 5-, 6- or 7-membered monocyclic or bicyclic or 7-, 8-, 9- or 10-membered bicyclic heterocyclic aromatic ring which contains carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3 or 4 ring heteroatoms independently selected from N, O and S. Nitrogen atom can be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR, wherein R is H or other substituents already defined herein). Nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i.e., NO and S(O)<sub>p</sub>, p is 1 or 2). It is worth noting that the total number of S and O atom of an aromatic heterocycle is not more than one. The bridged ring is also included in the definition of the heterocycle. A bridged ring is formed when one or more than one atom (i.e, C, O, N or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0397" num="0395">Experimental Methods:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0398" num="0396">C57BL/6 male mice were used in this study. The drug concentration in the plasma of mice subjected to intravenous or oral administration of the test compound at different time points were quantitatively determine by LC/MS/MS method, respectively, in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the tested drugs in mice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0399" num="0397">A clear solution of the test compound was injected into C57BL/6 mice via the tail vein (overnight fasting, 7-10 weeks old), and the test compound was intragastrically administered to C57BL/6 mice (overnight fasting, 7-10 weeks old). 30 μL of the blood was collected from the jugular vein or the tail vein of the animals 0.0833, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after administration, and placed in the anticoagulant tube containing EDTA-K<sub>2</sub>, followed by centrifugation at 4° C. for 15 minutes to collect the plasma. The plasma concentration was determined by LC-MS/MS. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the non-compartment model linear logarithmic trapezoidal method using WinNonlin™ Version 6.3 (Pharsight, Mountain View, Calif.) pharmacokinetic software. The experimental results were shown in Table 3:</div>
