<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to processing of lignocellulosic biomass materials containing lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose polymers.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Lignocellulosic biomass materials are renewable sources for production of amino acids for feed and food supplements, monomers and polymers for the plastic industry, and renewable sources for different types of fuels, polyol sugar substitutes (xylitol, sorbitol, manitols and the likes), and numerous other chemicals that can be synthesized from C<b>5</b> and C<b>6</b> sugars. Nonetheless, efficient and cost effective processes to extract C<b>5</b> and C<b>6</b> sugars from the biomass are still a challenge. Lignocellulosic biomass materials are composite materials that contains not only the lignocellulosic polymers, but also a wide variety of small amounts of lipophilic or amphiphilic compounds, e.g., fatty acids, rosin acids, phytosteroids, as well as proteins and ash element. When hydrolyzing the hemicellulose polymers, ester bonds on the sugar molecules can also be hydrolyzed, releasing the un-substituted sugar molecule along with a significant amount of methanol and acetic acid. Additional organic acids such as lactic acid, glucoronic acid, galacturonic acid, formic acid and levulinic acid are also typically found in cellulosic hydrolysate. In addition to these, the lignin polymer tends to release under mild hydrolyzing conditions some small chain aqueous soluble lignin molecules. Consequently, the typical hydrolysate is a very complex solution of multiple components. This poses a significant challenge in separation and refining of the sugars to obtain useful grades of the extracted sugars.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">Introduction</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The present invention relates to lignocellulosic biomass processing and refining to produce hemicellulose sugars, cellulose sugars, lignin, cellulose and other high-value products.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">An overview of the lignocellulosic biomass processing and refining according to embodiments disclosed herein is provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In general, the lignocellulosic biomass processing and refining processes include: (1) pretreatment <b>1770</b>: (2) hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b> and purification <b>1710</b>; (3) cellulose hydrolysis <b>1720</b> and cellulose sugar refining <b>1730</b>; (4) lignin processing <b>1740</b> and refining <b>1750</b>; and (5) direct lignin extraction <b>1760</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Various products can be made using these processes. For example, hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b> and purification <b>1710</b> produce a hemicellulose sugar mixture, xylose, and a xylose-removed hemicellulose sugar mixture, as well as bioenergy pellets. Cellulose hydrolysis <b>1720</b> and cellulose sugar refining <b>1730</b> processes produce a cellulose sugar mixture. Lignin processing <b>1740</b> and refining <b>1750</b> processes produce a high purity lignin and a high purity cellulose. Direct lignin extraction <b>1760</b> process produces a high purity lignin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The lignocellulosic biomass processing and refining begins with pretreatment <b>1770</b>, during which the lignocellulosic biomass can be, for example, debarked, chipped, shredded, dried, or grinded to particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">During hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b>, the hemicellulose sugars are extracted from the lignocellulosic biomass, forming an acidic hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1700</b>A and a lignocellulosic remainder stream <b>1700</b>B. The lignocellulosic remainder stream <b>1700</b>B consists of mostly cellulose and lignin. It was surprisingly discovered in the present invention that hemicellulose sugars can be effectively extracted and converted into monomeric sugars (e.g., &gt;90% of the total sugar) by treating biomass under mild conditions, e.g., with an acid in low concentrations, heat, and optionally pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The acidic hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1700</b>-A is purified in hemicellulose sugar purification <b>1710</b>, acids and impurities co-extracted with hemicellulose sugars can be easily removed from the hemicellulose sugar stream by solvent extraction (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> for more details, e.g., amine extraction <b>1831</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). Once acids and impurities are removed from the hemicellulose sugar stream, the stream is neutralized and optionally evaporated to a higher concentration. A high purity hemicellulose sugar mixture <b>1710</b>-P<b>1</b> is obtained, which can be fractionated to obtain xylose and xylose-removed hemicellulose sugar mixture <b>1710</b>-P<b>3</b>. Xylose is then crystallized to obtain xylose <b>1710</b>-P<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The lignocellulosic remainder <b>1700</b>-B contains mostly cellulose and lignin. In some methods, the lignocellulosic remainder <b>1700</b>-B can be processed to make bioenergy pellets <b>1700</b>-P, which can be burnt as fuels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In some methods, the lignocellulosic remainder <b>1700</b>-B can be directly processed to extract lignin. This process produces a high purity lignin <b>1760</b>-P<b>1</b> and a high purity cellulose <b>1760</b>-P<b>2</b>. The novel lignin purification process of the invention utilizes a limited-solubility solvent, and can produce a lignin having a purity greater than 99%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In some methods, the lignocellulosic remainder <b>1700</b>-B can be subject to cellulose hydrolysis <b>1720</b> to obtain cellulose sugar mixture <b>1730</b>-P containing mostly C<b>6</b> sugars. The novel cellulose hydrolysis process described herein allows cellulose hydrolysis of different lignocellulosic materials using a same set of equipment. Cellulose hydrolysis <b>1720</b> of the lignocellulosic remainder <b>1700</b>-B results in an acidic hydrolysate stream <b>1720</b>-A and an acidic lignin stream <b>1720</b>-B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The acidic hydrolysate stream <b>1720</b>-A is then subject to cellulose sugar refining <b>1730</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> for more details, e.g., cellulose sugar refining <b>1920</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). The acids in the acidic hydrolysate stream <b>1720</b>-A can be removed using a novel solve extraction system. The deacidified main sugar stream is further fractionated to remove oligosaccharides from monosaccharides. The acid can be recovered and the solvents can be purified and recycled. The resulting cellulose sugar mixture <b>1730</b>-P has unusually high monomeric sugar contents, particularly a high glucose content.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Acidic lignin stream <b>1720</b>-B is subject to lignin processing <b>1740</b> and lignin refining <b>1750</b> to obtain high purity lignin <b>1750</b>-P (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-21</figref> for more details). Raw lignin stream <b>1720</b>-B is first processed to remove any residual sugar and acids during lignin processing <b>1740</b>. The deacidified lignin <b>1740</b>-A is purified to obtain high purity lignin (lignin refining <b>1750</b>). The novel lignin purification process of the invention utilizes a limited-solubility solvent, and can produce a lignin having a purity greater than 99%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The sections I-VIII below illustrate lignocellulosic biomass processing and refining according to some embodiments disclosed herein. Section I discusses pretreatment <b>1770</b>. Sections II and III discuss hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b> and purification <b>1710</b>. Sections IV and V discuss cellulose hydrolysis <b>1720</b> and cellulose sugar refining <b>1730</b>. Section VI and VII discuss lignin processing <b>1740</b> and refining <b>1750</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">I. Pretreatment</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Prior to hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b>, lignocellulosic biomass can be optionally pre-treated. Pretreatment refers to the reduction in biomass size (e.g., mechanical breakdown or evaporation), which does not substantially affect the lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose compositions of the biomass. Pretreatment facilitates more efficient and economical processing of a downstream process (e.g., hemicellulose sugar extraction). Preferably, lignocellulosic biomass is debarked, chipped, shredded and/or dried to obtain pre-treated lignocellulosic biomass. Pretreatment can also utilize, for example, ultrasonic energy or hydrothermal treatments including water, heat, steam or pressurized steam. Pretreatment can occur or be deployed in various types of containers, reactors, pipes, flow through cells and the like. In some methods, it is preferred to have the lignocellulosic biomass pre-treated before hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b>. In some methods, no pre-treatment is required, i.e., lignocellulosic biomass can be used directly in the hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Optionally, lignocellulosic biomass can be milled or grinded to reduce particle size. In some embodiments, the lignocellulosic biomass is grinded such that the average size of the particles is in the range of 100-10,000 micron, preferably 400-5,000, e.g., 100-400, 400-1,000, 1,000-3,000, 3,000-5,000, or 5,000-10,000 microns. In some embodiments, the lignocellulosic biomass is grinded such that the average size of the particles is less than 10,000, 9,000, 8,000, 7,000, 6,000, 5,000, 4,000, 3,000, 1,000, or 400.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">II. Hemicellulose sugar extraction</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The present invention provides an advantageous method of extracting hemicellulose sugars from lignocellulosic biomass (hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b>). Preferably, an aqueous acidic solution is used to extract lignocellulose biomass. The aqueous acidic solution can contain any acids, inorganic or organic. Preferably, an inorganic acid is used. For example, the solution can be an acidic aqueous solution containing an inorganic or organic acid such as H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3 </sub>(which can be introduced as dissolved acid or as SO<sub>2 </sub>gas), HCl, and acetic acid. The acidic aqueous solution can contain an acid in an amount of 0 to 2% acid or more, e.g., 0-0.2%, 0.2-0.4%, 0.4-0.6%, 0.6-0.8%, 0.8-1.0%, 1.0-1.2%, 1.2-1.4%, 1.4-1.6%, 1.6-1.8%, 1.8-2.0% or more weight/weight. Preferably, the aqueous solution for the extraction includes 0.2-0.7% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and 0-3,000 ppm SO<sub>2</sub>. The pH of the acidic aqueous solution can be, for example, in the range of 1-5, preferably 1-3.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, an elevated temperature or pressure is preferred in the extraction. For example, a temperature in the range of 100-200° C., or more than 50° C., 60° C., 70° C., 80° C., 90° C., 100° C., 110° C., 120° C., 130° C., 140° C., 150° C., 160° C., 170° C., 180° C., 190° C., or 200° C. can be used. Preferably, the temperature is in the range of 110-160° C., or 120-150° C. The pressure can be in the range of 1-10 mPa, preferably, 1-5 mPa. The solution can be heated for 0.5-5 hours, preferably 0.5-3 hours, 0.5-1 hour, 1-2 hours, or 2-3 hours, optionally with a cooling down period of one hour.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Impurities such as ash, acid soluble lignin, fatty acids, organic acids such as acetic acid and formic acid, methanol, proteins and/or amino acids, glycerol, sterols, rosin acid and waxy materials can be extracted together with the hemicellulose sugars under the same conditions. These impurities can be separated from the aqueous phase by solvent extraction (e.g., using a solvent containing amine and alcohol).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">After the hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b>, the lignocellulosic remainder stream <b>1700</b>-B can be separated from the acidic hemicellulose sugar steam <b>1700</b>-A by any relevant means, including, filtration, centrifugation or sedimentation to form a liquid stream and a solid stream. The acidic hemicellulose sugar steam <b>1700</b>-A contains hemicellulose sugars and impurities. The lignocellulosic remainder stream <b>1700</b>-B contains predominantly cellulose and lignin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The lignocellulosic remainder stream <b>1700</b>-B can be further washed to recover additional hemicellulose sugars and acidic catalyst trapped inside the biomass pores. The recovered solution can be recycled back to the acidic hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1700</b>-A, or recycled back to the hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b> reactor. The remaining lignocellulosic remainder stream <b>1700</b>-B can be pressed mechanically to increase solid contents (e.g., dry solid contents 40-60%). Filtrate from the pressing step can be recycled back to the acidic hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1700</b>-A, or recycled back to the hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b> reactor. Optionally, the remaining lignocellulosic remainder <b>1700</b>-B is grinded to reduce particle sizes. Optionally, the pressed lignocellulosic remainder is then dried to lower the moisture content, e.g., less than 15%. The dried matter can be further processed to extract lignin and cellulose sugars (processes <b>1720</b> and <b>1760</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). Alternatively, the dried matter can be pelletized into pellets <b>1700</b>-P, which can be burnt as energy source for heat and electricity production or can be used as feedstock for conversion to bio oil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Alternatively, the lignocellulosic remainder stream <b>1700</b>-B can be further processed to extract lignin (process <b>1760</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). Prior to the lignin extraction, the lignocellulosic remainder stream <b>1700</b>-B can be separated, washed, and pressed as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">It was surprisingly found that hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b> can produce, in one single extraction process, a hemicellulose sugar stream containing at least 80-95% monomeric sugars. For example, the hemicellulose sugar stream can contain more than 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% monomeric sugars. In addition, the present method produces minimal amounts of lignocellulose degradation products such as furfural, levulinic acid, and formic acid. In addition, a xylose yield greater than 93% of theoretical value can be achieved. Overall, 18-27% of total sugars and at least 70%, 75%, or 80% or more of the hemicellulose sugars can be extracted using the present method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The acidic hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1700</b>-A is then subject to hemicellulose sugar purification <b>1710</b>. Various hemicellulose sugar products can be obtained from the purification. Exemplary purified products include hemicellulose sugar mixture <b>1710</b>-P<b>1</b>, xylose <b>1710</b>-P<b>2</b>, and xylose-removed hemicellulose sugar mixture <b>1710</b>-P<b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">III. Hemicellulose sugar purification</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Prior to hemicellulose sugar purification <b>1710</b>, the acidic hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1700</b>-A from the hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b> can be optionally filtered, centrifuged, or concentrated by evaporation. For example, the hemicellulose sugar stream can be contacted with strong acid cation exchanger (e.g., in H<sup>+</sup> form) to convert all salts to their respective acids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">The hemicellulose sugar purification is illustrated in greater details according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the acidic hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1800</b>-A is first subject to a strong cation exchange resin and then amine extraction <b>1831</b>, during which acids and impurities are extracted from the hemicellulose sugar stream into the amine extractant. The acids-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1831</b>-A is then purified by ion exchange <b>1832</b>, including a strong acid cation exchanger <b>1833</b> and optionally followed by a weak base anion exchanger <b>1834</b>. The amine-removed and neutralized hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1832</b>-A is optionally evaporated <b>1835</b> to form a hemicellulose sugar mixture <b>1836</b>. Optionally, the amine removed and neutralized hemicelluloses sugar stream <b>1832</b>-A may also be refined by contact with granulated activated carbon prior to evaporation <b>1835</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">The hemicellulose sugar mixture <b>1836</b> can be optionally fractionated (process <b>1837</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) to obtain high purity C<b>5</b> sugars such as xylose. Fractionation can be carried out by any means, preferably using a simulated moving bed (SMB) or sequential simulated moving bed (SSMB). Examples of simulated moving bed processes are disclosed, for instance, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,379,554, 5,102,553, 6,093,326, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,187,204, examples of sequential simulated moving bed processes can be found in GB 2 240 053 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,332,623 as well as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,379,751 and 4,970,002, each of the contents of the entirety of which is incorporated herein by this reference. In an exemplary SMB or SSMB setup, resin bed is divided into a series of discrete vessels, each of which sequence through a series of 4 zones (feed, separation, feed/separation/raffinate and safety) and connected by a recirculation loop. A manifold system connects the vessels and directs, in appropriate sequence to (or from) each vessel, each of the four media accommodated by the process. Those media are generally referred to as feed, eluent, extract and raffinate. For example, a feed can be hemicellulose sugar mixture <b>1836</b>, the eluent can be water, the extract is an enriched solution of xylose and the raffinate is an aqueous solution containing high molecular weight sugars and other monomeric sugars i.e. arabinose, galactose and glucose. Optionally, the eluent can be an aqueous solution comprising low concentration of hydroxide ion to maintain the resin in hydroxyl form, or the eluent can be an aqueous solution comprising low concentration of acid to maintain the resin in a protonated form. For example, a feed comprising 30% sugar mix where xylose is about 65-70% of the mix can be fractionated using a SSMB to obtain an extract comprising about 16-20% sugars where xylose is about 82% or more and a raffinate comprising 5-7% sugar mix with only 15-18% xylose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">When a SSMB is used for fractionation, xylose exits from the extract flow and the higher sugars as well as glucose, galactose and arabinose exit from the raffinate flow. The xylose stream <b>1837</b>-A can optionally be refined by contacting with granulated activated carbon and refined with mixed bed prior to evaporation to higher concentration (process <b>1838</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The refined xylose stream <b>1839</b>-A is then optionally evaporated again and crystallized (see, e.g., processes denoted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> by the number <b>1841</b>). The products are xylose crystal <b>1842</b> and xylose-removed hemicellulose sugar mixture <b>1843</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">The amine extractant stream <b>1831</b>-A can be back-extracted with an aqueous solution containing a base (e.g., sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and magnesium hydroxide) (see, e.g., process denoted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> by the number <b>1850</b>). A portion of the solvent can be further purified using a lime solution (e.g. calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, or a combination thereof) (see, e.g., process denoted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> by the number <b>1860</b>) and the purified solvent can be recycled back to the amine extraction <b>1831</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">Specific embodiments of hemicellulose sugar purification (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Several preferred embodiments of hemicellulose sugar purification are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, during hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>101</b>, at least portion of the hemicellulose and impurities are extracted from lignocellulosic biomass by liquid extracting (e.g., using an acidic aqueous solution) to produce an acidic hemicellulose sugar stream and a lignocellulosic remainder stream. In some embodiments, hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>101</b> employs pressure cooking (e.g., 120-150° C., 1-5 mPa).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">A more detailed description of these exemplary hemicellulose sugar purification embodiments is provided below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">1. Amine Extraction</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">As discussed above, the hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1800</b>-A can be extracted with an amine extractant containing an amine base and a diluent, to remove mineral acid(s), organic acids, furfurals, acid soluble lignins (see, e.g., the processes denoted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> by the number X<b>02</b>, where X is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 depending on the figures; process <b>1831</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The extraction can be carried out by any method suitable for extracting acids. Preferably, the hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1800</b>-A is extracted with an amine extractant counter-currently, e.g., the hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1800</b>-A flows in an opposite direction to the flow of the amine extractant. The counter-current extraction can be carried out in any suitable device, e.g., a mixer-settler device, stirred tanks, columns, or any other equipment suitable for this mode of extraction. Preferably, the amine extraction is conducted in a mixer-settler designed to minimize emulsion formation and reduce phase separation time. A mixer-settler has a first stage that mixes the phases together followed by a quiescent settling stage that allows the phases to separate by gravity. Various mixer-settlers known in the art can be used. In some methods, phase separation may be enhanced by incorporating a suitable centrifuge with the mixer-settler.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Typically, the vast majority of the sugars remain in the acid-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1831</b>-B, whereas much of the organic or inorganic acids (e.g., the acids used in hemicellulose sugar extraction) and impurities are extracted into the amine extractant stream <b>1831</b>-A. The amine extractant stream <b>1831</b>-A can be contacted with an aqueous stream in a counter current mode, to recover any residual sugars absorbed into the amine extractant stream. In some embodiments, the amine extractant stream <b>1831</b>-A contains less than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1% w/w hemicellulose sugars. In some embodiments, the acid-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1831</b>-B contains less than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1% w/w acid. In some embodiments, the acid-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1831</b>-B contains less than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1% w/w amine. In some embodiments, the acid-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1831</b>-B contains less than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1% w/w impurities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">The amine extractant can contain 10-90% or preferably 20-60% weight/weight of one or a plurality of amines having at least 20 carbon atoms. Such amine(s) can be primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. Examples of tertiary amines include tri-laurylamine (TLA; e.g. COGNIS ALAMINE 304 from Cognis Corporation; Tucson Ariz.; USA), tri-octylamine, tri-isooctylamine, tri-caprylylamine and tri-decylamine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Diluents suitable for use in the amine extraction include an alcohol such as butanol, isobutanol, hexanol, octanol, decanol, dodecanol, tetradecanol, pentadecanol, hexadecanol, octadecanol, eicosanol, docosanol, tetracosanol, and triacontanol. Preferably, the diluent is a long chain alcohol (e.g. C<b>6</b>, C<b>8</b>, C<b>10</b>, C<b>12</b>, C<b>14</b>, C<b>16</b> alcohol), or kerosene. The diluent can have additional components. More preferably, the diluent comprises n-hexanol or 2-ethyl-hexanol. Most preferably, the diluent comprises n-hexanol. In some embodiments, the diluent consists essentially of, or consists of, n-hexanol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Optionally, the diluent contains one or more additional components. In some methods, the diluent contains one or more ketones, one or more aldehydes having at least 5 carbon atoms, or another alcohol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">Preferably, the amine is tri-laurylamine and the diluent is hexanol. The ratio of amine and diluent can be any ratio, e.g., between 3:7 and 6:4 weight/weight. In some methods, the amine extraction solution contains tri-laurylamine and hexanol in a ratio of 1:7, 2:7, 3:7, 6:4, 5.5:4.55, 4:7, 5:7, 6:7, 7:7, 5:4, 3:4, 2:4, or 1:4 weight/weight. Preferably, the amine extraction solution contains tri-laurylamine and hexanol in a ratio of 3:7 weight/weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The amine extraction can be conducted at any temperature at which the amine is soluble, preferably at 50-70° C. Optionally, more than one extraction steps (e.g., 2, 3, or 4 steps) can be used. The ratio of the amine extractant stream (organic phase) to the hemicellulose sugar stream <b>1800</b>-A (aqueous phase) can be 0.5-5:1, 1-2.5:1, or preferably, 1.5-3.0:1 weight/weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">2. Back extraction</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">The amine extractant stream <b>1831</b>-A contains mineral and organic acid, as well as impurities extracted from biomass and sugar degradation products. The acids can be extracted from the amine extractant stream <b>1831</b>-A in a back extraction step (see, e.g., the processes denoted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> by the number X<b>03</b>, where X is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 respectively; process <b>1850</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Optionally, prior to the back extraction <b>1850</b>, the amine extractant stream <b>1831</b>-A can be washed with an aqueous solution to recover any sugars in the stream. Typically, after the washing, the amine extractant stream <b>1831</b>-A has less than 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.05% sugars.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The back extraction medium is an aqueous solution containing a base. For example, the extraction medium can be a solution containing NaOH, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, MgO, or NH<sub>4</sub>OH. The concentration of the base can be 1-20% by weight/weight, preferably 4-10% by weight/weight. Preferably, the base of choice produces a soluble salt when reacted with the acids in the acid-loaded organic stream. Preferably, the amount of the base in the back extraction medium is 2-10% excess over the stoichiometric equivalent of acids in the organic stream.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">Back extraction <b>1850</b> can be carried out in any device, e.g., a mixer-settler device, stirred tanks, columns, or any other equipment suitable for this mode of back extraction. Preferably, the back extraction is conducted in a mixer-settler designed to minimize emulsion formation and reduce phase separation time, e.g., a mixer-settler equipped with low emulsifying mixers for high rate separation, or in tandem with a centrifuge to enhance separation. Back extraction can result in removal of at least 93% of the mineral acid and at least 85% of the organic acid from the organic phase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Back extraction <b>1850</b> can be carried out in multiple reactors. In one example, back extraction <b>1850</b> is carried out in 4 reactors. In the first reactor, the amount of base is equivalent to that of carboxylic acid and only the carboxylic acids is back-extracted to produce a solution of their salt(s) (e.g. sodium salt). In the second reactor, the mineral acid is back-extracted. The streams coming out of each reactor is treated separately to allow recovering of the organic acids. Optionally, the aqueous streams coming out of the back extraction steps can be combined. Typically, the combined stream contains at least 3% of the anion of the mineral acid (e.g. sulfate ion if sulfuric and/or sulfurous acids where used in hemicellulose sugar extraction <b>1700</b>), and 0.2-3% acetic acid as well as lower concentrations of other organic acids. The aqueous stream can contain low concentration of the organic phase diluent, typically less than 0.5%, depending on the solubility of the diluent used in water. Preferably, the aqueous stream coming out of back extraction is kept to allow segregation of chemicals present in these streams. In one example, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 50<sub>4</sub> <sup>2−</sup>, which are deleterious to anaerobic digestion, is routed separately to aerobic treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The organic phase diluent may be removed from the aqueous phase by distillation, where in many cases these diluents may form a heterogeneous azeotrope with water that has a lower boiling point than the diluent solvent alone, thus the energy required to distill off the diluent is significantly reduced due to the vast excess of water over the diluent. The distilled solvent can be recovered and recycled back into the solvent reservoir for further use. The diluent-stripped aqueous phase may be directed to the waste treatment unit of the plant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">3. Solvent purification</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">The amine extractant stream, now neutralized after acid removal, can be washed with water to remove salts remaining from the back extraction. It is particularly preferred for certain blended extractants that can partially saturate with water (as is the case of certain alcohols for example). The wash stream may be combined with the back extraction aqueous stream. A fraction of the washed amine extractant, typically 5-15% of the total weight of the amine extractant stream, can be diverted to the purification and filtration step denoted as X<b>04</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> (see, also, process <b>1860</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The remaining amine extractant is recycled to amine extraction denoted as X<b>02</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">The fraction diverted to purification step (X<b>04</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>; process <b>1860</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) can be treated with a lime suspension (e.g., a 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% weight/weight lime solution). The solvent to lime suspension ratio can be in the range 4-10, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, or 9-10. Treatment may be conducted in any suitable device, e.g., a thermostatic mixed tank. The solution can be heated for at least 1 hour at 80-90° C. Lime reacts with residual organic acids and esters of organic acids and adsorbs effectively organic impurities present in the organic phase such as acid soluble lignin and furfurals, as visualized by change of color from dark to light. The contaminated lime and impurities can be filtered or centrifuged to recover the purified organic phase, which is washed with water and recycled back to the amine extraction step (X<b>02</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>; process <b>1831</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The aqueous stream may be diverted to other aqueous waste streams. Any solid cake that may be formed by the lime reaction may be used in the waste water treatment plant as a neutralization salt for residual acids from ion exchange regenerations for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The back extraction aqueous stream contains salts of the organic acids. This stream can be contacted with a cation exchanger to convert all salts to their respective organic acids (see, e.g., the processes denoted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 5 and 6</figref> by the number X<b>05</b> where X is 2, 5, or 6 respectively). Alternatively the organic acids can be converted to the acid form by acidifying the solution with a strong mineral acid. The acidified stream can be distilled to harvest formic acid and acetic acid (see, e.g., the processes denoted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 5 and 6</figref> by the number X<b>06</b> where X is 2, 5, or 6 respectively). Remaining aqueous streams are diverted to waste.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">4. Sugar purification</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The acid-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream can be further purified (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>). For example, the diluent in the acid-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream can be removed using a packed distillation column. The distillation can remove at least 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95% of the diluent in the acid-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream. With or without diluent distillation step, the acid-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream can also be contacted with a strong acid cation (SAC) exchanger to remove any residual metallic cations and any residual amines. Preferably, the acid-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream is purified using a packed distillation column followed by a strong acid cation exchanger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">Preferably, the acid-depleted hemicellulose sugar stream can then be contacted with a weak base anion (WBA) exchanger to remove excess protons. The amine-removed and neutralized hemicellulose sugar stream can be pH adjusted and evaporated to 25-65% and preferably 30-40% weight/weight dissolved sugars in any conventional evaporator, e.g., a multiple effect evaporator or a mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) evaporator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">Any residual solvent present in the hemicellulose sugar stream can also be removed by evaporation. For example, the solvent that forms a heterogeneous azeotrope with water can be separated and returned to the solvent cycle. Optionally the concentrated sugar solution can be contacted with activated carbon to remove residual organic impurities. The concentrated sugar solution may also be contacted with mixed bed resin system to remove any residual ions or color bodies. Optionally, the now refined sugar solution can be concentrated further by and conventional evaporator or MVR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The resulting stream is a highly purified hemicellulose sugar mixture (e.g., <b>1836</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) comprising, e.g., 85-95% weight/weight monosaccharides out of the total dissolved sugars. The composition of the sugars depends on the composition of the starting biomass. A hemicellulose sugar mixture produced from softwood biomass can have 65-75% (weight/weight) C<b>6</b> saccharides in the sugar solution out of total sugars. In contrast, a hemicellulose sugar mixture produced from hardwood biomass can contain 80-85% weight/weight C<b>6</b> sugars out of total sugars.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0017" num="0000">5. Sugar fractionation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Some biomass materials contain a high concentration of a single sugar as part of their hemicellulosic sugar composition. For example, eucalyptus and bagasse contain high concentration of xylose. A single sugar such as xylose has specific application and much greater industrial value as compared to a sugar mixture. Therefore, it is highly beneficial to fractionate the sugar stream to obtain a high concentration of the single sugar to facilitate sugar crystallization and production of high purity single sugar product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">The hemicellulose sugar mixture <b>1836</b> can be optionally concentrated by evaporation, and fractionated <b>1837</b> (e.g., by chromatographic separation) to produce a xylose-enriched stream <b>1837</b>-A having more than 75, 78, 80, 82, 84, 85, 86, 88, 90% xylose, and a xylose-removed hemicellulose sugar mixture <b>1837</b>-B.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">The chromatographic fractionation to achieve enrichment of xylose concentration can be carried out with ion exchange resins (e.g., a cation exchange resin and an anion exchange resin) as the column filling material. The cation exchange resins include strong acid cation exchange resins and weak acid cation exchange resins. The strong acid cation exchange resins can be in a monovalent or multivalent metal cation form, e.g., in H<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> form. Preferably, the resins are in Na<sup>+</sup> form. The strong acid cation exchange resins typically have a styrene skeleton, which is preferably cross-linked with 3 to 8%, preferably 5 to 6.5% of divinylbenzene. The weak acid cation exchange resins may be in a monovalent or multivalent metal cation form, e.g., H<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> form, preferably in Na<sup>+</sup> form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">The chromatographic fractionation can be carried out in a batch mode or a simulated moving bed (SMB) mode or a sequential simulated moving bed (SSMB) mode. The temperature of the chromatographic fractionation is typically in the range of 20 to 90° C., preferably 40 to 65° C. The pH of the solution to be fractionated can be acidic or adjusted to a range of 2.5-7, preferably 3.5-6.5 and most preferably 4-5.5. Typically, the fractionation can be carried out with a linear flow rate of about 1 m/h-10 m/h in the separation column.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Anion exchange resins have usually been used in the past for demineralization of solutions, i.e., for ion exchange, or for decolorization, i.e., for adsorption. In some embodiments of the invention, there can be little or no net ion exchange or adsorption between the resin and the solution. In that case, an anion-type ion exchange resin is used for its properties as a chromatographic substrate, rather than in a column intended primarily for net exchange of ions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Chromatographic separation differs from other column-based separations (e.g., ion-exchange or adsorption) in that no major component in the feed mixture is retained by the sorbent so strongly as to require that additional reagents be routinely used between cycles to regenerate the column by removing strongly retained components before the next separation cycle. In general, a chromatographic column can be re-used for multiple cycles before regeneration before the columns require some degree of periodic cleansing or regeneration. The function of an ion-exchange or adsorption column is to bind components tightly, necessarily requiring frequent regeneration for the resin to be reused. By contrast, the function of a chromatographic column is to provide differential mobility for components moving through the column to effect a separation, but not to bind too tightly to the principal components. Regeneration of a chromatographic column may be needed from time to time due to incidental binding of minor components or impurities to the resin. The minimal quantity of reagents needed for resin regeneration is a major advantage of chromatographic separations over ion-exchange separations. The operational cost of chromatographic separations is due primarily to the energy needed to evaporate water (or other solvent) from dilute products, and to a lesser extent to the infrequent replacement or regeneration of resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">A preferred method for large-scale chromatographic separations is the sequential simulated moving bed (SSMB), or alternatively a simulated moving bed (SMB). Both methods use a number of columns packed with a suitable sorbent and connected in series. There are inlet ports for feed and solvent (which may include recycled solvent), and outlet ports for two or more products (or other separated fractions). The injection of the mixture solution to be separated is periodically switched between the columns along the direction of the liquid flow, thereby simulating continuous motion of the sorbent relative to the ports and to the liquid. The SMB is a continuous counter current type operation. SSMB is a more advance method, requiring a sequential operation. Its advantages over SMB and over other older methods include: fewer number of columns is needed in the SSMB method versus the SMB, hence less resin is required and hence associated cost of installation is significantly reduced in large system; the pressure profile is better controlled, facilitating the use of more sensitive resins; achievable recovery/purity is higher than obtained with SMB systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Fractionation of xylose from the refined mix sugar solution X<b>09</b> (X denotes 4, 5, or 6 in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>; process <b>1837</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) can be preferably achieved using a strong base anion (SBA) exchanger having a particle size of ˜280-320 μm. This larger particle size is advantageous over much smaller particles sizes used in U.S. Pat. No. 6,451,123. A larger particle size reduces the back pressure of the column to industrially practical range. Suitable commercial SBA resins can be purchased from Finex (AS 510 GC Type I, Strong Base Anion, gel form), similar grades can be purchased from other manufacturers including Lanxess AG, Purolite, Dow Chemicals Ltd. or Rohm &amp; Haas. The SBA resin may be in the sulfate or chloride form, preferably in the sulfate form. The SBA is partially impregnated with hydroxyl groups by low concentration NaOH, the range of base to sulfate is 3-12% to 97-88% respectively. To maintain this level of OH groups on the resin, a low level of NaOH, sufficient to replace the hydroxyl removed by sugar adsorption, may be included in the desorption pulse, thus making the xylose retain longer than other sugars on this resin. Fractionation may be conducted in the SSMB mode at about 40-50° C., resulting in a xylose rich stream, containing at least 79%, at least 80%, at least 83%, preferably at least 85% xylose out of total sugars, and a mix sugar stream, at a recovery of at least 80%, at least 85% xylose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">In some methods, the SSMB sequence includes three steps. In the first step, a product stream is extracted by exposing and flushing the adsorbent with a desorbent stream (“desorbent to extract” step). Concurrently, a feed stream in passed into the adsorbent and a raffinate stream is flushed from the adsorbent (“feed to raffinate” step). In the second step, a raffinate stream is extracted by exposing and flushing the adsorbent with a desorbent stream (“desorbent to raffinate” step). In the third step, the desorbent is recycled back to the adsorbent (“recycle” step).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Typically, the product is extracted in such a manner that the raffinate flow equals the desorbent flow but it results in a high desorbent consumption to reach the target product recovery. Preferably, in some SSMB sequences, the product is extracted in more than one step (e.g., not only in step 1, but also in step 2). In some methods, the product stream is not only extracted in the first step, but also extracted in the second step (i.e., the “desorbent to raffinate” step). When the product is extracted in more than one step, the desorbent flow rate is equal to the sum of the extract flow rate and the raffinate flow rate. In some embodiments, the desorbent flow rate is about the same as the sum of the extract flow rate and the raffinate flow rate. In some embodiments, the desorbent flow rate is within 50-150%, 60-140%, 70-130%, 80-120%, 90-110%, 95-105%, 96-104%, 97-103%, 98-102%, 99-101%, or 99.5-100.5%, of the sum of the extract flow rate and the raffinate flow rate. This change in the SSMB sequence decreases the required desorbent, resulting in the target product recovery with much less desorbent volume while maintaining the SSMB chromatographic profiles in the four (4) zones and six (6) columns and purity.</div>

Once hemicellulose sugar is extracted, it is much easier to mill or grind the lignocellulosic remainder.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">Compared to ungrounded particles such as chips, ground particles can be suspended in the hydrolysis liquid, and can be circulated from container to container. Ground particles from different lignocellulosic biomass materials can be processed by the same set of equipments using similar or same operating parameters. Reduced particle size greatly accelerates the downstream cellulose hydrolysis process. Preferably, the lignocellulosic biomass is grinded such that the average size of the particles is in the range of 100-10,000 micron, preferably 400-5,000, e.g., 100-400, 400-1,000, 1,000-3,000, 3,000-5,000, or 5,000-10,000 microns.

This counter current system is advantageous for acid hydrolysis of cellulose sugars. When multiple tanks are used, the system enables separate temperature control for each individual tank.

If moisture content is higher than 15%, the ground lignocellulosic remainder is dried to have moisture 15%. The hydrolysis system includes a number of n stirred tanks (e.g., n=1-9, preferably 4) connected in series as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. The aqueous liquid in the tank, containing acid, dissolved sugar and suspended biomass is recycled by a high pressure high flow rate pump causing stirring of the solution in each tank. The flow line is also fitted with a solid/liquid separation device (e.g., a filter, a membrane, or a hydrocylone) that allows at least some of the liquid and dissolved molecules, i.e. acid and sugars, to permeate thereby producing a permeate (or filtrate) stream. At least some of the feed liquid is retained by the solid/liquid separation device to produce retentate stream thus producing stirring of the liquid in the reactor. Super azeotropic HCl solution with acid concentration of at least 41% is fed into tank n. The permeate of the separation unit of tank n is fed into reactor n-<b>1</b> while at least part of the retentate is recycled back into tank n. The permeate of tank n-<b>1</b> is fed into tank n-<b>2</b> while the retentate is recycled back into tank n-<b>1</b> and so on. The permeate exiting tank <b>1</b> of the series is the acidic hydrolysate stream <b>1720</b>-A. The solids concentration in each stirred tank reactor can be maintained between 3-15%, 3-5%, 5-10%, or 10-15% weight/weight. Overall, the biomass is retained in the system over 10 to 48 hours.

In some embodiments, the acidic hydrolysate stream <b>1720</b>-A can contain more than 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, dissolved sugars.

The <b>1700</b>-B stream is pre-hydrolyzed by the aqueous acid hydrolysate stream from the intermediate reactor before it is contacted with the strong acid in the first reactor. Preferably, the pre-hydrolysis mixture is heated to a temperature in the range of 15 to 60° C., preferably 25 to 40° C., most preferably 40° C. for 5 minutes to 1 day, preferably 15-20 minutes. In one example, eucalyptus is hydrolyzed using stirred tank reactors. Upon initial introduction of the eucalyptus wood into the acid, viscosity initially increases as a result of fast dissolution of oligomers of cellulosic sugars, the high viscosity hinders the ability to pump and recirculate the aqueous solution through the system; the short stirring of ground lignocellulosic remainder stream <b>1700</b>-B with intermediate reactor hydrolysate at elevated temperature accelerates further hydrolysis of the dissolved oligomers to monomer, accompanied with decrease in viscosity. In another example, eucalyptus is first contacted with acid solution coming out of stage <b>2</b> (i.e. concentration ˜33%) at 35-50° C. for 15-20 minutes. The pre-hydrolyzed eucalyptus can be fed into the system much faster and is further hydrolyzed in the stirred tank reactors.</div>

The S<b>1</b> solvent suitable for use in the extraction is a solvent that has a boiling point at 1 atm between 100° C. and 200° C. and forms a heterogeneous azeotrope with water. In some S<b>1</b> solvents, the heterogeneous azeotrope has a boiling point at 1 atm of less than 100° C. For example, the S<b>1</b> solvent can be a solvent containing an alcohol or kerosene. Examples of alcohols suitable for making a S<b>1</b> solvent include butanol, isobutanol, hexanol, octanol, decanol, dodecanol, tetradecanol, pentadecanol, hexadecanol, octadecanol, eicosanol, docosanol, tetracosanol, and triacontanol.

Optionally, the extraction can be conducted in multiple extraction columns, e.g., two extraction columns. In the first column, the acid is extracted into the extractant, leaving the acid concentration in the sugar stream less than azeotrope. The extractant leaving the column 1 can be optionally washed with azeotropic acid water solution to recover any sugars absorbed in the extractant back to the water solution, which can be recycled in the hydrolysis. The sugar stream, now having less than azeotropic acid concentration, is distilled. The sugar solution is re-concentrated, thereby achieving a higher acid concentration again. The re-concentrated sugar solution can be extracted with the extractant to remove residual acid. Overall the acid recovery can be more than 97.5%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">A portion (e.g., 5-20, 10-15%) of the extractant washed with azeotropic acid water solution can be purified by various methods to remove acids, esters, soluble impurities such as furfurals and phenols. For example, the extractant can be purified by liming as disclosed in WO2012018740 (incorporated herein by reference for all purposes). Preferably, the extractant is treated with lime at a 10% concentration. Preferably, the purification is conducted using 5-10:1 lime to solvent ratio. The mixture is heated for, e.g., 1 hour at 85° C. The residual salts in the mixture can be removed by separation means such as filtration or centrifugation. The purified extractant is then recycled back to the washed extractant. 3.

Lime reacts with residual organic acids and esters of organic acids and adsorbs effectively organic impurities present in the organic phase such as acid soluble lignin and furfurals, as visualized by change of color from dark to light. The contaminated lime and impurities can be filtered or centrifuged to recover the purified organic phase, which is washed with water and recycled back to the S<b>1</b> solvent extraction <b>1921</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0230">After the cellulose hydrolysis, the remaining residues in the lignocellulosic biomass are mostly lignins. The present invention provides methods of making novel lignin compositions using a unique processing and refining system. An exemplary method of lignin processing according to some embodiments of the present invention is provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> (process <b>2000</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0031" num="0000">1. Lignin Washing</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0231">The lignin washing process <b>2020</b> is designed to remove free sugars and hydrochloric acid, which remain with acidic lignin stream <b>1720</b>-B coming from the last reactor of the stirred tank reactors. Optionally, wet grinding <b>2010</b> of lignin prior to washing is conducted. The wet grinding <b>2010</b> contributes to an increase in washing efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">The lignin washing process <b>2020</b> can use various numbers of washing stages (e.g., two washing stages). In some method, 2-9 or 3-10 washing stages are used. Each washing stage can consist of a separator (e.g., a hydroclone, screen, filter, membranes) where the mixture of acid, sugar, and lignin solids is separated with the liquid stream moving to the previous stage and the concentrated lignin solids stream moving to the next stage of washing. The temperature of each washing stage can be the same or different. For example, the last stage can be conducted at a slightly elevated temperature as compared to early reactors, e.g. 25° C.-40° C. versus 10° C.-20° C. Preferably, the method uses a 7-stage counter-current system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0233">In some methods, each washing stage is carried out in a hydro-cyclone. The pressure in the hydro-cyclones can be 40 to 90 psig. In some methods, two wash streams serve more than two hydro-cyclones. For example, the first wash stream has an HCl concentration of 40 to 43% and the second wash stream has an HCl concentration of 32 to 36%. The first wash stream can enter the first hydro-cyclone and the second wash stream enters the last hydro-cyclone. Optionally, washing temperature increases as HCl concentration decreases in the wash.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">Preferably, the wash system is counter current with an azeotropic acid solution added to the last washing stage. The lignin containing free sugars and concentrated acid enters the first washing stage. Use of azeotropic concentration is advantageous as it does not dilute the solution with water, that later necessitates re-concentration of the acid solution at increased cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">Optionally, the wash system is counter current with a weak acid wash (5-20% HCl concentration) added to the last washing stage. The lignin containing free sugars and concentrated acid enters the first washing stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236">The multi stage washing process can remove up to 99% of the free sugars and 90% of the excess acid entering the washing process with the lignin. The washed lignin leaves the last stage for further processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0237">As discussed above in connection with acid recovery during sugar refining process, the acid-loaded extractant can be back-extracted with water to recover the acids. The recovered acid stream contains about 15-23% acids at a temperature around 50° C. Preferably, this recovered acid stream is used for lignin washing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">The exiting acid stream from lignin washing can contain up to 38-42% acid, which can be recycled in hydrolysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0239">The lignin exiting lignin washing can contain 0.5-1.5% sugars. The lignin can be pressed to remove excess liquid. The pressed lignin can contain up to 35-50% solids, and preferably less than 1% residual sugars and 13-20% HCl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0032" num="0000">2. Deacidification</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0240">The washed (and optionally pressed) lignin <b>2020</b>-A is then deacidified by contacting with a hydrocarbon solvent <b>2040</b>-A (process <b>2040</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). Optionally, wet grinding <b>2030</b> prior to contacting is conducted. The wet grinding contributes to an increase in efficiency of de-acidification. This increased efficiency is in terms of a reduced time for contacting and/or a reduction in the ratio of wash stream to feed stream.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0241">Various hydrocarbon solvents can be used. Preferably, the hydrocarbon has a boiling point at atmospheric pressure between 100-250° C., 120-230° C., or 140-210° C. Examples of hydrocarbons suitable for the present invention include dodecane and various isoparaffinic fluids (e.g. ISOPAR G, H, J, K, L or M from ExxonMobil Chemical, USA). In some methods, the selected isoparaffinic fluid is substantially insoluble in water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0242">In some deacidification processes, the hydrocarbon solvent is mixed with lignin to make a slurry. For example, the hydrocarbon solvent is mixed with lignin in a ratio of hydrocarbon (e.g., Isopar K) to dry lignin is about 7/1; 9/1; 11/1; 15/1; 30/1; 40/1 or 45/1 w/w (or intermediate or greater ratios). Preferably, 9 parts of hydrocarbon (e.g., Isopar K) are contacted with 1 part of washed lignin stream (e.g. about 20% solid lignin on as is basis).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">The mixture is then evaporated to remove acid from the slurry. The acid evaporates together with the hydrocarbon solvent. The evaporated acid can be recovered and recycled in the hydrolysis process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">De-acidified lignin stream can include less than 2%, 1.5%, 1.0%, 0.5%, 0.3%, 0.2% or 0.1% HCl. De-acidified lignin stream can contain at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% solid lignin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">Optionally, the de-acidified lignin is dried to remove the hydrocarbon solvent. Preferably, the dried, de-acidified lignin has less than 5% solvent and less than 0.5% acid.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">The dried, de-acidified lignin can be pelletized to make fuel pellets, or it can be further processed to produce novel lignin compositions as described below.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">According to some exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the lignin (e.g., the de-acidified lignin) is solubilized to generate an aqueous lignin solution. For example, the lignin can be solubilized by a pulping, a milling, a biorefining process selected from kraft pulping, sulfite pulping, caustic pulping, hydro-mechanical pulping, mild acid hydrolysis of lignocellulose feedstock, concentrated acid hydrolysis of lignocellulose feedstock, supercritical water or sub-supercritical water hydrolysis of lignocellulose feedstock, ammonia extraction of lignocellulose feedstock.

Preferably, the alkali solubilization <b>2110</b> is conducted for about 6 hours (e.g. at 182° C.). An increase in cooking time and/or in cooking temperature contributes to an increase in lignin fragmentation and/or degradation.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">As discussed above in connection with hemicellulose sugars extraction, the present invention in one aspect provides a novel method of extracting lignin directly from lignocellulosic biomass after hemicellulose sugars are extracted. The method utilizes a limited-solubility solvent, and works well with biomass particles of various sizes. Therefore, it is not necessary to grind the particles prior to lignin extraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0276">The extraction of hemicellulose sugars from the biomass results in a lignin-containing remainder. In some methods, the extraction of hemicellulose sugars does not remove a substantial amount of the cellulosic sugars. For example, the extraction of hemicellulose sugars does not remove more than 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60% weight/weight cellulose. In some methods, the lignin-containing remainder contains lignin and cellulose. In some methods, the lignin-containing remainder contains less than 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 2, 1% hemicellulose. In some embodiments, the lignin can be directly extracted from lignocellulosic biomass without removing hemicellulose sugars.</div>

Examples of limited-solubility solvents suitable for the present invention include methylethylketone, diethylketone, methyl isopropyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, mesityl oxide, diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, 2,4-pentanedione, 2,5-dimethylfuran, 2-methylfuran, 2-ethylfuran, 1-chloro-2-butanone, methyl tert-butyl ether, diisopropyl ether, anisole, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, ethyl formate, isopropyl acetate, propyl acetate, propyl formate, isopropyl formate, 2-phenylethanol, toluene, 1-phenylethanol, phenol, m-cresol, 2-phenylethyl chloride, 2-methyl-2H-furan-3-one, y-butyrolactone, acetal, methyl ethyl acetal, dimethyl acetal, morpholine, pyrrol, 2-picoline, 2,5-dimethylpyridine. Optionally, the limited-solubility solvent includes one or more of esters, ethers and ketones with 4 to 8 carbon atoms. For example, the limited-solubility solvent can include ethyl acetate. Optionally, the limited-solubility solvent consists essentially of, or consists of, ethyl acetate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0279" num="0278">The ratio of the limited-solubility solvent to water suitable for carrying out the lignin extraction can vary depending on the biomass material and the particular limited-solubility solvent used. In general, the solvent to water ratio is in the range of 100:1 to 1:100, e.g., 50:1-1:50, 20:1 to 1:20, and preferably 1:1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0279">Various inorganic and organic acids can be used for lignin extraction. For example, the solution can contain an inorganic or organic acid such as H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HCl, acetic acid and formic acid.

Preferably, the aqueous solution for the extraction and hydrolysis includes 0.6-5%, preferably 1.2-1.5% acetic acid. The pH of the acidic aqueous solution can be, for example, in the range of 0-6.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0280">Elevated temperatures and/or pressures are preferred in lignin extraction. For example, the temperature of lignin extraction can be in the range of 50-300° C., preferably 160 to 200° C., e.g., 175-185° C. The pressure can be in the range of 1-10 mPa, preferably, 1-5 mPa.

An exemplary method of hydrolysis of cellulose by cellulase according to some embodiments of the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. In some exemplary embodiments, cellulose hydrolysis and cellulose sugar refining can be carried out under conditions identical or similar to those described above in sections IV and V.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0282">Optionally, the pH of the solvent is adjusted to 3.0 to 4.5 (e.g., 3.5-3.8). At this pH range, the lignin is protonated and is easily extracted into the organic phase. The organic phase comprising solvent and lignin is contacted with strong acid cation exchanger to remove residual metal cations. To obtain high purity solid lignin, the limited-solubility solvent is separated from lignin, e.g., evaporated. Preferably, the limited-solubility solvent can be separated from lignin by mixing the solvent solution containing acidic lignin with water at an elevated temperature (e.g., 80° C.). The precipitated lignin can be recovered by, e.g., filtration or centrifugation. The solid lignin can be dissolved in any suitable solvents (e.g., phenylethyl alcohol) for making lignin solutions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0283">Alternatively, the limited-solubility solvent solution containing acidic lignin can be mixed with another solvent (e.g., toluene).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0285">To utilize the energy stored in organic solutes and to comply with environmental requirements, aqueous waste streams that contain organic matter can be treated in anaerobic digesters to produce methane, which can be burned. However, anaerobic digesters are known to be poisoned by too high levels of sulfate ions per a given chemical oxygen demand (COD) level, and are also limited to the incoming stream having less than 400 ppm calcium ions to prevent calcium carbonate build up in the digester. The aqueous waste streams produced in various stages of the current invention as described above comply with these requirements. Furthermore, as disclosed above, back extraction may be conducted in several steps allowing better control of the inorganic ion level versus the organic matter.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0478" num="0480">HCl catalyzes both hydrolysis of oligomeric sugars and oligomerization of monomeric sugars.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0479" num="0481">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26<i>a </i> </figref>and secondary hydrolysis unit <b>240</b>: in some embodiments, the input sugar concentration has an excess of oligomers relative to equilibrium conditions. Dilution with the oligomer cut returning from chromatography unit <b>270</b> shifts the monomer: oligomer balance even further away from equilibrium conditions. Under these conditions, HCl drives the reaction in the direction of hydrolysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0480" num="0482">The sugar composition leaving hydrolysis unit <b>240</b> is much closer to equilibrium conditions, since oligomers have been hydrolyzed. However, evaporation <b>260</b> might shift the balance to monomeric excess. If this occurs, HCl would tend to catalyze re-oligomerization of monomers. The chromatographic separation <b>270</b> is operated according to an embodiment at a sugars concentration significantly higher than that of secondary hydrolysis <b>240</b>. In order to avoid re-oligomerization during the concentration of the sugars, acid <b>156</b> is removed by contacting with an anion exchanger <b>251</b> in some embodiments of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0481" num="0483">In equilibrium of the secondary hydrolysis reaction, the ratio between monomeric sugars and oligomeric sugars is a function of the total sugar concentration. The kinetics of the reaction is set by the temperature and by the HCl concentration. The choice of temperature and HCl concentration is a matter of optimization, taking into account capital and operating costs. In any case, equilibrium may be reached. Alternatively, the reaction may be stopped prior to reaching equilibrium. It is a matter of optimization of several factors such as degradation of monomeric sugars and operational and capital costs. In some embodiments, the secondary hydrolysis is stopped when it reaches at least 70, 75, 80, 85, or 90% by weight of the equilibrium ratio or intermediate or greater percentages.</div>

(The complete disclosures of these seventeen patents, which are owned by Cargill, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minn., are incorporated herein by reference.) There has been general interest in developing improved techniques for generation and isolation of lactic acid. Also, because of their potential commercial value, there is great interest in isolation of the other valuable related lactate products such as lactide, lactate esters and amides, and oligomers; see e.g. the same 17 patents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0512" num="0514">In general, large amounts of lactic acid can be readily generated by the conduct of large-scale, industrial, microbial fermentation processes, particularly using sugars produced by exemplary methods as described herein, such as dextrose, in the media, along with suitable mineral and amino acid based nutrients. Typically, such productions occur at broth temperatures of at least 45° C., usually around 48° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0513" num="0515">Issues of concern with respect to lactic acid generation include, inter alia, appropriate control of pH within the fermentation system to ensure proper environment for microbial action, separation and isolation of either or both of lactic acid and lactate salts from the fermentation process and downstream isolation and production involving the isolated lactic acid or lactic acid derived product.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0626" num="0632">Pine (ref A1202102-5): Fresh Loblolly pine chips (145.9 Lb dry wood) were fed into a Rapid Cycle Digester (RDC, Andritz, Springfield, Ohio. An acid aqueous solution (500 Lb) was prepared by adding 0.3% H2SO4 and 0.2% SO2 to water in a separate tank. The solution was heated to 135° C. and then added to the digester to cover the wood. The solution was circulated through the wood for 40 minutes while maintaining the temperature. After 60 minutes, the resulting liquor was drained to a liquor tank and using steam the wood was blown to a cyclone to collect the wood (128.3 Lb dry wood) and vent the vapor. The extracted wood was analyzed for sugar content, carbohydrate composition, ash, elements (by ICP), and DCM extractives. The analyses of the hemi depleted lignocellulose material show extraction of 42.4% Arabinan, 10.5% Galactan, 9.6% Xylan, 14.3% Manan, and 11.8% Glucan, indicating that mostly hemicellulose is extracted. Analyses also show 11.6% of “others”, including ASL, extractives and ash. The overall fraction of carbohydrates in the remaining solid is not different within the error of the measurement to that of the starting biomass due to this removal of “others”. It is however easily notices that the extracted woodchips are darker in color and are more brittle than the fresh biomass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0627" num="0633">Pine (ref A1204131-14(K1)): Fresh Loblolly pine chips (145.9 Lb dry wood) were fed into a Rapid Cycle Digester (RDC, Andritz, Springfield, Ohio. An acid aqueous solution (500 Lb) was prepared by adding 0.3% H2SO4 and 0.2% SO2 to water in a separate tank. The solution was heated to 135° C. and then added to digester to cover the wood. The solution was circulated through the wood for 180 minutes while maintaining the temperature. After 180 minutes, the resulting liquor was drained to a liquor tank and using steam the wood was blown to a cyclone to collect the wood (121.6 Lb dry wood) and vent the vapor. The material was analyzed as described above. The analyses of the hemi depleted lignocellulose material show extraction of 83.9% Arabinan, 84.3% Galactan, 50.1% Xylan, 59.8% Manan and no extraction of glucan, indicating effective extraction of hemicellulose. Analyses also show extraction of 21.8% of “others” including lignin, extractives and ash.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0628" num="0634">Eucalyptus (ref A120702K6-9): Fresh Eucalyptus Globulus chips (79.1 Kg dry wood) were fed into a Rapid Cycle Digester (RDC, Andritz, Springfield, Ohio). An acid aqueous solution was prepared by adding 0.5% H2SO4 and 0.2% SO2 to water in a separate tank. The solution was heated to 145° C. and then added to digester to cover the wood. The solution was circulated through the wood for 60 minutes while maintaining the temperature, then heating was stopped while circulation continued for another 60 minute, allowing the solution to cool. After 120 minutes, the resulting liquor was drained to a liquor tank and using steam the wood was blown to a cyclone to collect the wood (58.8 Kg dry wood) and vent the vapor. The material was analyzed as described above. Analyses showed that 20.1% of the carbohydrates were extracted from the wood (dry wood base) xylose containing 70% of these sugars, 91% of the sugars in the liquor present as monomers. Under these conditions acetic acid concentration in the liquor was 3.6% (dry wood base) showing maximal removal of acetate groups from hemicellulose sugars; 4.2% (dry wood base) of acid soluble lignin. These results indicate effective extraction of hemicellulose and in particularly xylose, along with hydrolysis of the acetate groups from substituted xylosans. At the same time a significant amount of acid soluble lignin, extractives and ash are also extracted into the liquor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0630" num="0636">The acidic hemicellulose sugar stream resulting from hemicellulose sugar extraction of Eucalyptus chips (as exemplified in Example 2) was used in this small scale experiment. The aqueous stream before the extraction was prepared by extracting eucalyptus in a solution containing 0.5% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and 0.2% SO<sub>2</sub>, separating the liquid from the solid, and contacting the liquid with a strong cation exchange resin. The results provided were obtained in a batch experiment, where the organic phase (amine extractant; tri-laurylamine:hexanol ratio 3:7) to aqueous phase (hemicellulose sugar stream) ratio was 4:1, contact time 15 minutes at 60° C. A highly efficient extraction of sulfuric acid and acetic acid is observed, along with good extraction of acid soluble lignin (75%) and minimal loss of sugars (2%) into the organic phase.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0639" num="0645">Bagasse sugar composition (DB4D01): Baggase was shredded in a wood shredder. In a temperature controlled tank, 60 Lb bagasse (dry base) was then treated with an aqueous solution containing 0.5% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, at a liquid to solid ratio of 14.2. The average temperature of the temperature controlled tank was maintained at 130-135° C. for 3 hours. The solution was circulated by pumping. The resulting liquor was collected, and the solids were washed with water. The wash water was then used to prepare the acid solution for the next batch by adding acids as needed. The hemicellulose-depleted lignocellulosic matter was collected and dried.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0640" num="0646">The acidic hemicellulose sugar stream ran through a SAC column. The sugar stream was then extracted continuously in a series of mixer settlers (2 stages) with an extractant having tri-laurylamine:hexanol at a ratio of 30:70. The extractant to sugar stream ratio was kept in the range of 2:1 to 1.5:1. The resulting aqueous phase was further purified by using a SAC resin, a WBA resin, a granulated active carbon and a mixed bed resin. The pH of the resulting stream was adjusted to 4.5 with 0.5% HCl and the sugar solution was evaporated to a concentration of ˜30% DS. The resulting sugar stream contains about 7% arabinose, 2.5% galactose, 6.5% glucose, 65% xylose, 1.5% mannose, 4% fructose and 14% oligosaccharides (all % weight/total sugars). This sugar solution was further processed by fractionation on an SSMB system, resulting in a xylose rich fraction and a xylose depleted fraction. Each fraction was concentrated by evaporation. Table 5B provides a chemical analysis of the resulting xylose rich sugar solution.</div>

<heading id="h-0119">Fractionation of Xylose from Hemicellulose Sugar Mixture</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0642" num="0648">Xylose was fractionated from hemicellulose sugar mixture containing 17% weight/weight glucose, 71% weight/weight xylose, 7% weight/weight arabinose, 0.3% weight/weight galactose, 0.2% weight/weight mannose, and 5% weight/weight mixed dimeric saccharides. The composition of this mixture is representative for hemicellulose sugar compositions from hardwood chips (e.g., Eucalyptus chips) and some grasses (e.g., bagasse).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0643" num="0649">A pulse test was conducted utilizing 250 ml of Finex AS 510 GC, Type I, SBA, gel form, styrene divinylbenzene copolymer, functional group trimethylamine, specific gravity 1.1-1.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, mean bead size 280 millimicrons. The gel was in the sulfate form. It was pre-conditioned with 1.5 bed volume (BV) of 60 mM OFF, adjusting the resin to 8-12% OH and leaving the remainder in the sulfate form. A 5 ml sample was injected, followed by water elution at 3 ml/min. Effective fractionation of xylose from the mixture was observed, with the mix sugars peaking at 0.61 and 0.65 BV, and xylose peaking at 0.7 BV. The pulse test results are described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0644" num="0650">In a pulse test, a column was loaded with a sample, and washed with an eluent. Elution fractions were collected and analyzed. For different sugars, the elution resulted in different interaction with the column materials, which lead to different elution profiles. Based on elution profile, it can be determined whether the elution conditions can be applied to a continuous method (e.g., SSMB) to fractionate sugars. An exemplary elution profile is provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0645" num="0651">A pulse test chromatogram demonstrates that xylose eluting last, and all other monomeric sugars and oligomers elute first. The separation demonstrated is sufficient to support scaling up of this chromatographic fractionation to a simulated moving bed (SMB) mode or sequential simulated moving bed (SSMB) continuous system.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0647" num="0653">The stirred tank hydrolysis reactor system is described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. An automatically controlled and monitored 4-tank system was used. Milled hemicellulose-depleted lignocellulose material (e.g., particles of an average size ˜1400 microns) is suspended in an aqueous solution containing approximately 33% HCl and 8% sugar. The suspension has about 5% solids. The suspension is fed to tank <b>1</b> at a rate of 5 gph. Simultaneously, a 42% HCl solution is fed at approximately 2 gph to tank <b>4</b>. The solution at each tank is circulated by a pump at a rate of 50 gpm to adequately keep the solution in the tank mixed and allow good cross sectional flow through the a separation membrane which is part of the flow loop. The permeate from the membrane of tank <b>1</b> is diverted to the hydrolysate collection tank for de-acidification and refining. The retentate of tank <b>1</b> is returned to the tank for further hydrolysis, and a portion of the flow is transferred to tank <b>2</b> in order to maintain a constant level in tank <b>1</b>. All the tanks in series are set at the same parameters of permeate flow and level control. Typical acid and sugar concentrations are depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. The temperature of each tank is typically held at 60° F., 55° F., 50° F., 50° F. for tanks <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> respectively. The retentate for tank <b>4</b> is transferred to the lignin washing process based on the same level control.</div>

Once these oligomers continue to hydrolyze to smaller units viscosity drops down sharply. It was observed that, when reactor <b>0</b> was used, the average % sugar at all stages increased. Typically this hydrolysis system yields greater than 97% of the cellulosic and remains of hemicellulosic polymers to dissolve in the hydrolysate as oligomeric and monomeric sugars.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0654" num="0660">The solvent from the main extraction process extracts along with acid and water much of the impurities present in the hydrolysate. In addition, organic acids react under the acidic conditions to form esters with the alcoholic solvent (e.g., hexyl acetate, hexyl formate). A fraction (e.g., ˜10%) of the back extracted solvent from the previous extraction process was separated and treated with lime (e.g., with an aqueous phase containing 10% lime slurry). By doing so, these impurities were removed. The lime addition was set at approximately a 1.5 weight % of the hexanol charged to the reactor. The 2 phase system was agitated at 80° C. for 3 hours. The solution was then cooled to &lt;50° C., the phases were separated in a mixer settler and the solvent phase was washed with water before returning to the extraction solvent feed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0668" num="0674">After hemicellulose sugars were extracted from eucalyptus chips, the remainder was mainly cellulose and lignin. The remainder was delignified using an aqueous organic solution containing acetic acid according to the process described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0669" num="0675">Eucalyptus wood chips (20.0 g) were mixed with a solution of 50/50 v/v of methylethylketone (MEK) and water that contains 1.2% acetic acid w/w of solution at a ratio of 1:10 (100 mL water, 100 mL MEK, and 2.2 g acetic acid). The mixture was treated at 175° C. for 4 hours in an agitated reactor. Then the system was allowed to cool to 30° C. before the reactor is opened. The slurry was decanted and the solid is collected for further analysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0670" num="0676">After the reaction, there was 127 g free liquid, of which 47.2 g organic and 79.8 g aqueous. The organic phase contained 1.1 g acetic acid, 10.4 g water, and 5.5 g dissolved solids (0.1 g sugars and 5.4 g others, which is mainly lignin). The aqueous phase contained 1.4 g acetic acid, 2.1 g dissolved solids (1.5 g sugars and 0.6 g other).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0671" num="0677">After decanting of the liquid, black slurry and white precipitate were at the bottom of the bottle. This material was vacuum-filtered and washed thoroughly with 50/50 v/v MEK/water (119.3 g MEK 148.4 g water) at room temperature until the color of the liquid became very pale yellow. Three phases were collected; organic 19.7 g, aqueous 215 g, and white solid 7 g dry. The organic phase contained 0.08 g acetic acid and 0.37 g dissolved solids. The aqueous phase contained 0.56 g acetic acid and 0.6 g dissolved solids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0672" num="0678">All organic phases were consolidated. The pH of the solution is adjusted to pH 3.8. The solution was then allowed to separate into an aqueous phase (containing salts) and an organic phase (containing lignin). The lignin-containing organic phase was recovered and purified using a strong acid cation column. The organic solution was then added drop-wise into an 80° C. water bath to precipitate the lignin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0673" num="0679"> <sup>13</sup>C Solids State NMR analysis of the white precipitate indicates that it comprises mostly cellulose (pulp). The amount of lignin is not detectable. The reaction is successful in delignifying the eucalyptus wood chips.</div>

<heading id="h-0139">Analysis of Hydrolyzed Cellulose Sugars from Pine Wood</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0674" num="0680">Pine wood chips were subject to hemicellulose sugar extraction as described in Examples 1 and 2. The cellulose hydrolysis was carried out using a simulated moving bed hydrolysis system as described in PCT/US2011/057,552 (incorporated herein by reference for all purposes). The cellulose sugar purification was conducted as described in Examples 8 and 9. A strong base anion exchanger was used instead of amine extraction for sugar purification similar to example 10 (all is the same except that the amine is in a solid phase, which is the SBA resin). The compositions of the cellulose sugars were described in the table below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0685" num="0691">Cellulose pulp (eucalyptus pulp) was obtained as the remainder after the hemicellulose and lignin extraction. Cellulose pulp suspension having 10-20% solids in 0.05M acetate buffer, pH 4.55, 5%/cellulose, cellulase:cellobiase 1:1 was prepared. The suspension was stirred at 55° C. Samples of the liquor were taken periodically for analysis of the dissolved sugars. The dissolving sugars were mostly glucose, but can also include some residual hemicellulose sugars remaining in the pulp. The dissolved sugar contained 7.78% lignin and 94.22% holocellulose, (89.66% glucose). As % solids increased, overall yield decreased (so long as the enzyme loading is the same). However the yield was higher compared to a reference sample hydrolyzed under the same conditions using Sigmacell (Sigma #S5504 from cotton linters, type 50, 50 um), as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref>. the cellulose pulp is well saccharified by the cellulase mix enzyme (although it still contains some residual lignin). the reaction rate of E-HDLM is higher than the reference material</div>
