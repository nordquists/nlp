<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">Technical Field</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to communication systems, and more particularly, to usage of a synchronization signal block index for scrambling.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">Introduction</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various telecommunication services such as telephony, video, data, messaging, and broadcasts. Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. An example telecommunication standard is 5G New Radio (NR). 5G NR is part of a continuous mobile broadband evolution promulgated by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet new requirements associated with latency, reliability, security, scalability (e.g., with Internet of Things (IoT)), and other requirements. Some aspects of 5G NR may be based on the 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. There exists a need for further improvements in 5G NR technology. These improvements may also be applicable to other multi-access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects.

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, components, circuits, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as “elements”). These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware, computer software, or any combination thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">By way of example, an element, or any portion of an element, or any combination of elements may be implemented as a “processing system” that includes one or more processors. Examples of processors include microprocessors, microcontrollers, graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs), application processors, digital signal processors (DSPs), reduced instruction set computing (RISC) processors, systems on a chip (SoC), baseband processors, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), state machines, gated logic, discrete hardware circuits, and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. One or more processors in the processing system may execute software. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, instruction sets, code, code segments, program code, programs, subprograms, software components, applications, software applications, software packages, routines, subroutines, objects, executables, threads of execution, procedures, functions, etc., whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, in one or more example embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or encoded as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes computer storage media. Storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise a random-access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage, other magnetic storage devices, combinations of the aforementioned types of computer-readable media, or any other medium that can be used to store computer executable code in the form of instructions or data structures that can be accessed by a computer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless communications system and an access network <b>100</b>. The wireless communications system (also referred to as a wireless wide area network (WWAN)) includes base stations <b>102</b>, UEs <b>104</b>, and an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) <b>160</b>. The base stations <b>102</b> may include macro cells (high power cellular base station) and/or small cells (low power cellular base station). The macro cells include base stations. The small cells include femtocells, picocells, and microcells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The base stations <b>102</b> (collectively referred to as Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN)) interface with the EPC <b>160</b> through backhaul links <b>132</b> (e.g., S1 interface). In addition to other functions, the base stations <b>102</b> may perform one or more of the following functions: transfer of user data, radio channel ciphering and deciphering, integrity protection, header compression, mobility control functions (e.g., handover, dual connectivity), inter-cell interference coordination, connection setup and release, load balancing, distribution for non-access stratum (NAS) messages, NAS node selection, synchronization, radio access network (RAN) sharing, multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS), subscriber and equipment trace, RAN information management (RIM), paging, positioning, and delivery of warning messages. The base stations <b>102</b> may communicate directly or indirectly (e.g., through the EPC <b>160</b>) with each other over backhaul links <b>134</b> (e.g., X2 interface). The backhaul links <b>134</b> may be wired or wireless.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The base stations <b>102</b> may wirelessly communicate with the UEs <b>104</b>. Each of the base stations <b>102</b> may provide communication coverage for a respective geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. There may be overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>. For example, the small cell <b>102</b>′ may have a coverage area <b>110</b>′ that overlaps the coverage area <b>110</b> of one or more macro base stations <b>102</b>. A network that includes both small cell and macro cells may be known as a heterogeneous network. A heterogeneous network may also include Home Evolved Node Bs (eNBs) (HeNBs), which may provide service to a restricted group known as a closed subscriber group (CSG). The communication links <b>120</b> between the base stations <b>102</b> and the UEs <b>104</b> may include uplink (UL) (also referred to as reverse link) transmissions from a UE <b>104</b> to a base station <b>102</b> and/or downlink (DL) (also referred to as forward link) transmissions from a base station <b>102</b> to a UE <b>104</b>. The communication links <b>120</b> may use multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, including spatial multiplexing, beamforming, and/or transmit diversity. The communication links may be through one or more carriers. The base stations <b>102</b>/UEs <b>104</b> may use spectrum up to Y MHz (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 100 MHz) bandwidth per carrier allocated in a carrier aggregation of up to a total of Yx MHz (x component carriers) used for transmission in each direction. The carriers may or may not be adjacent to each other. Allocation of carriers may be asymmetric with respect to DL and UL (e.g., more or less carriers may be allocated for DL than for UL). The component carriers may include a primary component carrier and one or more secondary component carriers. A primary component carrier may be referred to as a primary cell (PCell) and a secondary component carrier may be referred to as a secondary cell (SCell).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Certain UEs <b>104</b> may communicate with each other using device-to-device (D2D) communication link <b>192</b>. The D2D communication link <b>192</b> may use the DL/UL WWAN spectrum. The D2D communication link <b>192</b> may use one or more sidelink channels, such as a physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH), a physical sidelink discovery channel (PSDCH), a physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH), and a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH). D2D communication may be through a variety of wireless D2D communications systems, such as for example, FlashLinQ, WiMedia, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, LTE, or NR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The wireless communications system may further include a Wi-Fi access point (AP) <b>150</b> in communication with Wi-Fi stations (STAs) <b>152</b> via communication links <b>154</b> in a 5 GHz unlicensed frequency spectrum. When communicating in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, the STAs <b>152</b>/AP <b>150</b> may perform a clear channel assessment (CCA) prior to communicating in order to determine whether the channel is available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The small cell <b>102</b>′ may operate in a licensed and/or an unlicensed frequency spectrum. When operating in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, the small cell <b>102</b>′ may employ NR and use the same 5 GHz unlicensed frequency spectrum as used by the Wi-Fi AP <b>150</b>. The small cell <b>102</b>′, employing NR in an unlicensed frequency spectrum, may boost coverage to and/or increase capacity of the access network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The gNodeB (gNB) <b>180</b> may operate in millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies and/or near mmW frequencies in communication with the UE <b>104</b>. When the gNB <b>180</b> operates in mmW or near mmW frequencies, the gNB <b>180</b> may be referred to as an mmW base station. Extremely high frequency (EHF) is part of the RF in the electromagnetic spectrum. EHF has a range of 30 GHz to 300 GHz and a wavelength between 1 millimeter and 10 millimeters. Radio waves in the band may be referred to as a millimeter wave. Near mmW may extend down to a frequency of 3 GHz with a wavelength of 100 millimeters. The super high frequency (SHF) band extends between 3 GHz and 30 GHz, also referred to as centimeter wave. Communications using the mmW/near mmW radio frequency band has extremely high path loss and a short range. The mmW base station <b>180</b> may utilize beamforming <b>184</b> with the UE <b>104</b> to compensate for the extremely high path loss and short range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The EPC <b>160</b> may include a Mobility Management Entity (MME) <b>162</b>, other MMEs <b>164</b>, a Serving Gateway <b>166</b>, a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) Gateway <b>168</b>, a Broadcast Multicast Service Center (BM-SC) <b>170</b>, and a Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway <b>172</b>. The MME <b>162</b> may be in communication with a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) <b>174</b>. The MME <b>162</b> is the control node that processes the signaling between the UEs <b>104</b> and the EPC <b>160</b>. Generally, the MME <b>162</b> provides bearer and connection management. All user Internet protocol (IP) packets are transferred through the Serving Gateway <b>166</b>, which itself is connected to the PDN Gateway <b>172</b>. The PDN Gateway <b>172</b> provides UE IP address allocation as well as other functions. The PDN Gateway <b>172</b> and the BM-SC <b>170</b> are connected to the IP Services <b>176</b>. The IP Services <b>176</b> may include the Internet, an intranet, an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), a PS Streaming Service, and/or other IP services. The BM-SC <b>170</b> may provide functions for MBMS user service provisioning and delivery. The BM-SC <b>170</b> may serve as an entry point for content provider MBMS transmission, may be used to authorize and initiate MBMS Bearer Services within a public land mobile network (PLMN), and may be used to schedule MBMS transmissions. The MBMS Gateway <b>168</b> may be used to distribute MBMS traffic to the base stations <b>102</b> belonging to a Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) area broadcasting a particular service, and may be responsible for session management (start/stop) and for collecting eMBMS related charging information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The base station may also be referred to as a gNB, Node B, evolved Node B (eNB), an access point, a base transceiver station, a radio base station, a radio transceiver, a transceiver function, a basic service set (BSS), an extended service set (ESS), or some other suitable terminology. The base station <b>102</b> provides an access point to the EPC <b>160</b> for a UE <b>104</b>. Examples of UEs <b>104</b> include a cellular phone, a smart phone, a session initiation protocol (SIP) phone, a laptop, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a satellite radio, a global positioning system, a multimedia device, a video device, a digital audio player (e.g., MP3 player), a camera, a game console, a tablet, a smart device, a wearable device, a vehicle, an electric meter, a gas pump, a large or small kitchen appliance, a healthcare device, an implant, a display, or any other similar functioning device. Some of the UEs <b>104</b> may be referred to as IoT devices (e.g., parking meter, gas pump, toaster, vehicles, heart monitor, etc.). The UE <b>104</b> may also be referred to as a station, a mobile station, a subscriber station, a mobile unit, a subscriber unit, a wireless unit, a remote unit, a mobile device, a wireless device, a wireless communications device, a remote device, a mobile subscriber station, an access terminal, a mobile terminal, a wireless terminal, a remote terminal, a handset, a user agent, a mobile client, a client, or some other suitable terminology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in certain aspects, the UE <b>104</b>/base station <b>180</b> may be configured to scramble/descramble information based on an SS block index (or any part or subset of the SS block index), where the SS block index indexes a particular SS block within an SS burst within an SS burst set (<b>198</b>). The information may be scrambled based on the SS block index before being transmitted and/or may be descrambled based on the SS block index after being received.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a diagram <b>200</b> illustrating an example of a DL subframe within a 5G/NR frame structure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a diagram <b>230</b> illustrating an example of channels within a DL subframe. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a diagram <b>250</b> illustrating an example of an UL subframe within a 5G/NR frame structure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> is a diagram <b>280</b> illustrating an example of channels within an UL subframe. The 5G/NR frame structure may be FDD in which for a particular set of subcarriers (carrier system bandwidth), subframes within the set of subcarriers are dedicated for either DL or UL, or may be TDD in which for a particular set of subcarriers (carrier system bandwidth), subframes within the set of subcarriers are dedicated for both DL and UL. In the examples provided by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2C</figref>, the 5G/NR frame structure is assumed to be TDD, with subframe 4 a DL subframe and subframe 7 an UL subframe. While subframe 4 is illustrated as providing just DL and subframe 7 is illustrated as providing just UL, any particular subframe may be split into different subsets that provide both UL and DL. Note that the description infra applies also to a 5G/NR frame structure that is FDD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Other wireless communication technologies may have a different frame structure and/or different channels. A frame (10 ms) may be divided into 10 equally sized subframes (1 ms). Each subframe may include one or more time slots. Each slot may include 7 or 14 symbols, depending on the slot configuration. For slot configuration 0, each slot may include 14 symbols, and for slot configuration 1, each slot may include 7 symbols. The number of slots within a subframe is based on the slot configuration and the numerology. For slot configuration 0, different numerologies 0 to 5 allow for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 slots, respectively, per subframe. For slot configuration 1, different numerologies 0 to 2 allow for 2, 4, and 8 slots, respectively, per subframe. The subcarrier spacing and symbol length/duration are a function of the numerology. The subcarrier spacing may be equal to 2<sup>μ</sup>*15 kKz, where μ is the numerology 0-5. The symbol length/duration is inversely related to the subcarrier spacing. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A, 2C</figref> provide an example of slot configuration 1 with 7 symbols per slot and numerology 0 with 2 slots per subframe. The subcarrier spacing is 15 kHz and symbol duration is approximately 66.7 μs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">A resource grid may be used to represent the frame structure. Each time slot includes a resource block (RB) (also referred to as physical RBs (PRBs)) that extends 12 consecutive subcarriers. The resource grid is divided into multiple resource elements (REs). The number of bits carried by each RE depends on the modulation scheme.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, some of the REs carry reference (pilot) signals (RS) for the UE (indicated as R). The RS may include demodulation RS (DMRS) and channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS) for channel estimation at the UE. The RS may also include beam measurement RS (BRS), beam refinement RS (BRRS), and phase-noise tracking RS (PT-RS).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates an example of various channels within a DL subframe of a frame. The physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH) is within symbol 0 of slot 0, and carries a control format indicator (CFI) that indicates whether the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) occupies 1, 2, or 3 symbols (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a PDCCH that occupies 3 symbols). The PDCCH carries downlink control information (DCI) within one or more control channel elements (CCEs), each CCE including nine RE groups (REGs), each REG including four consecutive REs in an OFDM symbol. A UE may be configured with a UE-specific enhanced PDCCH (ePDCCH) that also carries DCI. The ePDCCH may have 2, 4, or 8 RB pairs (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows two RB pairs, each subset including one RB pair). The physical hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ) (HARQ) indicator channel (PHICH) is also within symbol 0 of slot 0 and carries the HARQ indicator (HI) that indicates HARQ acknowledgement (ACK)/negative ACK (NACK) feedback based on the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). The primary synchronization channel (PSCH) may be within symbol 6 of slot 0 within subframes 0 and 5 of a frame. The PSCH carries a primary synchronization signal (PSS) that is used by a UE <b>104</b> to determine subframe/symbol timing and a physical layer identity. The secondary synchronization channel (SSCH) may be within symbol 5 of slot 0 within subframes 0 and 5 of a frame. The SSCH carries a secondary synchronization signal (SSS) that is used by a UE to determine a physical layer cell identity group number and radio frame timing. Based on the physical layer identity and the physical layer cell identity group number, the UE can determine a physical cell identifier (PCI). Based on the PCI, the UE can determine the locations of the aforementioned DL-RS. The physical broadcast channel (PBCH), which carries a master information block (MIB), may be logically grouped with the PSCH and SSCH to form a synchronization signal (SS)/PBCH block. The MIB provides a number of RBs in the DL system bandwidth, a PHICH configuration, and a system frame number (SFN). The physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) carries user data, broadcast system information not transmitted through the PBCH such as system information blocks (SIBs), and paging messages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, some of the REs carry demodulation reference signals (DMRS) for channel estimation at the base station. The UE may additionally transmit sounding reference signals (SRS) in the last symbol of a subframe. The SRS may have a comb structure, and a UE may transmit SRS on one of the combs. The SRS may be used by a base station for channel quality estimation to enable frequency-dependent scheduling on the UL.</div>

A physical random access channel (PRACH) may be within one or more subframes within a frame based on the PRACH configuration. The PRACH may include six consecutive RB pairs within a subframe. The PRACH allows the UE to perform initial system access and achieve UL synchronization. A physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) may be located on edges of the UL system bandwidth. The PUCCH carries uplink control information (UCI), such as scheduling requests, a channel quality indicator (CQI), a precoding matrix indicator (PMI), a rank indicator (RI), and HARQ ACK/NACK feedback. The PUSCH carries data, and may additionally be used to carry a buffer status report (BSR), a power headroom report (PHR), and/or UCI.</div>

Layer 1, which includes a physical (PHY) layer, may include error detection on the transport channels, forward error correction (FEC) coding/decoding of the transport channels, interleaving, rate matching, mapping onto physical channels, modulation/demodulation of physical channels, and MIMO antenna processing. The TX processor <b>316</b> handles mapping to signal constellations based on various modulation schemes (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM)). The coded and modulated symbols may then be split into parallel streams. Each stream may then be mapped to an OFDM subcarrier, multiplexed with a reference signal (e.g., pilot) in the time and/or frequency domain, and then combined together using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to produce a physical channel carrying a time domain OFDM symbol stream. The OFDM stream is spatially precoded to produce multiple spatial streams.

The PSS, SSS, and PBCH may be time division multiplexed and/or frequency division multiplexed with the SS block (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the PSS, SSS, and PBCH time division multiplexed within an SS block). While <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the PSS, SSS, and PBCH as consecutive in time, the PSS, SSS, and PBCH may be non-consecutive in time, and therefore may be spaced from each other by one or more slots/symbols (i.e., may not be adjacent to each other in time). The SS block may include other signals/channels, and therefore other signals/channels other than the PSS, SSS, and PBCH may be multiplexed into the SS block. One or multiple SS blocks make up an SS burst. The number of SS blocks n in an SS burst may vary. SS blocks may or may not be consecutive with respect to the corresponding SS block index.

As illustrated in the diagram <b>500</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, an SS burst includes a plurality of SS blocks corresponding to SS block indices 0, 1, . . . , 7. A subset <b>502</b> of the SS blocks (see indices 2, 5, in this example) may be preconfigured such that they may be off (i.e., not transmitted) to allow for transmission of an UL control block instead. As illustrated in the diagram <b>550</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, different bands may have different SS burst configurations. For example, in band X, an SS burst may include SS blocks 0, 1, . . . , 7, with SS blocks 2, 5 being preconfigured for on/off to allow for transmission of an UL control block instead.

The time length of the SS burst set may be N*10 ms, where N is an integer. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the periodicity (period P<sub>1</sub>) of an SS burst in an SS burst set is how often an SS burst is transmitted in an SS burst set. The periodicity of beam sweeping (period P<sub>2</sub>) is how often a beam sweeping SS burst repeats itself in an SS burst set. A UE may use repetitive SS bursts in an SS burst set to filter a reference signal received power (RSRP) over time for the same beam direction and/or to train sub-arrays.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">As discussed supra, the SS block index may be used to indicate an SS block within an SS burst or within an SS burst set. When the SS block index is used to indicate an SS block within an SS burst, SS bursts may have an SS burst index to indicate the particular SS burst within an SS burst set. As such, an SS block index can indicate an SS block within an SS burst within an SS burst set (e.g., SS block indices are 0, 1, . . . , n*K−1 for SS blocks in an SS burst set, where there are n SS blocks per SS burst and K SS bursts in an SS burst set), or the combination of an SS block index and an SS burst index can indicate an SS block within an SS burst within an SS burst set (e.g., SS block indices are 0, 1, . . . , n−1 for SS blocks in each SS burst set, and SS burst indices are 0, 1, . . . , K−1 for SS bursts in an SS burst set). Herein, SS block index may refer to one or more indices for indicating an SS block within an SS burst within an SS burst set. A mapping function may be used to map an SS block index to a logic index.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">At <b>712</b>, the base station <b>704</b> scrambles information based on the determined SS block index. The base station <b>704</b> may scramble the information by generating a scrambling sequence based on a sequence/scrambling initialization that is based at least in part on the SS block index. For example, the scrambling initialization for scrambling the information may be based on any subset of the SS block index. For another example, the scrambling initialization for scrambling the information may be based on both a subset of the SS block index and the cell ID of the base station <b>704</b> (N<sub>ID</sub> <sup>CELL</sup>). If the SS block index is m bits, the subset of the SS block index may include 1 to m bits. In one example, the subset of the SS block index may be X least significant bits (LSBs) of the SS block index, where X may be 2 or 3. In one example, the SS block index is 6 bits (e.g., b<sub>5</sub>b<sub>4</sub>b<sub>3</sub>b<sub>2</sub>b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>0</sub>) and the 3 LSBs (e.g., b<sub>2</sub>b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>10</sub>) of the SS block index are used for the scrambling initialization for scrambling the information. The information before scrambling may be encoded and/or unencoded, and may be scrambled based on the generated scrambling sequence. The information includes at least one of a reference signal, data, paging information, control information, broadcast information, or a CRC associated with control information. In one configuration, the reference signal is at least one of CSI-RS, measurement RS (MRS) (also referred to as mobility RS), DMRS (for a PDCCH, a PDSCH, or a PBCH), or PT-RS. In one configuration, the data is for a PDSCH, the paging information is for a paging channel (PCH), the control information is for a PDCCH, and the broadcast information is for a PBCH. When the information includes a scrambled CRC, the control information associated with the scrambled CRC may or may not be scrambled itself based on the SS block index.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, the sequence initialization for scrambling DMRS (e.g., PBCH DMRS) may be based on the cell ID of the base station <b>704</b> and on the 3 LSBs of the SS block index. Specifically, the initialization for the PBCH DMRS may be c<sub>init</sub>=2<sup>11 </sup>(f<sub>SSB</sub>+1)·(└N<sub>ID</sub>/4┘+1)+2<sup>6</sup>·(f<sub>SSB</sub>+1)+mod(N<sub>ID</sub>, 4), where I<sub>SSB </sub>is the SS block index, and where for max length L=4, f<sub>SSB</sub>=I<sub>SSB</sub>+4HF where HF=0 in the first half frame of a radio frame and HF=1 in the second half frame of a radio frame, and for max length L=8, and max L=64, Í<sub>SSB</sub>=I<sub>SSB</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">For another example, assume the information is broadcast information for a PBCH.
