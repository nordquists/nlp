<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to computing devices, software applications, and methods that utilize voice and speech recognition to provide feedback to a customer service representative regarding his performance during an interaction with a customer.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Recorded phone conversations between a customer calling a call center and a customer service representative are often utilized to evaluate the performance of the representative. A supervisor of the representative or manager may listen to at least a portion of one or more conversations in order to check for behavior that needs improvement, such as interrupting the customer, using improper language, using an inappropriate tone of voice, or the like. The supervisor may also listen for following proper protocols, positive interactions with customers, and behavior that should be rewarded and reinforced. However, in many cases, long periods of time may go by between the recorded conversations and the opportunity for the supervisor to listen to them. During this time, bad behavior of the representative may go uncorrected while positive actions may be unrecognized, leading to development of habits that are difficult to change.</div>

One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the systems and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The present embodiments described in this patent application and other possible embodiments may relate to, inter alia, computing devices, software applications, methods, and media for providing an evaluation to a customer service representative regarding his performance during an interaction with a customer. The computing device, through hardware operation, execution of the software application, implementation of the method, or combinations thereof, may be utilized as follows. An existing customer, or a potential customer, may call a business seeking information regarding one or more products or services offered by the business, seeking to discuss a bill or an account, seeking to change services or return a product, or the like. The representative may answer the call with a telecom device, such as a telephone including a headset or a handset. The representative may have a conversation with the customer to provide information or resolve the customer's issue. The computing device may also receive the call either through a communication line, such as a phone line, or through a connection with the telecom device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The computing device may have already been trained to recognize or identify the representative's voice. While the customer and the representative are talking, the computing device may be tracking, or continuously determining, which voice is that of the representative. The computing device may also determine the voice which is not recognized, or already known, is that of the customer. The computing device may also perform speech recognition, converting the dialog between the customer and the representative to text. The computing device may identify words of the text that are spoken by the representative and may compare the words with a list of positive words or phrases and a list of negative words or phrases. The positive words or phrases may include language that is preferred for interacting with customers, such as correct grammar, common courtesies, and proper etiquette. The negative words or phrases may include language that is considered to be incorrect grammar, slang, or obscenities. The computing device may generate a first score for the representative's customer service performance. The first score may vary according to the usage of positive words and negative words by the representative. For example, the first score may increase when the representative uses positive words or phrases. Likewise, the first score may decrease when the representative uses negative words or phases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, the computing device may analyze the conversation to determine a tone of voice for the representative and to determine a tone of voice for the customer. The tone of voice of the representative and the customer may refer to the frequency or spectral content of each one's voice. The tone of voice may also refer to the amplitude or volume of each voice. The tone of voice for the representative and the customer may be determined and recorded during the entire conversation. Thus, the responses of the representative to the customer can be determined. In other words, it may be determined whether the representative changed his tone of voice in response to a change in tone of voice of the customer. The computing device may generate a second score that varies according to the responses of the representative to the customer. For example, the second score may increase for every time that the customer changed his tone of voice and the representative did not. Likewise, the second score may decrease for every time that the representative changed his tone of voice in response to a change in tone of voice of the customer. The second score may be combined with the first score, such as by addition of the two scores or averaging of the two scores.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, the computing device may determine when a change of speakers occurs during the conversation—that is when the customer stops talking and the representative starts talking. The computing device may further determine a response time which is related to the period of time that elapses between when the customer stops talking and the representative starts talking. The computing device may generate a third score that varies according to the response time. For example, there may be a window of time, say between a lower threshold of 1 second and an upper threshold of 5 seconds, during which it is considered polite for the representative to respond to the customer. If the response time is less than the lower threshold or the representative and the customer are speaking simultaneously, then the representative may be interrupting the customer. If the response time is greater than the upper threshold, then the representative may be considered to be keeping the customer waiting. In an exemplary implementation, the third score may not change as long the response time is within the window. But, the third score may decrease for every occurrence when the response time is less than the lower threshold or greater than the upper threshold. The third score may be combined with the first and second scores, such as by addition of the three scores or averaging of the three scores.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">After the phone call between the representative and the customer is over, the computing device may present the representative with a total score that represents the combination of the three individual scores. In addition or instead, the computing device may present the representative with the three individual scores. Furthermore, the computing device may present the representative with a summary of the evaluation. The summary may include a list of both the positive words or phrases, and the negative words and phrases, used by the representative. The summary may also include a list of occurrences when the representative changed his tone of voice, and the times during the conversation when they occurred. The summary may further include a list of occurrences when the representative did not respond to the customer during the window of time for a proper response, and the times during the conversation when they occurred. The evaluation may further include suggestions for improvement or behavioral changes, if needed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The memory element <b>20</b> may include data storage components such as read-only memory (ROM), programmable ROM, erasable programmable ROM, random-access memory (RAM) such as static RAM (SRAM) or dynamic RAM (DRAM), cache memory, hard disks, floppy disks, optical disks, flash memory, thumb drives, universal serial bus (USB) drives, or the like, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the memory element <b>20</b> may be embedded in, or packaged in the same package as, the processing element <b>22</b>. The memory element <b>20</b> may include, or may constitute, a “computer-readable medium.” The memory element <b>20</b> may store the instructions, code, code segments, software, firmware, programs, applications, apps, services, daemons, or the like, including the software application <b>24</b>, that are executed by the processing element <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The processing element <b>22</b> may include processors, microprocessors (single-core and multi-core), microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), analog and/or digital application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or the like, or combinations thereof.

The processing element <b>22</b> may be in communication with the other electronic components through serial or parallel links that include address buses, data buses, control lines, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">By executing the software application <b>24</b> or through the use of specially-configured hardware, the processing element <b>22</b> may perform the following tasks. Before the computing device <b>10</b> is utilized during a phone call, the processing element <b>22</b> may be trained to recognize or identify the representative's voice. The training process may involve having the representative utilize the representative telecom device <b>16</b> as a microphone into which the representative speaks. The representative telecom device <b>16</b> may communicate an audio signal to the computing device <b>10</b>. The audio signal may be digitized and optionally filtered to eliminate noise and frequencies outside of the typical human vocal range by the representative telecom device <b>16</b> and/or the computing device <b>10</b> to create a data signal received by the processing element <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the representative may utilize a standalone microphone electrically connected to the computing device <b>10</b>, a microphone from a headset electrically connected to the computing device <b>10</b>, or a microphone integrated with the computing device <b>10</b> to generate the audio signal. The representative may speak a plurality of words or phrases or a series of sounds which are analyzed by the processing element <b>22</b> to create a voice print, template, or model that is stored in the memory element <b>20</b>. The processing element <b>22</b> may generate a spectrogram or utilize short-time Fourier transform to create the voice print. The voice print may be used to identify the representative.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">During the phone call between the customer and the representative, the processing element <b>22</b> may receive an audio stream corresponding to the spoken conversation from either the communication network <b>12</b> or the representative telecom device <b>16</b>. The audio stream may be digitized and filtered, in a similar fashion as mentioned above, to create a data stream. The processing element <b>22</b> may implement speech recognition or may convert speech to text utilizing techniques such as hidden Markov models, dynamic time warping, neural networking, or the like, or combinations thereof. The output of the speech recognition may be a stream of text words. In various embodiments, the processing element <b>22</b> may also successively or repeatedly generate a spectrogram or utilize short-time Fourier transform to create a plurality of voice prints, each voice print representing a short period of time, such as 0.5-1 seconds. The processing element <b>22</b> may further compare each voice print with the voice print of the representative in order to identify the voice of the current speaker during the conversation on an ongoing basis or as a function of time. Those voice prints that match the voice print of the representative may be marked or noted as the voice of the representative. Those voice prints that do not match the voice print of the representative may be marked or noted as the voice of the customer. The processing element <b>22</b> may also timestamp the text so that each word is associated with a time of the conversation. The processing element <b>22</b> may match each word of the conversation with one or more voice prints so that it may determine which person spoke each word. Thus, the processing element <b>22</b> may generate a representative transcript of the conversation which includes those words of the text that are spoken by the representative. The processing element <b>22</b> may also generate a customer transcript including words of the text that are spoken by the customer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The processing element <b>22</b> may compare the representative transcript in an ongoing process throughout the conversation with a list of positive words or phrases and a list of negative words or phrases. The positive words or phrases may include language that is preferred for interacting with customers, such as correct grammar, common courtesies, and/or proper etiquette. The negative words or phrases may include language that is considered to be incorrect grammar, slang, and/or obscenities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The processing element <b>22</b> may generate a first score for the representative's customer service performance. The first score may vary according to the usage of positive words and negative words by the representative. For example, the first score may have an initial value, such as 0 or 100. The processing element <b>22</b> may increase the first score during the conversation when the representative uses positive words or phrases. Likewise, the processing element <b>22</b> may decrease the first score when the representative uses negative words or phrases. The processing element <b>22</b> may also store in the memory element <b>20</b> all of the positive words used by the representative and the number of occurrences of each usage, as well as the negative words used by the representative and the number of occurrences of each usage. In some embodiments, the processing element <b>22</b> may mark the positive words and negative words in the representative transcript which is stored in the memory element <b>20</b>. As an alternative scoring method, the processing element <b>22</b> may count the total number of positive words and negative words and adjust the first score accordingly at the end of the phone conversation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The processing element <b>22</b> may also analyze the conversation to determine a tone of voice for the representative and to determine a tone of voice for the customer. The tone of voice of the representative and the customer may refer to the frequency or spectral content of each one's voice. The tone of voice may also refer to the amplitude or volume of each voice. Thus, the processing element <b>22</b> may perform mathematical or signal processing operations such as Fourier transforms, pulse coding, and the like in order to determine variations in the frequency, the amplitude, or both of each voice. The processing element <b>22</b> may repeatedly generate voice prints and compare them with already stored voice prints, as discussed above, to identify the voice of the representative and the voice of the customer. The processing element <b>22</b> may further utilize the identities of the voice prints to determine the tone of voice for the representative and the tone of voice for the customer on an ongoing basis for the entire conversation. The tone of voice of each person may be recorded in the memory element <b>20</b> as one or more values representing the tone of voice for each of a plurality of timestamps. The tone of voice may be recorded at a given rate, such as 1-10 samples per second. Thus, the memory element <b>20</b> may include a first series of tone of voice values for the representative and a second series of tone of voice values for the customer. The processing element <b>22</b> may also determine a first average tone of voice value for the representative and a second average tone of voice value for the customer. In addition, the processing element <b>22</b> may match, or otherwise associate, the tone of voice of the representative with the words spoken by the representative. For example, each word of the conversation spoken by the representative may be associated with an average, or maximum, tone of voice value that was recorded for the particular word of the conversation. The processing element <b>22</b> may perform the same operation for the tone of voice of the customer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">During the conversation, the customer may speak for a turn and then the representative may speak for a turn. The representative may respond to a question from the customer or may make a statement following a statement from the customer. Each turn may correspond to a set of timestamp values and the associated tone of voice values for the speaker during the turn. The processing element <b>22</b> may determine whether the customer changed his tone of voice during his turn and whether the representative changed his tone of voice in response. In various embodiments, the processing element <b>22</b> may determine each occurrence when the customer's tone of voice value is above a first threshold, such as 10% greater than his average tone of voice value. The processing element <b>22</b> may further determine whether the tone of voice value for the representative increases above a second threshold, such as a 10% increase greater than his average tone of voice value, within a first time period afterward, such as 10 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The processing element <b>22</b> may generate a second score for the representative's customer service performance. The second score may vary according to whether the representative changed his tone of voice in response to a change in tone of voice of the customer. For example, like the first score, the second score may have an initial value, such as 0 or 100. The processing element <b>22</b> may increase the second score during the conversation when the representative does not change his tone of voice in response to a change in tone of voice of the customer. This may indicate that the representative has remained calm during a tense or confrontational moment of the conversation. Likewise, the processing element <b>22</b> may decrease the second score during the conversation when the representative changes his tone of voice in response to a change in tone of voice of the customer—perhaps indicating that the representative was unable to remain calm when the customer got agitated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The processing element <b>22</b> may determine when a change of speakers occurs during the conversation—that is when the customer stops talking and the representative starts talking. The processing element <b>22</b> may repeatedly generate voice prints and compare them with already stored voice prints, as discussed above, to identify the voice of the representative and the voice of the customer. The processing element <b>22</b> may further determine a response time which is related to the period of time that elapses between when the customer stops talking and the representative starts talking. In certain embodiments, the processing element <b>22</b> may start a timer at the end of every word spoken by the customer. The timer may stop when the next word is spoken. If the next word is spoken by the representative, then the processing element <b>22</b> may record the value of the timer—which would correspond to the response time. In some cases, the processing element <b>22</b> may determine that the representative and the customer are speaking at the same time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The processing element <b>22</b> may generate a third score that varies according to the response time. For example, like the first and second scores, the third score may have an initial value, such as 100. In various embodiments, there may be a window of time, say between a lower threshold of 1 second and an upper threshold of 5 seconds, during which it is considered polite for the representative to respond to the customer. If the response time is less than the lower threshold or the representative and the customer are speaking simultaneously, then the representative may be interrupting the customer. If the response time is greater than the upper threshold, then the representative may be considered to be keeping the customer waiting. The processing element <b>22</b> may record all of the occurrences when the response time was outside of the window and the times during the conversation when they occurred. In an exemplary implementation, the third score may not change as long the response time is within the window. But, the processing element <b>22</b> may decrease the third score for every occurrence when the response time is less than the lower threshold, or greater than the upper threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">After the conversation has concluded, the processing element <b>22</b> may generate a total score, which may be a combination of the first, second, and third scores, such as the sum of the three or the average of the three. In addition or instead, the processing element <b>22</b> may present the representative with the three individual scores. Furthermore, the processing element <b>22</b> may present the representative with the evaluation. The evaluation may include a list of both the positive words or phrases and the negative words and phrases used by the representative. The evaluation may also include a list of occurrences when the representative changed his tone of voice and the times during the conversation when they occurred. The evaluation may further include a list of occurrences when the representative did not respond to the customer during the window of time for a proper response, and the times during the conversation when they occurred. The evaluation may additionally include suggestions for improvement or behavioral changes, if needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The computing device <b>10</b> may be electrically connected to the communication network <b>12</b> and to the display <b>18</b>, with an optional connection to the representative telecom device <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. During the conversation between the representative and the customer, the computing device <b>10</b> may receive the audio stream from the communication network <b>12</b> or alternatively from the representative telecom device <b>16</b>. The processing element <b>22</b> may perform the operations necessary to evaluate the representative's customer service performance, as discussed above. After the conversation is over, the computing device <b>10</b> may communicate the total score or the first, second, and third scores along with the summary of the evaluation to the display <b>18</b> so that the representative can review the evaluation. Given the immediate feedback that the current invention provides, the representative may start addressing the areas that need improvement before his next phone call. Furthermore, the scores and all of the data recorded during the conversation may be transferred from the memory element <b>20</b> of the computing device <b>10</b> to a data server that is accessible by the supervisor or manager of the representative.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">Exemplary Computer-Implemented Method</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> depict a listing of steps of an exemplary computer-implemented method <b>100</b> for providing an evaluation to a customer service representative regarding his performance during an interaction with a customer. The steps may be performed in the order shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, or they may be performed in a different order. Furthermore, some steps may be performed concurrently as opposed to sequentially. In addition, some steps may be optional. The steps of the computer-implemented method <b>100</b> may be performed by the computing device <b>10</b> through the utilization of hardware, software, firmware, or combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to step <b>101</b>, data corresponding to words spoken by a representative is received. The representative may utilize the representative telecom device <b>16</b> as a microphone into which the representative speaks. The representative telecom device <b>16</b> may communicate an audio signal to the computing device <b>10</b>. The audio signal may be digitized and optionally filtered to eliminate noise and frequencies outside of the typical human vocal range by the representative telecom device <b>16</b> and/or the computing device <b>10</b> to create a data signal received by the processing element <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to step <b>102</b>, a voice print that is associated with the representative may be created. The words, phrases, or sounds spoken by the representative may be analyzed by the processing element <b>22</b> to create a voice print, template, or model that is stored in the memory element <b>20</b>. The processing element <b>22</b> may generate a spectrogram or utilize short-time Fourier transform to create the voice print.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to step <b>103</b>, a stream of data corresponding to a spoken conversation between a representative and a customer may be received. The stream of data may be received from the communication network <b>12</b> or the representative telecom device <b>16</b> as an audio stream which is then digitized and filtered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to step <b>104</b>, a portion of the data may be converted to a representative transcript. The processing element <b>22</b> may implement speech recognition or may convert speech to text utilizing techniques such as hidden Markov models, dynamic time warping, neural networking, or the like, or combinations thereof. The output of the speech recognition may be a stream of text words. In various embodiments, the processing element <b>22</b> may also successively or repeatedly generate a spectrogram or utilize a short-time Fourier transform to create a plurality of voice prints, each voice print representing a short period of time, such as 0.5-1 seconds. The processing element <b>22</b> may further compare each voice print with the voice print of the representative in order to identify the voice of the current speaker during the conversation on an ongoing basis or as a function of time. Those voice prints that match the voice print of the representative may be marked or noted as the voice of the representative. Those voice prints that do not match the voice print of the representative may be marked or noted as the voice of the customer. The processing element <b>22</b> may also timestamp the text so that each word is associated with a time of the conversation. The processing element <b>22</b> may match each word of the conversation with one or more voice prints so that it may determine which person spoke each word. Thus, the processing element <b>22</b> may generate the representative transcript of the conversation. The processing element <b>22</b> may also generate a customer transcript.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to step <b>105</b>, the representative transcript may be compared to a list of positive words or phrases and a list of negative words or phrases. The positive words or phrases may include language that is preferred for interacting with customers, such as correct grammar, common courtesies, and proper etiquette. The negative words or phrases may include language that is considered to be incorrect grammar, slang, and/or obscenities. The comparison of the representative transcript to the list of positive words and negative words may be performed as an ongoing process throughout the conversation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to steps <b>106</b>-<b>108</b>, a first score that varies according to the usage of positive words and negative words by the representative may be generated. For example, the first score may have an initial value, such as 0 or 100. The processing element <b>22</b> may increase the first score during the conversation when the representative uses positive words or phrases. Likewise, the processing element <b>22</b> may decrease the first score when the representative uses negative words or phases. The processing element <b>22</b> may also store in the memory element <b>20</b> all of the positive words used by the representative and the number of occurrences of each usage as well as the negative words used by the representative and the number of occurrences of each usage. In some embodiments, the processing element <b>22</b> may mark the positive words and negative words in the representative transcript which is stored in the memory element <b>20</b>. As an alternative scoring method, the processing element <b>22</b> may count the total number of positive words and negative words, and adjust the first score accordingly at the end of the phone conversation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to step <b>109</b>, a tone of voice for the representative and a tone of voice for the customer may be determined. The tone of voice of the representative and the customer may refer to the frequency or spectral content of each one's voice. The tone of voice may also refer to the amplitude or volume of each voice. Thus, the processing element <b>22</b> may perform mathematical or signal processing operations such as Fourier transforms, pulse coding, and the like in order to determine variations in the frequency, the amplitude, or both of each voice. The processing element <b>22</b> may repeatedly generate voice prints and compare them with already stored voice prints, as discussed above, to identify the voice of the representative and the voice of the customer. The processing element <b>22</b> may further utilize the identities of the voice prints to determine the tone of voice for the representative and the tone of voice for the customer on an ongoing basis for the entire conversation. The tone of voice of each person may be recorded in the memory element <b>20</b> as one or more values representing the tone of voice for each of a plurality of timestamps. The tone of voice may be recorded at a given rate, such as 1-10 samples per second. Thus, the memory element <b>20</b> may include a first series of tone of voice values for the representative and a second series of tone of voice values for the customer. The processing element <b>22</b> may also determine a first average tone of voice value for the representative and a second average tone of voice value for the customer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to step <b>110</b>, whether the representative changed his tone of voice in response to a change in tone of voice of the customer may be determined. During the conversation, the customer may speak for a turn and then the representative may speak for a turn. The representative may respond to a question from the customer or may make a statement following a statement from the customer. The processing element <b>22</b> may determine whether the customer changed his tone of voice during his turn and whether the representative changed his tone of voice in response. In various embodiments, the processing element <b>22</b> may determine each occurrence when the customer's tone of voice value is above a first threshold, such as 10% greater than his average tone of voice value. The processing element <b>22</b> may further determine whether the tone of voice value for the representative increases above a second threshold, such as a 10% increase greater than his average tone of voice value, within a first time period afterward, such as 10 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to steps <b>111</b>-<b>113</b>, a second score that varies according to whether the representative changed his tone of voice in response to a change in tone of voice of the customer may be generated or calculated. For example, the second score may have an initial value, such as 0 or 100. The processing element <b>22</b> may increase the second score during the conversation when the representative does not change his tone of voice in response to a change in tone of voice of the customer. This may indicate that the representative has remained calm during a tense or confrontational moment of the conversation. Likewise, the processing element <b>22</b> may decrease the second score during the conversation when the representative changes his tone of voice in response to a change in tone of voice of the customer—perhaps indicating that the representative was unable to remain calm when the customer got agitated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to step <b>114</b>, a response time between when the customer stops talking and the representative starts talking may be determined or calculated. The processing element <b>22</b> may repeatedly generate voice prints and compare them with already stored voice prints, as discussed above, to identify the voice of the representative and the voice of the customer. The processing element <b>22</b> may also assume that the voice which does not match a voice print is the customer's. The processing element <b>22</b> may further determine a response time which is related to the period of time that elapses between when the customer stops talking and the representative starts talking. In certain embodiments, the processing element <b>22</b> may start a timer at the end of every word spoken by the customer. The timer may stop when the next word is spoken. If the next word is spoken by the representative, then the processing element <b>22</b> may record the value of the timer—which would correspond to the response time. In some cases, the processing element <b>22</b> may determine that the representative and the customer are speaking at the same time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to steps <b>115</b> and <b>116</b>, a third score that varies according to the response time may be generated or calculated. For example, the third score may have an initial value, such as 100. In various embodiments, there may be a window of time, say between a lower threshold of 1 second and an upper threshold of 5 seconds, during which it is considered polite for the representative to respond to the customer. If the response time is less than the lower threshold or the representative and the customer are speaking simultaneously, then the representative may be interrupting the customer. If the response time is greater than the upper threshold, then the representative may be considered to be keeping the customer waiting. The processing element <b>22</b> may record all of the occurrences when the response time was outside of the window and the times during the conversation when they occurred. In an exemplary implementation, the third score may not change as long the response time is within the window. But, the processing element <b>22</b> may decrease the third score for every occurrence when the response time is less than the lower threshold or greater than the upper threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to step <b>117</b>, an evaluation may be presented to the representative after the conversation is over. The processing element <b>22</b> may generate a total score, which may be a combination of the first, second, and third scores, such as the sum of the three or the average of the three that are communicated to the display <b>18</b>. In addition or instead, the computing device <b>10</b> may present the representative with the three individual scores. Furthermore, the computing device <b>10</b> may communicate the evaluation to the display <b>18</b>. The evaluation may include a list of both the positive words or phrases and the negative words and phrases used by the representative.

The software application <b>24</b> may be generally executed by the computing device <b>10</b> and may broadly comprise a voice print generator <b>26</b>, a speech recognition component <b>28</b>, a transcript comparison component <b>30</b>, a first score generator <b>32</b>, a tone of voice determination component <b>34</b>, a second score generator <b>36</b>, a response time determination component <b>38</b>, a third score generator <b>40</b>, and/or an evaluation generator <b>42</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The voice print generator <b>26</b> may receive audio communication from a microphone to which the representative has access or from the communication network <b>12</b>. The audio communication may include an electronic signal that is digitized and filtered to create a data stream which corresponds to speech from the representative. The representative may speak a plurality of words or phrases or a series of sounds which are analyzed by the voice print generator <b>26</b> to create a voice print, template, and/or model that is stored in the memory element <b>20</b> and accessed by the software application <b>24</b>. The voice print generator <b>26</b> may generate a spectrogram or utilize the short-time Fourier transform to create the voice print. The voice print may be used to identify the representative.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In various embodiments, during the conversation, the voice print generator <b>26</b> may also successively or repeatedly generate a spectrogram or utilize the short-time Fourier transform to create a plurality of voice prints, each voice print derived from a period of time, such as 0.5-1 seconds. The voice print generator <b>26</b> may compare the successively-generated voice prints with the voice print of the representative to identify the voice of the current speaker during the conversation on an ongoing basis or as a function of time. Those voice prints that match the voice print of the representative may be associated with, identified, marked, or noted in the memory element <b>20</b> as the voice of the representative. Those voice prints that do not match the voice print of the representative may be associated with, identified, marked, or noted in the memory element <b>20</b> as the voice of the customer. Alternatively, the voice print generator <b>26</b> may communicate the voice prints to the other components of the software application <b>24</b> to perform the comparison and identification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The speech recognition component <b>28</b> may receive audio communication from the communication network <b>12</b>.

The speech recognition component <b>28</b> may receive or access the identified voice prints generated by the voice print generator <b>26</b>. The speech recognition component <b>28</b> may also timestamp the text so that each word is associated with a time of the conversation. The speech recognition component <b>28</b> may match each word of the conversation with one or more identified voice prints so that it may determine which person spoke each word. Thus, the speech recognition component <b>28</b> may generate a representative transcript of the conversation which includes those words of the text that are spoken by the representative. The speech recognition component <b>28</b> may also generate a customer transcript including words of the text that are spoken by the customer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The transcript comparison component <b>30</b> may compare the representative transcript in an ongoing process throughout the conversation with a list of positive words or phrases and a list of negative words or phrases. The positive words or phrases may include language that is preferred for interacting with customers, such as correct grammar, common courtesies, and/or proper etiquette. The negative words or phrases may include language that is considered to be incorrect grammar, slang, and/or obscenities. The transcript comparison component <b>30</b> may determine a positive count corresponding to a number of occurrences or instances when the words of the representative transcript match one or more positive words. The transcript comparison component <b>30</b> may also determine a negative count corresponding to a number of occurrences or instances when the words of the representative transcript match one or more negative words. The transcript comparison component <b>30</b> may also store in the memory element <b>20</b> all of the positive words used by the representative and the number of occurrences of each usage, as well as the negative words used by the representative, and the number of occurrences of each usage. Alternatively, the transcript comparison component <b>30</b> may mark the positive words and negative words in the representative transcript which is stored in the memory element <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The first score generator <b>32</b> may generate a first score which varies according to the usage of positive words and negative words by the representative. For example, the first score may have an initial value, such as 0 or 100.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">Exemplary Feedback &amp; Quality Assurance</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">A tool or computer system may be configured to provide for an objective and/or more accurate review of customer-call center representative telephone calls. The tool or computer system may provide (1) immediate associate feedback enabled by voice recognition software; (2) quality assurance processes that include new, more comprehensive call data; and/or (3) systematic messaging to reinforce desired behaviors, based upon vocal metrics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Voice recognition technology may be used to gather an increased amount of data, looking for particular words and tones of voice that are assumed to be representative of exemplary associate behaviors. Certain words or phrases may be considered to be particularly appropriate (for example, drawing from a library of common courtesies, or from desired word tracks for certain transactions). Certain words or phrases may also be considered particularly inappropriate. Certain etiquette protocols may also be detected (for example, whether an associate interrupts a customer). The tone of voice may be detected (for both associates and customers).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">All of these factors may then be correlated to a scoring—with certain words, phrases, points of etiquette considered to be particularly positive or negative. In the aggregate, this scoring could be used to provide general feedback regarding the assumed quality of individual calls and groups of calls (either for individual associates, or sets of associates). The specifically detected words, phrases, and points of etiquette may also provide the basis for immediate associate feedback.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, at the conclusion of a call, the associate may receive on-screen messaging that reinforces aspects of the conversation that scored well, as well as a suggestion for alternative phrasing when aspects of the conversation scored poorly. Based upon tones of voice detected, the associate may also receive positive feedback about staying calm during a tense call (for example, by evaluating the tone of voice of the customer versus the tone of voice of the associate).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Feedback about a telephone call or text interaction with a customer may be provided to the representative during or after a customer interaction. A pop-up window on a computer display screen may provide short bullets of encouragement, feedback, and/or areas of opportunity for improved customer service.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">Additional Considerations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">In this description, references to “one embodiment”, “an embodiment”, or “embodiments” mean that the feature or features being referred to are included in at least one embodiment of the technology. Separate references to “one embodiment”, “an embodiment”, or “embodiments” in this description do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment and are also not mutually exclusive unless so stated and/or except as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the description. For example, a feature, structure, act, etc. described in one embodiment may also be included in other embodiments, but is not necessarily included. Thus, the current technology can include a variety of combinations and/or integrations of the embodiments described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Although the present application sets forth a detailed description of numerous different embodiments, it should be understood that the legal scope of the description is defined by the words of the claims set forth at the end of this patent and equivalents. The detailed description is to be construed as exemplary only and does not describe every possible embodiment since describing every possible embodiment would be impractical. Numerous alternative embodiments may be implemented, using either current technology or technology developed after the filing date of this patent, which would still fall within the scope of the claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Throughout this specification, plural instances may implement components, operations, or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently, and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of routines, subroutines, applications, or instructions. These may constitute either software (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware. In hardware, the routines, etc., are tangible units capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as computer hardware that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">In various embodiments, computer hardware, such as a processing element, may be implemented as special purpose or as general purpose. For example, the processing element may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured, such as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or indefinitely configured, such as an FPGA, to perform certain operations. The processing element may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement the processing element as special purpose, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or as general purpose (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Accordingly, the term “processing element” or equivalents should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which the processing element is temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the processing elements need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the processing element comprises a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different processing elements at different times. Software may accordingly configure the processing element to constitute a particular hardware configuration at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware configuration at a different instance of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Computer hardware components, such as communication elements, memory elements, processing elements, and the like, may provide information to, and receive information from, other computer hardware components. Accordingly, the described computer hardware components may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such computer hardware components exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the computer hardware components. In embodiments in which multiple computer hardware components are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such computer hardware components may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple computer hardware components have access. For example, one computer hardware component may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further computer hardware component may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Computer hardware components may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and may operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processing elements that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processing elements may constitute processing element-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processing element-implemented modules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Similarly, the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processing element-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processing elements or processing element-implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processing elements, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processing elements may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processing elements may be distributed across a number of locations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">Unless specifically stated otherwise, discussions herein using words such as “processing,” “computing,” “calculating,” “determining,” “presenting,” “displaying,” or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine (e.g., a computer with a processing element and other computer hardware components) that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic, magnetic, or optical) quantities within one or more memories (e.g., volatile memory, non-volatile memory, or a combination thereof), registers, or other machine components that receive, store, transmit, or display information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">As used herein, the terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes,” “including,” “has,” “having” or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion. For example, a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">The patent claims at the end of this patent application are not intended to be construed under 35 U.S.C. § 112(f) unless traditional means-plus-function language is expressly recited, such as “means for” or “step for” language being explicitly recited in the claim(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Although the invention has been described with reference to the embodiments illustrated in the attached drawing figures, it is noted that equivalents may be employed and substitutions made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as recited in the claims.</div>
