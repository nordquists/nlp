<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/670,154, which is a national phase application of International Application No. PCT/JP2008/062958, filed Jul. 17, 2008, which claims priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-191445 filed on Jul. 23, 2007, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a battery assembly in which a plurality of unit cells (typically, secondary batteries) are arranged, and more particularly to a method for manufacturing a battery assembly suitable for installation on a vehicle.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Battery assemblies in which power storage elements such as lightweight lithium ion batteries making it possible to obtain a high energy density, nickel hydrogen batteries, and other secondary batteries or capacitors, are used as unit cells and a plurality of unit cells are connected in series have gained importance as power sources that can produce a high output in applications as power sources for installation on automobiles or power sources for personal computers and portable terminals. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses, as an example of a battery assembly for installation on a vehicle, a battery assembly configured by arranging a plurality of unit cells of the same shape composed of nickel hydrogen secondary batteries and connecting the unit cells in series. Patent Document 2 is another example of the related art document that relates to a battery assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Battery assemblies in which a plurality of lightweight lithium ion batteries making it possible to obtain a high energy density is connected as unit cells in series are expected to be used especially advantageously as high-output power sources for installation on vehicles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-57196</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-5167</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition to a limited installation space, battery assemblies that are installed on vehicles such as automobiles are presumed to be used in a state in which vibrations are generated. Therefore, for example, as also described in Patent Document 1, battery assemblies are constructed by arranging and bundling a large number of unit cells (that is, the unit cells are fixed to each other). Such bundling is conducted so that the arranged unit cell group be bundled by an appropriate bundling pressure (compressive pressure). In order to stabilize the performance (quality) of battery assemblies, it is preferred that a “spread” in the bundling pressure among the manufactured battery assemblies (products) be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">However, there is generally a certain spread in the outer shape (for example, a thickness in the arrangement direction) of individual unit cells used to construct a battery assembly. Where a large number of unit cells that have such as spread in thickness are arranged in the stacking direction, the spread in thickness of the unit cells is accumulated. As a result, the length of the entire bundling object (body to be bundled) that includes the arranged unit cells in the stacking direction (arrangement direction) has a spread equal to or larger than the spread in thickness of individual unit cells. Where the body to be bundled is bundled by applying the stipulated bundling pressure, without regard for the spread in the stacking direction length of the body to be bundled, a spread occurs in the length of the obtained battery assembly in the stacking direction, this spread reflecting the spread (unevenness) of the stacking direction length of the body to be bundled. For example, the stacking direction length of the battery assembly in which the body to be bundled that has a relatively large stacking direction length is bundled by the stipulated bundling pressure is larger than the stacking direction length of the battery assembly in which the body to be bundled that has a relatively small stacking direction length is bundled under the same bundling pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">When the battery assemblies are installed on vehicles, this spread in the stacking direction length (outer size) of the battery assemblies causes inconveniences, for example, the battery assembly cannot be accommodated in the installation space that has been prepared in advance or an extra gap remains when the battery assembly is accommodated in the gap. Therefore, in the manufacture of battery assemblies, it is desirable not only to reduce the spread in bundling pressure of the battery assemblies, but also to reduce the spread in stacking direction length.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing with good efficiency a battery assembly in which a plurality of unit cells are bundled by the preset (stipulated) bundling pressure and which has a preset accurate size (in particular, a length dimension of the battery assembly in the stacking direction of the unit cells constituting the battery assembly). Another object of the present invention is to provide a battery assembly obtained by this manufacturing method and a vehicle provided with the battery assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides a method for manufacturing a battery assembly in which a predetermined number of unit cells (typically, secondary batteries) are arranged in a stacking direction. This method includes a step of preparing a plurality of unit cells (for example, the unit cells may be manufactured from components or semi-products or may be prepared by purchasing or the like). Further, the method includes a step of measuring a stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of a stacked body including the predetermined number of the unit cells arranged in the stacking direction. The method also includes a step of bundling a body to be bundled that includes the stacked body. The body to be bundled includes length adjusting means for converging a spread in stacking direction length L<b>1</b>. The bundling step is implemented by setting the length adjusting means according to the length L<b>1</b>, so that a length of the battery assembly in the stacking direction is a stipulated length LT and a bundling pressure of the body to be bundled is a stipulated pressure (stipulated bundling pressure) P.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The “unit cells” as referred to in the present description is a term indicating individual power storage elements constituting a battery assembly and includes batteries and capacitors of various compositions, unless specifically stated otherwise. Further, the term “secondary battery” refers generally to batteries that can be repeatedly charged and discharged and covers the so-called storage batteries such as a lithium ion battery and a nickel hydrogen battery. A power storage element constituting a lithium ion battery is a typical example of a configuration included in the definition of “unit cell” referred to herein, and a lithium ion battery module constituted by a plurality of such unit cells is a typical example of “battery assembly” disclosed herein. The technique disclosed herein can be applied especially advantageously to a battery assembly in which a predetermined number of unit cells (for example, lithium ion batteries) having a flat outer shape are arranged in a direction in which the flat planes are placed one on another (stacking direction) and the electrode terminals of these unit cells are connected in series or parallel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In the battery assembly manufacturing method of the above-described configuration, a predetermined number of unit cells (typically, a predetermined number of unit cells of the same shape) that are used to constitute the battery assembly are stacked, a stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body is measured, and the length adjusting means is set so as to converge a spread in length L<b>1</b> and realize the stipulated length LT and stipulated pressure P on the basis of the length L<b>1</b>. The stacking direction length L<b>1</b> is measured as a length of all the constituent elements of the stacked body (includes at least the predetermined number of unit cells, but also may include elements other that the unit cells that can constitute the body to be bundled, for example cooling plates sandwiched between the unit cells and an end plate disposed at one end of the stacked body, as described in Examples 1 to 9 below) and therefore can be measured with higher accuracy than the stacking direction length of each constituent element. Therefore, with the above-described method, a battery assembly can be manufactured in which the bundling pressure of the entire body to be bundled and the stacking direction length of the battery assembly are matched with good accuracy with the stipulated values (stipulated length LT and stipulated pressure P). Further, because it is not necessary to measure successively the stacking direction length (that is, thickness) of each unit cell used to construct the battery assembly, a battery assembly with a small spread in bundling pressure and small spread in stacking direction length can be efficiently manufactured. Therefore, with the manufacturing method in accordance with the present invention, it is possible to provide a battery assembly suitable for installation on a vehicle or for other applications, this battery assembly being provided with good performance (quality) and external size (stacking direction length).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">A spacer member that is arranged together with the stacked body in the stacking direction and constitutes the body to be bundled can be presented as a preferred example of the length adjusting means. The bundling step is implemented by setting the spacer member according to the length L<b>1</b>. Typically, a spacer member of an adequate size (stacking direction length, that is, thickness) is selected with consideration for the length L<b>1</b>, and the body to be bundled is formed by using the selected spacer member (that is, the length adjusting means is set). More specifically, a spacer member may be used of a thickness so as to make it possible to form a body to be bundled with a stacking direction length that constitutes the battery assembly of the stipulated length LT when the spread in length L<b>1</b> is converged and the body to be bundled is bundled by the stipulated pressure (bundling pressure) P where the spacer member is arranged together with other constituent elements of the body to be bundled. It is preferred that a plurality of spacer members that differ at least in thickness be prepared in advance so that the spacer members of adequate thickness be disposed with good efficiency, or that a plurality of spacer members be used in combination to adjust the total thickness of these spacer members to the appropriate thickness. For example, a mode can be advantageously used in which the spacer members prepared in a sheet-like form and having a predetermined thickness are used in the number corresponding to the aforementioned length L<b>1</b> (in addition to the constituent elements of the body to be bundled).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">An end plate disposed in at least one stacking end of the body to be bundled and configured so that a length thereof in the stacking direction can be changed can be presented as another preferred example of the length adjusting means. The bundling step is typically implemented by adjusting the stacking direction length (that is, thickness) of the end plate member to the adequate thickness with consideration for the length L<b>1</b>, forming the body to be bundled of a configuration that includes the end plate with the adjusted thickness (that is, setting the length adjusting means), and bundling the body to be bundled so as to obtain the stipulated pressure P and stipulated length LT. The thickness of the end plate may be adjusted (for example, adjusted by a screwing degree in the setscrew mechanism such as described in Example 2 below) to a thickness such that makes it possible to converge the spread in length L<b>1</b> and to form a body to be bundled of a stacking direction length that constitutes the battery assembly of the stipulated length LT when the body to be bundled is bundled by the stipulated pressure (bundling pressure) P.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The length adjusting means may be an elastic member that is arranged together with the stacked body in the stacking direction and constitutes the body to be bundled. In this case, the bundling step is implemented by selecting an elastic member demonstrating an adequate elastic force (repulsion force) with consideration for the length L<b>1</b>, forming the body to be bundled by using the selected elastic member (that is, setting the length adjusting means), and bundling the body to be bundled so as to obtain the stipulated pressure P and stipulated length LT. More specifically, it is possible to use an elastic member having characteristics such that the spread in length L<b>1</b> is converged and the repulsion force acting when bundling is conducted to configure the battery assembly of the stipulated length LT (when the elastic member is compressed) becomes the stipulated pressure (bundling pressure) P where the elastic member is arranged together with other constituent elements of the body to be bundled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention also provides a method for manufacturing a battery assembly in which a predetermined number of unit cells are arranged in a stacking direction, the method including the steps of: preparing (manufacturing or purchasing) a plurality of unit cells and measuring a stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of a stacked body including the predetermined number of the unit cells arranged in the stacking direction. This manufacturing method includes a step of bundling a body to be bundled that includes the stacked body, so that a bundling pressure of the body to be bundled is a stipulated pressure P. Further, the method includes a step of disposing an externally attached spacer at the outside in the stacking direction of the bundled body that has been bundled by the stipulated pressure P, the externally attached spacer serving to converge a spread in stacking direction length L<b>1</b> and match the length of the battery assembly in the stacking direction with a stipulated length LT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">With the manufacturing method of such a configuration, an externally attached spacer is used that has an adequate size (stacking direction length, that is, thickness) determined with consideration for the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body. As described hereinabove, this length L<b>1</b> can be measured with an accuracy higher than that of the stacking direction length of individual constituent elements. Therefore, it is possible to manufacture a battery assembly in which the bundling pressure and the stacking direction length of the battery assembly match the stipulated values (stipulated length LT and stipulated pressure P) with higher accuracy. Further, the bundling pressure is not applied to the externally attached spacer and the externally attached spacer is not deformed (compression deformation) by the bundling pressure. Therefore, the stacking direction length of the battery assembly can be adjusted with better accuracy. Further, because the operation of measuring successively the thickness of individual unit cells that are used is unnecessary, battery assemblies with well-matched bundling pressure and stacking direction length can be manufactured with good efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">With consideration for the length L<b>1</b>, the externally attached spacer is used that has a size (stacking direction length, that is, thickness) adequate to match the stacking direction length of the battery assembly with the stipulated length LT. More specifically, the externally attached spacer may be used that is configured so that the spread in stacking direction length B of the bundled unit obtained by bundling the body to be bundled by the stipulated bundling pressure P (can be the length reflecting the spread in length L<b>1</b>) can be converged and a stacking direction length necessary to match the stacking direction length of the battery assembly with the stipulated length LT can be added to the body to be bundled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention also provides a method for manufacturing a battery assembly in which a predetermined number of unit cells are arranged in a stacking direction, comprising the steps of: preparing the predetermined number of unit cells and measuring a stacking direction thickness for each of these unit cells. The method includes a step of forming a body to be bundled that includes the predetermined number of unit cells arranged in the stacking direction. Further, the method includes a step of bundling the body to be bundled so that a length of the battery assembly in the stacking direction is a stipulated length LT and a bundling pressure of the body to be bundled is a stipulated pressure P. In this case, the step of forming the body to be bundled includes a length adjustment processing of converging a spread of a total value CT of stacking direction thicknesses of the predetermined number of unit cells. The length adjustment processing is a processing of arranging one or a plurality (typically, a plurality) of spacing adjusting members that have a total thickness FT corresponding to the total value CT together with the predetermined number of unit cells in the stacking direction. In this processing, the spacing adjusting members are disposed (distributed) between the unit cells so as to obtain a constant stacking pitch of the unit cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">With the manufacturing method of the above-described configuration, the spacing adjusting members are used that have a total thickness FT which makes it possible to converge the total value CT and realize the stipulated length LT and stipulated pressure P according to the total value CT. As a result, it is possible to provide battery assemblies with well-matched bundling pressure and stacking direction length. When the manufacturing method of the battery assembly further includes a step of connecting the terminals of the bundled unit cells in series or parallel, if the stacking pitch of the unit cells is uneven due to a spread in unit cell thickness, it can result in inconveniences. For example, the terminal connection tools that have been fabricated to predetermined shape and size cannot be used between some of the unit cells. In this case, with the above-described manufacturing method, because the stacking pitch of the unit cells is adjusted to a constant pitch by the spacing adjusting members, the stacking pitch of the unit cells contained in the battery assembly can be made uniform. Therefore, the terminals of unit cells can be efficiently connected by the terminal connection tools that have been fabricated to predetermined shape and size.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention also provides a method for manufacturing a battery assembly in which a predetermined number of unit cells are arranged in a stacking direction, including the steps of: preparing a plurality of unit cells and measuring a stacking direction thickness for each of these unit cells. The method includes a step of classifying the plurality of unit cells into a plurality of thickness ranks with mutually different thickness ranges based on the stacking direction thickness. Further, the method includes a step of selecting the predetermined number of unit cells from one, or two or more thickness ranks from among the plurality of thickness ranks so that the sum total of representative values of the thickness ranks to which the unit cells belong is a stipulated length RT. The method also includes a step of forming a body to be bundled that includes the selected unit cells arranged in the stacking direction. In addition, the method includes a step of bundling the body to be bundled so that a length of the battery assembly in the stacking direction is a stipulated length LT and a bundling pressure of the body to be bundled is a stipulated pressure P. In this method, the stipulated length RT in the unit cell selection step is set to a length corresponding to the stipulated length LT and stipulated pressure P.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">With this manufacturing method, the predetermined number of unit cells are selected such that the spread in thickness of individual unit cells is absorbed and the total thickness of these unit cells converges to the stipulated thickness RT. Therefore, by adequately (that is, so as to obtain the stipulated thickness RT) combining and arranging a plurality of unit cells having a spread in thickness, it is possible to manufacture a battery assembly with the stipulated stacking direction length LT and bundling pressure P with higher accuracy even when the degree of thickness spread (shape accuracy) of the unit cells is at the conventional level. This is useful from the standpoint of production cost of unit cells. Further, in this manufacturing method, the stacking direction length LT at the bundling pressure P is adjusted by combining the unit cells selected from thickness ranks and no novel components are necessary to implement the method. The resultant advantage is that it is not necessary to increase the number of parts constituting the battery assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In any of the above-described methods for manufacturing a battery assembly, unit cells that are prepared by a step of constructing a plurality of unit cells of the same shape, each unit cell including an electrode body in which a positive electrode sheet and a negative electrode sheet are laminated together with a separator sheet, a container that accommodates the electrode body and an electrolyte, and a positive electrode terminal and a negative electrode terminal that are electrically connected to the positive electrode and the negative electrode and are disposed outside the container, can be advantageously used as the plurality of unit cells. The step of constructing the plurality of unit cells can include a processing in which one, or two or more of positive electrode sheets, negative electrode sheets, and separator sheets to be used to form the electrode bodies are selected from a plurality of positive electrode sheets, a plurality of negative electrode sheets, and a plurality of separator sheets that have been classified into a plurality of thickness ranks based on the sheet thickness and the electrode bodies are formed by using the selected positive electrode sheets, negative electrode sheets, and separator sheets. In this case, the sheets to be used to form the electrode bodies are selected from one, or two or more thickness ranks from among the plurality of thickness ranks, so that the sum total of representative values of the thickness ranks to which these sheets belong is a stipulated thickness ST.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In the unit cells that have thus been prepared (by manufacturing the unit cells by the above-described process or purchasing the unit cells manufactured by the above-described process), the sheets are selected such that the spread in thickness of individual sheets (electrode sheets of positive and negative electrodes and separator sheets that are used to form the electrode bodies) is absorbed and the total thickness of these sheets is converged to the stipulated thickness ST. Therefore, by adequately combining a plurality of sheets having a spread in thickness, it is possible to reduce a spread in thickness in the sheet lamination direction in an electrode body of a laminated type in which the sheets are laminated and an electrode body of a wound type (wound electrode body) in which the laminated sheets are wound, even when the degree of thickness spread in sheets is at the conventional level. By so reducing the spread in thickness of the electrode bodies, it is possible to reduce the spread in thickness of unit cells in which the electrode bodies are accommodated in containers. Therefore, by using such unit cells it is possible to manufacture a battery assembly having the stipulated stacking direction length LT and bundling pressure P with better accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The effect of the present invention, which is in the possibility of manufacturing a battery assembly having the stipulated stacking direction length LT and bundling pressure P with better accuracy by adequately selecting the sheets constituting the electrode bodies and reducing the spread in thickness of unit cells, can be advantageously applied to a method for manufacturing a battery assembly of a mode including a step of measuring the stacking direction thickness for each of these unit cells and/or a step of measuring the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body, and also to a method for manufacturing a battery assembly of a mode that does not require these steps. Therefore another aspect of the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a battery assembly in which a predetermined number of unit cells are arranged in a stacking direction, including the steps of: constructing a plurality of unit cells of the same shape, each unit cell including an electrode body in which a positive electrode sheet and a negative electrode sheet are laminated together with a separator sheet, a container that accommodates the electrode body and an electrolyte, and a positive electrode terminal and a negative electrode terminal that are electrically connected to the positive electrode and the negative electrode and are disposed outside the container; forming a body to be bundled that includes the predetermined number of unit cells arranged in the stacking direction; and bundling the body to be bundled so that a length of the battery assembly in the stacking direction is the stipulated length LT and a bundling pressure of the body to be bundled is a stipulated pressure P. In this case, the step of constructing the plurality of unit cells includes a processing in which one, or two or more of positive electrode sheets, negative electrode sheets, and separator sheets to be used to form the electrode bodies are selected from a plurality of positive electrode sheets, a plurality of negative electrode sheets, and a plurality of separator sheets that have been classified into a plurality of thickness ranks based on the sheet thickness and the electrode bodies are formed by using the selected positive electrode sheets, negative electrode sheets, and separator sheets. Further, the sheets to be used to form the electrode bodies are selected from one, or two or more thickness ranks from among the plurality of thickness ranks, so that the sum total of representative values of the thickness ranks to which these sheets belong is a stipulated thickness ST.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Another preferred example of the unit cells that can be used in any of the methods for manufacturing a battery assembly disclosed herein relates to unit cells prepared by a step of constructing a plurality of unit cells of the same shape, each unit cell including an electrode body in which a positive electrode sheet and a negative electrode sheet are laminated together with a separator sheet, a container that accommodates the electrode body and an electrolyte, and a positive electrode terminal and a negative electrode terminal that are electrically connected to the positive electrode and the negative electrode and are disposed outside the container. The step of constructing the plurality of unit cells includes a processing in which a lamination direction thickness of an electrode body of a standard configuration that is predicted from the sheet thickness of the positive electrode sheet, negative electrode sheet, and separator sheet to be used to form the electrode body is compared with a stipulated electrode body thickness (target value of the electrode body thickness measured in the stacking direction of the unit cells including the electrode body) E, and the electrode body is formed to match the stipulated electrode body thickness E by increasing or decreasing the amount of the separator sheet used with respect to the standard configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">By so increasing or decreasing the amount of the separator sheet to match the stipulated electrode body thickness E, it is possible to form electrode bodies of more uniform thickness (small spread) and therefore the spread in thickness of unit cells in which the electrode body is accommodated in the container can be reduced. Therefore, by using such unit cells, it is possible to manufacture the battery assembly having the stipulated stacking direction length LT and bundling pressure P with better accuracy. The increase or decrease in the amount of the separator sheet used can be performed for example by increasing or decreasing the number of the separator sheet so as to match the stipulated electrode body thickness E. Further, in an electrode body of a wound type (wound electrode body), this increase or decrease can be performed by winding the separator sheet in excess on the outer circumference (winding end portion) of the electrode body so as to match the stipulated electrode body thickness E. Alternatively, the separator sheet may be wound in excess on the inner circumference (winding start portion) of the electrode body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The effect of the present invention, which is in the possibility of reducing the spread in thickness of unit cells and manufacturing a battery assembly having the stipulated stacking direction length LT and bundling pressure P with better accuracy by adequately increasing or decreasing the amount of separator sheets used can be advantageously applied to a method for manufacturing a battery assembly of a mode including a step of measuring the stacking direction thickness for each of these unit cells and/or a step of measuring the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body, and also to a method for manufacturing a battery assembly of a mode that does not require these steps. Therefore another aspect of the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a battery assembly in which a predetermined number of unit cells are arranged in a stacking direction, including the steps of: constructing a plurality of unit cells of the same shape, each unit cell including an electrode body in which a positive electrode sheet and a negative electrode sheet are laminated together with a separator sheet, a container that accommodates the electrode body and an electrolyte, and a positive electrode terminal and a negative electrode terminal that are electrically connected to the positive electrode and the negative electrode and are disposed outside the container; forming a body to be bundled that includes the predetermined number of unit cells arranged in the stacking direction; and bundling the body to be bundled so that a length of the battery assembly in the stacking direction is the stipulated length LT and a bundling pressure of the body to be bundled is a stipulated pressure P. In this case, the step of constructing the plurality of unit cells includes a processing in which a lamination direction thickness of an electrode body of a standard configuration that is predicted from the sheet thickness of the positive electrode sheet, negative electrode sheet, and separator sheet to be used to form the electrode body is compared with a stipulated electrode body thickness E, and the electrode body is formed to match the stipulated electrode body thickness E by increasing or decreasing the amount of the separator sheet used with respect to the standard configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Another preferred example of the unit cells that can be used in any of the methods for manufacturing a battery assembly disclosed herein relates to unit cells prepared by a step of constructing a plurality of unit cells of the same shape, each unit cell including an electrode body in which a positive electrode sheet and a negative electrode sheet are laminated together with a separator sheet, a container that accommodates the electrode body and an electrolyte, and a positive electrode terminal and a negative electrode terminal that are electrically connected to the positive electrode and the negative electrode and are disposed outside the container. The step of constructing the plurality of unit cells includes a processing in which a lamination direction thickness of the electrode body is measured and one or a plurality of gap filling materials are disposed in the lamination direction of the electrode body between the electrode body and an inner wall of the container according to the measured value of the lamination direction thickness, thereby adjusting the combined lamination direction thickness of the electrode body and the gap filling materials to a stipulated value A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">By so adjusting the combined thickness of the body (in this case, the electrode body and the gap filling material) that will be accommodated in the container to the stipulated value A, it is possible to form electrode bodies with more uniform thickness (smaller spread in thickness) and reduce a spread in thickness of the unit cells that will be thereafter obtained by accommodating the electrode bodies in the containers. Therefore, by using such unit cells, it is possible to manufacture a battery assembly having the stipulated stacking direction length LT and bundling pressure P with better accuracy. For example, fillers formed in sheets can be advantageously used as the gap filling material, and the total thickness of the electrode body and gap filling material can be easily adjusted to match the stipulated value A by increasing or decreasing the number of gap filling material sheets that are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">As described hereinabove, the battery assembly manufactured by any of the above-disclosed methods excels in stable quality and therefore can be advantageously used as a battery assembly for installation on a vehicle (for example, a battery for a motor (electric motor) of a vehicle such as an automobile).

<heading id="h-0005">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The preferred embodiments of the invention will be described below. A matter other than the subject specifically referred to in the present description, but necessary to carry out the invention (for example, methods for manufacturing a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a separator, configurations thereof, a method for bundling the unit cells, and a method for installing a battery assembly on a vehicle) may be understood as a design matter for a person skilled in the art on the basis of a related art in the pertinent field. The present invention can be implemented on the basis of the contents disclosed in the present description and general technical knowledge in the pertinent field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In the battery assembly manufactured by applying the technique disclosed herein, the configuration of each unit cell is not particularly limited, provided that the battery assembly has the unit cells (typically unit cells having a flat outer shape) that are arranged and bundled in the arrangement direction (stacking direction). Examples of unit cells that are preferred as the application objects of the present invention include secondary batteries such as nickel-hydrogen batteries and electric double layer capacitors. Among them, the present invention can be advantageously employed as a method for manufacturing a battery assembly using a lithium ion battery as a unit cell. Because the lithium ion battery is a secondary battery that can realize a high output at a high energy density, such a battery can be used to construct a high-performance battery assembly, in particular a battery assembly (battery module) for installation on a vehicle. Further, the present invention is advantageous as a method for manufacturing a battery assembly of a configuration in which a plurality of such arranged unit cells are connected in series or parallel (typically, in series).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The present invention will be described below in greater detail by the example in which a flat-shaped lithium ion battery is used as a unit cell and a battery assembly is manufactured in which a plurality of such unit cells are connected in series. In the drawings, members and components demonstrating like actions will be assigned with like reference numerals and the redundant explanation thereof is omitted or simplified.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Similarly to a unit cell provided in the conventional battery assembly, a unit cell used as a constituent element of the battery assembly manufactured in each of the below-described embodiments typically includes an electrode body composed of predetermined constituent material of the battery (active materials of positive and negative electrodes, collectors of positive and negative electrodes, separator, etc.) and a container that accommodates the electrode body and an appropriate electrolyte.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">As an example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a battery assembly <b>10</b> of the present example includes a predetermined number (typically 10 or more, preferably about 10 to 30, for example, 20) unit cells <b>12</b> of the same shape. The unit cell <b>12</b> has a container <b>14</b> of a shape (in the present embodiment, a flat box-like shape) that can accommodate the below-described flat-shaped wound electrode body. The “same shape” of the unit cells <b>12</b> means that the cells have been manufactured to the same target dimensions and does not necessarily mean that the dimensions of each portions are absolutely identical. The side of portions of the unit cells <b>12</b> (for example, the external shape such as thickness in the stacking direction) can have a spread due to a dimensional error in the manufacture of the container <b>14</b> used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The container <b>14</b> is provided with a positive electrode terminal <b>15</b> for electric connection to the positive electrode of the wound electrode body and a negative electrode terminal <b>16</b> for electric connection to the negative electrode of the electrode body. As shown in the figure, the positive electrode terminal <b>15</b> of one of the adjacent unit cells <b>12</b> is electrically connected to the negative electrode terminal <b>16</b> of the other of the adjacent unit cells with a connection tool <b>17</b>. The battery cell <b>10</b> of a desired voltage is thus constructed by connecting the unit cells <b>12</b> in series.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Similarly to the conventional unit cell container, a safety valve for releasing the gas generated inside the container can be provided in the container <b>14</b>. The configuration of such a container <b>14</b> does not by itself characterizes the present invention and therefore the detailed explanation thereof is omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The material of the container <b>14</b> is not particularly limited, provided that it is identical to the material used in the conventional until cells. For example a metallic (for example, aluminum or steel) container, a synthetic resin (for example, a polyolefin resin such as polypropylene or a high-melting resin such as polyethylene terephthalate, polytetrafluoroethylene, and a polyamide resin) container can be used. The container <b>14</b> in the present example is made, for example, from aluminum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality of unit cells <b>12</b> of the same shape are arranged in the direction facing a wide plane <b>14</b>A of the container <b>14</b> (that is, a plane facing a flat plane of the below-described wound electrode body <b>30</b> accommodated inside the container <b>14</b>), while inverting every other unit cell so that the positive electrode terminals <b>15</b> and negative electrode terminals <b>16</b> of the unit cells are disposed alternately. Cooling plates <b>11</b> of a predetermined shape are disposed in a state of intimate contact with the wide plane <b>14</b>A of the container <b>14</b> between the arranged unit cells <b>12</b> and at both outer sides in the unit cell arrangement direction (stacking direction). The cooling plates <b>11</b> function as heat dissipating members serving to dissipate efficiently the heat generated inside the unit cells in use. The cooling plates have a frame shape (for example, a concave-convex shape, as viewed from the side surface, such as a comb-like shape shown in the figure) that enables the introduction of a cooling fluid (typically, the air) between the unit cells <b>12</b>. Cooling plates <b>11</b> made from a metal with good thermal conductivity or a lightweight and hard synthetic resin such as polypropylene can be advantageously used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">A pair of end plates <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are disposed further outside of the cooling plates <b>11</b> disposed at both outer sides of the arranged until cells <b>12</b> and cooling plates <b>11</b> (referred together hereinbelow as “unit cell group”). A spacer member <b>40</b> serving as length adjusting means is inserted between the cooling plate <b>11</b> and end plate <b>18</b> disposed at one (right end in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) outer side of the unit cell group. The spacer member <b>40</b> is constituted by one or a plurality of stacked (three are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) sheet-like spacers (spacer sheets) <b>42</b>. The constituent material of the spacer members <b>40</b> (spacer sheets <b>42</b>) is not particularly limited and various materials (metallic materials, resin materials, ceramic materials, and the like) can be used, provided that they can demonstrate the below-described length adjusting function. From the standpoint of endurance against impacts, the use of metallic materials or resin materials is preferred. For example, the spacer member <b>40</b> made from a lightweight polyolefin resin can be advantageously used. In the present example, polypropylene sheets of the same thickness (typically a thickness of 0.03 mm to 3 mm, preferably 0.1 mm to 1 mm) are used as the spacer sheets <b>42</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The entire body (referred to hereinbelow as “body to be bundled”) <b>20</b> composed of the unit cell groups, spacer members <b>40</b>, and end plates <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> arranged in the stacking direction of the unit cells <b>12</b> is bundled by a stipulated bundling pressure P in the stacking direction of the body to be bundled, using a bundling band <b>21</b> for tightening that is wrapped around so as to bridge both end plates <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>. More specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the end portions of the bundling band <b>21</b> are tightened and fixed to the end plate <b>18</b> with screws <b>22</b>, whereby the body <b>20</b> to be bundled is bundled so that a stipulated bundling pressure P (for example such that a surface pressure received by the wall surface of the container <b>14</b> is about 2×10<sup>6 </sup>to 5×10<sup>6 </sup>Pa) is applied in the arrangement direction of the body to be bundled. The length (in the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the length between the outer ends of the end plates <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>) in the stacking direction of the battery assembly <b>10</b> bundled by such a stipulated bundling pressure P is a stipulated length LT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">With the manufacturing method of the present example, as will be described hereinbelow, the battery assembly <b>10</b> having the above-described configuration can be manufactured with good efficiency so as to realize the stipulated bundling pressure P and stipulated length LT with good stability. This manufacturing method will be explained below with reference to schematic diagrams shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">First, a step of preparing the predetermined number of unit cells <b>20</b> that will be used to construct the battery assembly <b>10</b> will be described. Similarly to a wound electrode body of the usual lithium ion battery, the until cell <b>20</b> has a flat-shaped wound electrode body <b>30</b> fabricated by laminating a sheet-like positive electrode <b>32</b> (can be also referred to hereinbelow as “positive electrode sheet <b>32</b>”), a sheet-like negative electrode <b>34</b> (can be also referred to hereinbelow as “negative electrode sheet <b>34</b>”), and a total of two sheet-like separators <b>36</b> (referred to hereinbelow as “separator sheets <b>36</b>”), winding, while somewhat shifting the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b> and negative electrode sheet <b>34</b>, and then flattening the obtained wound body from the side surface direction thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as a result of winding with the above-described shift in the transverse direction with respect to the winding direction of this wound electrode body <b>30</b>, end parts of the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b> and negative electrode sheet <b>34</b> protrude to the outside from a wound core portion <b>31</b> (that is, a portion obtained by tightly winding a positive electrode active material layer formation portion of the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b>, a negative electrode active material layer formation portion of the negative electrode sheet <b>34</b>, and the separator sheet <b>36</b>). A positive electrode lead terminal <b>32</b>B and a negative electrode lead terminal <b>34</b>B are attached to a positive electrode protruding portion (that is, a portion that does not form the positive electrode active material layer) <b>32</b>A and a negative electrode protruding portion (that is, a portion that does not form the negative electrode active material layer) <b>34</b>A, and these lead terminals <b>32</b>B, <b>34</b>B are electrically connected to the aforementioned positive electrode terminal <b>15</b> and negative electrode terminal <b>16</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The materials constituting the wound electrode body <b>30</b> and the members themselves are not particularly restricted and may be identical to those of the electrode body of the conventional lithium ion battery. For example, the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b> can be formed by providing a positive electrode active material layer for a lithium ion battery on an elongated positive electrode collector. An aluminum foil (present embodiment) or other metal foil suitable for the positive electrode can be advantageously used for the positive electrode collector. One, or two or more substances that have been conventionally used in lithium ion batteries can be used without any particular limitation for the positive electrode active material. The preferred examples include lithium transition metal oxides such as LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, and LiNiO<sub>2</sub>. For example, the advantageous positive electrode sheet <b>32</b> can be obtained by using an aluminum foil with a length of about 2 m to 4 m (for example 2.7 m), a width of about 8 cm to 12 cm (for example, 10 cm), and a thickness of about 5 μm to 20 μm (for example, 15 μm) as the collector, and forming a positive electrode active material layer (for example, lithium nickel oxide 88 wt. %, acetylene black 10 wt. %, polytetrafluoroethylene 1 wt. %, and carboxymethyl cellulose 1 wt. %) for a lithium ion battery that is based on a lithium nickel oxide by the usual method on the predetermined region of the collector surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The negative electrode sheet <b>34</b> can be formed by providing a negative electrode active material layer for a lithium ion battery on an elongated negative electrode collector. A copper foil (present embodiment) or other metal foil suitable for the negative electrode can be advantageously used for the negative electrode collector. One, or two or more substances that have been conventionally used in lithium ion batteries can be used without any particular limitation for the negative electrode active material. The preferred examples include carbon-containing materials such as graphite carbon and amorphous carbon, lithium transition metal oxides, and transition metal nitrides. For example, the advantageous negative electrode sheet <b>34</b> can be obtained by using a copper foil with a length of about 2 m to 4 m (for example 2.9 m), a width of about 8 cm to 12 cm (for example, 10 cm), and a thickness of about 5 μm to 20 μm (for example, 10 μm) as the collector, and forming a negative electrode active material layer (for example, graphite 98 wt. %, styrene-butadiene rubber 1 wt. %, and carboxymethyl cellulose 1 wt. %) for a lithium ion battery that is based on graphite by the usual method on the predetermined region of the collector surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The preferred separator sheet <b>36</b> used between the positive and negative electrode sheets <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> is constituted for example by a porous polyolefin resin. For example, a porous separator sheet from a synthetic resin (for example, a polyolefin such as polyethylene) with a length of about 2 m to 4 m (for example 3.1 m), a width of about 8 cm to 12 cm (for example, 11 cm), and a thickness of about 5 μm to 30 μm (for example, 25 μm) can be advantageously used. When a solid electrolyte or a gelled electrolyte is used as the electrode, the separator is sometimes unnecessary (that is, in this case, the electrolyte itself can function as the separator).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The flat-shaped wound electrode body <b>30</b> thus obtained is accommodated inside the container <b>14</b> so that the winding axis is side toppled as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a nonaqueous electrolyte (electrolytic solution) such as a mixed solvent (for example, a mass ratio of 1:1) of diethyl carbonate and ethylene carbonate including an appropriate amount (for example, a concentration of 1 M) of an appropriate support salt (for example, a lithium salt such as LiPF<sub>6</sub>) is poured in, and the container is sealed to produce the unit cell <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Then, as shown schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the predetermined number of unit cells <b>12</b> to be used in the manufacture of the battery assembly <b>10</b> are arranged in the stacking direction together with the predetermined number (the number sufficient to dispose the cooling plates between the unit cells <b>12</b> and at both outer sides of the arrangement) of cooling plates <b>11</b> used in the manufacture of the battery assembly <b>10</b>. Then, end plates <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are disposed at both ends of the arrangement. The stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the unit cells—cooling plates—end plates stacked body <b>24</b> that is configured as described hereinabove is measured and the measured value obtained (length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body <b>24</b> in the stacking direction) is compared with the target value L<b>0</b> of the stacking direction length of the body <b>20</b> to be bundled that has been set in advance. The target value L<b>0</b> is set so as to configure a battery assembly of a stipulated stacking direction length LT by bundling the body <b>20</b> to be bundled that has the stacking direction length L<b>0</b> with the stipulated bundling pressure P, in order words, so as to realize the stipulated bundling pressure P by wrapping around the bundling band <b>21</b> of a shape and size that enable the configuration of the battery assembly with the stipulated stacking direction length LT to the above-described body <b>20</b> to be bundled (that is, the body having the stacking direction length L<b>0</b>). The target value L<b>0</b> can be set on the basis of past results obtained in the process of manufacturing battery assemblies or can be readily found by preliminary tests.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As described hereinabove, the thickness of the predetermined number of unit cells <b>12</b> typically has a spread caused for example by a dimensional error in the manufacture of the containers <b>14</b> that will be used. Therefore, the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body <b>24</b> that includes the predetermined number of unit cells <b>12</b> arranged in the stacking direction has a spread reflecting the spread in thickness of these unit cells <b>12</b>. A spacer member (length adjusting means) <b>40</b> is selected that has a thickness suitable to compensate for the difference between the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> (actually measured value) of the stacked body <b>24</b> and the target value L<b>0</b> according to the stipulated stacking direction length L<b>1</b> measured with respect to the stacked body <b>24</b> to be used in the manufacture of the battery assembly <b>10</b>, so as to converge the spread in stacking direction length L<b>1</b>. Thus, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example in which three spacer sheets are used as the spacer member <b>40</b>, but the thickness of the spacer member <b>40</b> (total thickness of the spacer sheets) can be adjusted and the spread in stacking direction length L<b>1</b> per each stacked body can be converged (absorbed) by increasing or decreasing the number of the spacer sheets used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">By arranging the spacer member <b>40</b> selected in the above-described manner in addition to the constituent elements of the stacked body <b>24</b> (for example, the spacer member <b>40</b> is set between the cooling plate <b>11</b> and end plate <b>18</b> at the right end of the stacked body <b>24</b>), it is possible to adjust adequately the stacking direction length of the body <b>20</b> to be bundled (has a configuration obtained by adding the spacer member <b>40</b> to the stacked body <b>24</b>). The body <b>20</b> to be bundled is then bundled by wrapping around the bundling band <b>21</b> so as to create the stipulated bundling pressure P. Because the stacking direction thickness of the body <b>20</b> to be bundled is matched with the target value L<b>0</b>, the body <b>20</b> to be bundled can be adequately bundled by using the bundling band <b>21</b> of the same size (size corresponding to the stacking direction length LT), regardless of the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body <b>24</b>. The battery assembly <b>10</b> having the stipulated bundling pressure P and stipulated stacking direction length LT can thereafter be manufactured with good stability by connecting the positive electrode terminals <b>15</b> and negative electrode terminals <b>16</b> of the adjacent unit cells <b>12</b> with the connection tools <b>17</b>. Thus, with the present manufacturing method, it is possible to provide with good efficiency the battery assemblies <b>10</b> with the bundling pressure and stacking direction length that are well matched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In a case where the unit cell <b>12</b> has a configuration in which the thickness can be easily changed (for example, the thickness can be easily reduced by flexural deformation of the container <b>14</b>) by the pressure in the stacking direction (for example, the pressure similar to the bundling pressure P), or in a case where any of other constituent element (cooling plates <b>11</b>, end plates <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>) contained in the stacked body <b>24</b> can be easily induced to change the thickness by the pressure in the stacking direction, the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body <b>24</b> may be measured in a state in which a compressive stress (typically, a pressure corresponding to the bundling pressure P) is applied in the stacking direction to the stacked body <b>24</b>. As a result, the stacking direction length obtained when the finally obtained battery assembly <b>10</b> is bundled by the bundling pressure P can be more accurately matched with the stipulated length LT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the spacer member <b>40</b> is disposed at one outer side of the unit cell group, but the spacer member <b>40</b> may be also inserted for example in an almost central portion of the unit cell group. Further, in the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, all the components of the spacer member <b>40</b> (that is, the three spacer sheets <b>42</b>) are disposed together, but the spacer sheets <b>42</b> may be also disposed separately in various portions of the body <b>20</b> to be bundled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Among the constituent elements for the body <b>20</b> to be bundled, the arrangement order of the constituent elements contained in the stacked body <b>24</b> (unit cells <b>12</b>, cooling plates <b>11</b>, and end plates <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>) is preferably identical to the arrangement order of the constituent elements of the stacked body <b>24</b> at the time the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> is measured. In such a case, the battery assembly <b>10</b> having the stipulated bundling pressure P and the stipulated stacking direction length LT can be manufactured with better stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, instead of measuring the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body <b>24</b> in which the predetermined number of unit cells <b>12</b>, cooling plates <b>11</b>, and end plates <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are arranged, it is possible, for example, to measure the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body of unit cells in which only the predetermined number of unit cells <b>12</b> are stacked and adjust the thickness of the spacer member <b>40</b> according to the stacking direction length L<b>1</b>. More specifically, for example, it is possible to compare the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body of unit cells and the total thickness (can have a spread reflecting the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body of unit cells) of the predetermined number of cooling plates <b>11</b> and the end plates <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> contained in the body <b>20</b> to be bundled, with the target value L<b>0</b> of the stacking direction length of the body <b>20</b> to be bundled, and to select the thickness of the spacer member <b>40</b> so as to converge the spread in the total thickness and compensate the thickness of the target value L<b>0</b>. Such an approach can be advantageously used in the case in which the spread in stacking direction thickness of the cooling plates <b>11</b> and end plates <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> is sufficiently small to be ignored. Further, the manufacturing method of the present example can be also implemented in a mode in which the stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body of only the unit cells <b>12</b> is measured. Therefore, such a method can be also advantageously applied to manufacturing a battery assembly <b>10</b> of a configuration in which no cooling plates <b>11</b> are disposed between the unit cells <b>12</b> (for example, a battery assembly in which cooling air passages are formed between the adjacent unit cells <b>12</b> by using convex grooves provided in the wide surface <b>14</b>A of the container <b>14</b>).</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Example 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In the present embodiment, length adjusting means of a configuration different from that of the spacer member <b>40</b> in Example 1 is used as length adjusting means for converging the spread in stacking direction length L<b>1</b> of the stacked body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a battery assembly <b>10</b> of the present example includes a unit cell group composed of a predetermined number of unit cells <b>12</b> that have a structure similar to that described in Example 1 and cooling plates <b>11</b> disposed between the unit cells <b>12</b> and also at both outer sides in the stacking direction of the unit cells, end plates <b>50</b>, <b>19</b> disposed in intimate contact with the cooling plates <b>11</b> arranged at both outer side of the unit cell group, and a bundling band <b>21</b> that bundles a body <b>20</b> to be bundled that is composed of the unit cell group and the end plates <b>50</b>, <b>19</b> in the stacking direction. The battery assembly <b>10</b> is so configured that the body <b>20</b> to be bundled is bundled by the stipulated bundling pressure P and the length in the stacking direction is a stipulated length LT. A thickness adjusting mechanism that adjusts the thickness of the plate <b>50</b> in the stacking direction is provided in the end plate <b>50</b> disposed at one end (right end in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the unit cell group.

Further, the individual thickness of cooling plates <b>11</b> used in the same battery assembly <b>10</b> in which the unit cells <b>12</b> will be used is measured (in a case where the spread in thickness of the cooling plates <b>11</b> is small, a designed value may be used instead of the actually measured value of the thickness of the cooling plates <b>11</b>), and a total value DT of the thickness of these cooling plates <b>11</b> is found.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Then, the unit cells <b>12</b>, cooling plates <b>11</b>, end plates <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and a plurality of spacing adjusting members <b>44</b> having a total thickness FT are arranged to form the body <b>20</b> to be bundled.

The predetermined number of unit cells contained in the battery assembly <b>10</b> are then selected from the thickness ranks <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> in a combination such that the sum total of the representative values of the thickness ranks to which the unit cells belong is the stipulated thickness RT.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">Thus, a positive electrode sheet <b>32</b> is fabricated by forming a positive electrode active material layer for a lithium ion battery on an elongated positive electrode collector. For example, a composition in which a material for forming a positive electrode active material that has the positive electrode active material as a main component is dispersed in an appropriate dispersion agent is applied to body surfaces of a positive electrode collector (for example, an aluminum foil) and dried. The configuration obtained is pressed by squeezing between rolls <b>68</b> and then wound. This process is repeated to fabricate a plurality of positive electrode rolls <b>33</b> in which the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b> of a length corresponding to that necessary for a plurality of unit cells <b>12</b> is wound in a roll. In this case, the thickness of the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b> after pressing is measured as the active material is pressed by the rollers <b>68</b>, and the plurality of positive electrode rolls <b>33</b> are classified based on the measured sheet thickness into a plurality of thickness ranks with mutually different thickness ranges. For example, as shown schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the positive electrode roll <b>33</b> for which the sheet thickness T is within a range (M−0.1 μm≤T≤M+0.1 μm) of the average value M±0.1 μm of the measured values is classified into a thickness rank <b>2</b> for which M is a representative value, the positive electrode roll <b>33</b> for which the stacking direction thickness T is within a range M−0.3 μm≤T&lt;M−0.1 μm is classified into a thickness rank <b>1</b> for which M−0.2 μm is a representative value, and the positive electrode roll <b>33</b> for which the stacking direction thickness T is within a range M+0.1 μm&lt;T≤M+0.3 μm is classified into a thickness rank <b>3</b> for which M+0.2 μm is a representative value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Likewise, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a plurality of negative electrode rolls <b>35</b> (obtained by winding into rolls the negative electrode sheets of a length corresponding to that necessary for a plurality unit cells <b>12</b>) and separator rolls (obtained by winding into rolls the separator sheets of a length corresponding to that necessary for a plurality unit cells <b>12</b>) <b>37</b> that have been classified into respective thickness ranks <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> are prepared. Then, the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b>, negative electrode sheet <b>34</b>, and two separator sheets <b>36</b> for fabricating the wound electrode body <b>30</b> to be included in each electrode cell <b>12</b> contained in the battery assembly <b>10</b> are selected in combinations such that the sum total of the representative values of thickness ranks to which these sheets belong is the stipulated thickness ST. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b> and negative electrode sheet <b>34</b> are both selected from the thickness rank <b>2</b>, whereas one separator sheet is selected from the thickness rank <b>1</b> and the other from the thickness rank <b>3</b>. The selected four sheets, that is, the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b>, first separator sheet <b>36</b>, negative electrode sheet <b>34</b>, and second separator sheet <b>36</b> are laminated in the order of description and wound. The wound body obtained is flattened from the side surface direction, thereby producing a flat-shaped wound electrode body <b>30</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In this case, the four sheets used to fabricate the electrode body <b>30</b> are selected and combined so that the total thickness (lamination thickness) ST of the representative values of thickness ranks to which the sheets belong has a constant value. As a result, the thickness spread among the individual sheets can be canceled and wound electrode bodies <b>30</b> with the thickness well matched in the flattening direction (small spread in thickness) can be manufactured with good stability and efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">Such a decrease in the spread in thickness of the wound electrode bodies <b>30</b> makes it possible to reduce a spread in thickness of unit cells in which the electrode body <b>30</b> is accommodated in the container <b>14</b>. By constructing a battery assembly in which such unit cells with a small spread in thickness are arranged in the stacking direction, it is possible to manufacture a battery assembly having the stipulated stacking direction length LT and bundling pressure P with good stability and efficiency. The reduction of spread in thickness of electrode bodies can demonstrate an especially significant effect when a container is used that has a configuration or includes a material such that the thickness can be easily changed by a pressure applied in the stacking direction (for example, a pressure similar to the bundling pressure P). Further, because using such unit cells with a small spread in thickness makes it possible to match effectively the stacking pitches D of the unit cells, the terminals of unit cells can be connected with good efficiency by using connection tools of the same predetermined shape, similarly to the battery assembly of Example 5 and manufacturing method thereof. Measuring the thickness as the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b> is manufactured, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, is preferred because the thickness measurement step can be incorporated in the conventional process for manufacturing the positive electrode sheet <b>32</b> (for example, a pressing process) and implemented in an in-line mode and no novel step has to be added to measure the thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">By using the unit cells with a small spread in thickness that have been obtained by the method of the present example, a battery assembly may be manufactured for example by the above-described manufacturing methods of Examples 1 to 6. Thus, the unit cells manufactured (prepared) by the method according to Example 7 can be advantageously used as the unit cells <b>12</b> used in the manufacturing methods of Examples 1 to 6. The battery assembly having the stipulated stacking direction length LT and bundling pressure P can thus be manufactured with even better accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">The total thickness ST of the four aforementioned sheets can be set to form an electrode body with a thickness suitable for accommodation in the container with consideration for a distance in the stacking direction inside the container (distance between the inner walls of the opposing flat surfaces), a length of the sheets used, and a winding diameter of the wound electrode body (before flattening). The ST is preferably set such that no excessive gap remains between the inner wall of the container and the flat surface of the electrode body accommodated in the container and no excessive bulging of the container is caused by the electrode body contained therein.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Thus, similarly to the electrode body <b>30</b> provided for a unit cell <b>12</b> used in Example 1 (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), a flat-shaped wound electrode body <b>30</b> is fabricated by laminating the elongated positive electrode sheet, negative electrode sheet, and two separator sheets, winding, and flattening the obtained wound body from the side surface direction. In this case, a stacking direction thickness F of the electrode body (electrode body of standard configuration; can be referred to hereinbelow as “standard electrode body”) that is manufactured by the predetermined conditions (inner diameter of the wound body, tension during winding, number of winding turns, etc.) by laminating the aforementioned sheets, that is, the length between the flat surfaces of the electrode body, is predicted from the sheet thickness of the positive electrode sheet, negative electrode sheet, and separator sheets used to fabricate the electrode body <b>30</b>. The stacking direction thickness F of the standard electrode body can be predicted based on the past results obtained battery assembly manufacture or can be readily found by preliminary testing. Further, for example, similarly to Example 7, the thickness of each sheet can be measured in an in-line mode by incorporating a thickness measurement mechanism in the conventional sheet manufacturing process (for example, electrode sheet pressing process).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The stacking direction thickness F of the standard electrode body is compared with a stacking direction thickness E of a stipulated (target) electrode body, and the amount of the separator sheet used is increased or decreased with respect to that in the configuration of the standard electrode body so as to match the thickness of the electrode body <b>30</b> that will be obtained with the electrode body thickness E. For example, in a case in which the stacking direction thickness F of the standard electrode body, which is predicted from the thickness of each sheet used, is somewhat larger than the target electrode body thickness E (this can occur, for example, because the thickness of the positive electrode sheet used is larger than the average value due to a spread in thickness in the positive electrode sheet manufacturing process) in the standard electrode body with a configuration in which only the separator sheet is wound several times (for example, 2 to 3 turns) at the winding end of the electrode body <b>30</b>, the length of the separator sheet used is decreased and the number of winding turns of the separator sheet at the winding end is reduced. Conversely, in a case in which the stacking direction thickness F of the standard electrode body, which is predicted from the thickness of each sheet used, is somewhat smaller than the target electrode body thickness E (this can occur, for example, because the thickness of the negative electrode sheet used is smaller than the average value due to a spread in thickness in the negative electrode sheet manufacturing process), as in the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the length of the separator sheet <b>36</b> used is increased and the number of winding turns of the separator sheet <b>36</b> at the winding end is increased. It is thus possible to manufacture the wound electrode body <b>30</b> in which the thickness in the flattening direction is well matched with the target electrode body thickness E (small spread in thickness) with good stability and efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">Such a decrease in the spread in thickness of the wound electrode bodies <b>30</b> makes it possible to reduce a spread in thickness of unit cells in which the electrode body <b>30</b> is accommodated in the container.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">A method for manufacturing a battery assembly of the present embodiment will be explained below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Thus, similarly to the electrode body <b>30</b> provided for a unit cell <b>12</b> used in Example 1, a flat-shaped wound electrode body <b>30</b> is fabricated by laminating the elongated positive electrode sheet, negative electrode sheet, and two separator sheets, winding, and flattening the obtained wound body from the side surface direction. A thickness G of the electrode body <b>30</b> thus obtained is measured and compared with a stipulated value (target value) A of the stacking direction thickness of a body <b>38</b> that will be accommodated in a container <b>14</b>. This body <b>38</b> to be accommodated is composed of the electrode body <b>30</b> and one, or two or more gap filling sheets (gas filling materials) <b>46</b> that are placed, if necessary, on the flat surface of the electrode body <b>30</b> and accommodated together with the electrode body <b>30</b> in the container <b>14</b>. The stipulated value A is set so as to obtain a thickness suitable for accommodation in the container <b>14</b> with consideration for the distance between the inner walls of the opposing flat surfaces of the container <b>14</b>. The stipulated value A is preferably set such that no excessive gap remains between the inner wall of the container <b>14</b> and the flat surface of the body <b>38</b> accommodated in the container and no excessive bulging of the container <b>14</b> is caused by the body <b>38</b> contained therein. In a simple mode, for example, the distance between the inner walls can be used as the target value A of the stacking direction thickness of the body <b>38</b> to be accommodated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">The desired number of the gap filling sheets <b>46</b> are then placed on the flat surface of the electrode body <b>30</b> so that the stacking direction thickness G (measured value) of the electrode body <b>30</b> obtained is matched with the target value A. A material similar to the spacer material <b>40</b> explained in Example 1 can be advantageously used as the constituent material of the gap filling sheets <b>46</b>. In the present example, polypropylene sheets of the same thickness (typically 10 μm to 1000 μm, preferably 100 μm to 200 μm) are used as the gap filling sheets <b>46</b>. In a case where a plurality of the gap filling sheets <b>46</b> are used for one electrode body <b>30</b>, it is preferred that these gap filling sheets <b>46</b> be distributed as uniform as possible at both sides in the lamination direction of the electrode body <b>30</b>. Further, the manufacturing conditions of the electrode body <b>30</b> may be adjusted so that the maximum value (MAX value) of the stacking direction thickness G of the electrode body <b>30</b> estimated from the thickness spread of the positive electrode sheets, negative electrode sheets, and separator sheets is the target value A (that is, so that the desired number of gap filling sheets <b>46</b> is zero when the stacking direction thickness G of the electrode body <b>30</b> is the MAX value (=A)). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows an example in which in the unit cell <b>12</b> (<b>12</b>B) second from the left end and the unit cell <b>12</b> (<b>12</b>D) second from the right end, two gap filling sheets <b>46</b> are disposed on the left and right of the electrode body <b>30</b> of an average thickness, in the unit cell <b>12</b> (<b>12</b>C) third from the left end, two gap filling sheets <b>46</b> are disposed on the right side and three on the left side (a total of five sheets) of the thin electrode body <b>30</b>, in the unit cell <b>12</b> (<b>12</b>A) on the left end, one gap filling sheet <b>46</b> is disposed on the right side and two gap filling sheets are disposed on the left side (a total of three sheets) of the thick electrode body <b>30</b>, and in the unit cell <b>12</b> (<b>12</b>E) on the right end, one gap filling sheet <b>46</b> is disposed on the left side and one on the right side of even thicker electrode body <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Thus, by increasing and decreasing the number of the gap filling sheets <b>46</b> used for each unit cell <b>12</b> according to the measured value of the stacking direction thickness G of the electrode body <b>30</b>, it is possible to converge (absorb) the spread in thickness G of the electrode bodies <b>30</b> and enable good matching of the stacking direction thickness of the bodies <b>38</b> to be accommodated with the target value A. As a result, the spread in thickness of the unit cells <b>12</b> in which the body <b>38</b> is accommodated in the container <b>14</b> can be reduced. By constructing the battery assembly <b>10</b> by using such unit cells <b>12</b> with a small spread in thickness, it is possible to manufacture the battery assembly <b>10</b> having the stipulated stacking direction length LT and bundling pressure P with good stability and efficiency. The reduction of spread in thickness of the bodies <b>38</b> to be accommodated can demonstrate an especially significant effect when a container <b>14</b> that has a configuration or includes a material such that the thickness can be easily changed by a pressure applied in the stacking direction (for example, a pressure similar to the bundling pressure P) is used as the container. Further, because using such unit cells <b>12</b> with a small spread in thickness makes it possible to match effectively the stacking pitches D of the unit cells <b>12</b>, the terminals of the unit cells <b>12</b> can be connected with good efficiency by using connection tools <b>17</b> of the same predetermined shape, similarly to the battery assembly of Example 5 and manufacturing method thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The configurations described herein by way of examples can be used in appropriate combinations. For example, the battery assembly <b>10</b> may be manufactured by the manufacturing methods of Examples 1 to 6 by using the unit cells <b>12</b> with a small thickness spread that have been obtained by the method of Example 9. Thus, the unit cells <b>12</b> manufactured (prepared) by the method of Example 9 can be advantageously used as the unit cell <b>12</b> for use in the manufacturing methods of Examples 1 to 6. The battery assembly <b>10</b> having the stipulated stacking direction length LT and bundling pressure P can thus be manufactured with even better accuracy. Further, Example 3 (configuration using an elastic member) may be combined with Example 5 (configuration using a spacing adjusting member). As a result, it is possible to obtain a constant stacking pitch D of unit cells and realize the stipulated bundling pressure P with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Further, in the above-described examples (e.g., Example 3), the stacking direction length is measured with respect to the electrode body including a total predetermined number (for example, 20) of unit cells constituting the battery assembly, but the number of unit cells arranged during the measurements is not limited thereto and may be the number that can allow (converge) the dimensional spread. For example, the stacking direction length may be measured for some (for 5, for 10, etc.) of the unit cells constituting the battery assembly. The methods for manufacturing a battery assembly that are disclosed herein can include such as an aspect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Several preferred embodiments of the battery assembly manufacturing method in accordance with the present invention and the battery assemblies that can be manufactured by these methods are explained hereinabove in detail, but the present invention is not intended to be limited to these specific embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">For example, in the above-described embodiments, the electrode body <b>30</b> is accommodated in the container <b>14</b> in an orientation such that the winding axis of the wound electrode body <b>30</b> is a transverse direction (the direction in the thickness of paper sheet in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the unit cell <b>12</b>, but the electrode body <b>30</b> may be also disposed so that the winding axis is the height direction (up down direction in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the unit cell <b>12</b>. Further, an electrode body of a laminated type in which a plurality of positive electrode sheets and a plurality of positive electrode sheets are alternately laminated together with separator sheets may be used instead of the electrode bodies <b>30</b> of a wound type. The invention disclosed herein can be advantageously applied to a battery assembly in which a plurality of unit cells in which electrode bodies having various configurations are accommodated in containers (in particular, unit cells in which electrode bodies of a wound type or a laminated type are accommodated in containers with an orientation such that the sheets constituting the electrode bodies are laminated in the stacking direction of the unit cells) are arranged in the stacking direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, the type of unit cells constituting the battery assembly is not limited to the above-described lithium ion battery, and the unit cells may be batteries of various contents that differ in the electrode body constituent material or electrode, for example, lithium secondary batteries that use metallic lithium or a lithium alloy as a negative electrode, nickel hydrogen batteries, nickel cadmium batteries, and electric double layer capacitors.</div>
