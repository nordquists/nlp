<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a wireless communication system, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for inserting an index into a code block as a unit in which a channel code is performed and transmitting the same.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet a demand for radio data traffic that is on an increasing trend since commercialization of a 4G communication system, efforts to develop an improved 5G communication system or a pre-5G communication system have been conducted. For this reason, the 5G communication system or the pre-5G communication system is called a beyond 4G network communication system or a post LTE system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">To achieve a high data transmission rate, the 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in a very high frequency (mmWave) band (e.g., like 60 GHz band). To relieve a path loss of a radio wave and increase a transfer distance of the radio wave in the very high frequency band, in the 5G communication system, beamforming, massive MIMO, full dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, analog beam-forming, and large scale antenna technologies have been discussed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, to improve a network of the system, in the 5G communication system, technologies such as an evolved small cell, an advanced small cell, a cloud radio access network (cloud RAN), an ultra-dense network, a device to device communication (D2D), a wireless backhaul, a moving network, cooperative communication, coordinated multi-points (CoMP), and reception interference cancellation have been developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to this, in the 5G system, hybrid FSK and QAM modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) that are an advanced coding modulation (ACM) scheme and a filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), a non orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and a sparse code multiple access (SCMA) that are an advanced access technology, and so on have been developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, the Internet is evolved from a human-centered connection network through which a human being generates and consumes information to the Internet of Things (IoT) network that transmits/receives information between distributed components such as things and processes the information. The Internet of Everything (IoE) technology in which the big data processing technology, etc., is combined with the IoT technology by connection with a cloud server, etc. has also emerged. To implement the IoT, technology elements, such as a sensing technology, wired and wireless communication and network infrastructure, a service interface technology, and a security technology, have been used. Recently, technologies such as a sensor network, machine to machine (M2M), and machine type communication (MTC) for connecting between things has been researched. In the IoT environment, an intelligent Internet technology (IT) service that creates a new value in human life by collecting and analyzing data generated in the connected things may be provided. The IoT may be applied to fields, such as a smart home, a smart building, a smart city, a smart car or a connected car, a smart grid, health care, smart appliances, and an advanced healthcare service, by fusing and combining the existing information technology (IT) with various industries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, various tries to apply the 5G communication system to the IoT network have been conducted. For example, the 5G communication technologies, such as the sensor network, the machine to machine (M2M), and the machine type communication (MTC), have been implemented by techniques such as beamforming, MIMO, and the array antenna. The application of the cloud radio access network (cloud RAN) as the big data processing technology described above may also be considered as an example of the fusing of the 5G communication technology with the IoT technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, recently, there is a need for a method and apparatus for inserting an index into a code block as a unit in which a channel code is executed and transmitting the same, in accordance with the development of a next generation mobile communication system.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">To address the above-discussed deficiencies, a primary object of the present is directed to a method of inserting a code block (CB) index, a method of operating a system by applying a CB index to retransmission, and the like. In a wireless communication system, in particular, the existing LTE system, a data transmission is performed in a transport block (TB) unit. The TB is divided into a plurality of code blocks (CB), and channel coding is performed in a CB unit. The retransmission after an initial transmission is performed in a TB unit, and the TBs need to be retransmitted even when only one CB fails to decode. Therefore, it may be a case in which the retransmission needs to be made in a CB unit. For the case, there is a need for a method of inserting and operating a CB index notifying a CB of the order of CBs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present disclosure is directed to provision of a transmitting and receiving of a terminal in a mobile communication system. The 5th generation wireless cellular communication system (hereinafter, referred to as 5G communication system) should be able to provide various services having different transmission/reception techniques and transmission/reception parameters in one system in order to satisfy various requirements and services of users and aims to be designed so that services to be added in future in consideration of forward compatibility will not be restricted by the design of the existing system. As an example of a method for supporting various services, the 5G communication system should be able to operate more efficiently in various frequency bands than the existing communication system. That is, the 5G communication system should be able to operate efficiently even in a frequency band of 70 GHz or more as well as in a frequency band of 1 GHz or less. In the frequency band of 1 GHz of less, the 5G communication system has an advantage of securing a wide coverage but has a disadvantage in that it is difficult to secure a wide frequency band. On the other hand, in the high frequency band of 70 GHz or more, the 5G communication system is easy to secure a wide frequency band and therefore is suitable for superhigh speed data transmission, but has a disadvantage of a narrow coverage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the present disclosure is directed to provision of various services having different transmission/reception techniques and transmission/reception parameters in one system in order to satisfy various requirements and services of users in the 5th generation wireless cellular communication system (hereinafter, referred to as 5G communication system) and to realize a design so that services to be added in future in consideration of forward compatibility are not restricted by the current system. As an example of a method for supporting various services in the 5G communication system, the present disclosure can consider a system for supporting a plurality of numerologies or subcarrier spacing in one system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Meanwhile, in the wireless communication system, a terminal performs the following initial connection step for the purpose of establishing a radio link with a base station. First, synchronization with a cell in a network is acquired, and a master information block (MIB) is acquired by physical broadcast channel (PBCH) decoding. The MIB contains the most basic information for connection to the system. Based on the information, a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) and a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) are decoded to obtain a system information block (SIB). Thereafter, it exchanges identity with the base station through a random access step and then performs an initial connection to a network through steps such as registration and authentication. At this time, since the 5G communication system supports various numerologies, for example, various parameters for the subcarrier spacing, the numerologies for the physical layer channel in which each information is transmitted in the initial connection step may be different from each other. However, since the terminal can not know the subcarrier spacing used by the system during the initial connection process, the initial connection may not be efficiently performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, a terminal in an RRC_IDLE state undergoes a paging process to start data transmission/reception. In order to observe the paging information, the terminal wakes up for a little while at a predetermined time interval to observe control signaling. For the terminal in the RRC_IDLE state, the network knows a location of the terminal in a tracking area (TA) unit, not in a cell unit, in which the TA is defined by grouping several neighboring eNBs. The paging message may be transmitted across a plurality of cells within the TA. The paging message is transmitted through the PDSCH, and scheduling information on the PDSCH can be acquired from the PDCCH configured as P-RNTI. In this case, if various numerologies are used in the 5G communication system, each cell can transmit the paging message through a physical layer channel set at different subcarrier spacings. In particular, if an initial connection to a certain cell is performed and then a reselection to another cell is performed, the corresponding cell does not have any information on the terminal in the RRC_IDLE state, such that an operation procedure for efficiently transmitting the paging message is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, the present disclosure proposes an effective method and operation procedure for cell initial connection and paging suitable for the 5G communication system. The cell initial connection and paging method proposed by the present disclosure can support the efficient services for various numerologies to more flexibly operate the 5G communication system capable of simultaneously providing different requirements.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 3R</figref>, discussed below, and the various embodiments used to describe the principles of the present disclosure in this patent document are by way of illustration only and should not be construed in any way to limit the scope of the disclosure. Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented in any suitably arranged electronic device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. When it is decided that a detailed description for the known function or configuration related to the present disclosure may obscure the present disclosure, the detailed description therefor will be omitted. Further, the following terminologies are defined in consideration of the functions in the present disclosure and may be construed in different ways by the intention or practice of users and operators. Therefore, the definitions thereof should be construed based on the contents throughout the specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Various advantages and features of the present disclosure and methods accomplishing the same will become apparent from the following detailed description of embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the embodiments disclosed herein but will be implemented in various forms. The embodiments have made disclosure of the present disclosure complete and are provided so that those skilled in the art can easily understand the scope of the present disclosure. Therefore, the present disclosure will be defined by the scope of the appended claims. Like reference numerals throughout the description denote like elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">To meet a demand for radio data traffic that is on an increasing trend since commercialization of a 4G communication system, efforts to develop an improved 5G communication system or a pre-5G communication system have been conducted. For this reason, the 5G communication system or the pre-5G communication system is called a beyond 4G network communication system or a post LTE system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">To achieve a high data transmission rate, the 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in a very high frequency (mmWave) band (e.g., like 60 GHz band). To relieve a path loss of a radio wave and increase a transfer distance of the radio wave in the very high frequency band, in the 5G communication system, beamforming, massive MIMO, full dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, analog beam-forming, and large scale antenna technologies have been discussed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, to improve a network of the system, in the 5G communication system, technologies such as an evolved small cell, an advanced small cell, a cloud radio access network (cloud RAN), an ultra-dense network, a device to device communication (D2D), a wireless backhaul, a moving network, cooperative communication, coordinated multi-points (CoMP), and reception interference cancellation have been developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition to this, in the 5G system, hybrid FSK and QAM modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) that are an advanced coding modulation (ACM) scheme and a filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), a non orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and a sparse code multiple access (SCMA) that are an advanced access technology, and so on have been developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Meanwhile, the Internet is evolved from a human-centered connection network through which a human being generates and consumes information to the Internet of Things (IoT) network that transmits/receives information between distributed components such as things and processes the information. The Internet of Everything (IoE) technology in which the big data processing technology, etc., is combined with the IoT technology by connection with a cloud server, etc., has also emerged. To implement the IoT, technology elements, such as a sensing technology, wired and wireless communication and network infrastructure, a service interface technology, and a security technology, have been used. Recently, technologies such as a sensor network, machine to machine (M2M), and machine type communication (MTC) for connecting between things has been researched. In the IoT environment, an intelligent Internet technology (IT) service that creates a new value in human life by collecting and analyzing data generated in the connected things may be provided. The IoT may be applied to fields, such as a smart home, a smart building, a smart city, a smart car or a connected car, a smart grid, health care, smart appliances, and an advanced healthcare service, by fusing and combining the existing information technology (IT) with various industries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Therefore, various tries to apply the 5G communication system to the IoT network have been conducted. For example, technologies such as the sensor network, the machine to machine (M2M), and the machine type communication (MTC), have been implemented by techniques such as the beamforming, the MIMO, and the array antenna that are the 5G communication technologies. The application of the cloud radio access network (cloud RAN) as the big data processing technology described above may also be considered as an example of the fusing of the 5G technology with the IoT technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Meanwhile, a new radio access technology (NR) which is a new 5G communication system is designed to freely multiplex various services in time and frequency resources. Accordingly, waveform/numerology, a reference signal and the like may be dynamically or freely allocated according to a need of the corresponding services. In order to provide an optimal service to a terminal in wireless communication, it is important to transmit optimized data based on a quality of channels and a measurement of an interference amount. As a result, it is essential to accurately measure a channel status. However, unlike the 4G communication in which channel and interference characteristics are not greatly changed depending on frequency resources, the 5G channel has channel and interference characteristics greatly changed depending on services, and as a result, there is a need to support a subset of frequency resource group (FRG) that can measure the channel and interference characteristics separately. Meanwhile, in the NR system, a kind of supported services may be classified into categories such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) or the like. The eMBB may be considered as a service aiming at a high speed transmission of high-capacity data, the mMTC may be considered as a service aiming at terminal power minimization and an access of multiple terminals, and the URLLC may be considered as a service aiming at high reliability and low latency. Different requirements may be applied depending on a type of services applied to the terminal</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">As described above, a plurality of services can be provided to a user in the communication system, and a method capable of providing each service within the same time interval in accordance with characteristics to provide a plurality of services to users and an apparatus using the same are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">In describing the embodiments of the present disclosure, a description of technical contents which are well known to the art to which the present disclosure belongs and are not directly connected with the present disclosure will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">For the same reason, some components are exaggerated, omitted, or schematically illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Further, the size of each component does not exactly reflect its real size. In each drawing, the same or corresponding components are denoted by the same reference numerals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Various advantages and features of the present disclosure and methods accomplishing the same will become apparent from the following detailed description of embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the embodiments disclosed herein but will be implemented in various forms. The embodiments have made disclosure of the present disclosure complete and are provided so that those skilled in the art can easily understand the scope of the present disclosure. Therefore, the present disclosure will be defined by the scope of the appended claims. Like reference numerals throughout the description denote like elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In this case, it may be understood that each block of processing flow charts and combinations of the flow charts may be performed by computer program instructions. Since these computer program instructions may be mounted in processors for a general computer, a special computer, or other programmable data processing apparatuses, these instructions executed by the processors for the computer or the other programmable data processing apparatuses create means performing functions described in block(s) of the flow charts. Since these computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer usable or computer readable memory of a computer or other programmable data processing apparatuses in order to implement the functions in a specific scheme, the computer program instructions stored in the computer usable or computer readable memory may also produce manufacturing articles including instruction means performing the functions described in block(s) of the flow charts. Since the computer program instructions may also be mounted on the computer or the other programmable data processing apparatuses, the instructions performing a series of operation steps on the computer or the other programmable data processing apparatuses to create processes executed by the computer to thereby execute the computer or the other programmable data processing apparatuses may also provide steps for performing the functions described in block(s) of the flow charts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In addition, each block may indicate some of modules, segments, or codes including one or more executable instructions for executing a specific logical function (s). Further, it is to be noted that functions mentioned in the blocks occur regardless of a sequence in some alternative embodiments. For example, two blocks that are consecutively illustrated may be simultaneously performed in fact or be performed in a reverse sequence depending on corresponding functions sometimes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Here, the term โ-unitโ used in the present embodiment means software or hardware components such as FPGA and ASIC and the โหunitโ performs any roles. However, the meaning of the โหunitโ is not limited to software or hardware. The โหunitโ may be configured to be in a storage medium that may be addressed and may also be configured to reproduce one or more processor. Accordingly, for example, the โหunitโ includes components such as software components, object oriented software components, class components, and task components and processors, functions, attributes, procedures, subroutines, segments of program code, drivers, firmware, microcode, circuit, data, database, data structures, tables, arrays, and variables.

In addition, the components and the โหunitsโ may also be implemented to reproduce one or more CPUs within a device or a security multimedia card. Further, in some embodiments, โหunitโ may include one or more processors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">A wireless communication system has been developed from a wireless communication system providing a voice centered service in the early stage toward broadband wireless communication systems providing high-speed, high-quality packet data services, such as communication standards of high speed packet access (HSPA) and long term evolution (LTE) or evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) of the 3GPP, high rate packet data (HRPD) and ultra mobile broadband (UMB) of 3GPP2, 802.16e of IEEE or the like. In addition, the 5G or new radio (NR) communication standards are being produced as the 5G wireless communication system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">As a representative example of the broadband wireless communication system, the LTE system has adopted an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme in a downlink (DL) and has adopted a single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) scheme in an uplink (UL). The uplink refers to a radio link through which a user equipment (UE) or a mobile station (MS) transmits data or a control signal to a base station (eNodeB or base station (BS)) and the down link refers to a radio link through which a base station transmits data or a control signal to a terminal. The multiple access scheme as described above normally allocates and operates time-frequency resources including data or control information to be transmitted to each other to prevent the time-frequency resources from overlapping with each other, that is, establish orthogonality, thereby dividing the data or the control information of each user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">If a decoding failure occurs upon initial transmission, the LTE system has adopted a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme of retransmitting the corresponding data in a physical layer. If a receiver does not accurately decode data, the HARQ scheme enables a receiver to transmit information (negative acknowledgement (NACK)) notifying the decoding failure to a transmitter so that the transmitter can retransmit the corresponding data in the physical layer. The receiver combines the data retransmitted by the transmitter with the data that are not decoded previously, thereby increasing reception performance of the data. Further, if the receiver accurately decodes the data, information (acknowledgement (ACK)) notifying a decoding success is transmitted to the transmitter so that the transmitter may transmit new data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a diagram of a basic structure of a time-frequency domain that is a radio resource region in which data or a control channel is transmitted in a downlink, in the LTE system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a horizontal axis represents a time domain and a vertical axis represents a frequency domain. A minimum transmission unit in the time domain is an OFDM symbol, in which one slot <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>06</b> is configured by collecting N<sub>symb </sub>OFDM symbols <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>02</b> and one subframe <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>05</b> is configured by collecting two slots. A length of the slot is 0.5 milliseconds (ms) and a length of the subframe is 1.0 ms. Further, a radio frame <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> is a time domain unit which includes 10 subframes. A minimum transmission unit in the frequency domain is a subcarrier, in which the whole system transmission bandwidth includes a total of N<sub>BW </sub>subcarriers <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>04</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">A basic unit of resources in the time-frequency domain is a resource element (RE) <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>12</b> and may be represented by an OFDM symbol index and a subcarrier index. A resource block (RB) (or a physical resource block (PRB)) <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>08</b> is defined by the N<sub>symb </sub>continued OFDM symbols <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>02</b> in the time domain and N<sub>RB </sub>continued subcarriers <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>10</b> in the frequency domain. Therefore, one RB <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>08</b> includes N<sub>symb</sub>รN<sub>RB </sub>REs <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>12</b>. Generally, a minimum transmission unit of the data is the RB unit. In the LTE system, generally, N<sub>symb</sub>=7 and N<sub>RB</sub>=12, and N<sub>BW </sub>and N<sub>RB </sub>are proportional to a bandwidth of the system transmission band, but other values may be used in systems other than the LTE system. A data rate is increased in proportion to the number of RBs scheduled for the terminal. The LTE system is operated by defining six transmission bandwidths. In an FDD system operated by dividing the downlink and the uplink based on a frequency, a downlink transmission bandwidth and an uplink transmission bandwidth may be different from each other. A channel bandwidth represents an RF bandwidth corresponding to the system transmission bandwidth. The following Table 1a-01 shows a correspondence relationship between the system transmission bandwidth and a channel bandwidth that are defined in the LTE system. For example, the LTE system having the channel bandwidth of 10 MHz is configured of a transmission bandwidth including 50 RBs.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The downlink control information may be transmitted within first N OFDM symbols within the subframe. Generally, N={1, 2, 3}. Therefore, the N value may variably apply to each subframe depending on the amount of control information to be transmitted to the current subframe. The transmitted control information may include a control channel transmission section indicator representing over how many OFDM symbols the control information is transmitted, scheduling information on downlink data or uplink data, information on HARQ ACK/NACK.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In the LTE system, the scheduling information on the downlink data or the uplink data is transmitted from a base station to a terminal through downlink control information (DCI). The DCI is defined depending on various formats. Depending on each format, it may be represented whether the DCI is scheduling information (uplink (UL) grant) on the uplink data or scheduling information (downlink (DL) grant) on the downlink data, whether the DCI is compact DCI having small-sized control information, whether to apply spatial multiplexing using a multiple antenna, whether the DCI is DCI for a power control, or the like. For example, DCI format 1 that is the scheduling control information (DL grant) on the downlink data may include at least one of the following control information.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0119">Generally, the DCI is independently scrambled with a specific radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) (or a terminal identifier) for each terminal to be added with a cyclic redundant check (CRC), subjected to channel coding, and then configured of independent PDCCH to be transmitted. In the time domain, the PDCCH is transmitted while being mapped during the control channel transmission section. A mapping location in the frequency domain of the PDCCH may be determined by identifiers (IDs) of each terminal and transmitted over the entire system transmission bandwidth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0120">The downlink data may be transmitted on a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) that is a physical channel for downlink data transmission.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0126">In the LTE system, a timing relationship between a PUCCH or a PUSCH is defined, with the PUCCH or the PUSCH being an uplink physical channel to which an HARQ ACK/NACK corresponding to a PDSCH as a physical channel for downlink data transmission or a PDCCH/EPDDCH including a semi-persistent scheduling release (SPS release) is transmitted. For example, in an LTE system operated by frequency division duplex (FDD), the HARQ ACK/NACK corresponding to the PDSCH transmitted in an nโ4-th subframe or the PDCCH/EPDCCH including the SPS release is transmitted to the PUCCH or the PUSCH in an n-th subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0127">In the LTE system, the downlink HARQ has adopted an asynchronous HARQ scheme in which data retransmission time is not fixed. That is, if for initial transmission data transmitted by the base station, the HARQ NACK is fed back from the terminal, the base station freely determines transmission time of retransmission data based on the scheduling operation. The terminal performs buffering on data determined as an error as a result of decoding the received data for an HARQ operation and then performs combining with the next retransmission data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0128">If the terminal receives the PDSCH including the downlink data transmitted from the base station in subframe n, the terminal transmits the uplink control information including the HARQ ACK or the NACK of the downlink data to the base station through the PUCCH or PUSCH in subframe n+k. At this time, the k is differently defined depending on the FDD or time division duplex (TDD) of the LTE system and the subframe setting thereof. For example, in the case of the FDD LTE system, the k is fixed as 4.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0130">If in the subframe n, the terminal receives the PDCCH including the uplink scheduling control information transmitted from the base station or the PHICH to which the downlink HARQ ACK/NACK are transmitted, the terminal transmits the uplink data corresponding to the control information through the PUSCH in subframe n+k. At this time, the k is differently defined depending on the FDD or the time division duplex (TDD) of the LTE system and the setting thereof. For example, in the case of the FDD LTE system, the k is fixed as 4. Meanwhile, in the case of the TDD LTE system, the k may be changed depending on the subframe setting and the subframe number. In the FDD LTE system, if the base station transmits an uplink scheduling grant or a downlink control signal and data to the terminal in the subframe n, the terminal receives the uplink scheduling grant or the downlink control signal and data in the subframe n. First, if the uplink scheduling grant is received in the subframe n, the terminal performs the uplink data transmission in subframe n+4. If the downlink control signal and data are received in the subframe n, the terminal transmits HARQ ACK or NACK for the downlink data in the subframe n+4. Therefore, the terminal receives the uplink scheduling grant and performs the uplink data transmission or receives the downlink data, and the time taken to transmit the HARQ ACK or the NACK becomes 3 ms corresponding to 3 subframes. Further, if the terminal receives the PHICH transporting the downlink HARQ ACK/NACK from the base station in subframe i, the PHICH corresponds to the PUSCH that the terminal transmits in subframe i-k. At this time, the k is differently defined depending on the FDD or the TDD of the LTE system and the setting thereof. For example, in the case of the FDD LTE system, the k is fixed as 4. Meanwhile, in the case of the TDD LTE system, the k may be changed depending on the subframe setting and the subframe number.</div>

In the present disclosure, a first type terminal, a second type terminal, and a third type terminal each indicate terminals that receive the first type service, the second type service, the third type service, or the data scheduling.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0148">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. When it is decided that a detailed description for the known function or configuration related to the present disclosure may obscure the present disclosure, the detailed description therefor will be omitted. Further, the following terminologies are defined in consideration of the functions in the present disclosure and may be construed in different ways by the intention or practice of users and operators. Therefore, the definitions thereof should be construed based on the contents throughout the specification. Hereinafter, a base station is the subject performing resource allocation of a terminal and may be at least one of eNodeB, Node B, a base station (BS), a wireless access unit, a base station controller, and a node on a network. The terminal may include user equipment (UE), a mobile station (MS), a cellular phone, a smart phone, a computer, or a multimedia system performing a communication function. In the present disclosure, a downlink (DL) means a radio transmission path of a signal transmitted from a base station to a terminal and an uplink (UL) means a radio transmission path of a signal transmitted from the terminal to the base station. Further, as an example of LTE or an LTE-A system, an embodiment of the present disclosure is described below, but the embodiment of the present disclosure may be applied to other communication systems having similar technical background or a channel form. For example, 5G mobile communication technologies (5G, new radio (NR)) developed after the LTE-A could be included. Further, embodiments of the present disclosure may be applied to other communication systems by partially being changed without greatly departing from the scope of the present disclosure under the decision of those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0149">In the present disclosure, the transmission time interval (TTI) may mean a unit in which the control signal and the data signal are transmitted, or a unit in which the data signal is transmitted. For example, in the existing LTE system downlink, the transmission time interval becomes a subframe of a time unit of 1 ms. Meanwhile, in the present disclosure, the transmission time interval in the uplink may mean a unit in which the control signal or the data signal is transmitted, or a unit in which the data signal is transmitted. The transmission time interval in the existing LTE system uplink becomes a subframe that is the same time unit of 1 ms as the downlink</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0150">Unless specifically stated below, the shortened-TTI terminal described may include a terminal capable of transmitting control information or data or the control information and the data in 1 ms or a transmission time interval shorter than 1 ms, and the normal-TTI terminal may include a terminal capable of transmitting the control information or the data or the control information and the data in a transmission time interval of 1 ms. Meanwhile, in the present disclosure, the shortened-TTI, a shorter-TTI, a shortened TTI, a shorter TTI, a short TTI, and an sTTI have the same meaning and thus may be used together with each other. In addition, in the present disclosure, the normal-TTI, a normal TTI, a subframe TTI, and a legacy TTI have the same meaning and thus may be used together with each other. In the above, 1 ms, which is a criterion for distinguishing the shortened-TTI from the normal-TTI, may be different depending on the system. That is, in a specific NR system, based on 0.2 ms, the TTI is the shortened-TTI if the TTI is shorter than 0.2 ms, and the TTI having 0.2 ms may be referred to as the normal-TTI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0151">Meanwhile, one of the important criteria of the performance of the cellular wireless communication system is packet data latency. For this purpose, the LTE system transmits and receives signals in a subframe unit having the transmission time interval (TTI) of 1 ms. In the LTE system operated as described above, a short-TTI UE having a transmission time interval shorter than 1 ms may also be supported. Meanwhile, the NR, which is the 5G mobile communication system, may be shorter than 1 ms, the transmission time interval may be shorter than 1 ms. The short-TTI terminal is expected to be suitable for a voice over LTE (VoLTE) service, a remote control service or the like where the latency is important. Further, the short-TTI terminal is expected to be a mean capable of realizing the Internet of Things (IoT) which is mission critical in a cellular infrastructure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0152">In addition, in the present disclosure, the shortened-TTI data refers to data transmitted in the PDSCH or the PUSCH transmitted/received in a shortened TTI unit, and the normal-TTI data refers to data transmitted in the PDSCH or the PUSCH transmitted/received in a subframe unit. In the present disclosure, a control signal for the shortened-TTI refers to a control signal for the shortened-TTI mode operation and is referred to as sPDCCH, and a control signal for the normal-TTI mode refers to a control signal for the normal-TTI mode operation. For example, the control signal for the normal-TTI may be PCFICH, PHICH, PDCCH, EPDCCH, PUCCH, etc., in the existing LTE system</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0153">In the present disclosure, the terms the physical channel and the signal in the existing LTE or LTE-A system may be used together with the data or the control signal. For example, the PDSCH is the physical channel to which the normal-TTI data is transmitted, but in the present disclosure, the PDSCH may be referred to as the normal-TTI data, and the sPDSCH may be the physical channel to which the shortened-TTI data are transmitted. However, in the present disclosure, the sPDSCH may be referred to as the shortened-TTI data. Similarly, in the present disclosure, the shortened-TTI data transmitted in the downlink and the uplink will be referred to as the sPDSCH and the sPUSCH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0154">Hereinafter, in the present disclosure, an uplink scheduling grant signal and a downlink data signal are referred to as a first signal. In addition, in the present disclosure, the uplink data signal for the uplink scheduling grant and the HARQ ACK/NACK for the downlink data signal are referred to as a second signal. In the present disclosure, among the signals transmitted from the base station to the terminal, a signal expecting a response from terminal may be a first signal, and a response signal of the terminal corresponding to the first signal may be a second signal. In addition, in the present disclosure, the service type of the first signal may belong to categories of the eMBB, the URLLC, the mMTC, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0155">Hereinafter, in the present disclosure, a TTI length of the first signal means a time length taken to transmit the first signal. In addition, in the present disclosure, a TTI length of the second signal means a time length taken to transmit the second signal. In addition, in the present disclosure, second signal transmission timing is information on when the terminal transmits the second signal and when the base station receives the second signal, which may be referred to as second signal transmitting/receiving timing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0156">If there is no mention of the TDD system in the present disclosure, the FDD system will be generally described. However, the method and apparatus of the present disclosure in the FDD system may be applied to the TDD system according to a simple modification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0157">Hereinafter, in the present disclosure, the higher signaling is a method for transmitting a signal from a base station to a terminal using a downlink data channel of a physical layer or from a terminal to a base station using an uplink data channel of a physical layer, which may be referred to as RRC signaling or a MAC control element (CE).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0165">The code block index may be masked on the CRC by allocating a code block index from 0 or 1 to the code blocks included in one transport block in order from the front. However, the code block index is determined by a separate sequence, and the code block index may be assigned according to the sequence. That is, the code block index like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . from the first code block can be allocated, but can be determined according to arbitrary sequence like 0, 7, 9, 11, 16, 18, 41, 57, . . . . The arbitrary sequence may be promised between the base station and the terminal, and may be set according to the type of sequences from the base station. In addition, it may also be possible to perform masking in the predetermined number of bits from the front or back of the CRC without being masked on the whole CRC.</div>

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1L</figref>, the terminal performs the channel coding and considers the code block index inserted when confirming data to confirm (<b>1</b> <i>l</i>-<b>04</b>) the sequence of the code block or the location of the data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0167"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1M and 1N</figref> illustrates diagrams of a procedure of a base station and a terminal in a method for determining whether a code block index is inserted and transmitting/receiving data. In the present disclosure, a method for inserting and transmitting a code block may be referred to as A type transmission. The name A type transmission is a term arbitrarily selected for convenience of explanation, and may be defined or called as any other name. The case in which the A type transmission is performed may correspond to at least one of the case in which an initial transmission in which data are transmitted first, the case in which a specific transmission mode is configured by the higher signaling, the case in which the TBS has a specific value or more, the case of the first type transmission, the second type transmission, or the third type transmission, and the case in which the transmission is performed at a specific TTI length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0168">The initial transmission in which the data are transmitted first is not an initial transmission when the transport blocks are transmitted but may mean the initial transmission that has not been transmitted from the base station in an RE unit or a code block unit even if the transport block is transmitted in previous TTIs. In other words, the initial transmission in which data are transmitted first may mean transmission in an RE unit or a code block unit that has not yet been transmitted among the transport blocks. On the other hand, in the initial transmission in which the data are transmitted first, the code block index is not inserted and the code block index may be inserted when the base station performs the retransmission on the initial transmission before the terminal transmits the HARQ-ACK information on the initial transmission. In this case, in the process of performing the retransmission from the base station after a predetermined time after the terminal transmits the HARQ-ACK information, the code block index is not inserted and the data may be transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0169">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1M</figref>, the base station prepares (<b>1</b> <i>m</i>-<b>02</b>) data to be transmitted and determines (<b>1</b> <i>m</i>-<b>04</b>) whether the transmission is the A type transmission in order to determine whether to insert a code block. In the case of the A type transmission, the code block index information is inserted to perform channel code encoding and is transmitted (<b>1</b> <i>m</i>-<b>06</b>), and in the case in which the transmission is not the A type transmission, the code block index information is transmitted (<b>1</b> <i>m</i>-<b>08</b>) by performing the channel code encoding on the code block without being inserted. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1N</figref>, the terminal confirms (<b>1</b> <i>n</i>-<b>04</b>) whether the transmission is the A type transmission when preparing to receive data (<b>1</b> <i>n</i>-<b>02</b>). If it is the A type transmission, it is determined (<b>1</b> <i>n</i>-<b>08</b>) whether the decoding succeeds by considering the code block index at the time of the channel code decoding of the code block, and if it is not the A type transmission, it is determined (<b>1</b> <i>n</i>-<b>06</b>) whether the decoding succeeds under the assumption that there is no code block index at the time of the channel code decoding of the code block. The initial transmission and the retransmission in the present disclosure may indicate an initial transmission and a retransmission in the HARQ operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0170">Although the present disclosure has been described with reference to an example in which the A type is transmitted, the case in which the A type transmission is performed according to various base station and terminal conditions and settings is changed and thus the present disclosure can be applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0171">At least one of the methods proposed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1H, 1I, 1J, 1K, 1L, 1M</figref>, IN may be used in combination. Further, the channel code encoding is performed after the code block index information is inserted and the transmission is performed but is not limited thereto. Therefore, some embodiments may be modified so that the code block index information is inserted after the channel code encoding. Meanwhile, the base station transmits data and the terminal receives data. However, the embodiments may not be necessarily limited thereto. Some embodiments can be applied to the case in which the terminal transmits data and the base station receives data in a portion into which the code block index information is inserted in the uplink data transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0172">A method for decoding, by a receiving end, a TB to feedback whether reception succeeds and performing a retransmission of a code block whose decoding fails will be described. That is, a process of performing a retransmission in a code block unit will be described. The receiving end may be a terminal in a downlink, and may be a base station in an uplink</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0173">The code block index information may be the method proposed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1H, 1I, and 1J</figref>, but the embodiments may not be limited thereto. Therefore, the code block may be the information notifying the location in the TB. For example, the code block index information may be optionally confirmed according to a code block order included in one TB. That is, if 10 code blocks are transmitted to one TB when the initial transmission is performed without including the code block index, even if the code block index is not explicitly included, the code block indexes starting from code block 0 or code block 1 located at the front may be sequentially assigned in an ascending order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0174">As described above, in the present disclosure, a method for inserting and transmitting a code block index may be referred to as A type transmission. The case in which the A type transmission is performed may correspond to at least one of the case in which an initial transmission in which data are transmitted first, the case in which the higher signaling is established to be a specific transmission mode, the case in which the TBS has a specific value or more, the case of the first type transmission, the second type transmission, or the third type transmission, and the case in which the transmission is performed at a specific TTI length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0175">The receiving end may perform the channel code decoding on the code blocks in the TB and feed back the code blocks whose decoding fails to the transmitting end. For example, when there are 10 code blocks in one transmitted TB, a code block whose transmission has succeeded is mapped to 1 and a code block whose transmission fails is mapped to 0, so that it is possible to transmit whether the channel code decoding of each code block succeeds e of each code block with 10-bit information. In other words, the success or failure of decoding may include the number of bit maps corresponding to the number of code blocks and fed back to the transmitting end. In the above example, if the decoding of the second and fifth code blocks out of 10 code blocks fails and the decoding of the remaining code blocks succeeds, decoding the receiving end can feed back a value of 1011011111 to the transmitting end. The feedback may be transmitted to the base station in the uplink control channel or the data channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0176">According to some embodiments, the receiving end can transmit a decoding success or failure to each code block group by establishing a code block group including M code blocks. The number M of code blocks included in the code block group may be determined by performing the higher signaling from the base station to the terminal or transmitting the information of the M value as the DCI or may be automatically determined according to the number of code blocks included in the TBS or the TB or the system frequency band. For example, the transmitting end and/or the receiving end may determine the number M of code blocks included in the code block group according to the TBS value of the scheduled data as illustrated in Table 1a-02 below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0181">Meanwhile, in the above example, in confirming the code block index of the code block whose decoding fails, in the case of the A type transmission, the receiving end can confirm the code block index information included in the code block, and in the case in which the transmission is not the A type transmission, the receiving end can arbitrarily confirm the code block index information according to the code block order included in one TB. For example, if 10 code blocks are transmitted to one TB when the initial transmission is performed without including the code block index, the code block index is not included, but the code block indexes starting from code block 0 or code block 1 located at the front may be assigned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0182">In the transmitting end, if a certain number of code blocks fail to be transmitted after the initial transmission of one TB, the transmission may be performed on the failing code block when the retransmission is performed. The transmitting end can transmit the code block index information when transmitting the code block in the retransmission. Therefore, when receiving data corresponding to the retransmission, the receiving end may determine that the transmission is the A type transmission, and confirm the code block index information and then decode the corresponding code block in combination with the initial transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0183">According to some embodiments, in the process of retransmitting code blocks which the transmitting end and the receiving end fail to transmit, the retransmission can be performed in units of code block groups. That is, if the number M of code blocks included in the code block group is determined as described above, the receiving end feeds back the success or failure of reception to each of the code block groups to the transmitting end, and the transmitting end can perform the retransmission in units of code block groups. As compared to the case in which the process of performing feedback and retransmission is performed in units of code blocks, the number of bits used for the feedback and the retransmission can be more saved. That is, the number of bits used for feedback per TB can be determined according to the number M of code blocks included in the code block group. If it is determined that a retransmission of a specific code block group is used according to the feedback (for example, by transmitting a bitmap) from the receiving end, the corresponding code block group instructed via feedback can be retransmitted to the transmitting end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0184">Although some embodiments describe a method for feeding back, by a receiving end, whether or not the transmission of the code block fails and a method for retransmitting, by a transmitting end, partial code blocks (or code block groups), they will not always be used in combination and may be used separately.</div>

The information may be transmitted in a manner that a bitmap is used for the control signal <b>1</b> <i>q</i>-<b>09</b> transmitting the scheduling information of the partial transmission or a starting or ending part is notified.

The terminal receiver <b>1</b> <i>p</i>-<b>01</b> and the terminal transmitter <b>1</b> <i>p</i>-<b>05</b> are collectively referred to as a transceiver. The transceiver may transmit/receive a signal to/from the terminal. The signal may include control information and data. To this end, the transceiver may include an RF transmitter that up-converts and amplifies a frequency of the transmitted signal, an RF receiver that low-noise-amplifies the received signal and down-converts the frequency, or the like. Further, the transceiver may receive a signal through a radio channel and output the received signal to the terminal processor <b>1</b> <i>p</i>-<b>03</b> and transmit the signal output from the terminal processor <b>1</b> <i>p</i>-<b>03</b> through the radio channel.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0200">In order to process explosively increasing mobile data traffic in recent years, a 5<sup>th </sup>generation (5G) system or a new radio access technology (NR) which is a next generation telecommunication system since long term evolution (LTE) or evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) and LTE-advanced (LTE-A) or E-UTRA evolution has been actively discussed. The existing mobile communication system focuses on voice/data communication, while the 5G system aims to meet various services, such as an enhanced mobile broad band (eMBB) service for enhancement of the existing voice/data communication, an ultra reliable/ultra low latency communication (URLLC) service, and a machine type communication (massive MTC) service supporting mass communication of things, and requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0201">A system transmission bandwidth per single carrier of the existing LTE and LTE-A is limited to a maximum of 20 MHz, while the 5G system aims at providing super-high speed data services of several Gbps using an ultra-wide bandwidth much wider than that. As a result, the 5G system has considered as a candidate frequency a very high frequency band from several GHz to 100 GHz, which is relatively easy to secure an ultra-wideband frequency. In addition, a method for securing a wideband frequency for the 5G system is also considered by frequency reallocation or allocation in a frequency band of several hundreds of MHz to several GHz used in the existing mobile communication system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0202">A radio wave in the very high frequency band is a wavelength of about several mm and therefore is sometimes referred to as a millimeter wave (mmWave). However, in the very high frequency band, a pathloss of the radio wave is increased in proportion to the frequency band, such that the coverage of the mobile communication system becomes small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0203">In order to overcome the disadvantage of the reduction in the coverage of the very high frequency band, a beamforming technique for concentrating radiation energy of a radio wave onto a predetermined destination by using a plurality of antennas to increase an arrival distance of the radio wave is becoming more important. The beamforming technique may be applied to a transmitting end and a receiving end, respectively. The beamforming technique also reduces interference in areas other than the beam forming direction in addition to increasing the coverage. In order for the beam forming technique to operate properly, a method for accurately measuring and feeding back a transmission/reception beam is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0204">As another requirement of the 5G system, there is an ultra-low latency service having a transmission delay of about 1 ms between the transmitting and receiving ends. By one method for reducing a transmission delay, a frame structure design based on short transmission time interval (TTI) compared to the LTE and the LTE-A is possible. The TTI is a basic unit for performing scheduling, and the TTI of the existing LTE and LTE-A systems is 1 ms corresponding to a length of one subframe. For example, the short TTI (for example, slot) to meet the requirements for the ultra-low latency service of the 5G system may be 0.5 ms, 0.2 ms, 0.1 ms, or the like that are shorter than the LTE and LTE-A systems. In the following description, unless otherwise stated, one TTI (or slot) and subframe are a basic unit of the scheduling and is interchangeably used with each other as a meaning representing a predetermined time interval.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0205">Hereinafter, the frame structure of the LTE and LTE-A systems will be described with reference to the drawings, and the design direction of the 5G system will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0206"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a diagram of a basic structure of a time-frequency resource area that is a radio resource area to which a data or a control channel of the existing LTE and LTE-A systems is transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0207">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a horizontal axis represents a time domain and a vertical axis represents a frequency domain. An uplink (UL) means a radio link through which a terminal transmits a data or a control signal to a base station and a downlink (DL) means a radio link through which the base station transmits the data or the control signal to the terminal. A minimum transmission unit in the time domain of the existing LTE and LTE-A systems is an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol in the case of the downlink and a single carrier-frequency division multiplexing access (SC-FDMA) symbol in the case of the uplink, in which one slot <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>06</b> is configured by collecting N<sub>symb </sub>symbols <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>02</b> and one subframe <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>05</b> is configured by collecting two slots. A length of the slot is 0.5 ms and a length of the subframe is 1.0 ms. Further, a radio frame <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>14</b> is a time domain unit which includes 10 subframes. A minimum transmission unit in the frequency domain is a subcarrier in a unit of 15 kHz (subcarrier spacing is equal to 15 kHz), and the overall system transmission bandwidth includes a total of N<sub>BW </sub>subcarriers <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>04</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0208">A basic unit of the resource in the time-frequency domain is a resource element (RE) <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>12</b> and may be represented by an OFDM symbol index or an SC-FDMA symbol index and a subcarrier index. A resource block (RB) (or a physical resource block (PRB)) <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>08</b> is defined by the N<sub>symb </sub>continued OFDM symbols <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>02</b> or the SC-FDMA symbols in the time domain and N<sub>RB </sub>continued subcarriers <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>10</b> in the frequency domain. Therefore, one RB <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>08</b> includes N<sub>symb</sub>รN<sub>RB </sub>REs <b>2</b> <i>a</i>-<b>12</b>. In the LTE and LTE-A systems, a data is mapped in an RB unit, and the base station performs scheduling on a predetermined terminal in a RB-pair unit configuring one subframe. The number of SC-FDMA symbols or the number N<sub>symb </sub>of OFDM symbols is determined depending on a cyclic prefix (CP) length added to each symbol to prevent inter-symbol interference. For example, if a normal CP is applied, N<sub>symb</sub>=7 and if a scalable CP is applied, N<sub>symb</sub>=6. The scalable CP is applied to a system having a radio wave transmission distance relatively longer than the normal CP, thereby maintaining inter-symbol orthogonality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0209">The subcarrier spacing, the CP length, or the like are essential information on OFDM transmission and reception and need to be recognized as a common value by the base station and the terminal to smoothly transmit and receive a signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0210">Further the N<sub>BW </sub>and N<sub>RB </sub>are also proportional to the system transmission bandwidth. A data rate is increased in proportion to the number of RBs scheduled in the terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0211">The frame structure of the LTE and LTE-A systems as described above is designed considering normal voice/data communications, and has limitations in scalability to meet various services and requirements like the 5G system. Therefore, in 5G system, it is necessary to flexibly define and operate frame structure considering various services and requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0212"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B to 2D</figref> illustrate an example of an extended frame structure. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B to 2D</figref> illustrate the case where the essential parameter sets defining the scalable frame structure include the subcarrier spacing, the CP length, the subframe length, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0213">In the early stage of the introduction of the 5G system, coexistence with the existing LTE/LTE-A systems or a dual mode operation is at least anticipated. By this, the existing LTE and LTE-A systems may serve to provide the stable system operation and the 5G system may serve to provide enhanced services. Therefore, the scalable frame structure of the 5G system at least needs to include the frame structure of the LTE and LTE-A or the essential parameter set. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a diagram of the 5G frame structure like the frame structure of the LTE and LTE-A or the essential parameter sets. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in a frame structure type A, subcarrier spacing is 15 kHz, a subframe of 1 ms includes 14 symbols, and a PRB includes 12 subcarriers (=180 kHz=12ร15 kHz).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0214">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, in a frame structure type B, the subcarrier spacing is 30 kHz, a subframe of 0.5 ms includes 14 symbols, and a PRB includes 12 subcarriers (=360 kHz=12ร30 kHz). That is, it may be seen that the subcarrier spacing and the PRB size are twice as large as those of the frame structure type A, and the subframe length and symbol length are twice as short as those of the frame structure type A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0215">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, in a frame structure type C, subcarrier spacing is 60 kHz, a subframe of 0.25 ms includes 14 symbols, and a PRB includes 12 subcarriers (=720 kHz=12ร60 kHz). That is, it may be seen that the subcarrier spacing and the PRB size are four times as large as those of the frame structure type A, and the subframe length and symbol length are four times as short as those of the frame structure type A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0216">That is, if the frame structure type is generalized, the subcarrier spacing, the CP length, and the subframe length that are the essential parameter sets have an integer multiple relationship with each other for each type, such that high scalability may be provided. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> is a comparison diagram of frame structure types A, B, and C in a time domain together with an LTE frame structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0217">The above-mentioned frame structure type may be applied corresponding to various scenarios. From the viewpoint of the cell size, it is possible to support a cell having a larger size as the CP length is increased, such that the frame structure type A may support cells relatively larger than the frame structure types B and C. From the viewpoint of the operating frequency band, as the subcarrier spacing is increased, it is more advantageous in restoring the phase noise in the high frequency band, such that the frame structure type C may support a relatively higher operating frequency than the frame structure types A and B. From the viewpoint of the services, to support the ultra-low delay service like the URLLC, it is advantageous to make the subframe length shorter, and therefore the frame structure type C is relatively more suitable for the URLLC service over the frame structure types A and B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0218">In addition, a scenario for multiplexing the frame structure types in one system and integrally operating them may be considered. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref> illustrates an example in which the frame structure types A, B, and C are multiplexed in one system (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2F-01, 2F-02, and 2F-03</figref>). That is, by maintaining an integer multiple relationship between the essential parameter sets defining the frame structure type, resource mapping in a subframe or in the PRB is smoothly performed even in the case of the multiplexing as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0219">In order to support the mobility of the terminal, the terminal needs to periodically measure the radio link quality for neighboring cells as well as cells (hereinafter referred to as serving cell) currently connected and transmitting/receiving signals. The terminal reports the measured radio link quality to the base station, and the base station determines whether to hand over the terminal to another cell with better radio link quality, referring to the radio link quality report of the terminal. The radio link quality measurement can be classified into intra-frequency measurement, inter-frequency measurement, and inter-radio access technology (RAT) measurement according to a measurement target.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0220">1) The intra-frequency measurement method corresponds to the case where the frequency of the serving cell of the terminal and the frequency of the cell in which the radio link quality is to be measured are the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0221">2) The intra-frequency measurement method corresponds to the case where the frequency of the serving cell of the terminal and the frequency of the cell in which the radio link quality is to be measured are different from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0222">3) The intra-RAT measurement method corresponds to the case where the radio access technology (RAT) of the serving cell of the terminal and the RAT of the cell in which the radio link quality is to be measured are different from each other. The RAT is a radio access technology and refers to communication schemes such as 4G and 5G.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0223">In the case of the intra-frequency measurement, the terminal does not need an RF tuning operation of the additional terminal to measure the radio link quality of the cell to be measured. On the other hand, in the case of the inter-frequency measurement or the inter-RAT measurement, an operation of changing (RF tuning) the RF frequency of the terminal to the frequency of a cell to be measured or an operation of changing the RAT to a RAT of a cell to be measured is needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0224">The measurement gap is a time interval used for the terminal to measure the radio link quality by changing the frequency or the RAT upon the inter-frequency measurement and the inter-RAT measurement. During the measurement gap, the terminal stops the uplink transmission operation and does not receive the downlink signal from the serving cell. That is, due to the measurement gap, a service interruption occurs between the terminal and the serving cell. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> illustrates the measurement gap of the LTE system. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> illustrates the length of the measurement gap indicates 6 subframes (=6 ms) from subframe (i+1) to subframe (i+6). Therefore, the service interruption time of the terminal continues from the subframe (i+1) to the subframe (i+6).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0225">In the case of a terminal capable of transmitting and receiving one RF or one RAT signal at an arbitrary instant, inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement is performed by changing RF or RAT during the measurement gap time interval. In addition, a measurement gap is used for interference control even if the terminal can simultaneously transmit and receive multiple RFs or multiple RAT signals at any moment. For example, if there is no measurement gap, the reliability of the radio link quality measurement may be degraded because the uplink signal transmitted from the terminal to the serving cell at any moment and signals of neighboring cells to be measured by the terminal are interfered with each other. The influence of the interference may vary according to the interval between the serving cell frequency and the frequency of the cell to be measured, and the RF implementation method of the terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0226">As described above, in the initial stage of the introduction of the 5G system in the future, the terminal expects the coexistence of the LTE-NR or the operation of LTE-NR dual mode through LTE-NR aggregation of at least existing LTE/LTE-A with the NR. By this, the existing LTE and LTE-A systems may serve to provide the stable system operation and the 5G system may serve to provide enhanced services. The present disclosure proposes a method for setting and applying a measurement gap for supporting mobility to LTE or NR systems for the terminal supporting LTE-NR aggregation. Basically, it is assumed that the LTE system and the NR system are independent of each other, and time synchronization between subframes or radio frames between the two systems or radio frames between the two systems does not match. A system whose time synchronization does not match is called an asynchronous system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0227">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, the terminal supports the aggregation of LTE <b>2</b> <i>h</i>-<b>01</b> and NR <b>2</b> <i>h</i>-<b>02</b> as the frame structure type B, and the LTE system and the NR system indicate that the time synchronization between subframes or radio frames does not match by โoffset Aโ <b>2</b> <i>h</i>-<b>03</b>. Further, the base station sets a measurement gap <b>2</b> <i>h</i>-<b>04</b> corresponding to LTE based 6 subframes in the terminal to indicate corresponding to LTE subframe i+1 to LTE subframe i+6. However, due to the above-mentioned โoffset Aโ, the measurement gap occurs in a state in which subframe boundaries do not coincide with the NR subframe. That is, the NR subframe affected by the measurement gap is from NR subframe (j+2) to NR subframe (j+14). Among those, a ฮ1 interval <b>2</b> <i>h</i>-<b>06</b> which is a part of the NR subframe (j+2) and a ฮ2 interval <b>2</b> <i>h</i>-<b>07</b> which is a part of the NR subframe (j+14) do not substantially overlap the measurement gap time period, but are inevitably included in the interruption time (=measurement gap+ฮ1+ฮ2) <b>2</b> <i>h</i>-<b>05</b> in terms of the NR system, resulting in inefficiency of radio resource utilization</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0228">In order to solve the inefficiency of the radio resource utilization as described above, there may be a method for performing signal transmission/reception of a terminal by using ฮ1 and ฮ2 intervals when a part of the subframe overlaps with the measurement gap. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2I, 2J</figref>, and <b>2</b>K each are diagrams illustrating ฮ1 and ฮ2 intervals for each frame structure type of the NR system.</div>

Such a partial subframe may be defined as a subframe including 1 to Nโ1 symbols when the number of maximum symbols configuring one normal subframe is N (N is a positive integer).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0245">Next, a method of setting, by a base station, a measurement gap in a terminal will be described. The length L of the measurement gap includes the processing time for cell identification from the signal received during the measurement gap interval, and the processing time for changing the RF or RAT of the terminal. In order for the terminal to periodically measure the radio link quality of the neighboring cell, the measurement gap is repeated every predetermined period P with respect to the reference system. The measurement gap starts at a point spaced by โmeasurement offsetโ within the period of the measurement gap. The โmeasurement offsetโ is set to be different values for each UE, thereby preventing the phenomenon that the terminals in the system simultaneously concentrate the radio link quality measurement at a limited time. The reference system may be the LTE system or the NR system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0246">The length of the measurement gap, the period, the โmeasurement offsetโ information, and the information on the reference system are defined or used, or the base station sets control information related to some or all of the measurement gaps and informs the terminal of it through signaling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0247">After the terminal acquires the measurement gap related control information from the base station, the terminal attempts radio link quality measurement for neighboring cells in a radio frame and a subframe satisfying the following condition A.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0251">Although the operation in the asynchronous mode or the synchronous mode in the partial subframe has been described with respect to the measurement gap of the terminal, it is possible to generalize and apply the technique before and after the predetermined radio resource area in which the transmission or reception of the terminal is restricted, like the measurement gap. For example, the predetermined radio resource region may be defined in advance and allocated by the base station so that the terminal supporting an ultra low latency service in a cell can transmit/receive signals for a time shorter than a subframe length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0252">A method of transmitting and receiving data that is flexible in an NR system will be described.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0270">The transmission/reception timing of the terminal can be defined by combining the scheduling timing with the partial subframe of some embodiments. Hereinafter, it will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2S</figref>. Like the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2S</figref> illustrates that the terminal supports the aggregation of LTE <b>2</b> <i>s</i>-<b>01</b> and NR <b>2</b> <i>s</i>-<b>02</b> as the frame structure type C, and the LTE system and the NR system indicate that the time synchronization between subframes or radio frames does not match by โoffset Aโ <b>2</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>. Further, the base station sets a measurement gap <b>2</b> <i>s</i>-<b>04</b> corresponding to LTE based 6 subframes in the terminal to indicate corresponding to LTE subframe i+1 to LTE subframe i+6. Then, in terms of the NR subframe, the overlapping with the measurement gap from a part of an interval of the NR subframe (j+4) to a part of an interval of the NR subframe (j+28) is shown. That is, it is illustrated that NR subframe (j+4) is applied to partial subframe <b>1</b> and NR subframe (j+28) is applied to partial subframe <b>2</b>. As described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref>, the terminal can perform a transmission/reception operation without interruption with the NR system in an interval that does not overlap the measurement gap of the partial subframes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0271">In the condition, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2S</figref> illustrates the case in which the terminal transmits (<b>2</b> <i>s</i>-<b>05</b>) 4 subframes in the subframe j according to the base station scheduling and the base station transmits the retransmission scheduling control information on the uplink data to the terminal in a subframe j+4 as the minimum processing time to receive and process the uplink data of the terminal is 4 subframes. Since the subframe j+4 is partial subframe <b>1</b> and the terminal can receive the downlink signal, the base station transmits the retransmission scheduling control information to the terminal in the subframe j+4 as calculated first.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0272">Thereafter, the terminal stops transmission/reception operation to/from the NR cell during the measurement gap interval, and then performs the uplink data transmission according to the retransmission scheduling of the base station at the time when the measurement gap ends. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2S</figref>, the terminal transmits uplink data in partial subframe <b>2</b> (<b>2</b> <i>s</i>-<b>08</b>). Therefore, the HARQ round trip time (RTT) between the initial uplink data transmission time (<b>2</b> <i>s</i>-<b>05</b>) and the retransmission uplink data transmission time of the terminal corresponds to 28 subframes (<b>2</b> <i>s</i>-<b>10</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0273">If the terminal does not support the transmission/reception operation in the partial subframe, the terminal can not receive the retransmission scheduling control information transmitted by the base station in subframe j+4, and receive the retransmission scheduling control information in subframe j+29 which is the time when the downlink signal may be fastest received from the base station after the measurement gap. If it is assumed that the retransmission scheduling control information processing time of the terminal is 4 subframes, the terminal can transmit the retransmission scheduled uplink data in subframe j+33. Therefore, the HARQ RTT is increased to 33 subframes, and therefore the transmission delay occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0274">Meanwhile, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2S</figref>, the timing indicator k may be applied together for the flexible timing adjustment described above. That is, if the terminal transmits the uplink data in the partial subframe <b>2</b> (<b>2</b> <i>s</i>-<b>08</b>), the transmission may be performed as it is in the partial subframe <b>2</b> (<b>2</b> <i>s</i>-<b>08</b>) in the case of the timing indicator k=0, and the transmission may be performed in the subframe j+29 in the case of the timing indicator k=1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0275">A method of measuring, by a terminal, channel status information (CSI) in the partial subframe will be described. The terminal measures the CSI indicating the downlink channel state from the CSI-reference signal (CSI-RS) transmitted from the base station and reports the CSI to the base station to support the scheduling operation of the base station. The CSI-RS is mapped to a predetermined promised pattern at a defined location, and the accuracy of terminal CSI measurement depends on the mapping of the CSI-RS in the partial subframe. Hereinafter, it will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2T and 2U</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0276">The example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2T</figref> illustrates that the subframe n (<b>2</b> <i>t</i>-<b>01</b>) is a partial subframe and a part of an interval <b>2</b> <i>t</i>-<b>04</b> of the subframe and the subframe (n+1) <b>2</b> <i>t</i>-<b>05</b> are included in a measurement <b>2</b> <i>t</i>-<b>02</b>. In the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2T</figref>, it is illustrated that the mapping in the partial subframe <b>2</b> <i>t</i>-<b>01</b> of the CSI-RS <b>2</b> <i>t</i>-<b>03</b> does not overlap with the measurement gap <b>2</b> <i>t</i>-<b>02</b>. Therefore, the terminal can receive the CSI-RS without loss and can maintain the reliability of the CSI measurement. That is, if the mapping of the CSI-RS to be measured by the terminal does not overlap with the measurement gap of the partial subframe, the terminal determines that the partial subframe is valid for CSI measurement and performs CSI measurement in the partial subframe. In the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2U</figref>, it is illustrated that the mapping in a partial subframe <b>2</b> <i>u</i>-<b>01</b> of the CSI-RS <b>2</b> <i>u</i>-<b>03</b> does not overlap with the measurement gap <b>2</b> <i>u</i>-<b>02</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2U</figref> also shows an interval <b>2</b> <i>u</i>-<b>04</b> and a subframe n+1 <b>2</b> <i>u</i>-<b>05</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0277"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2V</figref> illustrates a diagram of a procedure of measuring, by a terminal, CSI according to the above-mentioned method.

The CSI configuration information includes control information on the CSI measurement of the terminal, such as the mapping pattern of the CSI-RS, the transmission period, and the transmission time. The measurement gap configuration information includes the measurement gap related control information such as the length, period, and time of the measurement gap. In step <b>2</b> <i>v</i>-<b>02</b>, the terminal determines the CSI measurement time. The terminal can determine the CSI measurement time point by referring to the CSI configuration information acquired in step <b>2</b> <i>v</i>-<b>01</b> and the CSI reporting command additionally indicated by the base station. In step <b>2</b> <i>v</i>-<b>03</b>, the terminal determines whether the subframe n in which the CSI is measured is a partial subframe, and thus if the subframe is not a partial subframe, the terminal proceeds to step <b>2</b> <i>v</i>-<b>04</b> to perform the CSI measurement in the subframe n. If it is a partial subframe as a result of the determination in step <b>2</b> <i>v</i>-<b>03</b>, the terminal determines in step <b>2</b> <i>v</i>-<b>05</b> whether the CSI-RS overlaps with the measurement gap.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0286">As a future communication system since the LTE, that is, a 5G communication system has to be able to freely reflect various requirements such as a user and a service provider, a service satisfying various requirements needs to be supported at the same time. The services considered for the 5G communication system include enhanced mobile broadband (hereinafter, eMBB), massive machine type communication (hereinafter, mMTC), ultra reliability low latency communication (hereinafter, URLLC), etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0287">The eMBB aims to provide a higher data transfer rate than a data rate supported by the existing LTE, LTE-A, or LTE-Pro. For example, in the 5G communication system, the eMBB may be able to provide a peak transmission rate of 20 Gbps in the downlink and a peak data rate of 10 Gbps in the uplink from the viewpoint of one base station. In addition, the 5G communication system may provide the increased user perceived data rate of the terminal simultaneously with providing the peak data rate. In order to satisfy such the requirement, improvement of various transmitting and receiving technologies including a further improved multi input multi output (MIMO) transmission technology is demanded. In addition, signals are transmitted using the transmission bandwidth of up to 20 MHz in the 2 GHz band used by the current LTE, but the 5G communication system uses a bandwidth wider than 20 MHz in the frequency band of 3 to 6 GHz or more than 6 GHz, thereby satisfying the data transmission rate used in the 5G communication system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0288">At the same time, the mMTC is being considered to support application services such as Internet of Thing (IoT) in the 5G communication system. The mMTC is used for an access support of a large-scale terminal in a cell, coverage enhancement of a terminal, improved battery time, and cost reduction of a terminal in order to efficiently provide the Internet of things. The Internet of things needs to be able to support a large number of terminals (e.g., 1,000,000 terminals/km<sup>2</sup>) in a cell because it is attached to various sensors and various devices to provide communication functions. In addition, the terminal supporting the mMTC are more likely to be located in shaded areas not covered by a cell, such as a underground of building due to nature of services, thus the terminal requires a wider coverage than other services provided by the 5G communication system. The terminals that support the mMTC may be configured as inexpensive terminals and require very long battery life time, such as 10 to 15 years, because it is difficult to frequently replace the battery of the terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0289">Finally, in the case of the URLLC, it is a cellular-based wireless communication service used for mission-critical purposes. For example, services used for a remote control for a robot or machinery, industrial automation, unmanaged aerial vehicle, remote health care, emergency situation, or the like may be considered. Therefore, the communication provided by the URLLC may provide very low latency and very high reliability. For example, a service that supports URLLC may meet air interface latency of less than 0.5 milliseconds and at the same time have requirements of a packet error rate less than 10<sup>โ5</sup>. Therefore, for the service that supports the URLLC, the 5G system may provide a transmit time interval (TTI) smaller than other services, and at the same time, design matters for allocating a wide resource in the frequency band in order to secure the reliability of the communication link are used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0279" num="0294">A basic unit of resources in the time-frequency domain is a resource element (RE) <b>3</b> <i>b</i>-<b>12</b> and may be represented by an OFDM symbol index and a subcarrier index.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0295">The frame structure of the LTE and LTE-A systems as described above is designed considering normal voice/data communications, and has limitations in scalability to meet various services and requirements like the 5G system. Therefore, in 5G system, it is necessary to flexibly define and operate frame structure considering various services and requirements. For example, each service may have different subcarrier spacings depending on the requirements. Currently, two schemes are considered to support a plurality of subcarriers in the 5G communication system. As a first method for supporting a plurality of subcarriers in the 5G communication system, a set of subcarrier spacings that the 5G communication system can have may be determined using the following Equation 1.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0296">In the above Equation 1, f<sub>0 </sub>represents a basic subcarrier spacing of the system and M represents a scaling factor. For example, if f<sub>0 </sub>is 15 kHz, the set of subcarrier spacings that the 5G communication system can have may include 7.5 kHz, 15 kHz, 30 kHz, 45 kHz, 60 kHz, 75 kHz, etc., and the system may be configured using all or some of the corresponding set.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0282" num="0297">In addition, as a two method for supporting a plurality of subcarriers in the 5G communication system, a set of subcarrier spacings which may be included in the 5G communication system may be determined using the following Equation 2.

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0298">In the above Equation 2, f<sub>0 </sub>represents a basic subcarrier spacing of the system and M represents a scaling factor of integer. For example, if f<sub>0 </sub>is 15 kHz, a set of subcarrier spacings that the 5G communication system can have may include 7.5 kHz, 15 kHz, 30 kHz, 60 kHz, 120 kHz, and the like. The system can be configured using all or some of the set as in Equation (1). According to the two methods described above, the present disclosure will be described on the assumption that f<sub>0 </sub>is 15 kHz and a set of 15 kHz, 30 kHz, and 60 kHz subcarrier spacing is used in the 5G communication system. However, the technique proposed in the present disclosure can apply even another set of subcarrier spacings (for example, f<sub>0 </sub>is 17.5 kHz, and a set of subcarrier spacings is 17.5 kHz, 35 kHz, and 70 kHz) without any limitation. If the set of subcarrier spacings of 17.5 kHz, 35 kHz, and 70 kHz is considered in the present disclosure, f<sub>0 </sub>can be mapped to the technique described based on 15 kHz. Likewise, the present disclosure may be described by mapping 35 kHz, 70 kHz, and 140 kHz to 30 kHz, 60 kHz, and 120 kHz, respectively, on a one-to-one basis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0299"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates a diagram of a resource element <b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>00</b> in the case where the subcarrier spacings are ฮf<sub>1 </sub>(<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>01</b>), ฮf<sub>2 </sub>(<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>02</b>), and ฮf<sub>3 </sub>(<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>03</b>), respectively. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the subcarrier spacings of the respective resource elements, i.e., values of ฮf<sub>1 </sub>(<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>01</b>), ฮf<sub>2 </sub>(<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>02</b>), and ฮf<sub>3 </sub>(<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>03</b>) correspond to 15 kHz, 30 kHz, and 60 kHz, respectively. In addition, each resource element has an OFDM symbol length of Ts (<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>04</b>), Ts' (<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>05</b>), Tsโณ (<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>06</b>). As the characteristic of the OFDM symbol, since the subcarrier spacing and the length of the OFDM symbol have a reciprocal relationship with each other, it can be seen that the larger the subcarrier spacing, the shorter the symbol length. Therefore, Ts (<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>04</b>) is two times Ts' (<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>05</b>) and four times Tsโณ (<b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>06</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0300">Various sets of subcarrier spacings described above can be used for various purposes within a system. For example, it may be appropriate to use the subcarrier spacing in consideration of channel conditions (multi-path delay spread) or coherence bandwidth of a corresponding band at a low carrier frequency such as 2 GHz to 4 GHz band. For example, it is advantageous to use low subcarrier spacing because the path delay spread is relatively large and therefore the coherence bandwidth is small at the carrier frequencies of the 2 GHz to 4 GHz band. At the same time, in a band having a high carrier frequency of 6 GHz or higher, it is advantageous to use wide subcarrier spacing because the influence due to the channel condition, Doppler shift, and frequency offset is more serious. At the same time, the 5G communication system can use high subcarrier spacing of systems that have requirements of very low transmission delay time like the URLLC, even in the band using the low carrier frequency.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0294" num="0311">First, a synchronization acquisition procedure with a cell will be described. In order to acquire synchronization with the cell, the terminal transmits two synchronization signals such as the primary synchronization signal (PSS) <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>01</b> and the secondary synchronization signal (SSS) <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>02</b> in the LTE. The PSS <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>01</b> includes three different Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences according to the physical layer cell ID (Identity) of the cell. More specifically, three cell IDs in one cell ID group correspond to different PSSs <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>01</b>. If the terminal detects and confirms the PSS <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>01</b>, the terminal acquires the information on 5 ms timing of the cell, the location of the SSS <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>02</b>, and the cell ID in the cell ID group. The SSS <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>02</b> has 168 different values corresponding to different cell ID groups. For this purpose, the SSS <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>02</b> is designed based on frequency interleaving of m-sequences X and Y of two length 31. The terminal detects the SSS <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>02</b> to know frame timing and know a cell ID group. As a result, the synchronization with the network is acquired through the PSS <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>01</b> and the SSS <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>02</b>, and one of 504 physical layer cell IDs is acquired. It is known what the corresponding cell-specific reference signal (CRS) is based on the obtained physical layer ID. At this time, in the case of the first cell search, that is, in the RRC_IDLE mode, the CRS is used to decode PBCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>03</b> for channel estimation and system information acquisition. On the other hand, in case of measurement for mobility, that is, in the case of RRC_CONNECTED mode, the received power of the CRS is measured, and if the measured value satisfies the set condition, an RSRP measurement report is transmitted to the network.

At this time, the physical layer transmission channel in the LTE is set as a parameter of common numerology. The numerology can refer to various physical parameters, such as subcarrier spacing, OFDM symbol length, and/or CP (Cyclic Prefix) length. Meanwhile, hereinafter, the subcarrier spacing will be mainly described as an example of numerology, but the content of the subcarrier spacing may be extended to other numerologies and applied. For example, an OFDM modulated symbol set at the subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz is transmitted. However, since the 5G communication system supports various subcarriers, for example, various parameters for the subcarrier spacing, the numerologies for the physical layer channel in which each information is transmitted in the initial connection step may be different from each other. For example, the subcarrier spacings of the PBCH and the PDCCH or the PDSCH may be different. Since the constraints may be different depending on the transmission purpose of each physical layer channel, a message size, and broadcasting, each physical layer channel can be set at different subcarrier spacings and transmitted. Alternatively, the physical layer channels having different subcarrier spacings may be multiplexed with each other to support various services having different requirements of eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC. That is, each service may be supported through a physical layer channel set at a different subcarrier spacings. Therefore, additional base station and terminal operations are used to efficiently perform the initial connection in the 5G system supporting various subcarrier spacings.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0338" num="0378">The efficient paging procedure may be able to wake up a predetermined time interval in order to observe the paging information from the network, allowing the terminal <b>3</b> <i>j</i>-<b>01</b> to rest without receiving operation for most of the time. For this purpose, LTE defines Paging Occasion (PO) and Paging Frame (PF). The PO is defined as a subframe in which a PDCCH is set to a P-RNTI for receiving a paging message. A PF is defined as a radio frame containing one or more POs. According to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref>, the terminal <b>3</b> <i>j</i>-<b>01</b> can observe one PO per DRX (Discontinuous Reception) period (<b>3</b> <i>j</i>-<b>08</b>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0343" num="0383">The T value corresponding to the DRX period can be set through higher layer signaling. If there is no higher layer signaling for T, a default paging cycle (defaultPagingCycle) indicated by SIB2 is set to be T. In rare cases, the terminal may directly request a UE-specific DRX cycle, which is possible through an attach request or a tracking area update (TAU) request. In the above Equation 3, UE_ID is calculated from an international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI). The IMSI transmits an attach request message to the MME through the higher layer signaling (here, non-access stratum (NAS) signaling) in the initial connection step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0344" num="0384">On the other hand, if the terminal is in the RRC_IDLE state, the LTE network knows the location of the terminal in units of TA instead of the cell unit. When accessing the LTE network, the terminal receives a tracking area identity (TAI) list from the MME. The terminal can freely move within the cell in the TAI list without updating the MME. When an incoming call to the terminal occurs, the MME transmits the same paging message to the cells in the TA currently set in the corresponding terminal, and each cell transmits the paging message to the corresponding terminal. The terminal acquires the tracking area code (TAC) of the corresponding cell through the SIB1 when (re) selecting any cell and can confirm whether the corresponding cell matches a cell in its own TAI list from acquired TAC. If the TAC of the selected cell is an ID that is not in the TAI list, the terminal transmits a TAU message to the MME. If the MME gives the TAU accept response (TAU Accept) to the terminal, the TAI list is given together, and thus the TAI list may be updated in the terminal, matching the movement of the location of the terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0345" num="0385">The physical layer transport channel for paging follows the downlink transport channel structure of the above-described 3D. The contention resolution message is transmitted through the PDSCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>04</b> and the scheduling information on the PDSCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>04</b> to which the paging message is transmitted is transmitted through the DCI of the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the P-RNTI. The terminal observes the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the P-RNTI and can receive the corresponding paging message if the paging message is found.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0346" num="0386">As described above, the paging procedure in the existing LTE is characterized in that a plurality of cells in the TA area transmit the same paging message to a specific terminal. Also, each cell cannot know whether the corresponding terminal is camped on itself, and the terminal can confirm the system information on the cell to which the terminal is connected. The 5G communication system can support various parameters for various subcarrier spacings, and thus different cells belonging to the same TA can transmit a paging message through the physical layer transmission channel set at different subcarrier spacings. In other words, the terminal may not properly receive the paging message coming from different cells in the TA area depending on whether the terminal supports the corresponding subcarrier spacing. Therefore, additional base station and terminal operations are used to efficiently perform the paging procedure in the 5G system supporting various subcarrier spacings.</div>

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>k</i> </figref>, the TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and the TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> are present in the same TA area and the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> may be allocated the information on the TA from the MME <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>05</b>. Each terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> and the TRPs <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> illustrate supporting (<b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>06</b>) a set of subcarrier spacings of ฮf<sub>1</sub>, ฮf<sub>2</sub>, and ฮf<sub>3</sub>. The present disclosure does not exclude not the case in which the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> and the 5G TRPs <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> support sets of subcarrier spacings, but also the case in which one or some of the subcarrier spacings can be supported. For example, the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> may support ฮf<sub>1</sub>, or the TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b> may support ฮf<sub>1 </sub>and ฮf<sub>2</sub>, the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b> may support ฮf<sub>2 </sub>and ฮf<sub>3</sub>, and the TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> may support ฮf<sub>1 </sub>and ฮf<sub>3</sub>. For the case in which one or some of the subcarrier spacings among the sets of subcarrier spacings, the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> and a service is possible when the 5G TRPs <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>2</b>, <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> supports at least one same subcarrier spacings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0348" num="0388">First, the operation for the decoding of PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the P-RNTI of the present disclosure will be described. The terminal (<b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b>) in the RRC_IDLE state goes through a process of acquiring synchronization with the cell and receiving system information when the cell is selected or reselected. The subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the P-RNTI may be different from those of the physical layer transmission channels, i.e., that is, the synchronization signal, the PBCH, the PDCCH configured as SI-RNTI, which are received in the cell selection process. Therefore, the base stations <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> transmit the subcarrier spacing used for the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the P-RNTI to the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> in the form of system information (MIB or SIBx). However, as described above, each of the base stations <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> in the TA cannot know whether or not the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> has camped on itself and the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> cannot know whether or not support the corresponding subcarrier spacing. Therefore, when transmitting the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the P-RNTI to the system information, a process of reselecting, by the terminal, the cell according to whether to support the received subcarrier spacing may be additionally requested. For example, assume that the TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and the TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref> support the sets of subcarrier spacings of ฮf<sub>1</sub>, ฮf<sub>2</sub>, and ฮf<sub>3 </sub>and the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> supports the subcarrier spacing. It can be considered that the physical layer channel transmitting the synchronization signal and the system information in the TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and the TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> is transmitted at the subcarrier spacing ฮf<sub>1</sub>. In addition, assume that the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the P-RNTI uses ฮf<sub>1</sub>, ฮf<sub>2</sub>, and ฮf<sub>3 </sub>in the TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and the TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b>. In this environment, the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> can camp-on on of the TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and the TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b>, thereby obtaining the system information. However, when the terminal camps on the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, the terminal can determine that it cannot receive the paging message through the system information. In this case, the terminal will be able to perform reselection with the TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b> or the TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> which is another cell in the TA. At the same time, the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b> can be excluded from its own TA by transmitting a request message to the TAU by the MME. Thereafter, the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> can successfully receive the paging message based on the newly updated TA</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0349" num="0389">In another method of determining the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH (<b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b>) configured as P-RNTI, it may be considered that the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> transmits capability information on whether to support its subcarrier spacing to the MME <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>05</b>. The terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> can transmit capability information on whether or not to support its own subcarrier spacing through the attach request message in the initial connection step to the MME <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>05</b>, which may be made through an upper layer signaling (for example, NAS signaling). The MME <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>05</b> can transmit the cells (TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b>) connected thereto of the capability of the subcarrier spacing of the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b>, and each base station may select the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the P-RNTI in consideration of this. Alternatively, the base station may reconfigure the TA in consideration of the selection of the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> as the P-RNTI. For example, assume that the TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and the TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref> support the sets of subcarrier spacings of ฮf<sub>1</sub>, ฮf<sub>2</sub>, and ฮf<sub>3 </sub>and the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> supports the subcarrier spacing. In addition, assume that the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the P-RNTI uses ฮf<sub>1</sub>, ฮf<sub>2</sub>, and ฮf<sub>1 </sub>in TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and the TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b>. It is considered that the TA of the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> is initially configured as the TRP1 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and the TRP3 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b>. The MME <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>05</b> that has received the capability of the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> may confirm that the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b> uses ฮf<sub>2 </sub>at the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as P-RNTI, exclude the TRP2 <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b> from the TA, and notify the terminal of the updated TA information. Thereafter, the terminal <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>01</b> can successfully receive the paging message based on the newly updated TA</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0390">Next, the operation of the PBCH decoding of the present disclosure to which the paging message is transmitted will be described. The control information on the PDSCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>04</b> to which the paging message is transmitted can be obtained from the DCI of the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the C-RNTI. Therefore, the base stations <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>02</b>, <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>03</b>, and <b>3</b> <i>k</i>-<b>04</b> can include information on the subcarrier spacing of the PDSCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>04</b> to which the paging message is transmitted in the DCI transmitted to the PDCCH <b>3</b> <i>d</i>-<b>05</b> configured as the P-RNTI.
