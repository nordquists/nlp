<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present application relates to the communication technical field, in particular to a method and device for service time division multiplexing.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The third generation partnership projects (3GPP) initiated a long term evolution (LTE) of the 3rd generation (3G) in 2005, and better support for increasing service requirements of operators and users is provided through evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) and an evolved universal terrestrial radio access network (E-UTRAN).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In an LTE system, downlink communication services can be divided into two categories, a unicast service and a multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS). The unicast service refers to a point-to-point service in which one data source sends data to one user equipment, and the MBMS refers to a point-to-multipoint service in which one data source sends data to multiple user equipment. The introduction of the MBMS is to realize resource sharing on a network. The network, which includes a core network and a radio access network, serves maximum multimedia user equipment having the same requirements by using minimum resources. In the radio access network, the MBMS can realize the multicast and broadcast of messages with plain text at a low rate, and realize the multicast and broadcast of multimedia services at a higher rate on a common transport channel and a common radio bearer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">For the MBMS, the specification 25.814 of the 3GPP supports two cell transmission modes, one is a multi-cell transmission mode, in which multiple cells simultaneously send the MBMS with the same frequency resource, and the other is a single-cell transmission mode, in which a single cell sends the MBMS without considering the transmission of other cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Data transmission modes of the MBMS include two modes, one is a mixed carrier (MC) mode, in which the MBMS and the unicast service share the same carrier to transmit data, and the other is a dedicated carrier (DC) mode, in which the MBMS itself uses one carrier to transmit data. In the case of the MC mode, it is decided at a 3GPP meeting that the MBMS and the unicast service are in time division multiplexing, and the two services are subframe-level time division multiplexing, i.e., each service occupies at least one subframe. If a base station does not send a signaling to inform the usage of each subframe, unicast service user equipment and MBMS user equipment will attempt to read their own service information through all the transmission time, thus wasting electric energy of the user equipment. If one bit of information is set for each subframe to indicate the usage, for example, one bit has two states, 0 and 1, corresponding to the two services respectively, then the required information amount is very large.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology is employed in the downlink of LTE. The OFDM technology divides a given channel into multiple orthogonal subchannels in a frequency domain, and allows subcarrier spectra to be partially overlapped. As long as mutual orthogonality is met among the subcarriers, data signals can be obtained. In the operation of an OFDM system, symbols are firstly subject to serial/parallel conversion to form multiple low-rate sub-data streams. Each data stream occupies one subcarrier, the mapping from the sub-data streams to the subcarriers can be achieved through an inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) or an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). A cyclic prefix (CP) as a guard interval is applied, which greatly reduces or even eliminates inter-symbol interference, and ensures orthogonality among various channels, thus greatly reducing inter-channel interference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In the subframe which sends the unicast service or a single-cell transmission MBMS, the length of the CP only needs to meet the requirements of the serving cell. In the subframe of a multi-cell transmission MBMS, however, signal needs to pass through a longer transmission path, in which case a longer CP is required to overcome inter-symbol interference, and user equipment can successfully demodulate a subframe only after knowing the length of the CP of the subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">To sum up, the base station in the prior art cannot effectively inform the transmission time of various services and the length of the CP of each subframe in the case of time division multiplexing for multiple services.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In the case of multi-service time division multiplexing, in order to allow user equipment to know that a subframe is used by which service, embodiments of the present invention provide a service time division multiplexing method and device, as well as a method and a device for transmitting service.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">One time unit is divided into at least one Type 1 subunit, and a part or all of the Type 1 subunits are selected as specific Type 1 subunits. Each of Type n subunits is divided into at least one Type n+1 subunits, where 1≤n≤N, and n and N are natural numbers. A part or all of the Type n+1 subunits in the specific Type n subunits are selected as specific Type n+1 subunits, and the Type N subunits are used for sending a specific service. The service is sent according to the above time division multiplexing mode. Position information of N kinds of the specific Type n subunits is sent. In the embodiments of the present invention, the service is multiplexed in the way of dividing one time unit into N layers by dividing one time unit into Type 1 subunits, dividing each of the Type 1 subunits into Type 2 subunits, and dividing each of the Type 2 subunits into Type 3 sub-time units and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in an embodiment, one time unit is divided into two layers. A method for service time division multiplexing includes the following steps:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In step S<b>101</b>, a part or all of radio frames in one time unit are selected as specific radio frames.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The size of the time unit can be changed, which means that the number of the radio frames included in the time unit may be changed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In step S<b>102</b>, a part or all of subframes in the specific radio frames are selected as specific subframes for sending a specific service.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The specific service is a multimedia broadcast multicast service, or a unicast service, or one or more than one services transmitted in broadcast or multicast mode. Particularly, when the specific service is the multimedia broadcast multicast service or the unicast service, the present invention is to solve the problems in the prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The allocation of the specific radio frames in the time unit can be predefined according to characteristics of the specific service. For example, both of base stations and user equipment pre-store a mapping table or mapping rules. Therefore, when the number of the specific radio frames in the time unit is given, the base stations and the user equipment can know which radio frames are specific radio frames by looking up the mapping table or by calculating according to the mapping rules. For example, the mapping rule may be that the specific radio frames are evenly allocated. In this way, specific positions of the radio frames can be determined if the number or the interval of the radio frames is determined, thus simplifying multiplexing design. The mode, such as explicit signaling, may be employed rather than employing the predetermined mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In order to further simplify the multiplexing design, the allocation of the specific subframes may be the same for every specific radio frame. In this way, specific positions of all specific subframes in the time unit can be determined only by determining the positions of specific subframes in one specific radio frame. The allocation of the specific subframes may not be necessarily the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, the allocation of the specific subframes in the radio frame that the specific subframes belong to may be predefined without need of notification. For example, both of the base stations and the user equipment prestore the mapping table or the mapping rules. When number of the specific subframes in one specific radio frame is given, the base stations and the user equipment can obtain which subframes are specific subframes by looking up the mapping table or by calculating according to the mapping rules. For example, the specific subframes may be evenly allocated, or allocated at an approximately equal interval in the radio frame that the specific subframes belong to.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The specific positions of the specific subframes can be determined only by determining the number or the interval of the specific subframes in one specific radio frame.

That is, a user can obtain the length of the CP of each subframe in the entire time unit only by increasing one bit of signaling to inform the MBMS subframes of using the long CP or the short CP. For example, the one bit of signaling is set as 0, which represents the long CP, and the one bit of signaling is set as 1, which represents the short CP, vice versa, the one bit of signaling is set as 1, which represents the long CP, and the one bit of information is set as 0, which represents the short CP.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the method for transmitting service includes the following steps:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">In step S<b>902</b>, a part or all of subframes in the specific radio frames are selected as specific subframes for sending a specific service.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">In step S<b>903</b>, the service is sent according to the above time division multiplexing mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">In step S<b>904</b>, the position information of the specific radio frames is sent by sending the value of a signaling F. When the number of the specific radio frames in the time unit is more, the time unit is divided into several sub-time units. F represents the position information of the specific radio frames in the sub-time units. And, the position information of the specific radio frames in several sub-time units is the same. When the number of the specific radio frames in the time unit is less, F represents the position information of the specific radio frames in the time unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">The present invention may be embodied in many different forms as follows, but should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">S successive radio frames form one time unit, where S=2<sup>M </sup>and the value of M may be 10 or other numerical values. The time unit is divided into 2<sup>M-M</sup> <sup> <sub2>0 </sub2> </sup>sub-time units, and each sub-time unit consists of 2<sup>M</sup> <sup> <sub2>0 </sub2> </sup>successive radio frames, and M0 is a positive integer smaller than M.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">In step S<b>904</b>.<b>1</b> (not shown), when the number of the specific radio frames in the time unit is more than or equal to 2<sup>M-M</sup> <sup> <sub2>0</sub2> </sup>, F represents the position information of the specific radio frames in the sub-time unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">For example, F may represent a bitmap Fq of the radio frames in the sub-time unit, Fq consists of 2<sup>M</sup> <sup> <sub2>0 </sub2> </sup>bits, each bit corresponds to one radio frame, and represents whether the corresponding radio frame is allocated to the specific service or not with two states which are 0 and 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">Another example is that F may represent the number Fp of the radio frames in the sub-time unit, and 0&lt;Fp≤2<sup>M</sup> <sup> <sub2>0</sub2> </sup>. The specific radio frames in a same sub-time unit are allocated according to a preset rule, for example, successive allocation or even allocation. If Fp specific radio frames are of approximate even allocation in the sub-time unit that the specific radio frames belong to, the method for determining the position of the radio frames is similar to the method for determining the specific subframes after knowing the value of Np in the embodiment one. If Fp specific radio frames are consecutively allocated in the sub-time unit that the specific radio frames belong to, then the positions of the specific radio frames can be determined according to a starting position f<sub>0 </sub>of the successive Fp specific radio frames and the value of Fp. The starting position f<sub>0 </sub>may be appointed or informed by signaling, particularly, f<sub>0 </sub>may be appointed as 0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">In step S<b>904</b>.<b>2</b> (not shown), when the number of the specific radio frames in the time unit is less than 2<sup>M-M</sup> <sup> <sub2>0</sub2> </sup>, F represents the position information of the specific radio frames in the time unit.</div>

The following paragraphs provide three examples of appointed allocation rules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">(1). When Gp specific radio frames are appointed to be consecutively allocated in the time unit, the positions of the specific radio frames can be determined according to a starting position g<sub>0 </sub>of the successive Gp specific radio frames and the value of Gp. The starting position g<sub>0 </sub>can be appointed or informed by the signaling, particularly, g<sub>0 </sub>may be appointed as 0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">(2). When Gp specific radio frames are appointed to be allocated in Gp successive sub-time units of the time unit, the positions of the sub-time units including the specific radio frames can be determined according to a starting position g′<sub>0 </sub>of the Gp successive sub-time units and the value of Gp. The starting position g′<sub>0 </sub>can be appointed or informed by the signaling, particularly, g′<sub>0 </sub>may be appointed as 0. The positions of the specific radio frames are identical in various sub-time units that the specific radio frames respectively belong to. The position can be appointed or informed by the signaling.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">If 2<sup>m </sup>is used to represent the number of the specific radio frames in the time unit, where 0≤m≤M−M<sub>0 </sub>or 0≤m≤M−M<sub>0</sub>, and m=M−M<sub>0 </sub>is used to indicate that the entire time unit has no specific subframe, when the specific radio frames are evenly allocated, the interval is 2<sup>M-m</sup>; vice versa, if 2<sup>m </sup>is used to represent the interval of various specific radio frames, then the number of the specific radio frames in the time unit is 2<sup>M-m</sup>, where M<sub>0</sub>≤m≤M or M<sub>0</sub>≤m≤M, and m=M<sub>0 </sub>is used to represent that the entire time unit has no specific subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">In step S<b>905</b>, the position information of the specific subframes is sent by sending the value of a signaling Np or the value of Nq, where Np represents the number of the specific subframes in the specific radio frame and 0≤Np≤R; R represents that the radio frame contains R subframes that may be allocated to the specific service; and Nq is a bitmap of the subframes in the specific radio frame. Specifically, Nq consists of R bits, each bit corresponds to one allocable subframe, and represents that whether the corresponding subframe is allocated to the specific service or not with two states which are 0 and 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">In the present embodiment, the allocation of the specific subframes is the same for every specific radio frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">After knowing the value of Np, if Np specific subframes are allocated at approximate equal interval in the specific radio frame that the specific subframes belong to, the method for determining positions of the specific subframes is exactly the same as that of the embodiment one. If Np specific subframes are consecutively allocated in the specific radio frame that the specific subframes belong to, then the positions of the specific subframes can be determined according to a starting position r<sub>0 </sub>of successive Np subframes and the value of Np, and the starting position r<sub>0 </sub>can be appointed or informed by the signaling, particularly, r<sub>0 </sub>may be appointed as 0.</div>
