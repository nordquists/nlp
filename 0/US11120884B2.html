<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to high-density memory structures. In particular, the present invention relates to high-density, low read-latency memory structures formed by interconnected thin-film storage elements (e.g., stacks of thin-film storage transistors, or “TFTs”, organized as NOR-type TFT strings or “NOR strings”).</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In this disclosure, memory circuit structures are described. These memory circuit structures may be fabricated on planar semiconductor substrates (e.g., silicon wafers) using conventional fabrication processes. To facilitate clarity in this description, the term “vertical” refers to the direction perpendicular to the surface of a semiconductor substrate, and the term “horizontal” refers to any direction that is parallel to the surface of that semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A number of high-density non-volatile memory structures, sometimes referred to as “three-dimensional vertical NAND strings,” are known in the prior art. Many of these high-density memory structures are formed using thin-film storage transistors (TFTs) formed out of deposited thin-films (e.g., polysilicon thin-films), and organized as arrays of “memory strings.” One type of memory strings is referred to as NAND memory strings or simply “NAND strings”. A NAND string consists of a number of series-connected TFTs. Reading or programming any of the series-connected TFTs requires activation of all series-connected TFTs in the NAND string. Under this NAND arrangement, the activated TFTs that are not read or programmed may experience undesirable program-disturb or read-disturb conditions. Further, TFTs formed out of polysilicon thin films have much lower channel mobility—and therefore higher resistivity—than conventional transistors formed in a single-crystal silicon substrate. The higher series resistance in the NAND string limits the number of TFTs in a string in practice to typically no more than 64 or 128 TFTs. The low read current that is required to be conducted through a long NAND string results in a long latency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Another type of high-density memory structures is referred to as the NOR memory strings or “NOR strings.” A NOR string includes a number of storage transistors each of which is connected to a shared source region and a shared drain region. Thus, the transistors in a NOR string are connected in parallel, so that a read current in a NOR string is conducted over a much lesser resistance than the read current through a NAND string. To read or program a storage transistor in a NOR string, only that storage transistor needs to be activated (i.e., “on” or conducting), all other storage transistors in the NOR string may remain dormant (i.e., “off” or non-conducting). Consequently, a NOR string allows much faster sensing of the activated storage transistor to be read. Conventional NOR transistors are programmed by a channel hot-electron injection technique, in which electrons are accelerated in the channel region by a voltage difference between the source region and the drain region and are injected into the charge-trapping layer between the control gate and the channel region, when an appropriate voltage is applied to the control gate. Channel hot-electron injection programming requires a relatively large electron current to flow through the channel region, therefore limiting the number of transistors that can be programmed in parallel. Unlike transistors that are programmed by hot-electron injection, in transistors that are programmed by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling or by direct tunneling, electrons are injected from the channel region to the charge-trapping layer by a high electric field that is applied between the control gate and the source and drain regions. Fowler-Nordheim tunneling and direct tunneling are orders of magnitude more efficient than channel hot-electron injection, allowing massively parallel programming; however, such tunneling is more susceptible to program-disturb conditions.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a NOR memory string may be used to implement a logic function involving many Boolean variables, or to generate an analog signal whose magnitude is representative of the bit values of many Boolean variables. The advantage of using a NOR memory string in either of these manners is that the logic function or the generation of the analog signal may be accomplished in one read operation on the memory cells in the NOR memory string.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one embodiment of the present invention, an array of memory cells includes TFTs formed in stacks of horizontal active strips running parallel to the surface of a silicon substrate and control gates in vertical local word lines running along one or both sidewalls of the active strips, with the control gates being separated from the active strips by one or more charge-storage elements. Each active strip includes at least a channel layer formed between two shared source or drain layers. The TFTs are organized as NOR strings. The TFTs associated with each active strip may belong to one or two NOR strings, depending on whether one or both sides of each active strip are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, only one of the shared source or drain layers in an active strip is connected by a conductor to a supply voltage through a select circuit, while the other source or drain layer is held at a voltage determined by the quantity of charge that is provided to that source or drain layer. Prior to a read, write or erase operation, some or all of the TFTs in a NOR string along the active strip that are not selected for the read, write or erase operation act as a strip capacitor, with the channel and source or drain layers of the active strip providing one capacitor plate and the control gate electrodes in the TFTs of the NOR string that are referenced to a ground reference providing the other capacitor plate. The strip capacitor is pre-charged before the read, write or erase operation by turning on one or more TFTs (“pre-charge TFT”) momentarily to transfer charge to the strip capacitor from the source or drain layer that is connected by conductor to a voltage source. Following the pre-charge operation, the select circuit is deactivated, so that the pre-charged source or drain layer is held floating at substantially the pre-charged voltage. In that state, the charged strip capacitor provides a virtual reference voltage source for the read, write, or erase operation. This pre-charged state enables massively parallel read, write or erase operations on a large number of addressed TFTs. In this manner, TFT of many NOR strings on one or more active strips in one or more blocks of a memory array may be read, written or erased concurrently. In fact, blocks in a memory array can be pre-charged for program or erase operations, while other blocks in the memory array can be pre-charged for read operations concurrently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, TFTs are formed using both vertical side edges of each active strip, with vertical local word lines being provided along both the vertical side edges of the active strips. In that embodiment, double-density is achieved by having the local word lines along one of vertical edges of an active strip contacted by horizontal global word lines provided above the active strip, while the local word lines along the other vertical edge of the active strip are contacted by horizontal global word lines provided beneath the active strip. All global word lines may run in a direction transverse to the direction along the lengths of the corresponding active strips. Even greater storage density may be achieved by storing more than one bit of data in each TFT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Organizing the TFTs into NOR strings in the memory array—rather than the prior art NAND strings—results in (i) a reduced read-latency that approaches that of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) array, (ii) reduced sensitivities to read-disturb and program-disturb conditions that are known to be associated with long NAND strings, (iii) reduced power dissipation and a lower cost-per-bit relative to planar NAND or 3-D NAND arrays, and (iv) the ability to read, write or erase TFTs on multiple active strips concurrently to increase data throughput.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one embodiment of the present invention, variations in threshold voltages within NOR strings in a block may be compensated by providing electrically programmable reference NOR strings within the block. Effects on a read operation due to background leakage currents inherent to NOR strings can be substantially eliminated by comparing the sensed result of the TFT being read and that of a concurrently read TFT in a reference NOR string. In other embodiments, the charge-storing element of each TFT may have its structure modified to provide a high write/erase cycle endurance (albeit, a lower data retention time that requires periodic refreshing). In this detailed description, such TFTs having a higher write/erase cycle endurance but a shorter retention time than the conventional memory TFTs (e.g., TFTs in conventional NAND strings) are referred to as being “quasi-volatile.” However, as these quasi-volatile TFTs require refreshing significantly less frequently than a conventional DRAM circuit, the NOR strings of the present invention may be used in lieu of DRAM in some applications. Using the NOR strings of the present invention in DRAM applications allows a substantially lower cost-per-bit figure of merit, as compared to the conventional DRAMs, and a substantially lower read-latency, as compared to conventional NAND strings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the active strips are manufactured in a semiconductor process in which the source or drain layers, and the channel layers are formed and annealed individually for each plane in the stack. In other embodiments, the source or drain layers are annealed either individually or collectively (i.e., in a single step for all the source or drain layers), prior to concurrently forming the channel layers in a single step.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b> and <b>1</b> <i>a</i>-<b>2</b> show conceptualized memory structure <b>100</b>, illustrating in this detailed description an organization of memory cells according to embodiments of the present invention. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>, memory structure <b>100</b> represents a 3-dimensional memory array or block of memory cells formed in deposited thin-films fabricated over a surface of substrate layer <b>101</b>. Substrate layer <b>101</b> may be, for example, a conventional silicon wafer used for fabricating integrated circuits, familiar to those of ordinary skill in the art. In this detailed description, a Cartesian coordinate system (such as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>) is adopted solely for the purpose of facilitating description. Under this coordinate system, the surface of substrate layer <b>101</b> is considered a plane which is parallel to the X-Y plane. Thus, as used in this description, the term “horizontal” refers to any direction parallel to the X-Y plane, while the term “vertical” refers to the Z-direction. As shown, block <b>100</b> consists of four planes (e.g., plane <b>110</b>) stacked in the vertical direction one on top of, and isolated from, each other. Each plane consists of horizontal active strips of NOR strings (e.g., active strip <b>112</b>). Each NOR string includes multiple TFTs (e.g., TFT <b>111</b>) formed side-by-side along the active strip, with thin-film transistor current flowing in the vertical direction, as described in further detail below. Unlike prior art NAND strings, in the NOR string of the present invention, writing, reading or erasing one of the TFTs in the NOR string does not require activating other TFTs in the NOR string. Accordingly, each NOR string is randomly addressable and, within such a NOR string, each TFT is randomly accessible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Plane <b>110</b> is shown as one of four planes that are stacked on top of each other and isolated from each other. Along the length of horizontal active strip <b>112</b> are formed side-by-side TFTs (e.g., TFT <b>111</b>). In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>, for illustrative purpose only, each plane has four horizontal active strips that are isolated from each other. Both the plane and the NOR strings are individually addressable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>2</b> introduces additional randomly addressable units of memory cells: “columns,” “pages” and “slices”. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>2</b>, each column (e.g., column <b>115</b>) represents TFTs of multiple NOR strings that share a common control gate or local word line, the NOR strings are formed along active strips of multiple planes. Note that, as a conceptualized structure, memory structure <b>100</b> is merely an abstraction of certain salient characteristics of a memory structure of the present invention. Although shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b> as an array of 4×4 active strips, each having four TFTs along their respective lengths, a memory structure of the present invention may have any number of TFTs along any of the X-, Y- and Z-directions. For example, there may be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 . . . planes of strings in the Z direction, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, . . . active strips of NOR strings along the X-direction, and each NOR string may have 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . 8192 or more side-by-side TFTs in the Y-direction. The use of numbers that are integer powers of 2 (i.e., 2<sup>n</sup>, where n is an integer) follows a customary practice in conventional memory design. It is customary to access each addressable unit of memory by decoding a binary address. Thus, for example, a memory structure of the present invention may have M NOR strings along each of the X and Z directions, with M being a number that is not necessarily 2<sup>n</sup>, for any integer n. TFTs of structure <b>100</b> of the present invention can be read, programmed or erased simultaneously on individual page or individual slice basis. (As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>2</b>, a “page” refers to a row of TFTs along the Y-direction; a “slice” refers to an organization of contiguous memory cells that extend along both the X- and Z-directions and one memory cell deep along the Y-direction). An erase operation can also be performed in one step for entire memory block <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">As a conceptualized structure, memory structure <b>100</b> is not drawn to scale in any of the X-, Y-, and Z-directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>b </i> </figref>shows a basic circuit representation of four NOR string pairs, each NOR string pair being located in a respective one of four planes, according to one embodiment of the present invention; corresponding TFTs of each NOR string share common local word lines (e.g., local word line <b>151</b> <i>n</i>). The detailed structure of this configuration is discussed and illustrated below in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>k</i> </figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>b</i> </figref>, this basic circuit configuration includes four NOR string pairs on four separate planes (e.g., NOR strings <b>150</b>L and <b>150</b>R in plane <b>159</b>-<b>4</b>) that are provided in adjacent columns <b>115</b> of memory structure <b>100</b> sharing a common local word line.</div>

In this embodiment, as illustrated in greater detail below in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>k </i> </figref>and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4<i>c</i> </figref>, a greater storage density may be achieved by having a shared vertical local word line control TFTs of adjacent active strips.

As discussed in greater detail below, in some embodiments, the parasitic capacitance C intrinsic to each NOR string (e.g., the distributed capacitance between the common N<sup>+</sup> source region or N<sup>+</sup> drain region of a NOR string and its multiple associated local word lines) may be used as a virtual voltage source, under some operating conditions, to provide source voltage V<sub>ss</sub>.</div>

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>c</i> </figref>, corresponding TFTs of each NOR string share common local word lines. Each NOR string may run horizontally along the Y-direction, with storage elements (i.e., TFTs) connected between source line <b>153</b>-<i>m </i>and drain or bit lines <b>154</b>-<i>m</i>, where m is the index between 1 to 4 of the corresponding active strip, with drain-source transistor currents flowing along the Z-direction.

The TFTs in the NOR strings of the present invention are variable threshold voltage thin-film storage transistors that may be programmed, program-inhibited, erased, or read using conventional programming, inhibition, erasure and read voltages. In one or more embodiments of the present invention, the TFTs are implemented by thin-film storage transistors that are programmed or erased using Fowler-Nordheim tunneling or direct tunneling mechanisms.

These support circuits may be formed out of the building blocks for conventional devices (e.g., N-wells, P-wells, triple wells, N<sup>+</sup>, P<sup>+</sup> diffusions, isolation regions, low and high voltage transistors, capacitors, resistors, vias, interconnects and conductors), as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</div>

To facilitate discussion in this detailed description, the global word lines are presumed to run along the X-direction. The metallic interconnect lines may be formed by applying photo-lithographical patterning and etching steps on one or more deposited metal layers. (Alternatively these metallic interconnect lines can be formed using a conventional damascene process, such as a copper or Tungsten damascene process). A thick oxide is deposited to form isolation layer <b>203</b>-<b>0</b>, followed by a planarization step using conventional chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques.</div>

As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>b</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>, active layer <b>220</b> <i>a </i>includes deposited sublayers <b>221</b>-<b>223</b> of polysilicon. In one implementation, sublayers <b>221</b>-<b>223</b> may be deposited successively in the same process chamber without removal in between. Sublayer <b>223</b> may be formed by depositing 10-100 nm of in-situ doped N<sup>+</sup> polysilicon. Sublayers <b>222</b> and <b>221</b> may then be formed by depositing undoped or lightly doped polysilicon or amorphous silicon, in the thickness range of 10-100 nm. Sublayer <b>221</b> (i.e., the top portion of the deposited polysilicon) is then N<sup>+</sup> doped. N<sup>+</sup> dopant concentrations in sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> should be as high as possible, for example between 1×10<sup>20</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and 1×10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, to provide the lowest possible sheet resistivity in N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b>. The N<sup>+</sup> doping may be achieved by either (i) a low-energy shallow high-dose ion implantation of phosphorus, arsenic or antimony, or (ii) in-situ phosphorus or arsenic doping of the deposited polysilicon, forming a 10-100 nm thick N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> on top. Low-dose implantations of boron (P<sup>−</sup>) or phosphorus (N<sup>−</sup>) ions may also be carried out at energies sufficient to penetrate the implanted or in-situ doped N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> into sublayer <b>222</b> lying between N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b>, so as to achieve an intrinsic enhancement mode threshold voltage in the resulting TFTs. The boron or P<sup>− </sup>dopant concentration of sublayer <b>222</b> can be in the range of 1×10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 1×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>; the actual boron concentration in sublayer <b>222</b> determines the native transistor turn-on threshold voltage, channel mobility, N<sup>+</sup>P<sup>−</sup>N<sup>+</sup> punch-through voltage, N<sup>+</sup>P<sup>−</sup> junction leakage and reverse diode conduction characteristics, and channel depletion depth under the various operating conditions for the N<sup>+</sup>P<sup>−</sup>N<sup>+ </sup>TFTs formed along active strips <b>202</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>202</b>-<b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Thermal activation of the N<sup>+</sup> and P<sup>− </sup>implanted species and recrystallization of sublayers <b>221</b>, <b>222</b> and <b>223</b> should preferably take place all at once after all active layers <b>202</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>202</b>-<b>7</b> have been formed, using a conventional rapid thermal annealing technique (e.g., at 700° C. or higher) or a conventional rapid laser annealing technique, thereby ensuring that all active layers experience elevated temperature processing in roughly the same amount. Caution must be exercised to limit the total thermal budget, so as to avoid excessive diffusion of the dopants out of N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b> and sublayer <b>221</b>, resulting in eliminating form the TFTs P sublayer <b>222</b>, which acts as a channel region. P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>222</b> is required to remain sufficiently thick, or sufficiently P-doped to avoid N<sup>+</sup>P<sup>−</sup>N<sup>+</sup> transistor punch-through or excessive leakage between N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Alternatively, N<sup>+</sup> and P<sup>− </sup>dopants of each of active layers <b>202</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>202</b>-<b>7</b> can be activated individually by shallow rapid thermal annealing using, for example, excimer laser anneal (ELA) at an ultraviolet wavelength (e.g., 308 nanometer). The annealing energy which is absorbed by the polysilicon or amorphous silicon to partially melt sublayer <b>221</b> and part or all of sublayer <b>222</b>, optionally penetrating into sublayer <b>223</b> to affect volume <b>205</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>b</i> </figref>-<b>4</b>) without unduly heating other active layers lying below sublayer <b>223</b> of the annealed active layer <b>220</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Although the use of successive layer-by-layer excimer laser shallow rapid thermal anneal is more costly than a single deep rapid thermal anneal step, ELA has the advantage that the localized partial melting of polysilicon (or amorphous silicon) can result in recrystallization of annealed volume <b>205</b> to form larger silicon polycrystalline grains having substantially improved mobility and uniformity, and reduced TFT leakage due to reduced segregation of N<sup>+</sup> dopants at the grain boundaries of the affected volume. The ELA step can be applied either to P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>222</b> and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b> before formation of N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> above it, or after formation of a sufficiently thin N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> to allow recrystallization of both sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> and, optionally, sublayer <b>223</b>. Such shallow excimer laser low-temperature anneal technique is well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, such technique is used to form polysilicon or amorphous silicon films in solar cell and flat panel display applications. See, for example, H. Kuriyama et al. “Comprehensive Study of Lateral Grain Growth in Poly-Si Films by Excimer Laser Annealing (ELA) and its applications to Thin Film Transistors”, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 33, Part 1, Number 10, 20 Aug. 1994, or “Annealing of Silicon Backplanes with 540 W Excimer Lasers”, technical publication by Coherent Inc. on their website.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The thickness of P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>222</b> roughly corresponds to the channel length of the TFTs to be formed, which may be as little as 10 nm or less over long active strips. In one embodiment (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>b</i> </figref>-<b>5</b>), it is possible to control the channel length of the TFT to less than 10 nm, even after several thermal process cycles, by depositing an ultra-thin (from one or a few atomic layers to 3 nm thick) film of silicon nitride (e.g., SiN or Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), or another suitable diffusion-blocking film following the formation of N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b> (see sublayer <b>223</b>-<i>d </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>b</i> </figref>-<b>5</b>). A second ultra-thin film of silicon nitride, or another suitable diffusion-blocking film (see <b>221</b>-<i>d </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>b</i> </figref>-<b>5</b>), may optionally be deposited following deposition of P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>222</b>, before depositing N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b>. The ultra-thin dopant diffusion-blocking layers <b>221</b>-<i>d </i>and <b>223</b>-<i>d </i>can be deposited by chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition or any other suitable means (e.g., high pressure nitridization at low temperature). Each ultra-thin dopant diffusion-blocking layer acts as a barrier that prevents the N<sup>+</sup> dopants in N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> from diffusing into P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>222</b>, yet are sufficiently thin to only marginally impede the MOS transistor action in the channel region between N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> (acting as a source) and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b> (acting as a drain). (Electrons in the surface inversion layer of sublayer <b>222</b> readily tunnel directly through the ultra-thin silicon nitride layers, which are too thin to trap such electrons). These additional ultra-thin dopant diffusion-blocking layers increase the manufacturing cost, but may serve to significantly reduce the cumulative leakage current from the multiple TFTs along the active strips that are in the “off” state. However, if that leakage current is tolerable then these ultra-thin layers can be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">NOR strings having long and narrow N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>223</b> and N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> may have excessively large line resistance (R), including the resistance of narrow and deep contacts to the substrate. Reduced line resistance is desirable, as it reduces the “RC delay” of a signal traversing a long conductive strip. (RC delay is a measure of the time delay that is given by the product of the line resistance R and the line capacitance C). Reduced line resistance also reduces the “IR voltage drop” across a long and narrow active strip. (The IR voltage drop is given by the product of the current I and the line resistance R). To significantly reduce the line resistance, an optional conductive sublayer <b>224</b> may be added to each active strip adjacent one or both of N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> or <b>223</b> (e.g., sublayer <b>224</b>, labeled as W in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2<i>b</i> </figref>-<b>2</b> and <b>2</b> <i>b</i>-<b>3</b>). Sublayer <b>224</b> may be provided by one or more deposited metal layers. For example, sublayer <b>224</b> may be provided by depositing 1-2 nm thick layer of TiN followed by depositing a 1-40 nm thick layer of tungsten, a similar refractory metal, or a polycide or silicide (e.g., nickel silicide). Sublayer <b>224</b> is more preferably in the 1-20 nm thickness range. Even a very thin sublayer <b>224</b> (e.g., 2-5 nm) can significantly reduce the line resistance of a long active strip, while allowing the use of less heavily doped N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>21</b> and <b>223</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>c</i> </figref>, the conductor inside contact opening <b>205</b>-<b>1</b> can become quite long for a tall stack, thereby adversely increasing the line resistance. In that case, metallic sublayer layer <b>224</b> (e.g., a tungsten layer) may preferably be included below sublayer <b>223</b>, so as to substantially fill contact opening <b>205</b>-<b>1</b>, rather than placing it above N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b>, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>c</i> </figref>. Including metal sublayer <b>224</b> in each of active layers <b>202</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>202</b>-<b>7</b> may, however, increase cost and complexity of the manufacturing process, including the complication that some of the metallic materials are relatively more difficult to etch anisotropically than materials such as polysilicon, silicon oxide or silicon nitride. However, metallic sublayer <b>224</b> enables use of considerably longer active strips, which results in superior array efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">In the embodiments where no metallic sublayers <b>224</b> are incorporated, there are several tradeoffs that can be made: for example, longer active strips are possible if the resultant increased read latency is acceptable. In general, the shorter the active strip, the lower the line resistance and therefore the shorter the latency. (The trade-off is in array efficiency). In the absence of metallic sublayer <b>224</b>, the thickness of N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> can be increased (for example to 100 nanometers) to reduce the intrinsic line resistance, at the expense of a taller stack to etch through. The line resistance can be further reduced by increasing the N<sup>+</sup> doping concentration in N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> and by applying higher anneal temperatures in excess of 1,000° C. (e.g., by rapid thermal anneal, deep laser anneal or shallow excimer laser anneal) to enhance recrystallization and dopant activation and to reduce dopant segregation at the grain-boundaries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Shorter active strips also have superior immunity to leakage between N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b> and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b>. A thicker N<sup>+</sup> sublayer provides reduced strip line resistance and increased strip capacitance, which is desirable for dynamic sensing (to be discussed below). The integrated circuit designer may opt for a shorter active strip (with or without metal sublayer <b>224</b>) when low read latency is most valued. Alternatively, the strip line resistance may be reduced by contacting both ends of each active strip, rather than just at one end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Block-formation patterning and etching steps define separate blocks in each of the active layers formed. Each block occupies an area in which a large number (e.g., thousands) of active strips running in parallel may be formed, as discussed below, with each active strip running along the Y-direction, eventually forming one or more NOR strings that each provide a large number (e.g., thousands) of TFTs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Each of active layers <b>202</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>202</b>-<b>7</b> may be successively formed by repeating the steps described above.

Buried contacts for active layers <b>202</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>202</b>-<b>7</b> (not shown) may be similarly provided to connect active layers <b>202</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>202</b>-<b>7</b> to contacts <b>206</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>206</b>-<b>7</b> in semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> in an inverted staircase-like structure in which the active layer closest to the substrate has the shortest buried contact, while the active layer furthest from the substrate has the longest buried contact. Alternatively, in lieu of buried contacts, conductor-filled vias extending from the top of the active layers may be etched through isolation layers <b>203</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>203</b>-<b>1</b>. These vias establish electrical contact from substrate circuitry <b>206</b>-<b>0</b>, for example, to top N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b>-<b>0</b> (or metal sublayer <b>224</b>, if provided).

The strip-formation mask consists of a pattern in a photoresist layer of long narrow strips running along the Y-direction.

As the number of active layers to be etched, which is eight in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>c </i> </figref>(and, more generally may be 16, 32, 64 or more), a photoresist mask may not be sufficiently robust to hold the strip-formation pattern through the numerous etches necessary to etch through to beyond the lowest active layer. Thus, reinforced masks using a hard mask material (e.g., carbon or a metal) may be required, as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Etching terminates at the dielectric isolation layer above the landing pads of the global word lines. It may be advantageous to provide an etch-stop barrier film (e.g., an aluminum oxide film) to protect the landing pads during the trench etch sequence.</div>

Between adjacent trenches <b>230</b> are high aspect-ratio, long and narrow active strips in the different active layers. To achieve the best etch result, etch chemistry may have to be changed when etching through the materials of the different sublayers, especially in embodiments where metal sublayers <b>224</b> are present. The anisotropy of the multi-step etch is important, as undercutting of any sublayer should be avoided, and so that an active strip in the bottom active layer (e.g., an active strip in active layer <b>202</b>-<b>0</b>) has approximately the same width and gap spacing to an adjacent active strip as the corresponding width and gap spacing in an active strip in the top active layer (i.e., an active strip of active layer <b>202</b>-<b>7</b>). Naturally, the greater the number of active layers in the stack to be etched, the more challenging is the design of the successive etches. To alleviate the difficulty associated with etching through a large number of active layers (e.g., 32), etching may be conducted in groups of layers, say 8, as discussed in Kim, referenced above, at pp. 188-189.</div>

The charge-trapping layer is formed by first chemically depositing or growing a thin tunneling dielectric film of a 2-10 nm thickness (e.g., a silicon dioxide layer, a silicon oxide-silicon nitride-silicon oxide (“ONO”) triple layer, a bandgap engineered nitride layer or a silicon nitride layer), preferably 3 nm or less, followed by deposition of a 4-10 nm thick layer of charge-trapping material (e.g., silicon nitride, silicon-rich nitride or oxide, nanocrystals, nanodots embedded in a thin dielectric film, or isolated floating gates), which is then capped by a blocking dielectric film. The blocking dielectric film may be a 5-15 nm thick layer consisting of, for example, an ONO layer, or a high dielectric constant film (e.g., aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide or some combination thereof). The storage element to be provided can be SONOS, TANOS, nanodot storage, isolated floating gates or any suitable charge-trapping sandwich structures known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</div>

It is preferable that, at least for high voltage pre-charge operations, TFTs that are dedicated entirely to serve as pre-charge TFTs are provided, as the they are more tolerant of program-disturb conditions than the memory TFTs.</div>

The metal layer is then photo-lithographically patterned and etched to form the top global word lines. (Alternatively, these global word lines may be provided by a copper damascene process.) In one implementation, these global word lines are horizontal, running along the X-direction and electrically connecting the contacts formed in the isolation oxide (i.e., thereby contacting local word lines <b>208</b>W-a or <b>208</b>W-CHG) and with the contacts to semiconductor substrate <b>201</b> (not shown).

The sheet resistivity of N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> establishes the incremental electrical resistance R along its length that is substantially proportional to the distance from ground connector node <b>280</b>. Alternatively, source reference voltage V<sub>ss </sub>may be accessed through a metal or N<sup>+</sup> doped polysilicon conductor connecting from the top of the memory array through staircase vias, in the manner commonly employed in prior art 3D NAND stacks.

The requirement for hard-wired conductors to connect N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> to the reference voltage V<sub>ss </sub>necessitates additional patterning and etching steps for each of active layers <b>202</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>202</b>-<b>7</b>, as well as additional address decoding circuitry, thereby increasing complexity and manufacturing cost. Hence in some embodiments, it is advantageous to dispense with the hard-wired source voltage V<sub>ss </sub>connections, by taking advantage of a virtual voltage source in the intrinsic parasitic capacitance of the NOR string, as discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">Dynamic Operation of Nor Strings</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The present invention takes advantage of the cumulative intrinsic parasitic capacitance that is distributed along each NOR string to dramatically increase the number of TFTs that can be programmed, read or erased in parallel in a single operation, while also significantly reducing the operating power dissipation, as compared to 3-D NAND flash arrays. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>, local parasitic capacitor <b>360</b> (contributing to a cumulative capacitance C) exists at each overlap between a local word line (as one plate) and the N<sup>+</sup>/P<sup>−</sup>/N<sup>+</sup> active layer (as the other plate). For the TFTs of the NOR strings with minimum feature size of 20 nanometers, each local parasitic capacitor is approximately 0.005 femtofarads (each femtofarad is 1×10<sup>−15 </sup>farad), too small to be of much use for temporary storage of charge. However, since there may be a thousand or more TFTs contributing capacitance from one or both sides of an active strip, the total distributed capacitance C of N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> (the source line) and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b> (the bit line) in a long NOR string can be in the range of ˜1 to 20 femtofarads. This is also roughly the capacitance at sensing circuitry connected through connections <b>270</b> (e.g., voltage source V<sub>bl</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Having the bit line capacitance of the NOR string almost the same value as the parasitic capacitance of the source line (where charge is temporarily stored) provides a favorable signal-to-noise ratio during a sensing operation. In comparison, a DRAM cell of the same minimum feature size has a storage capacitor of approximately 20 femtofarads, while its bit line capacitance is around 2,000 femtofarads, or 100 times that of its storage capacitor. Such mismatch in capacitance results in a poor signal-to-noise ratio and the need for frequent refreshes. A DRAM capacitor can hold its charge for typically 64 milliseconds, due to leakage of the capacitor's charge through the DRAM cell's access transistor. In contrast, the distributed source line capacitance C of a NOR string has to contend with charge leakage not just of one transistor (as in a DRAM cell), but the much larger charge leakage through the thousand or more parallel unselected TFTs. This leakage occurs in TFTs on word line <b>151</b> <i>b </i>(WL-nsel) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b> that share the same active strip as the one selected TFT on word line <b>151</b> <i>a </i>(WL-sel) and reduces substantially the charge retention time on the distributed capacitance C of the NOR string to perhaps a few hundred microseconds, thus requiring measures to reduce or neutralize the leakage, as discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">As discussed below, the leakage current due to the thousand or more transistors occurs during read operations. During program, program-inhibit or erase operations, both N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> are preferably held at the same voltage, therefore the leakage current between the two N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> is insignificant. During program, program-inhibit or erase operations, charge leakage from cumulative capacitance C flows primarily to the substrate through the substrate selection circuitry, which has very little transistor leakage, as it is formed in single crystal or epitaxial silicon. Nevertheless, even a 100-microsecond charge retention time is sufficient to complete the sub-100 nanosecond read operation or the sub-100 microsecond program operation (see below) of the selected TFT on the NOR string.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">A TFT in a NOR string, unlike a DRAM cell, is a non-volatile memory transistor, so that, even if parasitic capacitor C of the NOR string is completely discharged, the information stored in the selected TFT remains intact in the charge storage material (i.e., charge-trapping layer <b>231</b>). This is the case for all the NOR strings of embodiments EMB-<b>1</b>, EMB-<b>2</b>, and EMB-<b>3</b>. In a DRAM cell, however, the information would be forever lost without frequent refreshes. Accordingly, distributed capacitance C of a NOR string of the present invention is used solely to temporarily hold the pre-charge voltage on N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> at one of voltages V<sub>ss</sub>, V<sub>bl</sub>, V<sub>progr</sub>, V<sub>inhibit</sub>, or V<sub>erase</sub>, and not used to store actual data for any of the TFTs in the NOR string. Pre-charge transistor <b>303</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>, controlled by word line <b>151</b> <i>n </i>(i.e., word line <b>208</b>-CHG), is activated momentarily immediately preceding each read, program, program-inhibit or erase operation to transfer voltage V<sub>bl </sub>(e.g., through connections <b>270</b>) from the substrate circuitry (not shown) to N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b>. For example, voltage Vim can be set at ˜0V to pre-charge N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> to a virtual ground voltage ˜0V during a read operation, or to pre-charge both N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> to between ˜5V and ˜10V during a program inhibit operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">The value of cumulative capacitance C may be increased by lengthening the NOR string to accommodate the thousands more TFTs along each side of the active strip, correspondingly increasing the retention time of pre-charge voltage V<sub>ss </sub>on N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b>. However, a longer NOR string suffers from an increased line resistance as well as higher leakage currents between N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b>. Such leakage currents may interfere with the sensed current when reading the one TFT being addressed with all other TFT's of the NOR string in their “off” (and somewhat leaky) states. Also, the potentially longer time it takes to pre-charge a larger capacitor during a read operation can conflict with the desirability for a low read latency (i.e., a fast read access time). To speed up the pre-charging of the cumulative capacitance C of a long NOR string, pre-charge TFTs may be provided spaced apart along either side of the active strip (e.g., once every 128, 256 or more TFTs).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Because the variable-threshold TFTs in a long NOR string are connected in parallel, the read operating condition for the NOR string should preferably ensure that all TFTs along both edges of an active strip operate in enhancement mode (i.e., they each have a positive threshold voltage, as applied between control gate <b>151</b> <i>n </i>and voltage V<sub>ss</sub>, at source <b>221</b>). With all TFTs being in enhancement mode, the leakage current between N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> and sublayer <b>223</b> of the active strip is suppressed when all control gates on both sides of the active strip are held at, or below V<sub>ss</sub>, ˜0V. This enhancement threshold voltage can be achieved by providing P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>222</b> with a suitable dopant concentration (e.g., a boron concentration between 1×10<sup>16 </sup>and 1×10<sup>17 </sup>per cm<sup>3 </sup>or higher, which results in an intrinsic TFT threshold voltage of between ˜0.5 V and ˜1 V).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">In some implementations, it may be advantageous to use N<sup>−</sup> doped or undoped polysilicon or amorphous silicon to implement sublayer <b>222</b>. With such a doping, some or all of the TFTs along an active string may have a negative threshold voltage (i.e., a depletion mode threshold voltage) and thus require some means to suppress the leakage current. Such suppression can be achieved by raising voltage V<sub>ss </sub>on N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> to ˜1V to ˜1.5V and voltage V<sub>bl </sub>on N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b> to a voltage that is ˜0.5V to ˜2V above that of N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b>, while holding all local word lines at 0 volt. This set of voltages provides the same effect as holding the word line voltage at ˜−1V to ˜1.5 volts with respect to N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> (the source line), and thus suppresses any leakage due to TFTs that are in a slightly depleted threshold voltage. Also, after erasing the TFTs of a NOR string, the erase operation may require a subsequent soft-programming step that shifts any TFT in the NOR string that has been over-erased into a depletion mode threshold voltage back into an enhancement mode threshold voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Quasi-Volatile Nor Strings</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Endurance is a measure of a storage transistor's performance degradation after some number of write-erase cycles. Endurance of less than around 10,000 cycles—i.e., performance being sufficiently degraded as to be unacceptable within 10,000 cycles—is considered too low for some storage applications requiring frequent data rewrites. However, the NOR strings of any of the embodiments EMB-<b>1</b>, EMB-<b>2</b>, and EMB-<b>3</b> of this invention can use a material for their charge-trapping material <b>231</b>L and <b>231</b>R which provides a reduced retention times, but which significantly increases their endurance (e.g., reducing the retention time from many years to minutes or hours, while increasing the endurance from thousands to tens of millions of write/erase cycles). To achieve this greater endurance, for an ONO film or a similar combination of charge-trapping layers, for example, the tunnel dielectric layer, typically a silicon oxide film of thickness 5-10 nm, can be reduced to 3 nm or less, or replaced altogether with another dielectric film (e.g., silicon nitride or SiN), or can have no dielectric layer at all. Similarly, the charge-trapping material layer may be a CVD-deposited more silicon-rich silicon nitride (e.g., Si<sub>1.0</sub>N<sub>1.1</sub>) than conventional Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Under a modest positive control gate programming voltage, electrons will tunnel through the thinner tunnel dielectric by direct tunneling (as distinct from Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, which typically requires higher programming voltages) into the silicon nitride charge-trapping material layer where the electrons will be temporarily trapped for a period between a few minutes to a few days. The charge-trapping silicon nitride layer and the blocking layer of silicon oxide (or aluminum oxide or another high-K dielectric) will keep these electrons from escaping to the word lines, but these electrons will eventually leak back out to sublayers <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>223</b> of the active strip, as electrons are negatively charged and therefor intrinsically repel each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">A TFT resulting from these modifications is a low data retention TFT (“semi-volatile TFT” or “quasi-volatile TFT”). Such a TFT may require periodic write refreshes or read refreshes to replenish the lost charge. Because the quasi-volatile TFT of the present invention provides a DRAM-like fast read access time with a low latency, the resulting quasi-volatile NOR strings may be suitable for use in some applications that currently require DRAMs. The advantages of quasi-volatile NOR string arrays over DRAMs include: (i) a much lower cost-per-bit figure of merit because DRAMs cannot be readily built in three-dimensional blocks, and (ii) a much lower power dissipation, as the refresh cycles need only be run approximately once every few minutes or once every few hours, as compared to every ˜64 milliseconds required in current DRAM technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">The quasi-volatile NOR strings of the present invention appropriately adapt the program/read/erase conditions to incorporate the periodic data refreshes. For example, because each quasi-non-volatile NOR string is frequently read-refreshed or program-refreshed, it is not necessary to “hard-program” quasi-volatile TFTs to open a large threshold voltage window between the ‘0’ and ‘1’ states, as compared to non-volatile TFTs where a minimum 10 years data retention is required. Quasi-non-volatile threshold voltage window may be as little as 0.2V to 1V, as compared to 1V to 3V typical for TFTs that support 10 years' data retention. The reduced threshold voltage window allows such TFTs to be programmed at lower programming voltages and by shorter-duration programming pulses, which reduce the cumulative electric field stress on the dielectric layers, thereby extending endurance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Mirror-Bit Nor Strings</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">According to another embodiment of the present invention, NOR string arrays may also be programmed by channel hot-electron injection, similar to that which is used in NROM/Mirror Bit transistors, known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In an NROM/Mirror Bit transistor, charge representing one bit is stored at one end of the channel region next to the junction with the drain region, and by reversing polarity of the source and drain, charge representing a second bit is programmed and stored at the opposite end of the channel region next to the source junction. Typical programming voltages are 5 volts at the drain terminal, 0 volt at the source terminal and 8 volts at the control gate. Reading both bits requires reading in reverse order the source and drain junctions, as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. However, channel hot-electron programming is much less efficient than tunnel programming, and therefore channel hot-electron programming does not lend itself to the massively parallel programming that is possible by tunneling. Furthermore, the relatively large programming current results in a large IR drop between the N<sup>+</sup> sublayers (i.e., between the source and drain regions), thereby limiting the length of the NOR string, unless hard-wire connections are provided to reduce line resistance, such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>b</i> </figref>-<b>2</b> or <b>2</b> <i>b</i>-<b>3</b>. Erase operations in a NROM/Mirror Bit embodiment can be achieved using conventional NROM erase mechanism of band-to-band tunneling-induced hot-hole injection. To neutralize the charge of the trapped electrons, one may apply −5V on the selected word line, 0V on N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> (the source line) and 5V on N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b> (the drain line). The channel hot-electron injection approach doubles NOR string bit-density, making it attractive for applications such as archival memory.</div>

Actual thickness used for each layer is preferably at the lower end of the range to keep to a minimum the total height of the multiple planes, which can be increasingly more difficult to etch anisotropically with 32, 64 or more stacked planes.</div>

Before active layers <b>502</b>-<b>0</b> through <b>502</b>-<b>7</b> are formed, buried contacts <b>205</b>-<b>0</b> are formed by etching into isolation layer <b>503</b>-<b>0</b>, so that when N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>523</b>-<b>0</b> is deposited, electrical contact is created with circuitry <b>206</b>-<b>0</b> previously formed in substrate <b>201</b>. An optional low resistivity thin metallic sublayer (e.g., TiN and tungsten) of typical thickness range between 5 and 20 nm can be deposited (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>b</i> </figref>) before N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>523</b>-<b>0</b> is deposited, so as to lower the line resistance. Low resistivity metallic plugs such as TiN followed by a thin layer of tungsten can be used to fill the buried contact openings to reduce contact resistance to the substrate.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Connecting active strips of each plane to substrate circuitry can be accomplished either by buried contacts from the bottom (e.g., buried contacts <b>205</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>205</b>-<b>1</b> connecting drain sublayers <b>523</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>523</b>-<b>1</b> to substrate circuitry <b>206</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>206</b>-<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>b</i> </figref>), or by conductor-filled vias from the top of the semiconductor structure (not shown), making electrical contacts to N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>521</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>521</b>-<b>1</b>. Because either one of sublayers <b>523</b> and <b>521</b> in the same active strip may serve as source terminal or drain terminal for the TFTs in the corresponding NOR string, N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>521</b> or <b>523</b> in the same active strip are interchangeable.

This alternative contact-from-the-top scheme allows vias to be etched to reach more than one plane at a time, thus reducing the number of masking and contact etching steps, which is particularly useful when there are 32, 64 or more stacked planes. However, because sublayers <b>523</b> lie underneath of, and are masked by sublayers <b>521</b>, it is not easy to contact sublayers <b>523</b> using stair-step vias from the top, as there is a risk that the conductor in the vias may electrically short sublayers <b>521</b> and <b>523</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">According to one embodiment of the present invention, in one process, drain sublayers <b>523</b> are connected to the substrate circuitry from the bottom through buried contacts, while the source sublayers <b>521</b> are connected to the substrate circuitry either through hard-wire connections by conductor-filled vias from the top (e.g., connections <b>280</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>). Alternatively, and preferably, the source layers <b>521</b> may be connected to substrate circuitry by the buried contacts using TFTs in the NOR string that are designated as pre-charge TFTs (i.e., those TFTs that are used to charge the parasitic capacitance of the NOR string to provide a virtual voltage source).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Source-Drain Leakage in Long Nor Strings</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">In long NOR strings, the current of the one accessed TFT in a read operation has to compete with the cumulative subthreshold leakage currents from the thousand or more parallel unselected TFTs. Similarly, pre-charged strip capacitor C has to contend with charge leakage not just of one transistor (as in a DRAM circuit) but the charge leakage through the thousand or more transistors in the NOR string. That charge leakage reduces substantially the charge retention time on C to perhaps a few hundred microseconds, requiring counter measures to reduce or neutralize such leakage, as discussed below. However, as will be discussed below, the leakage for a thousand or so transistors only comes into play during read operations. During program, program-inhibit or erase operations, source sublayer <b>221</b> and bit line sublayer <b>223</b> are preferably held at the same voltage, therefore transistor leakage between the two sublayers is insignificant (the leakage of charge from capacitor C during program, program-inhibit or erase operations is primarily to the substrate through the substrate selection circuitry, which is formed in single-crystal or epitaxial silicon where transistor leakage is very small). For a read operation, even a relatively short 100-microsecond retention time of charge on the source and bit line capacitors is ample time to complete the sub-100 nanosecond read operation (see below) of the TFTs of the present invention. A key difference between a TFT in a NOR string of the present invention and a DRAM cell is that the former is a non-volatile memory transistor, so that even if parasitic capacitor C is completely discharged the information stored in the selected TFT is not lost from the charge storage material (i.e., charge-trapping layers <b>231</b> in embodiments EMB-<b>1</b>, EMB-<b>2</b> and EMB-<b>3</b>), unlike a DRAM cell where it is forever lost unless refreshed. Capacitor C is used solely to temporarily hold the pre-charge voltage on N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> at one of voltages V<sub>ss</sub>, V<sub>bl</sub>, V<sub>progr</sub>, V<sub>inhibit</sub>, or V<sub>erase</sub>; C is not used to store actual data for any of the non-volatile TFTs in the string. Pre-charge transistor <b>303</b>, controlled by word line <b>151</b> <i>n </i>(<b>208</b>-CHG) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>) is activated momentarily immediately preceding read, program, program-inhibit or erase operations to transfer through connections <b>270</b> the voltage V<sub>bl </sub>from the substrate circuitry (not shown) to capacitor C of sublayer <b>221</b>. For example, voltage V<sub>bl </sub>can be set at ˜0V to pre-charge N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> to a virtual ground voltage ˜0V during read, or to pre-charge both N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> to between ˜5V and ˜10V during program inhibit. The value of cumulative capacitors C may be increased by lengthening the active string to accommodate thousands more TFTs along each side of the string, correspondingly increasing the retention time of pre-charge voltage V<sub>ss </sub>on N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b>. However, a longer NOR string suffers from an increased resistance R as well as higher leakage current between N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b> and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b>; such leakage current may interfere with the sensed current when reading the one TFT being addressed with all other TFT's in their “off” (but somewhat leaky) state. To speed up the pre-charging of the capacitance C of a long active strip, several pre-charge TFTs <b>303</b> may be provided spaced apart along either side of the active strip (e.g., once every 128, 256 or more TFTs).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">Ultra-thin diffusion-blocking layer <b>521</b>-<i>d </i>enables a highly scaled channel length in non-volatile memory TFTs (“ultra-short channel TFTs”; e.g., the channel length L in TFT T<sub>R </sub> <b>585</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>f</i> </figref>) by reducing the thickness of the SAC1 material. For example, the highly scaled channel length may be 40 nanometers or less, while the thickness of the SAC1 material standing in place for P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>522</b> may be reduced to 20 nanometers or less. TFT channel scaling is enhanced by having extremely thin P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>522</b>, in the range of 3-10 nanometers, sufficient to support the TFT channel inversion layer but thin enough to be depleted through its entire depth under appropriate control gate voltage. A read operation for an ultra-short channel TFT requires P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>522</b> to be relatively heavily P<sup>− </sup>doped (e.g., between 1×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and 1×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>). A shorter channel length results in a higher read current at a lower drain voltage, thus reducing power dissipation for read operations. A highly scaled channel has the added benefit of a lesser total thickness in the active layers, thus making the easier to etch from the top active layer to the bottom active layer. Ultra-short channel TFTs also can be erased through a lateral-field-assisted charge-hopping and tunnel-erase mechanism, which is discussed below in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>

As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>, the addressed NOR string (e.g. NOR string <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>) can either share a sensing circuit among several NOR strings through a decoding circuitry in substrate <b>201</b>, or each NOR string may be directly connected to a dedicated sensing circuit, so that many other addressed NOR strings sharing the same plane can be sensed in parallel. Each addressed NOR string has its source line (i.e., N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b>) initially set at Vs, ˜0V. (To simplify this discussion, in the context of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, the N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> are referred to as source line <b>221</b> and bit line or drain line <b>223</b>, respectively). In an implementation using a hard-wired source connection, voltage V<sub>ss </sub>is supplied from substrate <b>201</b> to source line <b>221</b> through hard-wired connections <b>280</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>b </i> </figref>illustrates a typical read cycle for a NOR string with hard-wired source voltage V<sub>ss</sub>. Initially, all word lines are at 0V and the voltage on source line <b>221</b> is held at 0V through connections <b>280</b>. The voltage on bit line <b>223</b> is then raised to V<sub>bl</sub>˜0.5 V to 2V, supplied through connections <b>270</b> from the substrate, and is also the voltage at an input to a sense amplifier (V<sub>SA</sub>). After bit line <b>223</b> is raised to VIII, the selected word line (word line <b>151</b> <i>a</i>; labeled “WL-sel”) is ramped up (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>b </i> </figref>as incremental stepped voltages) while all other non-selected word lines (word line <b>151</b> <i>b</i>; labeled “WL-nsel”) remain in their “off” state (0V). When the voltage on the selected gate electrode exceeds the threshold voltage programmed into the selected TFT (e.g. transistor <b>152</b>-<b>1</b> on strip <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>) it begins conducting, and thus begins to discharge voltage V<sub>bl </sub>(event A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>b</i> </figref>) which is detected by the sense amplifier connected to addressed string <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">In embodiments EMB-<b>1</b>, EMB-<b>2</b> and EMB-<b>3</b> employing pre-charging of parasitic cumulative capacitance C (i.e., the total capacitance of all capacitors labeled <b>360</b> in each NOR string in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>) to a “virtual V<sub>ss</sub>” voltage, pre-charge TFT <b>303</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>b</i> </figref>) shares source line <b>221</b> and bit line or drain line <b>223</b> of the NOR string (pre-charge TFT <b>303</b> may have the same construction as the memory TFTs, but is not used as a memory transistor and may have a wider channel to provide a greater current during the pre-charge pulse) and has its drain line <b>223</b> connected through connections <b>270</b> to bit line voltage V<sub>bl </sub>in substrate <b>201</b>. In a typical pre-charge/read cycle (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>c</i> </figref>) V<sub>bl </sub>is initially set at 0V. Pre-charge word line <b>208</b>-CHG of TFT <b>303</b> is momentarily raised to around 3V to transfer V<sub>bl</sub>˜0V from bit line <b>223</b> to source line <b>221</b> to establish a “virtual V<sub>ss</sub>” voltage ˜0V on source line <b>221</b>. Following the pre-charge pulse, bit line <b>223</b> is set to around V<sub>bl</sub>˜2V through bit line connection <b>270</b>. The V<sub>bl </sub>voltage is also the voltage at the sense amplifier for the addressed NOR string. The one selected global word line and all its associated vertical local word lines <b>151</b> <i>a </i>(labeled “WL-sel”) (i.e. slice <b>114</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>2</b>) are ramped from 0V to typically 3V-4V (shown as stepped voltages in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>d</i> </figref>) or higher if a larger window of operation is desired between the erased and programmed V<sub>th </sub>voltages, while all other global word lines and their local word lines in the block are in their “off” state (0V). If the selected TFT is in an erased state (i.e., V<sub>th</sub>=V<sub>erase</sub>˜1 volt), bit line voltage V<sub>bl </sub>will begin to discharge toward source voltage V<sub>ss </sub>when its word line voltage rises above ˜1V. If the selected TFT has been programmed to V<sub>th</sub>˜2V, the bit line voltage will begin discharging only when its word line rises above ˜2V. A voltage dip in voltage V<sub>bl </sub>(event B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>c</i> </figref>) is detected at the sense amplifier when the charge stored on bit line <b>223</b> begins to discharge through the selected TFT towards voltage V<sub>ss </sub>on source line <b>221</b>. All non-selected word lines <b>151</b> <i>b </i>(labeled “WL-nsel”) in the NOR string are “off” at 0V, even though they may each contribute a sub-threshold leakage current between N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>223</b> and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>221</b>. Accordingly, it is important that the read operation follows closely the pre-charge pulse before this leakage current begins to seriously degrade the V<sub>ss </sub>charge on capacitors C of the NOR string. The pre-charge phase typically has a duration between 1 and 10 nanoseconds, depending on the magnitude of distributed capacitance C and distributed resistance R of N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b>, and the pre-charge current supplied through pre-charge TFTs <b>303</b>. The pre-charge can be sped up by augmenting the current through pre-charge TFTs <b>303</b> using some of the memory TFTs along the NOR string to serve temporarily as pre-charge transistors, although care must be taken to avoid driving their gate voltages high enough during the pre-charge pulse as to cause a disturb condition on their programmed threshold voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">All TFTs <b>152</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>152</b>-<b>3</b> within slice <b>114</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>2</b>) experience the same ramping voltage on their local word line <b>151</b> <i>a </i>(WL-sel), and therefore TFTs on different active strips on different planes can be read simultaneously (i.e., in parallel) during a single read operation, provided that the active strips on different active layers <b>202</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>202</b>-<b>7</b> are all pre-charged (either individually or at the same time) when the read operation begins from their respective substrate circuitry through their pre-charge TFTs <b>303</b>, and provided that the active strips on the different active layers have dedicated sense amplifiers connected through individual connections <b>270</b>. This slice-oriented read operation increases the read bandwidth by a factor corresponding to the number of planes in memory block <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">Multibit (MLC), Archival, and Analog Thin-Film Transistor Strings</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">In an embodiment where MLC is used (i.e., Multi-Level cell, in which more than one bit of information is stored in a TFT), the addressed TFT in a NOR string may be programmed to any of several threshold voltages (e.g., 1V (for an erased state), 2V, 3V or 4V, for the four states representing two bits of data). The addressed global word line and its local word lines can be raised in incremental voltage steps until conduction in the selected TFTs is detected by the respective sense amplifiers. Alternatively, a single word line voltage can be applied (e.g., ˜5V), and the rate of discharge of voltage V<sub>bl </sub>can be compared with the rate of discharge of each of several programmable reference voltages representative of the four voltage states of the two binary bits stored on the TFT. This approach can be extended to store eight states (for 3-bit MLC TFTs), sixteen states or a continuum of states, which effectively provides analog storage. The programmable reference voltages are stored on reference NOR strings, typically in the same block, preferably located in the same plane as the selected NOR string to best track manufacturing variations among active strips on different planes. For MLC applications, more than one programmable reference NOR string may be provided to detect each of the programmed states. For example, if 2-bit MLC is used, three reference NOR strings, one for each intermediate programmable threshold voltage (e.g. 1.5V, 2.5V, 3.5 V in the example above) may be used. Since there may be thousands of active strips on each plane in a block, the programmable reference NOR strings can be repeated, for example, with one set shared between every 8 or more NOR strings in a block.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">Alternatively, the reference NOR string can be programmed to a first threshold voltage (e.g., ˜1.5V that is slightly above the erased voltage of ˜1V), so that the additional ˜2.5V and ˜3.5 V reference programmed voltage levels can be achieved by pre-charging the virtual source voltage V<sub>ss </sub>(source line <b>221</b>) of the reference NOR string with a stepped or ramped voltage starting from ˜0V and raising it to ˜4V, while correspondingly increasing the voltage V<sub>bl </sub>on the reference NOR string bit line <b>223</b> to be ˜0.5 V higher than the V<sub>ss </sub>voltage. All the while the word line voltage applied to the reference TFT and the word line voltage applied to the memory TFT being read are the same, as they both are driven by the same global word line. This “on the fly” setting of the various reference voltages is made possible because each reference NOR string can be readily set to its individual gate-source voltage, independent of all other NOR strings in the block.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">The flexibility for setting the reference voltages on a reference NOR string by adjusting its V<sub>ss </sub>and V<sub>bl </sub>voltages, rather than by actually programming the reference TFT to one or another of the distinct threshold voltages, enables storing of a continuum of voltages, providing analog storage on each storage TFT of a NOR string. As an example, during programming, the reference NOR string can be set to a target threshold voltage of 2.2V, when programming the storage TFT to ˜2.2 V. Then during reading the reference string's voltages V<sub>ss </sub>and V<sub>bl </sub>are ramped in a sweep starting at ˜0V and ending at ˜4V, with the word lines for both the reference TFT and the storage TFT at ˜4V. So long as the ramping reference voltage is below 2.2V, the signal from the reference TFT is stronger than that of the programmed memory TFT. When the reference TFT has ramped past 2.2V, the signal from the reference TFT becomes weaker than the signal from the storage TFT, resulting in the flipping of the output signal polarity from the differential sense amplifier, indicating 2.2V as the stored value of the programmed TFT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">The NOR strings of the present invention can be employed for archival storage for data that changes rarely. Archival storage requires the lowest cost-per-bit possible, therefore selected archival blocks of the NOR string of the current invention can be programmed to store, for example, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 or more bits per TFT. For example, storing 4 bits per TFT requires 16 programmed voltages between ˜0.5V and ˜4V. The corresponding TFT in the reference NOR string can be programmed at ˜0.5V, while programming the storage TFT to the target threshold. During a read operation, the reference string's source and drain voltages V<sub>ss </sub>and V<sub>bl </sub>are stepped up in ˜0.25V increments until the output polarity of the sense amplifier flips, which occurs when the signal from the reference NOR string becomes weaker than the signal from the storage or programmed TFT. Strong ECC at the system controller can correct any of the intermediate programmed states that have drifted during long storage or after extensive number of reads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">When the NOR strings in a block suffer from excessive source to drain leakage even when all TFTs of the NOR string are turned off, such leakage can be substantially neutralized by designation leakage reference strings in which the leakage current of the reference string is modulated by adjusting the voltages on its shared source V<sub>ss </sub>and shared drain V<sub>bl </sub>until its leakage substantially matches the leakage currents of the non-reference NOR strings in the same block.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">Revolving Reference Nor String Address Locations to Extend Cycle Endurance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">In applications requiring a large number of write/erase operations, the threshold-voltage window of operation for the TFTs in the NOR strings may drift with cycling, away from the threshold-voltage window that is programmed into the TFTs of the reference NOR strings at the device's beginning of life. The growing discrepancy between TFTs on the reference NOR strings and TFTs on the addressed memory NOR strings over time, if left unattended, can defeat the purpose of having reference NOR strings. To overcome this drift, reference NOR strings in a block need not always be at the same physical address, and need not be permanently programmed for the entire life of the device. Since the programmable reference NOR strings are practically identical to the memory NOR strings sharing the same plane in a block, reference NOR strings need not be dedicated for that purpose in any memory array block. In fact, any one of the memory NOR strings can be set aside as a programmable reference NOR string. In fact, the physical address locations of the programmable reference NOR strings can be rotated periodically (e.g. changed once every 100 times the block is erased) among the sea of memory NOR strings, so as to level out the performance degradation of memory NOR strings and reference NOR strings as a result of extensive program/erase cycles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">According to the current invention, any NOR string can be rotated periodically to be designated as a programmable reference NOR string, and its address location may be stored inside or outside the addressed block. The stored address may be retrieved by the system controller when reading the NOR string. Under this scheme, rotation of reference NOR strings can be done either randomly (e.g., using a random number generator to designate new addresses), or systematically among any of the active memory NOR strings. Programming of newly designated reference NOR strings can be done as part of the erase sequence when all TFTs on a slice or a block are erased together, to be followed by setting anew the reference voltages on the newly designated set of reference NOR strings. In this manner, all active memory NOR strings and all reference NOR strings in a block drift statistically more or less in tandem through extensive cycling.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">In some embodiments of the present invention, a block may be partitioned into four equal-size quadrants, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>a</i> </figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>a </i> </figref>show semiconductor structure <b>600</b>, which is a three-dimensional representation of a memory array organized into quadrants Q<b>1</b>-Q<b>4</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>b</i> </figref>, programmable reference NOR strings <b>112</b> Ref may be provided in each quadrant to provide reference voltages for the memory NOR strings on the same plane in the same quadrant, in the manner already discussed above. Alternatively, programmable reference slices (e.g., reference slice <b>114</b> Ref) are provided on mirror-image quadrants for corresponding memory slices. For example, when reading a memory slice in quadrant Q<b>1</b>, programmed reference slice <b>114</b> Ref (area B) in quadrant Q<b>3</b> is simultaneously presented to sense amplifiers <b>206</b> that are shared between quadrants Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>3</b>. Similarly, when reading a memory slice in quadrant Q<b>3</b>, reference slice <b>114</b> Ref (area A) of quadrant Q<b>1</b> is presented to the shared sense amplifiers <b>206</b>. There can be more than one reference slice distributed along the length of NOR strings <b>112</b> to partially accommodate mismatched in RC delay between the slice being read and its reference slice. Alternatively, the system controller can calculate and apply a time delay between the global word line of the addressed slice and that of the reference slice, based on their respective physical locations along their respective NOR strings. Where the number of planes is a high number (e.g. 8 or more planes), one or more planes can be added at the top of the block to serve either as a redundant plane (i.e., to substitute for any defective plane) in the quadrant, or as programmable reference pages, providing reference threshold voltages for the addressed pages sharing the same global word line conductor <b>208</b> <i>g</i>-<i>a</i>. The sense amplifier at the end of each NOR string receives the read signal from the addressed page at the same time as it receives the signal from the reference page at the top of the block, since both pages are activated by the same global word line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">In one embodiment, each memory block consists of two halves, e.g., quadrants Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> constitute an “upper half” and quadrants Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> constitute a “lower half.” In this example, each quadrant has 16 planes, 4096 (4K) NOR strings in each plane, and 1024 (1K) TFTs in each NOR string. It is customary to use the unit “K” which is 1024. Adjacent quadrants Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> share 1K global word lines (e.g., global word line <b>208</b> <i>g</i>-<i>a</i>) driving <b>2048</b> (2K) local word lines <b>208</b>W per quadrant (i.e., one local word line for each pair of TFTs from two adjacent NOR strings). 4K TFTs from quadrant Q<b>1</b> and 4K TFTs from quadrant Q<b>2</b> form an 8K-bit page of TFTs. 16 pages form a 128K-bit slice, and 1K slices are provided in a half-block, thus providing 256 Mbits of total storage per block. (Here, 1 Mbits is 1K×1 Kbits.) The 4K strings in each plane of quadrants Q<b>2</b> and Q<b>4</b> share substrate circuitry <b>206</b>, including voltage sources for voltage V<sub>bl </sub>and sense amplifiers (SA). Also included in each quadrant are redundant NOR strings that are used as spares to replace faulty NOR strings, as well to store quadrant parameters such as program/erase cycle count, quadrant defect map and quadrant ECC. Such system data are accessible to a system controller. For blocks with high plane counts, it may be desirable to add one or more planes to each block as spares for replacing a defective plane.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">High capacity storage systems based on arrays of the NOR strings of the present invention require a dedicated intelligent high-speed system controller to manage the full potential for error-free massively parallel erase, program and program-inhibit, and read operations that may span thousands of “chips” including millions of memory blocks. To achieve the requisite high speed, off-chip system controllers typically rely on state machines or dedicated logic functions implemented in the memory circuits. As well, each memory circuit stores system parameters and information related to the files stored in the memory circuit. Such system information is typically accessible to the system controller, but not accessible by the user. It is advantageous for the system controller to quickly read the memory circuit-related information. For a binary memory system in which 1 bit is stored per TFT (e.g., in the block organization of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>a</i> </figref>), the storage capacity in each block accessible to the user is given by 4 quadrants×16 planes per block×4K NOR strings per plane per quadrant×1K TFTs per NOR string, which equals 256M bits.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">Since silicon real estate on an integrated circuit is costly, rather than adding reference strings or reference pages to each plane, it may be advantageous to have some or all reference strings or reference pages provided in one or more additional planes. The additional plane or planes consume minimal additional silicon real-estate and the reference plane has the advantage that the addressed global word line <b>208</b> <i>g</i>-<i>a </i>accesses a reference page at the same time it accesses an addressed page on any of the planes at the same address location along the active strings in the same quadrant. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>b</i> </figref>, reference string <b>112</b> Ref, which is shown as dashed line in quadrant Q<b>2</b>, resides in reference plane <b>110</b> Ref in this example.

Although reference plane <b>110</b> Ref is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>b </i> </figref>as being provided in the top plane, any plane in the quadrant can be designated a reference plane. In fact, it is not be necessary for every NOR string on the reference plane to be a reference string: e.g., every one in eight NOR strings can be designated as a reference NOR string that is shared by eight NOR strings in other planes. The remainder of NOR strings in the reference plane may serve as spare strings to substitute for defective strings on the other planes in the block.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">A very large storage system of 1 petabyte (8×10<sup>15 </sup>bits) requires 8,000 1-terabit memory circuits (“chips”), involving 32M blocks or 64 G slices. (1 Gbits is 1K×1 Mbits). This is a large amount of data to be written (i.e. programmed) or read. Therefore, it is advantageous to be able to program and read in parallel a great many blocks, slices or pages on numerous chips at once, and to do so with minimum power dissipation at the system level. It is also advantageous for a terabit capacity memory chip to have many input/output channels such that requested data can be streamed in and out in parallel from and to a large number of blocks. The time required to track down the physical location of the most current version of any given stored file or data set would require a significant amount of time for the system controller to maintain, such as the translation the logical address into the most current physical addresses. The translation between logical to physical addresses would require, for example, a large centralized look-up FAT (file allocation table) to access the right slice in the right block on the right chip. Such a search could add considerable read latency (e.g., in the range of 50-100 microseconds) which would defeat a fast read access goal (e.g., under 100 nanoseconds). Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention significantly reduces the search time by introducing a system-wide parallel on-chip rapid file searches, so as to dramatically reduce the latency associated with a centralized large FAT, as described below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">The cache storage may be used to store on-chip resource management data, such as file management data. A file can be identified, for example, as “hot file” (i.e., associated with a large number of accesses, or a “high cycle count”), “cold file” (i.e., has not been altered for a long time, and is ready to be moved to slower storage or archival memory at a future time), “delete file” (i.e., ready for future erase in background mode), “defective file” (i.e., to be skipped over), or “substitute file” (i.e., replacing a defective file). Also included in the identifier may be a time stamp representing the last time and date the file associated with the identifier was written into the quadrant. Such unique identifier, typically between 32-bit and 128-bit long can be written into one or more of the cache slices as part of the writing of the file itself into the other memory slices in the same half-block. Files are written sequentially into available erased space, and the identifiers can be assigned by incrementing the previous unique identifier by one for each new file written into memory. If desired, new files can be written into partial slices and the unwritten part of the slice can be used for writing part or whole of the next file, to avoid wasting storage space. Writing sequentially until the entire memory space of the system is used helps level out the wear-out of TFTs throughout the system. Other on-chip resource management data may include chip, block, plane, slice, page and string parameters, address locations of faulty strings and their replacement strings, defective pages, defective planes, defective slices and defective blocks and their substitute replacements, file identifiers for all files resident in the block, look up tables and link lists for skipping over unusable memory, block-erase cycle counts, optimum voltages and pulse shape and durations for erase, program, program-inhibit, program scrub, read, margin read, read refresh, read scrub operations, error correcting codes, and data recovery modes, and other system parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">Because of the modularity of each chip at the block level and the low power operation attendant to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling for program and erase, it is possible to design the chip to execute simultaneously erase of some blocks, programming at some other blocks, and reading one or more of remaining blocks. The system controller can use that parallelism of operations at the block level to work in background mode; for example, the system controller may delete (i.e. erase, so as to free up space) some blocks or entire chips, de-fragment fragmented files into consolidated files, move files, blocks or chips that have been inactive for longer than a predetermined time to slower or archival storage, or to chips that group together files with close dates and time stamps, while rewriting the original file identifier with the latest time stamp into cache storage <b>116</b> of the next available physical block.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">To facilitate high-speed searches for the location of the most current version of any one file out of the many millions such files in a petabyte storage system, it is important that the unique identifier for each file, wherever it has been physically relocated to, be accessed quickly by the system controller. According to one embodiment of the present invention, a system controller broadcasts the unique identifier (i.e., the 32-128 bits word) for the file being searched simultaneously to some or all the chips in the system. Each chip is provided with a buffer memory to temporarily store that identifier and, using on-chip Exclusive-Or (XOR) circuits, compare the identifier in the buffer memory with all the identifiers stored on cache <b>116</b> of each block and report to the system controller when a match has been found, together with the location where the corresponding file is located. If more than one match is found, the system controller picks the identifier with the most recent time-stamp. The search can be narrowed to just a few chips if the file being searched has been written within a known time period. For a 1-terabit chip, just one 128-Kbit slice or 16×8 Kb pages would be sufficient to store all the 64-bit identifiers for all 2K slices of each block.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">TFT Pairs for Fast Read Cache Memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">To reduce read latency for cache storage <b>116</b>, TFTs in NOR strings that are physically nearest to sense amplifiers <b>206</b> can be arranged in pairs. For example, in adjacent NOR strings, two TFTs related by a common local word line may be shared to store a single data bit between them. For example, in embodiment EMB-<b>3</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>k</i> </figref>), plane <b>202</b>-<b>7</b> includes a pair of TFTs from adjacent active strips share local word lines <b>208</b>-W (e.g., TFT <b>281</b> on one NOR string can serve as a reference TFT for TFT <b>283</b>, or vice versa). In a typical programming operation, TFTs on both NOR strings are initialized to the erased state, then one of the TFTs, say TFT <b>281</b>, is programmed to a higher threshold voltage, while TFT <b>283</b> is program-inhibited, so as to remain in the erased state. Both TFTs on the two adjacent active strips are read simultaneously by a differential sense amplifier in substrate circuitry when their shared local word line <b>208</b>W is raised to the read voltage, the first TFT that start to conduct tips the sense amplifier into state ‘0’ or state ‘1’, depending on whether TFT <b>281</b> or TFT <b>283</b> is the programmed TFT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">This TFT-pair scheme has the advantage of high-speed sensing and higher endurance because TFTs of two adjacent NOR strings are almost perfectly matched, so that at the sense amplifier even a small programmed voltage differential between the two TFTs being read will suffice to correctly trip the sense amplifier. In addition, as the threshold voltage of a programmable reference TFT may drift over many write/erase cycle during the life of the device, under this scheme the reference TFT and the read TFT are both reset with each new cycle. In fact, either one of the two TFTs in the pair can serve as the reference TFT. If the two TFTs making the pair are randomly scrambled to invert or not invert the data written in each cycle, to ensure that statistically each TFT in each pair serves as the reference TFT for approximately the same number of cycles as the other TFT. (The invert/not invert code can be stored in the same page as the page being programmed, to assist in the descrambling during a read operation). Because the paired TFTs are in close proximity to each other, i.e., on two adjacent active strips on the same plane, the TFTs can best track each other for local variations in the manufacturing process or to best neutralize (i.e. cancel out) the strip leakage during a read operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">Alternatively, the TFT pairing scheme may be applied to TFTs on different planes where the pair shares a common vertical local word line. The one drawback of this scheme is that it cuts the silicon efficiency by nearly 50%, as the two TFTs are required to store one bit between them. For this reason, each block can be organized such that only a small percentage (e.g. 1% to 10%) of the block is used as high-speed dual TFT pairs, while the rest of the block is operated as regular NOR strings and programmable reference TFT strings. The actual percentage set aside for the TFT-pair scheme can be altered on the fly by the system controller, depending on the specific usage application. The high level of flexibility for operating the NOR strings of the present invention result from the fact that the TFTs in a NOR string are randomly addressable and operate independently of each other, or of TFTs in other NOR strings, unlike conventional NAND strings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">Numerous applications of data storage, such as video or high resolution imaging require data files that occupy many pages or even many slices. Such files can be accessed rapidly in a pipelined fashion, i.e., the system controller stores the first page or first slice of the file in the cache memory while storing the remaining pages or slices of the file in a low-cost memory and streaming out the data in a pipeline sequence. The pages or slices may thus be linked into a continuous stream, such that the first page of the file is read quickly into the sense amplifiers and transferred to a data buffer shift register to clock the first page out of the block while pre-charging and reading the next, slower page in a pipeline sequence, thereby hiding the read access time of each page following the first page. For example, if the first page of 8 Kbits stored in the cache memory is read in 10 nanoseconds and then clocked out at 1 Gbit per second, the entire 8K bits would take approximately 1 microsecond to complete clocking out, which is more than sufficient time for the second page to be read from the slower, lower-cost pages. The flexibility afforded by pre-charging randomly selected TFT strings makes it possible for one or more data files from one or more blocks to be read concurrently, with their data streams routed on-chip to one or more data input/output ports.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">Random Access Reads</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">The pre-charging scheme of the current invention allows data to be programmed to be serially clocked into, or randomly accessed, and likewise read out serially in a stream or randomly accessed by words. For example, an addressed page in one plane can be read in one or more operations into the sense amplifiers, registers or latches of the addressed plane, after which it can be randomly accessed in 32-bit, 64-bit or 128-bit words, one word at a time, for routing to the input/output pads of the chip. In this manner, the delay attendant to streaming the entire page sequentially is avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">In all embodiments, for example <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>h</i> </figref>, only TFTs on one of the two sides of an active strip can participate in any one read operation; every TFT on the other side of an active strip must be set to the “off” state. For example, if TFT <b>285</b> is being read then TFT <b>283</b> on the same active strip must be shut off. Other schemes to read the correct state of a multi-state TFT are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">Reading TFTs of the present invention is much faster than reading conventional NAND flash memory cells because, in a NOR string, only the TFT to be read is required to be “on”, as compared to a NAND string, in which all the TFTs in series with the one TFT being read must also be “on”. In embodiments in which metallic sublayer <b>224</b> is not provided as integral part of the active layer (see, e.g., memory structure <b>220</b> <i>a </i>of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>b</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>), for a string with 1,024 non-volatile TFTs on each side, a typical line resistance for each active strip is ˜500,000 Ohm and a typical capacitance of the active strip (e.g., capacitor <b>360</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>) is ˜5 femtofarads, to provide an RC time delay in the order of under 10 nanosecond. The time delay may be significantly reduced if metallic sublayer <b>224</b> is provided to reduce the line resistance of the active strip. To further reduce read latency, some or all the planes in selected memory blocks may be kept pre-charged to their read voltages V<sub>ss </sub>(source line) and V<sub>bl </sub>(bit line), thereby rendering them ready to immediately sense the addressed TFT (i.e., eliminating the time required for pre-charge immediately before the read operation). Such ready-standby requires very little standby power because the current required to periodically re-charge capacitor <b>360</b> to compensate for charge leakage is very small. Within each block, all NOR strings on all eight or more planes can be pre-charged to be ready for fast read; for example, after reading TFTs in NOR strings of plane <b>207</b>-<b>0</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>a</i> </figref>), TFTs in NOR strings of plane <b>207</b>-<b>1</b> can be read in short order because its source and bit line voltages V<sub>ss </sub>and V<sub>bl </sub>are already previously set for a read operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">In memory block <b>100</b>, only one TFT per NOR string can be read in a single operation. In a plane with eight thousand side by side NOR strings, the eight thousand TFTs that share a common global word line may all be read concurrently, provided that each NOR string is connected to its own sense amplifier <b>206</b> in substrate <b>201</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>c</i> </figref>). If each sense amplifier is shared among, for example, four NOR strings in the same plane using a string decode circuit, then four read operations are required to take place in four successive steps, with each read operation involving two thousand TFTs. Each plane can be provided its own set of dedicated sense amplifiers or, alternatively one set of sense amplifiers can be shared among NOR strings in the eight or more planes through a plane-decoding selector. Additionally, one or more sets of sense amplifiers can be shared between NOR strings in quadrants and their mirror image quadrants (see, e.g., sense amplifiers (SA) <b>206</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6<i>a</i>, 6<i>b</i>, and 6<i>c</i> </figref>). Providing separate sense amplifiers for each plane allows concurrent read operations of NOR strings of all planes, which correspondingly improves the read operation throughput. However, such higher data throughput comes at the expense of greater power dissipation and the extra chip area needed for the additional sense amplifiers (unless they can be laid out in substrate <b>201</b> underneath block <b>100</b>). In practice, just one set of sense amplifiers per stack of NOR strings may suffice because of the pipeline clocking or data in and out of the memory block, so that while a first page in one plane is being transferred out of its sense amplifiers to a high speed shift register, the first page of the second plane is being read into the second set of sense amplifiers, with the two sets sharing one set of input/output shift registers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">Parallel operations may also create excessive electrical noise through ground voltage bounces when too many TFTs are read all at once. This ground bounce is substantially suppressed in all embodiments that rely on pre-charging capacitor <b>360</b> to set and temporarily hold the virtual V<sub>ss </sub>voltage for each active strip. In this case, source voltage V<sub>ss </sub>of all NOR strings is not connected to the chip's V<sub>ss </sub>ground line, allowing any number of active strips to be sensed simultaneously without drawing charge from the chip ground supply</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">Program (Write) and Program-Inhibit Operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">There are several methods to program an addressed TFT in a NOR string to its intended threshold voltage. The most common method, employed by the industry for the past 40 years, is by channel hot-electron injection. The other commonly used method is by tunneling, whether direct tunneling or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. Either one of these tunneling and charge-trapping mechanisms is highly efficient, so that very little current is needed to program a TFT in a NOR string, allowing parallel programming of hundreds of thousands of such TFTs with minimal power dissipation. For illustration purpose, let us assume that programming by tunneling requires a 20V pulse of 100 microseconds (us) duration to be applied to the addressed word line (control gate), with 0V applied to the active strip (e.g., an active strip formed out of active layer <b>202</b>-<b>0</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>a</i> </figref>). Under these conditions, N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>b</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>), serving respectively as source and drain regions, are both set at 0V. P<sup>− </sup>channel sublayer <b>222</b> of the TFT is inverted at the surface, so that electrons tunnel into the corresponding charge-trapping layer. TFT Programming can be inhibited by applying a half-select voltage (e.g., 10V in this example) between the local word line and the source and drain regions. Program-inhibit can be accomplished, for example, either by lowering the word line voltage to 10V, while keeping the strip voltage at 0 volt, or by raising to 10V the active strip voltage, while keeping the word line voltage at 20V, or some combination of the two.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">Only one TFT in one addressed active strip can be programmed at one time, but TFTs on other active strips can be programmed concurrently during the same programming cycle. When programming one of the many TFTs on one side edge of an addressed active strip (e.g., one TFT in the even-addressed NOR string), all other TFTs in the NOR string are program-inhibited, as are all TFTs on the other side edge of the active strip (e.g., all TFTs in the odd-addressed NOR string).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">Once the addressed TFT is programmed to the target threshold voltage of its designated state, program-inhibition of that TFT is required, as overshooting that target voltage will exert unnecessary stress on the TFT. When MLC is used, overshooting the target voltage may cause overstepping or merging with the threshold voltage of the next higher target threshold voltage state, and the TFT that has reached its intended threshold voltage must therefore be program-inhibited. It should be noted that all TFTs in the adjacent active strips on the same plane that share the same global word line and its associated local word lines are exposed to the 20V programming voltage—and are required to be program-inhibited once they have been programmed to their target threshold voltages. Also, TFTs that are in the erased state and that are to remain erased need to be program-inhibited. Similarly, all TFTs on other planes that are within the same block and that share the same global word line and its associated local word lines (i.e. all TFTs in a slice <b>114</b>)—and thus, are also exposed to the 20V programming voltage—are also required to be program-inhibited. These program and program-inhibit conditions can all be met for the memory blocks of the present invention because the even and odd sides of each active strip are controlled by different global word lines and their associated local word lines, and because the voltages on the shared source and bit lines of each active strip regardless of its plane can be set independently from all other active strips on the same plane or on other planes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">In one example of a programming sequence, all TFTs in a block are first erased to a threshold voltage of around 1V. The voltage on the active strip of each addressed TFT is then set to 0V (e.g., through connections <b>270</b> in conjunction with pre-charge word line <b>208</b>-CHG, or through hard-wire connections <b>280</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>), if the addressed TFT is to be programmed; otherwise, the voltage on the shared source line of the active strip of the addressed TFT is set to ˜10V if it is to remain in its erased state (i.e., program-inhibited). The global word line associated with the addressed TFT is then raised to ˜20V, either in one step or in short-duration steps of incrementally increasing voltages, starting at around 14V. Such incremental voltage steps reduce the electrical stress across the charge-trapping layer of the TFT and avoid overshooting the target programmed threshold voltage. All other global word lines in the block are set at half-select 10V. All active strips on all planes that are not being addressed in the memory block, as well as all active strips within the addressed plane that are not individually addressed, are also set at 10V, where they may be floated by ensuring that their access transistors (not shown) to substrate circuitry <b>206</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>206</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>c </i> </figref>are off. Of importance, if any of the active strips on all planes that are not being addressed in the memory block, as well as all active strips within the addressed plane that are not individually addressed, are floated with their voltage set at ˜0V, i.e. not in program-inhibit mode, they may be erroneously programmed. These active strips are strongly capacity-coupled to their local word lines, which are at 10V, and thus float at close to 10V. Each of the incrementally higher voltage programming pulses is followed by a read cycle to determine if the addressed TFT has reached its target threshold voltage. When the target threshold voltage is reached, the active strip voltage is raised to ˜10V (alternatively the strip is floated, and rises close to 10V when all but the one addressed global word lines in the block are raised to 10V) to inhibit further programming, while the global word line continues to program other addressed strips on the same plane that have not yet attained their target threshold voltages. This program/read-verify sequence terminates when all addressed TFTs have been read-verified to be correctly programmed. All blocks on a chip that are dormant, i.e. they are not frequently accessed, should preferably be powered down, for example by setting the voltage on their active strips and conductors at ground potential.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">When MLC is used, programming of the correct one of the multiple threshold voltage states can be accelerated by parallel programming of all target voltage states in parallel. First, capacitors <b>360</b> of all addressed active strips (see, e.g., through connections <b>270</b> and pre-charge word lines <b>208</b>-CHG of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>) are pre-charged to one of several voltages (e.g., 0, 1.5, 3.0, or 4.5V, if two bits of information are to be stored in each TFT). A ˜20V pulse is then applied to the addressed global word line, which expose the charge-trapping layers of the TFTs to different effective tunneling voltages (i.e., 20, 18.5, 17, or 15.5V, respectively), resulting in the correct one of the four threshold voltages being programmed in a single coarse programming step. Thereafter, fine programming pulses may be applied at the individual TFT level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">Because of the intrinsic parasitic capacitance C of every active strip in the block, all active strips on all planes in a block can have their pre-charge voltage states set in place (either in parallel or sequentially) in advance of applying the high voltage pulsing on the addressed global word line. Consequently, concurrent programming of a great many TFTs can be achieved. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>2</b>, all TFTs in one page <b>113</b>, or all pages in one slice <b>114</b> can be course-programmed in one high voltage pulsing sequence. Thereafter, individual read-verify, and where necessary, resetting properly programmed active strips into program-inhibit mode can be carried out. Pre-charging is advantageous, as programming time is relatively long (e.g., around 100 microsecond) while pre-charging all capacitors <b>360</b> or read-verifying of addressed TFTs can be carried out over a time period that is around 100 nanoseconds, or 1,000 times faster. Thus, it is advantageous to program a large number of TFTs in a single global word line programming sequence, and this is made possible because the programming mechanisms of direct tunneling or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling require only a small current per TFT being programmed. The programming typically requires trapping a hundred or less electrons in the charge-trapping material to shift. The TFT threshold by one or more volts, and these electrons can readily be supplied from the reservoir of electrons pre-charged onto the parasitic capacitor of the active string, provided that the string has sufficient number of TFTs contributing to parasitic capacitance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">It is important to note that, because of the poor efficiency of programming TFTs with the conventional channel hot-electron injection mechanism—requiring several orders of magnitude more electrons, as compared to programming by tunneling—to adequately shift the threshold voltage of one TFT, channel hot-electron injection is not suitable for use with embodiments relying on pre-charging multiple active strips. Instead, channel hot-electron injection programming requires hard-wired connections to the addressed source and drain regions during programming, thus severely limiting the ability to perform parallel programming</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">Erase Operations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">With some charge-trapping layers, erase is accomplished through either reverse-tunneling of the trapped electron charge or tunneling of holes to electrically neutralize the trapped electrons. Erase is slower than programming and may require tens of milliseconds of erase pulsing. Therefore, the erase operation is frequently implemented at the block, or at the multiple blocks level, often in a background mode. The blocks to be erased are tagged to be pre-charged to their predetermined erase voltages, followed by concurrently erasing all the tagged blocks and discontinuing erase of those blocks that have been verified to be properly erased, while continuing to erase the other tagged blocks. Typically, block erase can be carried out by applying ˜20V to the P-sublayer <b>222</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>b</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>) of every active strip through connection through pillars <b>290</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3<i>a</i> </figref>-<b>1</b>, <b>4</b> <i>d</i>, <b>2</b> <i>k</i>-<b>1</b>), while holding all global word lines in the block at 0V. However, since pillars <b>290</b> cannot be employed in embodiments where metallic sublayers <b>224</b> are used, as they provide a path for excessive leakage between different planes, one alternative method to erase all TFTs in the block in the absence of substrate contact to P<sup>− </sup>channels <b>222</b> is by doping the P<sup>− </sup>sublayers <b>222</b> to the relatively high range of 1×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 1×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>so as to increase the N<sup>+</sup>P<sup>−</sup> reverse bias conduction characteristics. Then, when N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b> of all active strips that are to be erased are raised to ˜20V (through substrate connection <b>206</b>-<b>0</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2<i>c</i> </figref>), reverse junction leakage brings the voltage on P<sup>− </sup>sublayers <b>222</b> (channel region) to close to 20V, initiating tunnel erase by ejecting electrons trapped in the charge-trapping layer into the P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>222</b> for all TFTs with local word lines held at ˜0V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">Partial block erase is also possible. For example, if only TFTs on one or more selected slices <b>114</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>b</i> </figref>) are to be erased, pillars <b>290</b> that typically are shared by all active strips in block <b>100</b> are connected to the substrate circuitry (e.g., substrate circuitry <b>262</b>-<b>0</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>b</i> </figref>) to supply the high erase voltage V<sub>erase </sub>to the P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>222</b> (channels) of all TFTs in the block. The global word lines of all slices in the block other than the slices selected for erase are held at half-erase voltage ˜10V or they are floated. The one or more slices to be erased have their global word line brought to ˜0V for the duration of the erase pulse. This scheme requires that strip-select decoders employ high voltage transistors that can withstand erase voltage V<sub>erase</sub>˜20 volts at their junctions. Alternatively, all but the addressed global word line are held at zero volts, while pulsing the addressed global word line to ˜20V supplied from the substrate and charging all active strips in planes <b>202</b>-<b>0</b> through <b>202</b>-<b>7</b> to 0V. This method allows partial-block erase of one or more Z-X slices <b>114</b> of all TFTs sharing the addressed global word lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">Other schemes are possible for partial block erase. For example, if one or more selected Z-X slices is to be erased while all others are to be erase-inhibited; all global word lines in the block are first held at 0V, while all strings in the block are charged from the substrate to the half-select voltage ˜10V and then are left isolated (floated) by switching off their access select transistors (not shown) in substrate <b>270</b>. Then, all global word lines in the block are raised to ˜10V, thereby boosting the voltage on all active strings to ˜20V by capacitive coupling. Then, the global word lines of the one or more Z-X slices to be erased are brought to 0V while the remaining global word lines continue to be held at 10V for the duration of the erase pulse. Note that, to select active strips for partial block erase, their access transistors in substrate <b>270</b> may need to be high-voltage transistors, able to hold the ˜20V of charge on the active strip for a duration in excess of the time required for the program or erase operation. The magnitude and duration of erase pulses should be such that most TFTs are erased to a slight enhancement mode threshold voltage, between zero and one volts. Some TFTs may overshoot and be erased into depletion mode (i.e., having a slightly negative threshold voltage). Such TFTs are required to be soft-programmed into a slight enhancement mode threshold voltage subsequent to the termination of the erase pulses, as part of the erase sequence.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the charge-trapping layer <b>531</b> consists of tunnel dielectric sublayer <b>531</b>-T, Charge-trapping sublayer <b>531</b>-CT (e.g., silicon-rich silicon nitride), and blocking dielectric sublayer <b>531</b>-B. Because of its very short channel length, the overlying channel (i.e., P-sublayer <b>522</b>) becomes strongly influenced by fringing electric fields (indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by dashed ellipsoids <b>574</b>) between local word line <b>208</b>W and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>521</b> (the source region) and N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>523</b> (the drain region).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0222">During erase, electrons (indicated by dashed line <b>575</b>) that are trapped in charge-trapping sublayer <b>531</b>-CT are removed by tunneling, as indicated by arrows <b>573</b> and <b>576</b>, to the source region (N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>521</b>) and the drain region (N<sup>+</sup> sublayer <b>523</b>), respectively, which are both held at a high erase voltage V<sub>erase </sub>˜20V. In some circumstances, voltage V<sub>erase </sub>on P-channel <b>522</b> may be lower than ˜20V, particularly if P<sup>− </sup>pillars <b>290</b> are not provided, or are unable to supply the full ˜20V from the substrate, so that tunnel-erase of electrons trapped close to the P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>522</b> may be less effective. However, fringing fields <b>574</b> assist in lateral migration (i.e., sideways, as indicated by arrows <b>577</b>) of electrons in the silicon-rich silicon nitride of charge-trapping sublayer <b>531</b>-CT. This lateral migration is often referred to as hopping or Frankel-Poole conduction, resulting from electrons being attracted to the ˜20V on the nearby source and drain regions. Once electrons have migrated sufficiently close to the source and drain regions, the electrons can tunnel out of charge-trapping sublayer <b>531</b>-CT, as indicated by arrow <b>578</b>. This fringing field-assisted erase mechanism becomes increasingly more effective with shorter channel length (e.g., in the range of 5 nanometers to 40 nanometers), provided the source-drain leakage is tolerable for the short channel. For highly-scaled channel length, the source-drain leakage is suppressed by making the P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>522</b> as thin as possible (e.g., in the range of 8 to 80 nanometers thick), so that it is readily depleted all the way through its thickness, when the transistor is in its “off” state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0223">Quasi-Volatile Random Access TFT Memory Strings in Three Dimensional Arrays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0224">The charge-trapping material (e.g., an ONO stack) described above has a long data retention time (typically measured in many years), but low endurance. Endurance is a measure of a storage transistor's performance degradation after some number of write-erase cycles. Endurance of less than around 10,000 cycles is considered too low for some storage applications requiring frequent data rewrites. However, the NOR strings of embodiments EMB-<b>1</b>, EMB-<b>2</b>, and EMB-<b>3</b> of the present invention may be provided a charge-trapping material that substantially reduces retention times, but significantly increases endurance (e.g., reducing retention time from many years to minutes or hours, while increasing endurance from ten thousand to tens of millions of write/erase cycles). For example, in an ONO film or a similar combination of charge-trapping layers, the tunnel dielectric layer, typically 5-10 nm of silicon oxide, can be thinned to 3 nanometers or less, replaced altogether by another dielectric (e.g., silicon nitride or SiN) or no be simply eliminated. Similarly, the charge-trapping material layer may be a more silicon-rich silicon nitride (e.g., Si<sub>1.0</sub>N<sub>1.1</sub>), which is more silicon-rich than conventional Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Under a modest positive control gate programming voltage, electrons may directly tunnel through the thinner tunnel dielectric layer into the silicon nitride charge-trapping material layer (as distinct from Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, which typically requires higher voltages to program). The electrons may be temporarily trapped in the silicon nitride charge-trapping layer for a few minutes, a few hours, or a few days. The charge-trapping silicon nitride layer and the blocking layer (e.g., silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, or other high-K dielectrics) keep electrons from escaping to the control gate (i.e., word line). However, the trapped electrons will eventually leak back out to N<sup>+</sup> sublayers <b>221</b> and <b>223</b>, and P<sup>− </sup>sublayer <b>222</b> of the active strip, as the electrons are negatively charged and repel each other. Even if the 3 nm or less tunnel dielectric layer breaks down locally after extended cycling, the trapped electrons are slow to depart from their traps in the charge-trapping material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0225">Other combinations of charge storage materials may also result in a high endurance but lesser retention (“semi-volatile” or “quasi-volatile”) TFT. Such a TFT may require periodic write refresh or read refresh to replenish the lost charge. Because the TFTs of embodiments EMB-<b>1</b>, EMB-<b>2</b> and EMB-<b>3</b> provide DRAM-like fast read access time with low latency, by including any of the high endurance charge-trapping layers in the TFTs, NOR string arrays having such TFTs may be used in some applications that currently require DRAMs. The advantages of such NOR string arrays over DRAM include: a much lower cost-per-bit because DRAMs cannot be readily built in three-dimensional blocks, and a much lower power dissipation, as the refresh cycles need only be run approximately once every few minutes or once every few hour, as compared to every ˜64 milliseconds required in current DRAM technology. Quasi-volatile embodiments of the NOR string arrays of the present invention appropriately adapt the program/read/erase conditions to incorporate the periodic data refreshes. For example, because each quasi non-volatile TFT is frequently read-refreshed or program-refreshed, it is not necessary to “hard-program” TFTs to provide a large threshold voltage window between the ‘0’ and ‘1’ states that is typical for non-volatile TFTs where a minimum 10 years data retention is required. For example, a quasi-volatile threshold voltage window can be as little as 0.2V to 1V, as compared to 1V to 3V typical for TFTs that support 10-years retention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0226">Read, Program, Margin Read, Refresh and Erase Operations for Quasi-Volatile Nor Strings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0227">The quasi-volatile NOR strings or slices of the current invention may be used as alternatives to some or all DRAMs in many memory applications, e.g., the memory devices for supporting central processing unit (CPU) or microprocessor operations on the main board (“motherboard”) of a computer. The memory devices in those applications are typically required to be capable of fast random read access and to have very high cycle-endurance. In that capacity, the quasi-volatile NOR strings of the present invention employ similar read/program/inhibit/erase sequences as the non-volatile NOR implementation. In addition, since the charge stored on programmed TFTs slowly leaks out, the lost charge needs to be replenished by reprogramming the TFTs in advance of a read error. To avoid the read error, one may employ “margin read” conditions to determine if a program-refresh operation is required, as are well known to a person skilled in the art. Margin read is an early-detection mechanism for identifying which TFT will soon fail, before it is too late to restore it to its correct programmed state. Quasi-volatile TFTs typically are programmed, program-inhibited or erased at reduced programming voltage (V<sub>pgm</sub>), program inhibit voltage (V<sub>inhibit</sub>) or erase voltage (V<sub>erase</sub>), or are programmed using shorter pulse durations. The reduced voltages or shorter pulse durations result in a reduced dielectric stress on the storage material and, hence, improvement by orders of magnitude in endurance. All slices in a block may require periodic reads under margin conditions to early-detect excessive threshold voltage shifts of the programmed TFTs due to charge leakage from their charge storage material. For example, the erase threshold voltage may be 0.5V±0.2 V and the programmed threshold voltage may be 1.5V±0.2V, so that a normal read voltage may be set at ˜1V while the margin-read may be set at ˜1.2V. Any slice that requires a program-refresh needs to be read and then correctly reprogrammed into the same slice or into an erased slice in the same block or in another previously erased block. Multiple reads of quasi-volatile TFTs can result in disturbing the erase or program threshold voltages, and may require rewriting the slice into another, erased slice. Read disturbs are suppressed by lowering the voltages applied to the control gate, and the source and drain regions during reads. However, repetitive reads may cumulatively cause read errors. Such errors can be recovered by requiring the data to be encoded with error correcting codes (“ECC”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0228">One challenging requirement for the proper operation of the quasi-volatile memory of the present invention is the ability to read and program-refresh a large number of TFTs, NOR strings, pages or slices. For example, a quasi-volatile 1-terabit chip has ˜8,000,000 slices of 128K bits each. Assuming that 8 slices (˜1 million) of TFTs can be program-refreshed in parallel (e.g., one slice in each of 8 blocks), and assuming a program-refresh time of 100 microseconds, then an entire chip can be program-refreshed in ˜100 seconds. This massive parallelism is made possible in memory devices of the present invention primarily because of two key factors; 1) Fowler-Nordheim tunneling or direct tunneling requires extremely low programming current per TFT, allowing an unprecedented 1 million or more TFTs to be programmed together without expanding excessive power; and 2) the parasitic capacitor intrinsic to a long NOR string enables pre-charging and temporarily holding the pre-charged voltage on multiple NOR strings. These characteristics allow a multitude of pages or slices on different blocks to be first read in margin-read mode to determine if a refresh is required, and if so, the pages or slices are individually pre-charged for program or program-inhibit and then program-refreshed in a single parallel operation. A quasi-volatile memory with average retention time of ˜10 minutes or longer will allow the system controller to have adequate time for properly program-refresh, and to maintain a low error rate that is well within the ECC recovery capability. If the entire 1-terabit chip is refreshed every 10 minutes, such a chip compares favorably with a typical 64 milliseconds-to-refresh DRAM chip, or a factor of more than 1,000 times less frequently, hence consuming far less power to operate.</div>

I/O ports <b>861</b> may be one or more high speed serial ports for data streaming in or out of NOR string arrays <b>854</b> and <b>855</b>, or they may be 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit, or any suitably sized wide words that are randomly accessed, one word at a time. Such access may be provided, for example, using DRAM-compatible DDR4, and future higher speed industry standard memory interface protocols, or other protocols for DRAM, SRAM or NOR flash memories. I/O ports <b>862</b> handle storage system management commands, with flash memory controller <b>853</b> translating CPU commands for memory chip management operations and for data input to be programmed into the memory chips. In addition, CPU <b>801</b> may use I/O ports <b>862</b> to write and read stored files using one of several standard formats (e.g., PCIe, NVMe, eMMC, SD, USB, SAS, or multi-Gbit high data-rate ports). I/O ports <b>862</b> communicate between system controller <b>853</b> and NOR string arrays in the memory chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0230">It is advantageous to keep the system controller (e.g., system controller <b>853</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8<i>b</i> </figref>) off the memory chips, as each system controller typically manages a number of memory chips, so that it is disengaged as much as possible from the continuous ongoing margin-read/program-refresh operations, which can be more efficiently controlled by simple on-chip state machines, sequencers or dedicated microcontrollers. For example, parity-check bit (1-bit) or more powerful ECC words (typically, between a few bits to 70 bits or more) can be generated for the incoming data by the off-chip controller or on-chip by dedicated logic or state machines and stored with the page or slice being programmed During a margin-read operation the parity bit generated on-chip for the addressed page is compared with the stored parity bit. If the two bits do not match, the controller reads again the addressed page under a standard read (i.e. non-margin). If that gives a parity bit match, the controller will reprogram the correct data into the page, even though it is not yet fully corrupted. If the parity bits do not match, then on-chip dedicated ECC logic or the off-chip controller will intervene to detect and correct the bad bits and rewrite the correct data preferably into another available page or slice, and permanently retiring the errant page or slice. To speed up the on-chip ECC operations, it is advantageous to have on-chip Exclusive-Or, or other logic circuitry to find ECC matches quickly without having to go off-chip. Alternatively, a memory chip can have one or more high-speed I/O ports dedicated for communication with the controller for ECC and other system management chores (e.g., dynamic defect management), so as not to interfere with the low latency data I/O ports. As the frequency of read or program-refresh operations may vary over the life of the memory chip due to TFT wear-out after excessive program/erase cycling, the controller may store in each block (preferably in the high-speed cache slices) a value indicating the time interval between refresh operations, This time interval tracks the cycle count of the block. Additionally, the chip or the system may have a temperature monitoring circuit whose output data is used to modulate the frequency of refreshes with chip temperature. It should be clear that the example used here is just one of several sequences possible for achieving automatic program-refresh with rapid correction or replacement of errant pages or slices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0231">In the example of a 1-terabit chip having only 8 blocks out of 4,000 blocks, or 0.2% or less of all blocks are being refreshed at any one time, program-refresh operations can be performed in a background mode, while all other blocks can proceed in parallel with their pre-charge, read, program and erase operations. In the event of an address collision between the 0.2% and the 99.8% of blocks, the system controller arbitrates one of the accesses is more urgent. For example, the system controller can interrupt a program-refresh to yield priority to a fast read, then return to complete the program-refresh.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">In summary, in the integrated circuit memory chip of the present invention, each active strip and its multiple associated conductive word lines are architected as a single-port isolated capacitor that can be charged to pre-determined voltages which are held semi-floating (i.e., subject to charge leaking out through the string-select transistor in the substrate circuitry) during read, program, program-inhibit or erase operations. That isolated semi-floating capacitor of each active strip, coupled with the extremely low Fowler-Nordheim or direct tunneling current required to program or erase the TFTs in a NOR string associated with the active strip, makes it possible to program, erase or read a massive number of randomly selected blocks, sequentially or concurrently. Within the integrated circuit memory chip, the NOR strings of one or more of a first group of blocks are first pre-charged and then erased together, while the NOR strings of one or more other groups of blocks are first pre-charged and then programmed or read together. Furthermore, erasing of the first group of blocks and programming or reading of a second group of blocks can take place sequentially or concurrently. Blocks that are dormant (e.g., blocks that store rarely-changed archival data) are preferably held at a semi-floating state, preferably isolated from the substrate circuits after having their NOR strings and conductors set at ground potential. To take advantage of the massively parallel read and program bandwidths of these quasi-floating NOR strings, it is advantageous for the integrated circuit memory chip to incorporate therein multiple high-speed I/O ports. Data can be routed on-chip to and from these I/O ports, for example, to provide multiple channels for word-wide random access, or for serial data streams out of the chip (reading) or into the chip (programming or writing).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">Many applications (e.g., search, machine learning and numerous other artificial intelligence applications) require fast Boolean operations involving numerous binary variables. For example, a search application often requires matching of keys to ascertain that the result found is the data item sought. The NOR memory strings of the present invention may be used to implement fast Boolean operations involving a large number of Boolean variables. For example, the NOR memory strings described above may be used to compare many bits in parallel. Such a compare function may be implemented using two n-bit NOR memory strings. Consider a Boolean string a<sub>n-1 </sub>a<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . a<sub>0</sub>, which is to be compared to an input Boolean string b<sub>n-1 </sub>b<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . b<sub>0</sub>. a<sub>n-1 </sub>a<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . a<sub>0</sub>. Such a comparison is often required, for example, in applications involving look-up tables, content addressable memories, cache tag hit/miss detections, or key searches associated with data stored in hashed locations. In one embodiment, the Boolean string a<sub>n-1 </sub>a<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . a<sub>0 </sub>may be stored in two NOR memory string, referred to as “true-string” and “complement-string,” respectively, in the following manner: (i) a ‘1’ in Boolean string a<sub>n-1 </sub>a<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . a<sub>0 </sub>is stored in a non-conducting state (e.g., high threshold voltage state or N) in the true-string and a ‘0’ in Boolean string a<sub>n-1 </sub>a<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . a<sub>0 </sub>is stored in the true-string as a conducting state (e.g., a low threshold voltage state or C), and (ii) a ‘0’ in Boolean string a<sub>n-1 </sub>a<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . a<sub>0 </sub>is stored in the non-conducting state in the complementary-string and a ‘1’ in Boolean string a<sub>n-1 </sub>a<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . a<sub>0 </sub>is stored in the complementary-string as a conducting state.

Conversely, when a bit is read in the complementary-string, a stored ‘1’ (conducting state) would result in a low voltage on the common bit line, whereas a stored ‘0’ (non-conducting state) would result in a high voltage on the common bit line.</div>

The read operations of every bit in Boolean string b<sub>n-1 </sub>b<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . b<sub>0 </sub>are all performed simultaneously by simultaneously activating the corresponding word lines. Hence, if stored Boolean string a<sub>n-1 </sub>a<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . a<sub>0 </sub>and input Boolean string b<sub>n-1 </sub>b<sub>n-2 </sub>. . . b<sub>0 </sub>are not identical, at least one of the bits read in either the true-string or the complementary-string would be in the conducting state, resulting in a low voltage on the common bit line of that NOR memory string.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">Thus, a current representing a desired analog value can be generated by programming the memory cells of a NOR memory string selectively in conducting and non-conducting states. The generated analog signal may participate in computation in the analog domain using appropriate analog circuitry provided under the array of NOR memory strings or in a separate, accompanying integrated circuit. Conversion between the Boolean string and its corresponding analog value may be conveniently accomplished using, for example, look-up tables. One may recognize that the total current I may represent a weighted sum, with each weight</div>

appropriate for representing a probability. Such a weighted sum is often computed in the neurons of a neural network, which is widely used in many machine learning and other artificial intelligence applications. Thus, the NOR memory strings of the present invention are particularly powerful when used in many such applications.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">Thus, such a NOR memory string is suitable for rapidly and efficiently generating an analog signal whose magnitude varies linearly with the number of memory cells programmed in the conducting state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">A distinct advantage of the current invention comes from the fact that the NOR memory strings of the current embodiments can be built efficiently in three-dimensional memory stacks of such NOR memory strings. In such configuration, the cost of each such string is drastically reduced. For example, in one embodiment implemented on a single semiconductor die, each three-dimensional memory stacks may include, for example, eight or more active layers that can form NOR memory strings. Such a die may be organized into 1024 (1K) compact modular units or “tiles,” with each tile having 16,385 (16K) non-volatile or quasi-volatile NOR memory strings of the types described above, for a total of more than 16 million such NOR memory strings, each representing an individual signal level. The tiles are each preferably of a regular shape to facilitate layout and signal routing. In some applications it may be advantageous to have the thin-film transistors of each NOR memory string be of the non-volatile type, specifically to store data that only change infrequently. In other applications it may be advantageous to have the stored data changes very frequently. In those case, as the thin-film transistors is required to have very high erase/write endurance, the quasi-volatile type transistors are better suited. (As discussed above, quasi-volatile thin-film transistors may need to be periodically read-refreshed.) In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the thin-film transistors in the NOR memory strings of some of the tiles may be configured to be of the non-volatile type, while the thin-film transistors in the NOR memory strings of other tiles may be configured to be of the quasi-volatile type.</div>
