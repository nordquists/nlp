<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">One or more embodiments are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It is evident, however, that the various embodiments can be practiced without these details (and without applying to any particular networked environment or standard).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In an embodiment, a guided wave communication system is presented for sending and receiving communication signals such as data or other signaling via guided electromagnetic waves. The guided electromagnetic waves include, for example, surface waves or other electromagnetic waves that are bound to or guided by a transmission medium as described herein. It will be appreciated that a variety of transmission media can be utilized with guided wave communications without departing from example embodiments. Examples of such transmission media can include one or more of the following, either alone or in one or more combinations: wires, whether insulated or not, and whether single-stranded or multi-stranded; conductors of other shapes or configurations including unshielded twisted pair cables including single twisted pairs, Category 5e and other twisted pair cable bundles, other wire bundles, cables, rods, rails, pipes; non-conductors such as dielectric pipes, rods, rails, or other dielectric members; combinations of conductors and dielectric materials such as coaxial cables; or other guided wave transmission media.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">The inducement of guided electromagnetic waves that propagate along a transmission medium can be independent of any electrical potential, charge or current that is injected or otherwise transmitted through the transmission medium as part of an electrical circuit. For example, in the case where the transmission medium is a wire, it is to be appreciated that while a small current in the wire may be formed in response to the propagation of the electromagnetic waves guided along the wire, this can be due to the propagation of the electromagnetic wave along the wire surface, and is not formed in response to electrical potential, charge or current that is injected into the wire as part of an electrical circuit. The electromagnetic waves traveling along the wire therefore do not require an electrical circuit (i.e., ground or other electrical return path) to propagate along the wire surface. The wire therefore is a single wire transmission line that is not part of an electrical circuit. For example, electromagnetic waves can propagate along a wire configured as an electrical open circuit. Also, in some embodiments, a wire is not necessary, and the electromagnetic waves can propagate along a single line transmission medium that is not a wire including a single line transmission medium that is conductorless. Accordingly, electromagnetic waves can propagate along a physical transmission medium without requiring an electrical return path</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">More generally, “guided electromagnetic waves” or “guided waves” as described by the subject disclosure are affected by the presence of a physical object that is at least a part of the transmission medium (e.g., a bare wire or other conductor, a dielectric including a dielectric core without a conductive shield and/or without an inner conductor, an insulated wire, a conduit or other hollow element whether conductive or not, a bundle of insulated wires that is coated, covered or surrounded by a dielectric or insulator or other wire bundle, or another form of solid, liquid or otherwise non-gaseous transmission medium) so as to be at least partially bound to or guided by the physical object and so as to propagate along a transmission path of the physical object. Such a physical object can operate as at least a part of a transmission medium that guides, by way of one or more interfaces of the transmission medium (e.g., an outer surface, inner surface, an interior portion between the outer and the inner surfaces or other boundary between elements of the transmission medium). In this fashion, a transmission medium may support multiple transmission paths over different surfaces of the transmission medium. For example, a stranded cable or wire bundle may support electromagnetic waves that are guided by the outer surface of the stranded cable or wire bundle, as well as electromagnetic waves that are guided by inner cable surfaces between two, three or more individual strands or wires within the stranded cable or wire bundle. For example, electromagnetic waves can be guided within interstitial areas of a stranded cable, insulated twisted pair wires, or a wire bundle. The guided electromagnetic waves of the subject disclosure are launched from a sending (transmitting) device and propagate along the transmission medium for reception by at least one receiving device. The propagation of guided electromagnetic waves, can carry energy, data and/or other signals along the transmission path from the sending device to the receiving device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">As used herein the term “conductor” (based on a definition of the term “conductor” from <i>IEEE </i>100<i>, the Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, </i>7<sup>th </sup>Edition, 2000) means a substance or body that allows a current of electricity to pass continuously along it. The terms “insulator”, “conductorless” or “nonconductor” (based on a definition of the term “insulator” from <i>IEEE </i>100<i>, the Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, </i>7<sup>th </sup>Edition, 2000) means a device or material in which electrons or ions cannot be moved easily. It is possible for an insulator, or a conductorless or nonconductive material to be intermixed intentionally (e.g., doped) or unintentionally into a resulting substance with a small amount of another material having the properties of a conductor. However, the resulting substance may remain substantially resistant to a flow of a continuous electrical current along the resulting substance. Furthermore, a conductorless member such as a dielectric rod or other conductorless core lacks an inner conductor and a conductive shield. As used herein, the term “eddy current” (based on a definition of the term “conductor” from <i>IEEE </i>100<i>, the Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, </i>7<sup>th </sup>Edition, 2000) means a current that circulates in a metallic material as a result of electromotive forces induced by a variation of magnetic flux. Although it may be possible for an insulator, conductorless or nonconductive material in the foregoing embodiments to allow eddy currents that circulate within the doped or intermixed conductor and/or a very small continuous flow of an electrical current along the extent of the insulator, conductorless or nonconductive material, any such continuous flow of electrical current along such an insulator, conductorless or nonconductive material is de minimis compared to the flow of an electrical current along a conductor. Accordingly, in the subject disclosure an insulator, and a conductorless or nonconductor material are not considered to be a conductor. The term “dielectric” means an insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field. When a dielectric is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not continuously flow through the material as they do in a conductor, but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization. The terms “conductorless transmission medium or non-conductor transmission medium” can mean a transmission medium consisting of any material (or combination of materials) that may or may not contain one or more conductive elements but lacks a continuous conductor between the sending and receiving devices along the conductorless transmission medium or non-conductor transmission medium—similar or identical to the aforementioned properties of an insulator, conductorless or nonconductive material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Unlike free space propagation of wireless signals such as unguided (or unbounded) electromagnetic waves that decrease in intensity inversely by the square of the distance traveled by the unguided electromagnetic waves, guided electromagnetic waves can propagate along a transmission medium with less loss in magnitude per unit distance than experienced by unguided electromagnetic waves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Unlike electrical signals, guided electromagnetic waves can propagate along different types of transmission media from a sending device to a receiving device without requiring a separate electrical return path between the sending device and the receiving device. As a consequence, guided electromagnetic waves can propagate from a sending device to a receiving device along a conductorless transmission medium including a transmission medium having no conductive components (e.g., a dielectric strip, rod, or pipe), or via a transmission medium having no more than a single conductor (e.g., a single bare wire or insulated wire configured in an open electrical circuit). Even if a transmission medium includes one or more conductive components and the guided electromagnetic waves propagating along the transmission medium generate currents that flow in the one or more conductive components in a direction of the guided electromagnetic waves, such guided electromagnetic waves can propagate along the transmission medium from a sending device to a receiving device without requiring a flow of opposing currents on an electrical return path between the sending device and the receiving device (i.e., in an electrical open circuit configuration).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">In a non-limiting illustration, consider electrical systems that transmit and receive electrical signals between sending and receiving devices by way of conductive media. Such systems generally rely on an electrical forward path and an electrical return path. For instance, consider a coaxial cable having a center conductor and a ground shield that are separated by an insulator. Typically, in an electrical system a first terminal of a sending (or receiving) device can be connected to the center conductor, and a second terminal of the sending (or receiving) device can be connected to the ground shield or other second conductor. If the sending device injects an electrical signal in the center conductor via the first terminal, the electrical signal will propagate along the center conductor causing forward currents in the center conductor, and return currents in the ground shield or other second conductor. The same conditions apply for a two terminal receiving device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In contrast, consider a guided wave communication system such as described in the subject disclosure, which can utilize different embodiments of a transmission medium (including among others a coaxial cable) for transmitting and receiving guided electromagnetic waves without requiring an electrical return path. In one embodiment, for example, the guided wave communication system of the subject disclosure can be configured to induce guided electromagnetic waves that propagate along an outer surface of a coaxial cable. Although the guided electromagnetic waves can cause forward currents on the ground shield, the guided electromagnetic waves do not require return currents on, for example, the center conductor to enable the guided electromagnetic waves to propagate along the outer surface of the coaxial cable. The same can be said of other transmission media used by a guided wave communication system for the transmission and reception of guided electromagnetic waves. For example, guided electromagnetic waves induced by the guided wave communication system on a bare wire, an insulated wire, or a dielectric transmission medium (e.g., a dielectric core with no conductive materials), can propagate along the bare wire, the insulated bare wire, or the dielectric transmission medium without requiring return currents on an electrical return path.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Consequently, electrical systems that require forward and return conductors for carrying corresponding forward and reverse currents on conductors to enable the propagation of electrical signals injected by a sending device are distinct from guided wave systems that induce guided electromagnetic waves on an interface of a transmission medium without requiring an electrical return path to enable the propagation of the guided electromagnetic waves along the interface of the transmission medium. It is also noted that a transmission medium having an electrical return path (e.g., ground) for purposes of conducting currents (e.g., a power line) can be used to contemporaneously propagate electromagnetic waves along the transmission medium. However, the propagation of the electromagnetic waves is not dependent on the electrical currents flowing through the transmission medium. For example, if the electrical currents flowing through the transmission medium stop flowing for any reason (e.g., a power outage), electromagnetic waves propagating along the transmission medium can continue to propagate without interruption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">It is further noted that guided electromagnetic waves as described in the subject disclosure can have an electromagnetic field structure that lies primarily or substantially on an outer surface of a transmission medium so as to be bound to or guided by the outer surface of the transmission medium and so as to propagate non-trivial distances on or along the outer surface of the transmission medium. In other embodiments, guided electromagnetic waves can have an electromagnetic field structure that substantially lies above an outer surface of a transmission medium, but is nonetheless bound to or guided by the transmission medium and so as to propagate non-trivial distances on or along the transmission medium. In other embodiments, guided electromagnetic waves can have an electromagnetic field structure that has a field strength that is de minimis at the outer surface, below the outer surface, and/or in proximity to the outer surface of a transmission medium, but is nonetheless bound to or guided by the transmission medium and so as to propagate non-trivial distances along the transmission medium. In other embodiments, guided electromagnetic waves can have an electromagnetic field structure that lies primarily or substantially below an outer surface of a transmission medium so as to be bound to or guided by an inner material of the transmission medium (e.g., dielectric material) and so as to propagate non-trivial distances within the inner material of the transmission medium. In other embodiments, guided electromagnetic waves can have an electromagnetic field structure that lies within a region that is partially below and partially above an outer surface of a transmission medium so as to be bound to or guided by this region of the transmission medium and so as to propagate non-trivial distances along this region of the transmission medium. It will be appreciated that electromagnetic waves that propagate along a transmission medium or are otherwise guided by a transmission medium (i.e., guided electromagnetic waves) can have an electric field structure such as described in one or more of the foregoing embodiments. The desired electromagnetic field structure in an embodiment may vary based upon a variety of factors, including the desired transmission distance, the characteristics of the transmission medium itself, environmental conditions/characteristics outside of the transmission medium (e.g., presence of rain, fog, atmospheric conditions, etc.), and characteristics of an electromagnetic wave that are configurable by a launcher as will be described below (e.g., configurable wave mode, configurable electromagnetic field structure, configurable polarity, configurable wavelength, configurable bandwidth, and so on).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Various embodiments described herein relate to coupling devices, that can be referred to as “waveguide coupling devices”, “waveguide couplers” or more simply as “couplers”, “coupling devices” or “launchers” for launching and/or receiving/extracting guided electromagnetic waves to and from a transmission medium, wherein a wavelength of the guided electromagnetic waves can be small compared to one or more dimensions of the coupling device and/or the transmission medium such as the circumference of a wire or other cross sectional dimension. Such electromagnetic waves can operate at millimeter wave frequencies (e.g., 30 to 300 GHz), or lower than microwave frequencies such as 300 MHz to 30 GHz. Electromagnetic waves can be induced to propagate along a transmission medium by a coupling device, such as: a strip, arc or other length of dielectric material; a millimeter wave integrated circuit (MMIC), a horn, monopole, dipole, rod, slot, patch, planar or other antenna; an array of antennas; a magnetic resonant cavity or other resonant coupler; a coil, a strip line, a coaxial waveguide, a hollow waveguide, or other waveguide and/or other coupling device. In operation, the coupling device receives an electromagnetic wave from a transmitter or transmission medium. The electromagnetic field structure of the electromagnetic wave can be carried below an outer surface of the coupling device, substantially on the outer surface of the coupling device, within a hollow cavity of the coupling device, can be radiated from a coupling device or a combination thereof. When the coupling device is in close proximity to a transmission medium, at least a portion of an electromagnetic wave couples to or is bound to the transmission medium, and continues to propagate as guided electromagnetic waves along the transmission medium. In a reciprocal fashion, a coupling device can receive or extract at least a portion of the guided electromagnetic waves from a transmission medium and transfer these electromagnetic waves to a receiver. The guided electromagnetic waves launched and/or received by the coupling device propagate along the transmission medium from a sending device to a receiving device without requiring an electrical return path between the sending device and the receiving device. In this circumstance, the transmission medium acts as a waveguide to support the propagation of the guided electromagnetic waves from the sending device to the receiving device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">According to an example embodiment, a surface wave is a type of guided wave that is guided by a surface of a transmission medium, such as an exterior or outer surface or an interior or inner surface including an interstitial surface of the transmission medium such as the interstitial area between wires in a multi-stranded cable, insulated twisted pair wires, or wire bundle, and/or another surface of the transmission medium that is adjacent to or exposed to another type of medium having different properties (e.g., dielectric properties). Indeed, in an example embodiment, a surface of the transmission medium that guides a surface wave can represent a transitional surface between two different types of media. For example, in the case of a bare wire or uninsulated wire, the surface of the wire can be the outer or exterior conductive surface of the bare wire or uninsulated wire that is exposed to air or free space. As another example, in the case of insulated wire, the surface of the wire can be the conductive portion of the wire that meets an inner surface of the insulator portion of the wire. A surface of the transmission medium can be any one of an inner surface of an insulator surface of a wire or a conductive surface of the wire that is separated by a gap composed of, for example, air or free space. A surface of a transmission medium can otherwise be any material region of the transmission medium. For example, the surface of the transmission medium can be an inner portion of an insulator disposed on a conductive portion of the wire that meets the insulator portion of the wire. The surface that guides an electromagnetic wave can depend upon the relative differences in the properties (e.g., dielectric properties) of the insulator, air, and/or the conductor and further dependent on the frequency and propagation mode or modes of the guided wave.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">According to an example embodiment, the term “about” a wire or other transmission medium used in conjunction with a guided wave can include fundamental guided wave propagation modes such as a guided wave having a circular or substantially circular field pattern/distribution, a symmetrical electromagnetic field pattern/distribution (e.g., electric field or magnetic field) or other fundamental mode pattern at least partially around a wire or other transmission medium. Unlike Zenneck waves that propagate along a single planar surface of a planar transmission medium, the guided electromagnetic waves of the subject disclosure that are bound to a transmission medium can have electromagnetic field patterns that surround or circumscribe, at least in part, a non-planar surface of the transmission medium with electromagnetic energy in all directions, or in all but a finite number of azimuthal null directions characterized by field strengths that approach zero field strength for infinitesimally small azimuthal widths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">For example, such non-circular field distributions can be unilateral or multi-lateral with one or more axial lobes characterized by relatively higher field strength and/or one or more nulls directions of zero field strength or substantially zero-field strength or null regions characterized by relatively low-field strength, zero-field strength and/or substantially zero-field strength. Further, the field distribution can otherwise vary as a function of azimuthal orientation around a transmission medium such that one or more angular regions around the transmission medium have an electric or magnetic field strength (or combination thereof) that is higher than one or more other angular regions of azimuthal orientation, according to an example embodiment. It will be appreciated that the relative orientations or positions of the guided wave higher order modes, particularly asymmetrical modes, can vary as the guided wave travels along the wire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">In addition, when a guided wave propagates “about” a wire or other type of transmission medium, it can do so according to a guided wave propagation mode that includes not only the fundamental wave propagation modes (e.g., zero order modes), but additionally or alternatively, non-fundamental wave propagation modes such as higher-order guided wave modes (e.g., 1<sup>st </sup>order modes, 2<sup>nd </sup>order modes, etc.). Higher-order modes include symmetrical modes that have a circular or substantially circular electric or magnetic field distribution and/or a symmetrical electric or magnetic field distribution, or asymmetrical modes and/or other guided (e.g., surface) waves that have non-circular and/or asymmetrical field distributions around the wire or other transmission medium. For example, the guided electromagnetic waves of the subject disclosure can propagate along a transmission medium from the sending device to the receiving device or along a coupling device via one or more guided wave modes such as a fundamental transverse magnetic (TM) TM00 mode (or Goubau mode), a fundamental hybrid mode (EH or HE) “EH00” mode or “HE00” mode, a transverse electromagnetic “TEMnm” mode, a total internal reflection (TIR) mode or any other mode such as EHnm, HEnm or TMnm, where n and/or m have integer values greater than or equal to 0, and other fundamental, hybrid and non-fundamental wave modes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">As used herein, the term “guided wave mode” refers to a guided wave propagation mode of a transmission medium, coupling device or other system component of a guided wave communication system that propagates for non-trivial distances along the length of the transmission medium, coupling device or other system component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">As used herein, the term “millimeter-wave” can refer to electromagnetic waves/signals that fall within the “millimeter-wave frequency band” of 30 GHz to 300 GHz. The term “microwave” can refer to electromagnetic waves/signals that fall within a “microwave frequency band” of 300 MHz to 300 GHz. The term “radio frequency” or “RF” can refer to electromagnetic waves/signals that fall within the “radio frequency band” of 10 kHz to 1 THz. It is appreciated that wireless signals, electrical signals, and guided electromagnetic waves as described in the subject disclosure can be configured to operate at any desirable frequency range, such as, for example, at frequencies within, above or below millimeter-wave and/or microwave frequency bands. In particular, when a coupling device or transmission medium includes a conductive element, the frequency of the guided electromagnetic waves that are carried by the coupling device and/or propagate along the transmission medium can be below the mean collision frequency of the electrons in the conductive element. Further, the frequency of the guided electromagnetic waves that are carried by the coupling device and/or propagate along the transmission medium can be a non-optical frequency, e.g., a radio frequency below the range of optical frequencies that begins at 1 THz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">It is further appreciated that a transmission medium as described in the subject disclosure can be configured to be opaque or otherwise resistant to (or at least substantially reduce) a propagation of electromagnetic waves operating at optical frequencies (e.g., greater than 1 THz).</div>

The diagram <b>300</b> includes different gray-scales that represent differing electromagnetic field strengths generated by the propagation of the guided wave having a non-circular and non-fundamental guided wave mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">In particular, the electromagnetic field distribution corresponds to a modal “sweet spot” that enhances guided electromagnetic wave propagation along an insulated transmission medium and reduces end-to-end transmission loss. In this particular mode, electromagnetic waves are guided by the transmission medium <b>125</b> to propagate along an outer surface of the transmission medium—in this case, the outer surface of the insulating jacket <b>302</b>. Electromagnetic waves are partially embedded in the insulator and partially radiating on the outer surface of the insulator. In this fashion, electromagnetic waves are “lightly” coupled to the insulator so as to enable electromagnetic wave propagation at long distances with low propagation loss.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">As shown, the guided wave has a field structure that lies primarily or substantially outside of the transmission medium <b>125</b> that serves to guide the electromagnetic waves. The regions inside the conductor <b>301</b> have little or no field. Likewise regions inside the insulating jacket <b>302</b> have low field strength. The majority of the electromagnetic field strength is distributed in the lobes <b>304</b> at the outer surface of the insulating jacket <b>302</b> and in close proximity thereof. The presence of a non-circular and non-fundamental guided wave mode is shown by the high electromagnetic field strengths at the top and bottom of the outer surface of the insulating jacket <b>302</b> (in the orientation of the diagram)—as opposed to very small field strengths on the other sides of the insulating jacket <b>302</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The example shown corresponds to a 38 GHz electromagnetic wave guided by a wire with a diameter of 1.1 cm and a dielectric insulation of thickness of 0.36 cm. Because the electromagnetic wave is guided by the transmission medium <b>125</b> and the majority of the field strength is concentrated in the air outside of the insulating jacket <b>302</b> within a limited distance of the outer surface, the guided wave can propagate longitudinally down the transmission medium <b>125</b> with very low loss. In the example shown, this “limited distance” corresponds to a distance from the outer surface that is less than half the largest cross sectional dimension of the transmission medium <b>125</b>. In this case, the largest cross sectional dimension of the wire corresponds to the overall diameter of 1.82 cm, however, this value can vary with the size and shape of the transmission medium <b>125</b>. For example, should the transmission medium <b>125</b> be of a rectangular shape with a height of 0.3 cm and a width of 0.4 cm, the largest cross sectional dimension would be the diagonal of 0.5 cm and the corresponding limited distance would be 0.25 cm. The dimensions of the area containing the majority of the field strength also vary with the frequency, and in general, increase as carrier frequencies decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">It should also be noted that the components of a guided wave communication system, such as couplers and transmission media can have their own cut-off frequencies for each guided wave mode. The cut-off frequency generally sets forth the lowest frequency that a particular guided wave mode is designed to be supported by that particular component. In an example embodiment, the particular non-circular and non-fundamental mode of propagation shown is induced on the transmission medium <b>125</b> by an electromagnetic wave having a frequency that falls within a limited range (such as Fc to 2Fc) of the cut-off frequency Fc for this particular non-fundamental mode. The cut-off frequency Fc is particular to the characteristics of transmission medium <b>125</b>. For embodiments as shown that include an inner conductor <b>301</b> surrounded by an insulating jacket <b>302</b>, this cutoff frequency can vary based on the dimensions and properties of the insulating jacket <b>302</b> and potentially the dimensions and properties of the inner conductor <b>301</b> and can be determined experimentally to have a desired mode pattern. It should be noted however, that similar effects can be found for a hollow dielectric or insulator without an inner conductor or conductive shield. In this case, the cutoff frequency can vary based on the dimensions and properties of the hollow dielectric or insulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">At frequencies lower than the cut-off frequency, the non-circular mode is difficult to induce in the transmission medium <b>125</b> and fails to propagate for all but trivial distances. As the frequency increases above the limited range of frequencies about the cut-off frequency, the non-circular mode shifts more and more inward of the insulating jacket <b>302</b>. At frequencies much larger than the cut-off frequency, the field strength is no longer concentrated outside of the insulating jacket, but primarily inside of the insulating jacket <b>302</b>. While the transmission medium <b>125</b> provides strong guidance to the electromagnetic wave and propagation is still possible, ranges are more limited by increased losses due to propagation within the insulating jacket <b>302</b>—as opposed to the surrounding air.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a graphical diagram <b>400</b> illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of an electromagnetic field distribution is shown. In particular, a cross section diagram <b>400</b>, similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown with common reference numerals used to refer to similar elements. The example shown corresponds to a 60 GHz wave guided by a wire with a diameter of 1.1 cm and a dielectric insulation of thickness of 0.36 cm. Because the frequency of the guided wave is above the limited range of the cut-off frequency of this particular non-fundamental mode, much of the field strength has shifted inward of the insulating jacket <b>302</b>. In particular, the field strength is concentrated primarily inside of the insulating jacket <b>302</b>. While the transmission medium <b>125</b> provides strong guidance to the electromagnetic wave and propagation is still possible, ranges are more limited when compared with the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by increased losses due to propagation within the insulating jacket <b>302</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a graphical diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a frequency response is shown. In particular, diagram <b>500</b> presents a graph of end-to-end loss (in dB) as a function of frequency, overlaid with electromagnetic field distributions <b>510</b>, <b>520</b> and <b>530</b> at three points for a 200 cm insulated medium voltage wire. The boundary between the insulator and the surrounding air is represented by reference numeral <b>525</b> in each electromagnetic field distribution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">As discussed in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an example of a desired non-circular mode of propagation shown is induced on the transmission medium <b>125</b> by an electromagnetic wave having a frequency that falls within a limited range (such as Fc to 2Fc) of the lower cut-off frequency Fc of the transmission medium for this particular non-circular mode. In particular, the electromagnetic field distribution <b>520</b> at 6 GHz falls within this modal “sweet spot” that enhances electromagnetic wave propagation along an insulated transmission medium and reduces end-to-end transmission loss. In this particular mode, guided waves are partially embedded in the insulator and partially radiating on the outer surface of the insulator. In this fashion, the electromagnetic waves are “lightly” coupled to the insulator so as to enable guided electromagnetic wave propagation at long distances with low propagation loss.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">At lower frequencies represented by the electromagnetic field distribution <b>510</b> at 3 GHz, the non-circular mode radiates more heavily generating higher propagation losses. At higher frequencies represented by the electromagnetic field distribution <b>530</b> at 9 GHz, the non-circular mode shifts more and more inward of the insulating jacket providing too much absorption, again generating higher propagation losses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a graphical diagram <b>550</b> illustrating example, non-limiting embodiments of a longitudinal cross-section of a transmission medium <b>125</b>, such as an insulated wire, depicting fields of guided electromagnetic waves at various operating frequencies is shown. As shown in diagram <b>556</b>, when the guided electromagnetic waves are at approximately the cutoff frequency (f<sub>c</sub>) corresponding to the modal “sweet spot”, the guided electromagnetic waves are loosely coupled to the insulated wire so that absorption is reduced, and the fields of the guided electromagnetic waves are bound sufficiently to reduce the amount radiated into the environment (e.g., air). Because absorption and radiation of the fields of the guided electromagnetic waves is low, propagation losses are consequently low, enabling the guided electromagnetic waves to propagate for longer distances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">As shown in diagram <b>554</b>, propagation losses increase when an operating frequency of the guide electromagnetic waves increases above about two-times the cutoff frequency (f<sub>c</sub>)—or as referred to, above the range of the “sweet spot”. More of the field strength of the electromagnetic wave is driven inside the insulating layer, increasing propagation losses. At frequencies much higher than the cutoff frequency (f<sub>c</sub>) the guided electromagnetic waves are strongly bound to the insulated wire as a result of the fields emitted by the guided electromagnetic waves being concentrated in the insulation layer of the wire, as shown in diagram <b>552</b>. This in turn raises propagation losses further due to absorption of the guided electromagnetic waves by the insulation layer. Similarly, propagation losses increase when the operating frequency of the guided electromagnetic waves is substantially below the cutoff frequency (f<sub>c</sub>), as shown in diagram <b>558</b>. At frequencies much lower than the cutoff frequency (f<sub>c</sub>) the guided electromagnetic waves are weakly (or nominally) bound to the insulated wire and thereby tend to radiate into the environment (e.g., air), which in turn, raises propagation losses due to radiation of the guided electromagnetic waves.</div>

The diagram <b>600</b> includes different gray-scales that represent differing electromagnetic field strengths generated by the propagation of a guided wave having a symmetrical and fundamental TM00 guided wave mode at a single carrier frequency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">In this particular mode, electromagnetic waves are guided by the transmission medium <b>602</b> to propagate along an outer surface of the transmission medium—in this case, the outer surface of the bare wire.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a block diagram <b>700</b> illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of an arc coupler is shown. In particular a coupling device is presented for use in a transmission device, such as transmission device <b>101</b> or <b>102</b> presented in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The coupling device includes an arc coupler <b>704</b> coupled to a transmitter circuit <b>712</b> and termination or damper <b>714</b>. The arc coupler <b>704</b> can be made of a dielectric material, or other low-loss insulator (e.g., Teflon, polyethylene, etc.), or made of a conducting (e.g., metallic, non-metallic, etc.) material, or any combination of the foregoing materials. As shown, the arc coupler <b>704</b> operates as a waveguide and has a wave <b>706</b> propagating as a guided wave, within and about a waveguide surface of the arc coupler <b>704</b>. In the embodiment shown, at least a portion of the arc coupler <b>704</b> can be placed near a wire <b>702</b> or other transmission medium, (such as transmission medium <b>125</b>), in order to facilitate coupling between the arc coupler <b>704</b> and the wire <b>702</b> or other transmission medium, as described herein to launch the guided wave <b>708</b> on the wire. The arc coupler <b>704</b> can be placed such that a portion of the curved arc coupler <b>704</b> is tangential to, and parallel or substantially parallel to the wire <b>702</b>. The portion of the arc coupler <b>704</b> that is parallel to the wire can be an apex of the curve, or any point where a tangent of the curve is parallel to the wire <b>702</b>. When the arc coupler <b>704</b> is positioned or placed thusly, the wave <b>706</b> travelling along the arc coupler <b>704</b> couples, at least in part, to the wire <b>702</b>, and propagates as guided wave <b>708</b> around or about the wire surface of the wire <b>702</b> and longitudinally along the wire <b>702</b>. The guided wave <b>708</b> can be characterized as a surface wave or other electromagnetic wave that is guided by or bound to the wire <b>702</b> or other transmission medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">A portion of the wave <b>706</b> that does not couple to the wire <b>702</b> propagates as a wave <b>710</b> along the arc coupler <b>704</b>. It will be appreciated that the arc coupler <b>704</b> can be configured and arranged in a variety of positions in relation to the wire <b>702</b> to achieve a desired level of coupling or non-coupling of the wave <b>706</b> to the wire <b>702</b>. For example, the curvature and/or length of the arc coupler <b>704</b> that is parallel or substantially parallel, as well as its separation distance (which can include zero separation distance in an embodiment), to the wire <b>702</b> can be varied without departing from example embodiments. Likewise, the arrangement of arc coupler <b>704</b> in relation to the wire <b>702</b> may be varied based upon considerations of the respective intrinsic characteristics (e.g., thickness, composition, electromagnetic properties, etc.) of the wire <b>702</b> and the arc coupler <b>704</b>, as well as the characteristics (e.g., frequency, energy level, etc.) of the waves <b>706</b> and <b>708</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">The guided wave <b>708</b> stays parallel or substantially parallel to the wire <b>702</b>, even as the wire <b>702</b> bends and flexes. Bends in the wire <b>702</b> can increase transmission losses, which are also dependent on wire diameters, frequency, and materials. If the dimensions of the arc coupler <b>704</b> are chosen for efficient power transfer, most of the power in the wave <b>706</b> is transferred to the wire <b>702</b>, with little power remaining in wave <b>710</b>. It will be appreciated that the guided wave <b>708</b> can still be multi-modal in nature (discussed herein), including having modes that are non-circular, non-fundamental and/or asymmetric, while traveling along a path that is parallel or substantially parallel to the wire <b>702</b>, with or without a fundamental transmission mode. In an embodiment, non-circular, non-fundamental and/or asymmetric modes can be utilized to minimize transmission losses and/or obtain increased propagation distances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">It is noted that the term “parallel” is generally a geometric construct which often is not exactly achievable in real systems. Accordingly, the term “parallel” as utilized in the subject disclosure represents an approximation rather than an exact configuration when used to describe embodiments disclosed in the subject disclosure. In an embodiment, “substantially parallel” can include approximations that are within 30 degrees of true parallel in all dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">In an embodiment, the wave <b>706</b> can exhibit one or more wave propagation modes. The arc coupler modes can be dependent on the shape and/or design of the coupler <b>704</b>. The one or more arc coupler modes of wave <b>706</b> can generate, influence, or impact one or more wave propagation modes of the guided wave <b>708</b> propagating along wire <b>702</b>. It should be particularly noted however that the guided wave modes present in the guided wave <b>706</b> may be the same or different from the guided wave modes of the guided wave <b>708</b>. In this fashion, one or more guided wave modes of the guided wave <b>706</b> may not be transferred to the guided wave <b>708</b>, and further one or more guided wave modes of guided wave <b>708</b> may not have been present in guided wave <b>706</b>. It should also be noted that the cut-off frequency of the arc coupler <b>704</b> for a particular guided wave mode may be different than the cutoff frequency of the wire <b>702</b> or other transmission medium for that same mode. For example, while the wire <b>702</b> or other transmission medium may be operated slightly above its cutoff frequency for a particular guided wave mode, the arc coupler <b>704</b> may be operated well above its cut-off frequency for that same mode for low loss, slightly below its cut-off frequency for that same mode to, for example, induce greater coupling and power transfer, or some other point in relation to the arc coupler's cutoff frequency for that mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In an embodiment, the wave propagation modes on the wire <b>702</b> can be similar to the arc coupler modes since both waves <b>706</b> and <b>708</b> propagate about the outside of the arc coupler <b>704</b> and wire <b>702</b> respectively. In some embodiments, as the wave <b>706</b> couples to the wire <b>702</b>, the modes can change form, or new modes can be created or generated, due to the coupling between the arc coupler <b>704</b> and the wire <b>702</b>. For example, differences in size, material, and/or impedances of the arc coupler <b>704</b> and wire <b>702</b> may create additional modes not present in the arc coupler modes and/or suppress some of the arc coupler modes. The wave propagation modes can comprise the fundamental transverse magnetic mode (TM<sub>00</sub>), where only small magnetic fields extend in the direction of propagation, and the electric field extends radially outwards and then longitudinally while the guided wave propagates along the wire. This guided wave mode can be donut shaped, where only a portion of the electromagnetic fields exist within the arc coupler <b>704</b> or wire <b>702</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">While the waves <b>706</b> and <b>708</b> can comprise a fundamental TM mode, the waves <b>706</b> and <b>708</b>, also or in the alternative, can comprise non-fundamental TM modes. While particular wave propagation modes are discussed above, other wave propagation modes in or along the coupler and/or along the wire are likewise possible such as transverse electric (TE) and hybrid (EH or HE) modes, based on the frequencies employed, the design of the arc coupler <b>704</b>, the dimensions and composition of the wire <b>702</b>, as well as its surface characteristics, its insulation if present, the electromagnetic properties of the surrounding environment, etc. It should be noted that, depending on the frequency, the electrical and physical characteristics of the wire <b>702</b> and the particular wave propagation modes that are generated, guided wave <b>708</b> can travel along the conductive surface of an oxidized uninsulated wire, an unoxidized uninsulated wire, an insulated wire and/or along the insulating surface of an insulated wire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">In an embodiment, a diameter of the arc coupler <b>704</b> is smaller than the diameter of the wire <b>702</b>. For the millimeter-band wavelength being used, the arc coupler <b>704</b> supports a single waveguide mode that makes up wave <b>706</b>. This single waveguide mode can change as it couples to the wire <b>702</b> as guided wave <b>708</b>. If the arc coupler <b>704</b> were larger, more than one waveguide mode can be supported, but these additional waveguide modes may not couple to the wire <b>702</b> as efficiently, and higher coupling losses can result. However, in some alternative embodiments, the diameter of the arc coupler <b>704</b> can be equal to or larger than the diameter of the wire <b>702</b>, for example, where higher coupling losses are desirable or when used in conjunction with other techniques to otherwise reduce coupling losses (e.g., impedance matching with tapering, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">In an embodiment, the wavelength of the waves <b>706</b> and <b>708</b> are comparable in size, or smaller than a circumference of the arc coupler <b>704</b> and the wire <b>702</b>. In an example, if the wire <b>702</b> has a diameter of 0.5 cm, and a corresponding circumference of around 1.5 cm, the wavelength of the transmission is around 1.5 cm or less, corresponding to a frequency of 70 GHz or greater. In another embodiment, a suitable frequency of the transmission and the carrier-wave signal is in the range of 30-100 GHz, perhaps around 30-60 GHz, and around 38 GHz in one example. In an embodiment, when the circumference of the arc coupler <b>704</b> and wire <b>702</b> is comparable in size to, or greater, than a wavelength of the transmission, the waves <b>706</b> and <b>708</b> can exhibit multiple wave propagation modes including fundamental and/or non-fundamental (symmetric and/or asymmetric, circular and/or non-circular) modes that propagate over sufficient distances to support various communication systems described herein. The waves <b>706</b> and <b>708</b> can therefore comprise more than one type of electric and magnetic field configuration. In an embodiment, as the guided wave <b>708</b> propagates down the wire <b>702</b>, the electrical and magnetic field configurations will remain the same from end to end of the wire <b>702</b>. In other embodiments, as the guided wave <b>708</b> encounters interference (distortion or obstructions) or loses energy due to transmission losses or scattering, the electric and magnetic field configurations can change as the guided wave <b>708</b> propagates down wire <b>702</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">In an embodiment, the arc coupler <b>704</b> can be composed of nylon, Teflon, polyethylene, a polyamide, or other plastics.

In an embodiment, a dielectric or otherwise non-conducting/insulated waveguide can be paired with either a bare/metallic wire or insulated wire. In other embodiments, a metallic and/or conductive waveguide can be paired with a bare/metallic wire or insulated wire. In an embodiment, an oxidation layer on the bare metallic surface of the wire <b>702</b> (e.g., resulting from exposure of the bare metallic surface to oxygen/air) can also provide insulating or dielectric properties similar to those provided by some insulators or sheathings.</div>

The coupler <b>952</b> couples an electromagnetic wave for propagation as a guided wave along an outer surface of a wire <b>702</b> or other transmission medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">The coupler <b>952</b> guides the electromagnetic wave to a junction at x<sub>0 </sub>via a symmetrical guided wave mode.

The junction at x<sub>0 </sub>couples the electromagnetic wave to the wire <b>702</b> or other transmission medium at an azimuthal angle corresponding to the bottom of the transmission medium.

In particular, the communications interface <b>1008</b> is an example of communications interface <b>205</b>, the stub coupler <b>1002</b> is an example of coupler <b>220</b>, and the transmitter/receiver device <b>1006</b>, diplexer <b>1016</b>, power amplifier <b>1014</b>, low noise amplifier <b>1018</b>, frequency mixers <b>1010</b> and <b>1020</b> and local oscillator <b>1012</b> collectively form an example of transceiver <b>210</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">In operation, the transmitter/receiver device <b>1006</b> launches and receives waves (e.g., guided wave <b>1004</b> onto stub coupler <b>1002</b>). The guided waves <b>1004</b> can be used to transport signals received from and sent to a host device, base station, mobile devices, a building or other device by way of a communications interface <b>1008</b>. The communications interface <b>1008</b> can be an integral part of system <b>1000</b>. Alternatively, the communications interface <b>1008</b> can be tethered to system <b>1000</b>. The communications interface <b>1008</b> can comprise a wireless interface for interfacing to the host device, base station, mobile devices, a building or other device utilizing any of various present or future wireless signaling protocols (e.g., LTE, WiFi, WiMAX, IEEE 802.xx, 5G, etc.) including an infrared protocol such as an infrared data association (IrDA) protocol or other line of sight optical protocol. The communications interface <b>1008</b> can also comprise a wired interface such as a fiber optic line, coaxial cable, twisted pair, category 5 (CAT-5) cable or other suitable wired or optical mediums for communicating with the host device, base station, mobile devices, a building or other device via a protocol such as an Ethernet protocol, universal serial bus (USB) protocol, a data over cable service interface specification (DOCSIS) protocol, a digital subscriber line (DSL) protocol, a Firewire (IEEE 1394) protocol, or other wired or optical protocol. For embodiments where system <b>1000</b> functions as a repeater, the communications interface <b>1008</b> may not be necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">The output signals (e.g., Tx) of the communications interface <b>1008</b> can be combined with a carrier wave (e.g., millimeter-wave carrier wave) generated by a local oscillator <b>1012</b> at frequency mixer <b>1010</b>. Frequency mixer <b>1010</b> can use heterodyning techniques or other frequency shifting techniques to frequency shift the output signals from communications interface <b>1008</b>. For example, signals sent to and from the communications interface <b>1008</b> can be modulated signals such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) signals formatted in accordance with a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) wireless protocol or other wireless 3G, 4G, 5G or higher voice and data protocol, a Zigbee®, WIMAX, UltraWideband or IEEE 802.11 wireless protocol; a wired protocol such as an Ethernet protocol, universal serial bus (USB) protocol, a data over cable service interface specification (DOCSIS) protocol, a digital subscriber line (DSL) protocol, a Firewire (IEEE 1394) protocol or other wired or wireless protocol. In an example embodiment, this frequency conversion can be done in the analog domain, and as a result, the frequency shifting can be done without regard to the type of communications protocol used by a base station, mobile devices, or in-building devices. As new communications technologies are developed, the communications interface <b>1008</b> can be upgraded (e.g., updated with software, firmware, and/or hardware) or replaced and the frequency shifting and transmission apparatus can remain, simplifying upgrades. The carrier wave can then be sent to a power amplifier (“PA”) <b>1014</b> and can be transmitted via the transmitter receiver device <b>1006</b> via the diplexer <b>1016</b>.</div>

In some embodiments, the guided wave <b>1004</b> can propagate in part on the outer surface of the stub coupler <b>1002</b> and in part inside the stub coupler <b>1002</b>. In other embodiments, the guided wave <b>1004</b> can propagate substantially or completely on the outer surface of the stub coupler <b>1002</b>. In yet other embodiments, the guided wave <b>1004</b> can propagate substantially or completely inside the stub coupler <b>1002</b>. In this latter embodiment, the guided wave <b>1004</b> can radiate at an end of the stub coupler <b>1002</b> (such as the tapered end shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) for coupling to a transmission medium such as a wire <b>702</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Similarly, if guided wave <b>1004</b> is incoming (coupled to the stub coupler <b>1002</b> from a wire <b>702</b>), guided wave <b>1004</b> then enters the transmitter/receiver device <b>1006</b> and couples to the cylindrical waveguide or conducting waveguide.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">In an embodiment, stub coupler <b>1002</b> can be wholly constructed of a dielectric material (or another suitable insulating material), without any metallic or otherwise conducting materials therein. Stub coupler <b>1002</b> can be composed of nylon, Teflon, polyethylene, a polyamide, other plastics, or other materials that are non-conducting and suitable for facilitating transmission of electromagnetic waves at least in part on an outer surface of such materials. In another embodiment, stub coupler <b>1002</b> can include a core that is conducting/metallic, and have an exterior dielectric surface. Similarly, a transmission medium that couples to the stub coupler <b>1002</b> for propagating electromagnetic waves induced by the stub coupler <b>1002</b> or for supplying electromagnetic waves to the stub coupler <b>1002</b> can, in addition to being a bare or insulated wire, be wholly constructed of a dielectric material (or another suitable insulating material), without any metallic or otherwise conducting materials therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">It is noted that although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows that the opening of transmitter receiver device <b>1006</b> is much wider than the stub coupler <b>1002</b>, this is not to scale, and that in other embodiments the width of the stub coupler <b>1002</b> is comparable or slightly smaller than the opening of the hollow waveguide. It is also not shown, but in an embodiment, an end of the coupler <b>1002</b> that is inserted into the transmitter/receiver device <b>1006</b> tapers down in order to reduce reflection and increase coupling efficiencies. The stub coupler <b>1002</b> can be representative of the arch coupler <b>704</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the stub coupler <b>904</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the coupler <b>952</b>, or any other couplers described in the subject disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">Before coupling to the stub coupler <b>1002</b>, the one or more waveguide modes of the guided wave generated by the transmitter/receiver device <b>1006</b> can couple to the stub coupler <b>1002</b> to induce one or more wave propagation modes of the guided wave <b>1004</b>. The wave propagation modes of the guided wave <b>1004</b> can be different than the hollow metal waveguide modes due to the different characteristics of the hollow metal waveguide and the dielectric waveguide. For instance, wave propagation modes of the guided wave <b>1004</b> can comprise the fundamental transverse magnetic mode (TM<sub>00</sub>), where only small magnetic fields extend in the direction of propagation, HE11 or other modes supported by the stub coupler <b>1002</b> that generate one or more desired wave modes on the transmission medium. The fundamental transverse electromagnetic mode wave propagation mode may or may not exist inside a waveguide that is hollow. Therefore, the hollow metal waveguide modes that are used by transmitter/receiver device <b>1006</b> are waveguide modes, such as TE01 or TE11, that can propagate inside a circular, rectangular or other hollow metallic waveguide and couple effectively and efficiently to wave propagation modes of stub coupler <b>1002</b>.</div>

In an embodiment, two or more couplers (such as the stub couplers <b>1104</b> and <b>1106</b>) can be positioned around a wire <b>1102</b> in order to receive guided wave <b>1108</b>. In an embodiment, one coupler is enough to receive the guided wave <b>1108</b>. In that case, guided wave <b>1108</b> couples to coupler <b>1104</b> and propagates as guided wave <b>1110</b>. If the field structure of the guided wave <b>1108</b> oscillates or undulates around the wire <b>1102</b> due to the particular guided wave mode(s) or various outside factors, then coupler <b>1106</b> can be placed such that guided wave <b>1108</b> couples to coupler <b>1106</b>. In some embodiments, four or more couplers can be placed around a portion of the wire <b>1102</b>, e.g., at 90 degrees or another spacing with respect to each other, in order to receive guided waves that may oscillate or rotate around the wire <b>1102</b>, that have been induced at different azimuthal orientations or that have non-fundamental or higher order modes that, for example, have lobes and/or nulls or other asymmetries that are orientation dependent. However, it will be appreciated that there may be less than or more than four couplers placed around a portion of the wire <b>1102</b> without departing from example embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">It should be noted that while couplers <b>1106</b> and <b>1104</b> are illustrated as stub couplers, any other of the coupler designs described herein including arc couplers, antenna or horn couplers, magnetic couplers, etc., could likewise be used. It will also be appreciated that while some example embodiments have presented a plurality of couplers around at least a portion of a wire <b>1102</b>, this plurality of couplers can also be considered as part of a single coupler system having multiple coupler subcomponents. For example, two or more couplers can be manufactured as single system that can be installed around a wire in a single installation such that the couplers are either pre-positioned or adjustable relative to each other (either manually or automatically with a controllable mechanism such as a motor or other actuator) in accordance with the single system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">Receivers coupled to couplers <b>1106</b> and <b>1104</b> can use diversity combining to combine signals received from both couplers <b>1106</b> and <b>1104</b> in order to maximize the signal quality. In other embodiments, if one or the other of the couplers <b>1104</b> and <b>1106</b> receive a transmission that is above a predetermined threshold, receivers can use selection diversity when deciding which signal to use. Further, while reception by a plurality of couplers <b>1106</b> and <b>1104</b> is illustrated, transmission by couplers <b>1106</b> and <b>1104</b> in the same configuration can likewise take place. In particular, a wide range of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission and reception techniques can be employed for transmissions where a transmission device, such as transmission device <b>101</b> or <b>102</b> presented in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes multiple transceivers and multiple couplers.

An extractor (or demultiplexer) <b>1432</b> can extract the signal on a subcarrier and direct the signal to an output component <b>1422</b> for optional amplification, buffering or isolation by power amplifier <b>1424</b> for coupling to communications interface <b>205</b>. The communications interface <b>205</b> can further process the signals received from the power amplifier <b>1424</b> or otherwise transmit such signals over a wireless or wired interface to other devices such as a base station, mobile devices, a building, etc. For the signals that are not being extracted at this location, extractor <b>1432</b> can redirect them to another frequency mixer <b>1436</b>, where the signals are used to modulate a carrier wave generated by local oscillator <b>1414</b>. The carrier wave, with its subcarriers, is directed to a power amplifier (“PA”) <b>1416</b> and is retransmitted by waveguide coupling device <b>1404</b> to another system, via diplexer <b>1420</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">An LNA <b>1426</b> can be used to amplify, buffer or isolate signals that are received by the communication interface <b>205</b> and then send the signal to a multiplexer <b>1434</b> which merges the signal with signals that have been received from waveguide coupling device <b>1404</b>. The signals received from coupling device <b>1404</b> have been split by diplexer <b>1420</b>, and then passed through LNA <b>1418</b>, and downshifted in frequency by frequency mixer <b>1438</b>. When the signals are combined by multiplexer <b>1434</b>, they are upshifted in frequency by frequency mixer <b>1430</b>, and then boosted by PA <b>1410</b>, and transmitted to another system by waveguide coupling device <b>1402</b>. In an embodiment bidirectional repeater system can be merely a repeater without the output device <b>1422</b>. In this embodiment, the multiplexer <b>1434</b> would not be utilized and signals from LNA <b>1418</b> would be directed to mixer <b>1430</b> as previously described. It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the bidirectional repeater system could also be implemented using two distinct and separate unidirectional repeaters. In an alternative embodiment, a bidirectional repeater system could also be a booster or otherwise perform retransmissions without downshifting and upshifting. Indeed in example embodiment, the retransmissions can be based upon receiving a signal or guided wave and performing some signal or guided wave processing or reshaping, filtering, and/or amplification, prior to retransmission of the signal or guided wave.</div>

The communication system <b>1655</b> comprises a plurality of waveguide systems <b>1602</b> coupled to power lines <b>1610</b> of the power grid <b>1653</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of an example, non-limiting embodiment of a method <b>1700</b> for detecting and mitigating disturbances occurring in a communication network of the systems of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A &amp; 16B</figref>. Method <b>1700</b> can begin with step <b>1702</b> where a waveguide system <b>1602</b> transmits and receives messages embedded in, or forming part of, modulated electromagnetic waves or another type of electromagnetic waves traveling along a surface of a power line <b>1610</b>. The messages can be voice messages, streaming video, and/or other data/information exchanged between communication devices communicatively coupled to the communication system <b>1655</b>. At step <b>1704</b> the sensors <b>1604</b> of the waveguide system <b>1602</b> can collect sensing data. In an embodiment, the sensing data can be collected in step <b>1704</b> prior to, during, or after the transmission and/or receipt of messages in step <b>1702</b>. At step <b>1706</b> the waveguide system <b>1602</b> (or the sensors <b>1604</b> themselves) can determine from the sensing data an actual or predicted occurrence of a disturbance in the communication system <b>1655</b> that can affect communications originating from (e.g., transmitted by) or received by the waveguide system <b>1602</b>. The waveguide system <b>1602</b> (or the sensors <b>1604</b>) can process temperature data, signal reflection data, loss of energy data, noise data, vibration data, environmental data, or any combination thereof to make this determination. The waveguide system <b>1602</b> (or the sensors <b>1604</b>) may also detect, identify, estimate, or predict the source of the disturbance and/or its location in the communication system <b>1655</b>. If a disturbance is neither detected/identified nor predicted/estimated at step <b>1708</b>, the waveguide system <b>1602</b> can proceed to step <b>1702</b> where it continues to transmit and receive messages embedded in, or forming part of, modulated electromagnetic waves traveling along a surface of the power line <b>1610</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">If at step <b>1708</b> a disturbance is detected/identified or predicted/estimated to occur, the waveguide system <b>1602</b> proceeds to step <b>1710</b> to determine if the disturbance adversely affects (or alternatively, is likely to adversely affect or the extent to which it may adversely affect) transmission or reception of messages in the communication system <b>1655</b>. In one embodiment, a duration threshold and a frequency of occurrence threshold can be used at step <b>1710</b> to determine when a disturbance adversely affects communications in the communication system <b>1655</b>. For illustration purposes only, assume a duration threshold is set to 500 ms, while a frequency of occurrence threshold is set to 5 disturbances occurring in an observation period of 10 sec. Thus, a disturbance having a duration greater than 500 ms will trigger the duration threshold. Additionally, any disturbance occurring more than 5 times in a 10 sec time interval will trigger the frequency of occurrence threshold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">In one embodiment, a disturbance may be considered to adversely affect signal integrity in the communication systems <b>1655</b> when the duration threshold alone is exceeded. In another embodiment, a disturbance may be considered as adversely affecting signal integrity in the communication systems <b>1655</b> when both the duration threshold and the frequency of occurrence threshold are exceeded. The latter embodiment is thus more conservative than the former embodiment for classifying disturbances that adversely affect signal integrity in the communication system <b>1655</b>. It will be appreciated that many other algorithms and associated parameters and thresholds can be utilized for step <b>1710</b> in accordance with example embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">Referring back to method <b>1700</b>, if at step <b>1710</b> the disturbance detected at step <b>1708</b> does not meet the condition for adversely affected communications (e.g., neither exceeds the duration threshold nor the frequency of occurrence threshold), the waveguide system <b>1602</b> may proceed to step <b>1702</b> and continue processing messages. For instance, if the disturbance detected in step <b>1708</b> has a duration of 1 msec with a single occurrence in a 10 sec time period, then neither threshold will be exceeded. Consequently, such a disturbance may be considered as having a nominal effect on signal integrity in the communication system <b>1655</b> and thus would not be flagged as a disturbance requiring mitigation. Although not flagged, the occurrence of the disturbance, its time of occurrence, its frequency of occurrence, spectral data, and/or other useful information, may be reported to the network management system <b>1601</b> as telemetry data for monitoring purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">Referring back to step <b>1710</b>, if on the other hand the disturbance satisfies the condition for adversely affected communications (e.g., exceeds either or both thresholds), the waveguide system <b>1602</b> can proceed to step <b>1712</b> and report the incident to the network management system <b>1601</b>. The report can include raw sensing data collected by the sensors <b>1604</b>, a description of the disturbance if known by the waveguide system <b>1602</b>, a time of occurrence of the disturbance, a frequency of occurrence of the disturbance, a location associated with the disturbance, parameters readings such as bit error rate, packet loss rate, retransmission requests, jitter, latency and so on. If the disturbance is based on a prediction by one or more sensors of the waveguide system <b>1602</b>, the report can include a type of disturbance expected, and if predictable, an expected time occurrence of the disturbance, and an expected frequency of occurrence of the predicted disturbance when the prediction is based on historical sensing data collected by the sensors <b>1604</b> of the waveguide system <b>1602</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">At step <b>1714</b>, the network management system <b>1601</b> can determine a mitigation, circumvention, or correction technique, which may include directing the waveguide system <b>1602</b> to reroute traffic to circumvent the disturbance if the location of the disturbance can be determined. In one embodiment, the waveguide coupling device <b>1402</b> detecting the disturbance may direct a repeater such as the one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-14</figref> to connect the waveguide system <b>1602</b> from a primary power line affected by the disturbance to a secondary power line to enable the waveguide system <b>1602</b> to reroute traffic to a different transmission medium and avoid the disturbance. In an embodiment where the waveguide system <b>1602</b> is configured as a repeater the waveguide system <b>1602</b> can itself perform the rerouting of traffic from the primary power line to the secondary power line. It is further noted that for bidirectional communications (e.g., full or half-duplex communications), the repeater can be configured to reroute traffic from the secondary power line back to the primary power line for processing by the waveguide system <b>1602</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">In another embodiment, the waveguide system <b>1602</b> can redirect traffic by instructing a first repeater situated upstream of the disturbance and a second repeater situated downstream of the disturbance to redirect traffic from a primary power line temporarily to a secondary power line and back to the primary power line in a manner that avoids the disturbance. It is further noted that for bidirectional communications (e.g., full or half-duplex communications), repeaters can be configured to reroute traffic from the secondary power line back to the primary power line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">To avoid interrupting existing communication sessions occurring on a secondary power line, the network management system <b>1601</b> may direct the waveguide system <b>1602</b> to instruct repeater(s) to utilize unused time slot(s) and/or frequency band(s) of the secondary power line for redirecting data and/or voice traffic away from the primary power line to circumvent the disturbance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">At step <b>1716</b>, while traffic is being rerouted to avoid the disturbance, the network management system <b>1601</b> can notify equipment of the utility company <b>1652</b> and/or equipment of the communications service provider <b>1654</b>, which in turn may notify personnel of the utility company <b>1656</b> and/or personnel of the communications service provider <b>1658</b> of the detected disturbance and its location if known. Field personnel from either party can attend to resolving the disturbance at a determined location of the disturbance. Once the disturbance is removed or otherwise mitigated by personnel of the utility company and/or personnel of the communications service provider, such personnel can notify their respective companies and/or the network management system <b>1601</b> utilizing field equipment (e.g., a laptop computer, smartphone, etc.) communicatively coupled to network management system <b>1601</b>, and/or equipment of the utility company and/or the communications service provider. The notification can include a description of how the disturbance was mitigated and any changes to the power lines <b>1610</b> that may change a topology of the communication system <b>1655</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">Once the disturbance has been resolved (as determined in decision <b>1718</b>), the network management system <b>1601</b> can direct the waveguide system <b>1602</b> at step <b>1720</b> to restore the previous routing configuration used by the waveguide system <b>1602</b> or route traffic according to a new routing configuration if the restoration strategy used to mitigate the disturbance resulted in a new network topology of the communication system <b>1655</b>. In another embodiment, the waveguide system <b>1602</b> can be configured to monitor mitigation of the disturbance by transmitting test signals on the power line <b>1610</b> to determine when the disturbance has been removed. Once the waveguide system <b>1602</b> detects an absence of the disturbance it can autonomously restore its routing configuration without assistance by the network management system <b>1601</b> if it determines the network topology of the communication system <b>1655</b> has not changed, or it can utilize a new routing configuration that adapts to a detected new network topology.</div>

In one embodiment, method <b>1750</b> can begin with step <b>1752</b> where a network management system <b>1601</b> receives from equipment of the utility company <b>1652</b> or equipment of the communications service provider <b>1654</b> maintenance information associated with a maintenance schedule. The network management system <b>1601</b> can at step <b>1754</b> identify from the maintenance information, maintenance activities to be performed during the maintenance schedule. From these activities, the network management system <b>1601</b> can detect a disturbance resulting from the maintenance (e.g., scheduled replacement of a power line <b>1610</b>, scheduled replacement of a waveguide system <b>1602</b> on the power line <b>1610</b>, scheduled reconfiguration of power lines <b>1610</b> in the power grid <b>1653</b>, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">In another embodiment, the network management system <b>1601</b> can receive at step <b>1755</b> telemetry information from one or more waveguide systems <b>1602</b>. The telemetry information can include among other things an identity of each waveguide system <b>1602</b> submitting the telemetry information, measurements taken by sensors <b>1604</b> of each waveguide system <b>1602</b>, information relating to predicted, estimated, or actual disturbances detected by the sensors <b>1604</b> of each waveguide system <b>1602</b>, location information associated with each waveguide system <b>1602</b>, an estimated location of a detected disturbance, an identification of the disturbance, and so on. The network management system <b>1601</b> can determine from the telemetry information a type of disturbance that may be adverse to operations of the waveguide, transmission of the electromagnetic waves along the wire surface, or both. The network management system <b>1601</b> can also use telemetry information from multiple waveguide systems <b>1602</b> to isolate and identify the disturbance. Additionally, the network management system <b>1601</b> can request telemetry information from waveguide systems <b>1602</b> in a vicinity of an affected waveguide system <b>1602</b> to triangulate a location of the disturbance and/or validate an identification of the disturbance by receiving similar telemetry information from other waveguide systems <b>1602</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">In yet another embodiment, the network management system <b>1601</b> can receive at step <b>1756</b> an unscheduled activity report from maintenance field personnel. Unscheduled maintenance may occur as result of field calls that are unplanned or as a result of unexpected field issues discovered during field calls or scheduled maintenance activities. The activity report can identify changes to a topology configuration of the power grid <b>1653</b> resulting from field personnel addressing discovered issues in the communication system <b>1655</b> and/or power grid <b>1653</b>, changes to one or more waveguide systems <b>1602</b> (such as replacement or repair thereof), mitigation of disturbances performed if any, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">At step <b>1758</b>, the network management system <b>1601</b> can determine from reports received according to steps <b>1752</b> through <b>1756</b> if a disturbance will occur based on a maintenance schedule, or if a disturbance has occurred or is predicted to occur based on telemetry data, or if a disturbance has occurred due to an unplanned maintenance identified in a field activity report. From any of these reports, the network management system <b>1601</b> can determine whether a detected or predicted disturbance requires rerouting of traffic by the affected waveguide systems <b>1602</b> or other waveguide systems <b>1602</b> of the communication system <b>1655</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0222">When a disturbance is detected or predicted at step <b>1758</b>, the network management system <b>1601</b> can proceed to step <b>1760</b> where it can direct one or more waveguide systems <b>1602</b> to reroute traffic to circumvent the disturbance. When the disturbance is permanent due to a permanent topology change of the power grid <b>1653</b>, the network management system <b>1601</b> can proceed to step <b>1770</b> and skip steps <b>1762</b>, <b>1764</b>, <b>1766</b>, and <b>1772</b>. At step <b>1770</b>, the network management system <b>1601</b> can direct one or more waveguide systems <b>1602</b> to use a new routing configuration that adapts to the new topology. However, when the disturbance has been detected from telemetry information supplied by one or more waveguide systems <b>1602</b>, the network management system <b>1601</b> can notify maintenance personnel of the utility company <b>1656</b> or the communications service provider <b>1658</b> of a location of the disturbance, a type of disturbance if known, and related information that may be helpful to such personnel to mitigate the disturbance. When a disturbance is expected due to maintenance activities, the network management system <b>1601</b> can direct one or more waveguide systems <b>1602</b> to reconfigure traffic routes at a given schedule (consistent with the maintenance schedule) to avoid disturbances caused by the maintenance activities during the maintenance schedule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0223">Returning back to step <b>1760</b> and upon its completion, the process can continue with step <b>1762</b>. At step <b>1762</b>, the network management system <b>1601</b> can monitor when the disturbance(s) have been mitigated by field personnel. Mitigation of a disturbance can be detected at step <b>1762</b> by analyzing field reports submitted to the network management system <b>1601</b> by field personnel over a communications network (e.g., cellular communication system) utilizing field equipment (e.g., a laptop computer or handheld computer/device). If field personnel have reported that a disturbance has been mitigated, the network management system <b>1601</b> can proceed to step <b>1764</b> to determine from the field report whether a topology change was required to mitigate the disturbance. A topology change can include rerouting a power line <b>1610</b>, reconfiguring a waveguide system <b>1602</b> to utilize a different power line <b>1610</b>, otherwise utilizing an alternative link to bypass the disturbance and so on. If a topology change has taken place, the network management system <b>1601</b> can direct at step <b>1770</b> one or more waveguide systems <b>1602</b> to use a new routing configuration that adapts to the new topology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0224">If, however, a topology change has not been reported by field personnel, the network management system <b>1601</b> can proceed to step <b>1766</b> where it can direct one or more waveguide systems <b>1602</b> to send test signals to test a routing configuration that had been used prior to the detected disturbance(s). Test signals can be sent to affected waveguide systems <b>1602</b> in a vicinity of the disturbance. The test signals can be used to determine if signal disturbances (e.g., electromagnetic wave reflections) are detected by any of the waveguide systems <b>1602</b>. If the test signals confirm that a prior routing configuration is no longer subject to previously detected disturbance(s), then the network management system <b>1601</b> can at step <b>1772</b> direct the affected waveguide systems <b>1602</b> to restore a previous routing configuration. If, however, test signals analyzed by one or more waveguide coupling device <b>1402</b> and reported to the network management system <b>1601</b> indicate that the disturbance(s) or new disturbance(s) are present, then the network management system <b>1601</b> will proceed to step <b>1768</b> and report this information to field personnel to further address field issues. The network management system <b>1601</b> can in this situation continue to monitor mitigation of the disturbance(s) at step <b>1762</b>.</div>

In an embodiment, an outer surface of the dielectric foam <b>1804</b> can be further surrounded in whole or in part by a third dielectric material <b>1806</b>, which can serve as an outer jacket (referred to herein as jacket <b>1806</b>). The jacket <b>1806</b> can prevent exposure of the dielectric core <b>1802</b> and the dielectric foam <b>1804</b> to an environment that can adversely affect the propagation of electromagnetic waves (e.g., water, soil, etc.).</div>

Each antenna <b>1855</b> can serve as a directional antenna for radiating wireless signals directed to wireless communication devices or for inducing electromagnetic wave propagation on a surface of a transmission medium (e.g., a power line).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">It is further noted that the terms “core”, “cladding”, “shell”, and “foam” as utilized in the subject disclosure can comprise any types of materials (or combinations of materials) that enable electromagnetic waves to remain bound to the core while propagating longitudinally along the core. For example, a strip of dielectric foam <b>1804</b> described earlier can be replaced with a strip of an ordinary dielectric material (e.g., polyethylene) for wrapping around the dielectric core <b>1802</b> (referred to herein for illustration purposes only as a “wrap”). In this configuration an average density of the wrap can be small as a result of air space between sections of the wrap. Consequently, an effective dielectric constant of the wrap can be less than the dielectric constant of the dielectric core <b>1802</b>, thereby enabling guided electromagnetic waves to remain bound to the core. Accordingly, any of the embodiments of the subject disclosure relating to materials used for core(s) and wrappings about the core(s) can be structurally adapted and/or modified with other dielectric materials that achieve the result of maintaining electromagnetic waves bound to the core(s) while they propagate along the core(s). Additionally, a core in whole or in part as described in any of the embodiments of the subject disclosure can comprise an opaque material (e.g., polyethylene) that is resistant to propagation of electromagnetic waves having an optical operating frequency.

In an embodiment, the radiated e-fields <b>1861</b> of pairs of symmetrically positioned slots <b>1863</b> (e.g., north and south slots of the waveguide <b>1865</b>) can be directed away from each other (i.e., polar opposite radial orientations about the cable <b>1862</b>). While the slots <b>1863</b> are shown as having a rectangular shape, other shapes such as other polygons, sector and arc shapes, ellipsoid shapes and other shapes are likewise possible. For illustration purposes only, the term north will refer to a relative azimuthal direction/orientation as shown in the figures. All references in the subject disclosure to other directions/orientations (e.g., south, east, west, northwest, and so forth) will be relative to northern illustration. In an embodiment, to achieve e-fields with opposing orientations at the north and south slots <b>1863</b>, for example, the north and south slots <b>1863</b> can be arranged to have a circumferential distance between each other that is approximately one wavelength of electromagnetic waves signals supplied to these slots. The waveguide <b>1865</b> can have a cylindrical cavity in a center of the waveguide <b>1865</b> to enable placement of a cable <b>1862</b>. In one embodiment, the cable <b>1862</b> can comprise an insulated conductor. In another embodiment, the cable <b>1862</b> can comprise an uninsulated conductor. In yet other embodiments, the cable <b>1862</b> can comprise any of the embodiments of a transmission core <b>1852</b> of cable <b>1850</b> previously described.</div>

According to these and other suitable embodiments, the waveguide <b>1865</b> can be configured to wrap around the cable <b>1862</b> like a collar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0241"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref> illustrates a side view of an embodiment of the waveguide <b>1865</b>.

The electromagnetic waves <b>1866</b> can be distributed by the hollow rectangular waveguide portion <b>1867</b> into in a hollow collar <b>1869</b> of the waveguide <b>1865</b>. The rectangular waveguide portion <b>1867</b> and the hollow collar <b>1869</b> can be constructed of materials suitable for maintaining the electromagnetic waves within the hollow chambers of these assemblies (e.g., carbon fiber materials). It should be noted that while the waveguide portion <b>1867</b> is shown and described in a hollow rectangular configuration, other shapes and/or other non-hollow configurations can be employed. In particular, the waveguide portion <b>1867</b> can have a square or other polygonal cross section, an arc or sector cross section that is truncated to conform to the outer surface of the cable <b>1862</b>, a circular or ellipsoid cross section or cross sectional shape. In addition, the waveguide portion <b>1867</b> can be configured as, or otherwise include, a solid dielectric material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0242">As previously described, the hollow collar <b>1869</b> can be configured to emit electromagnetic waves from each slot <b>1863</b> with opposite e-fields <b>1861</b> at pairs of symmetrically positioned slots <b>1863</b> and <b>1863</b>′.

In this configuration, the electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> can propagate longitudinally along the cable <b>1862</b> to other downstream waveguide systems coupled to the cable <b>1862</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">It should be noted that since the hollow rectangular waveguide portion <b>1867</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref> is closer to slot <b>1863</b> (at the northern position of the waveguide <b>1865</b>), slot <b>1863</b> can emit electromagnetic waves having a stronger magnitude than electromagnetic waves emitted by slot <b>1863</b>′ (at the southern position). To reduce magnitude differences between these slots, slot <b>1863</b>′ can be made larger than slot <b>1863</b>. The technique of utilizing different slot sizes to balance signal magnitudes between slots can be applied to any of the embodiments of the subject disclosure relating to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18D, 18E, 18G, and 18I</figref>—some of which are described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">In another embodiment, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18F</figref> depicts a waveguide <b>1865</b>′ that can be configured to utilize circuitry such as monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) <b>1870</b> each coupled to a signal input <b>1872</b> (e.g., coaxial cable that provides a communication signal). The signal input <b>1872</b> can be generated by a transmitter circuit as previously described in the subject disclosure (e.g., see reference <b>101</b>, <b>1000</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</figref>) adapted to provide electrical signals to the MMICs <b>1870</b>. Each MMIC <b>1870</b> can be configured to receive signal <b>1872</b> which the MMIC <b>1870</b> can modulate and transmit with a radiating element (e.g., an antenna) to emit electromagnetic waves having radiated e-fields <b>1861</b>. In one embodiment, the MMICs <b>1870</b> can be configured to receive the same signal <b>1872</b>, but transmit electromagnetic waves having e-fields <b>1861</b> of opposing orientation. This can be accomplished by configuring one of the MMICs <b>1870</b> to transmit electromagnetic waves that are 180 degrees out of phase with the electromagnetic waves transmitted by the other MMIC <b>1870</b>. In an embodiment, the combination of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the MMICs <b>1870</b> can together induce electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> that are bound to the cable <b>1862</b> for propagation according to a fundamental wave mode without other wave modes present—such as non-fundamental wave modes. In this configuration, the electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> can propagate longitudinally along the cable <b>1862</b> to other downstream waveguide systems coupled to the cable <b>1862</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">A tapered horn <b>1880</b> can be added to the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18E and 18F</figref> to assist in the inducement of the electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> on cable <b>1862</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18G and 18H</figref>. In an embodiment where the cable <b>1862</b> is an uninsulated conductor, the electromagnetic waves induced on the cable <b>1862</b> can have a large radial dimension (e.g., 1 meter). To enable use of a smaller tapered horn <b>1880</b>, an insulation layer <b>1879</b> can be applied on a portion of the cable <b>1862</b> at or near the cavity as depicted with hash lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18G and 18H</figref>. The insulation layer <b>1879</b> can have a tapered end facing away from the waveguide <b>1865</b>. The added insulation enables the electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> initially launched by the waveguide <b>1865</b> (or <b>1865</b>′) to be tightly bound to the insulation, which in turn reduces the radial dimension of the electromagnetic fields <b>1868</b> (e.g., centimeters). As the electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> propagate away from the waveguide <b>1865</b> (<b>1865</b>′) and reach the tapered end of the insulation layer <b>1879</b>, the radial dimension of the electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> begin to increase eventually achieving the radial dimension they would have had had the electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> been induced on the uninsulated conductor without an insulation layer. In the illustration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18G and 18H</figref> the tapered end begins at an end of the tapered horn <b>1880</b>. In other embodiments, the tapered end of the insulation layer <b>1879</b> can begin before or after the end of the tapered horn <b>1880</b>. The tapered horn can be metallic or constructed of other conductive material or constructed of a plastic or other non-conductive material that is coated or clad with a dielectric layer or doped with a conductive material to provide reflective properties similar to a metallic horn.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">In an embodiment, cable <b>1862</b> can comprise any of the embodiments of cable <b>1850</b> described earlier. In this embodiment, waveguides <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′ can be coupled to a transmission core <b>1852</b> of cable <b>1850</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18I and 18J</figref>. The waveguides <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′ can induce, as previously described, electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> on the transmission core <b>1852</b> for propagation entirely or partially within inner layers of cable <b>1850</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">It is noted that for the foregoing embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18G, 18H, 18I and 18J</figref>, electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> can be bidirectional. For example, electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> of a different operating frequency can be received by slots <b>1863</b> or MMICs <b>1870</b> of the waveguides <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′, respectively. Once received, the electromagnetic waves can be converted by a receiver circuit (e.g., see reference <b>101</b>, <b>1000</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 10</figref>) for generating a communication signal for processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">Although not shown, it is further noted that the waveguides <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′ can be adapted so that the waveguides <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′ can direct electromagnetic waves <b>1868</b> upstream or downstream longitudinally. For example, a first tapered horn <b>1880</b> coupled to a first instance of a waveguide <b>1865</b> or <b>1865</b>′ can be directed westerly on cable <b>1862</b>, while a second tapered horn <b>1880</b> coupled to a second instance of a waveguide <b>1865</b> or <b>1865</b>′ can be directed easterly on cable <b>1862</b>. The first and second instances of the waveguides <b>1865</b> or <b>1865</b>′ can be coupled so that in a repeater configuration, signals received by the first waveguide <b>1865</b> or <b>1865</b>′ can be provided to the second waveguide <b>1865</b> or <b>1865</b>′ for retransmission in an easterly direction on cable <b>1862</b>. The repeater configuration just described can also be applied from an easterly to westerly direction on cable <b>1862</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">In another embodiment, the waveguide <b>1865</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18G, 18H, 18I and 18J</figref> can also be configured to generate electromagnetic waves having non-fundamental wave modes. This can be accomplished by adding more MMICs <b>1870</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18K</figref>. Each MMIC <b>1870</b> can be configured to receive the same signal input <b>1872</b>. However, MMICs <b>1870</b> can selectively be configured to emit electromagnetic waves having differing phases using controllable phase-shifting circuitry in each MMIC <b>1870</b>. For example, the northerly and southerly MMICs <b>1870</b> can be configured to emit electromagnetic waves having a 180 degree phase difference, thereby aligning the e-fields either in a northerly or southerly direction. Any combination of pairs of MMICs <b>1870</b> (e.g., westerly and easterly MMICs <b>1870</b>, northwesterly and southeasterly MMICs <b>1870</b>, northeasterly and southwesterly MMICs <b>1870</b>) can be configured with opposing or aligned e-fields. Consequently, waveguide <b>1865</b>′ can be configured to generate electromagnetic waves with one or more non-fundamental wave modes such as TMnm, HEnm or EHnm modes where n and m are non-negative integers and either n or m is non-zero, electromagnetic waves with one or more fundamental wave modes such as TM00, or any combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">It is submitted that it is not necessary to select slots <b>1863</b> in pairs to generate electromagnetic waves having a non-fundamental wave mode. For example, electromagnetic waves having a non-fundamental wave mode can be generated by enabling a single slot from a plurality of slots and disabling all other slots. In particular, a single MMIC <b>1870</b> of the MMICs <b>1870</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18K</figref> can be configured to generate electromagnetic waves having a non-fundamental wave mode while all other MMICs <b>1870</b> are not in use or disabled. Likewise, other wave modes and wave mode combinations can be induced by enabling other non-null proper subsets of waveguide slots <b>1863</b> or the MMICs <b>1870</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">It is further noted that in some embodiments, the waveguide systems <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′ may generate combinations of fundamental and non-fundamental wave modes where one wave mode is dominant over the other. For example, in one embodiment electromagnetic waves generated by the waveguide systems <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′ may have a weak signal component that has a non-fundamental wave mode, and a substantially strong signal component that has a fundamental wave mode. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the electromagnetic waves have a substantially fundamental wave mode. In another embodiment electromagnetic waves generated by the waveguide systems <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′ may have a weak signal component that has a fundamental wave mode, and a substantially strong signal component that has a non-fundamental wave mode. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the electromagnetic waves have a substantially non-fundamental wave mode. Further, a non-dominant wave mode may be generated that propagates only trivial distances along the length of the transmission medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">It is also noted that the waveguide systems <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′ can be configured to generate instances of electromagnetic waves that have wave modes that can differ from a resulting wave mode or modes of the combined electromagnetic wave. It is further noted that each MMIC <b>1870</b> of the waveguide system <b>1865</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18K</figref> can be configured to generate an instance of electromagnetic waves having wave characteristics that differ from the wave characteristics of another instance of electromagnetic waves generated by another MIMIC <b>1870</b>. One MMIC <b>1870</b>, for example, can generate an instance of an electromagnetic wave having a spatial orientation and a phase, frequency, magnitude, electric field orientation, and/or magnetic field orientation that differs from the spatial orientation and phase, frequency, magnitude, electric field orientation, and/or magnetic field orientation of a different instance of another electromagnetic wave generated by another MIMIC <b>1870</b>. The waveguide system <b>1865</b>′ can thus be configured to generate instances of electromagnetic waves having different wave and spatial characteristics, which when combined achieve resulting electromagnetic waves having one or more desirable wave modes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">From these illustrations, it is submitted that the waveguide systems <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′ can be adapted to generate electromagnetic waves with one or more selectable wave modes. In one embodiment, for example, the waveguide systems <b>1865</b> and <b>1865</b>′ can be adapted to select one or more wave modes and generate electromagnetic waves having a single wave mode or multiple wave modes selected and produced from a process of combining instances of electromagnetic waves having one or more configurable wave and spatial characteristics. In an embodiment, for example, parametric information can be stored in a look-up table. Each entry in the look-up table can represent a selectable wave mode. A selectable wave mode can represent a single wave mode, or a combination of wave modes. The combination of wave modes can have one or dominant wave modes. The parametric information can provide configuration information for generating instances of electromagnetic waves for producing resultant electromagnetic waves that have the desired wave mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">For example, once a wave mode or modes is selected, the parametric information obtained from the look-up table from the entry associated with the selected wave mode(s) can be used to identify which of one or more MMICs <b>1870</b> to utilize, and/or their corresponding configurations to achieve electromagnetic waves having the desired wave mode(s). The parametric information may identify the selection of the one or more MMICs <b>1870</b> based on the spatial orientations of the MMICs <b>1870</b>, which may be required for producing electromagnetic waves with the desired wave mode. The parametric information can also provide information to configure each of the one or more MMICs <b>1870</b> with a particular phase, frequency, magnitude, electric field orientation, and/or magnetic field orientation which may or may not be the same for each of the selected MMICs <b>1870</b>. A look-up table with selectable wave modes and corresponding parametric information can be adapted for configuring the slotted waveguide system <b>1865</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">In some embodiments, a guided electromagnetic wave can be considered to have a desired wave mode if the corresponding wave mode propagates non-trivial distances on a transmission medium and has a field strength that is substantially greater in magnitude (e.g., 20 dB higher in magnitude) than other wave modes that may or may not be desirable. Such a desired wave mode or modes can be referred to as dominant wave mode(s) with the other wave modes being referred to as non-dominant wave modes. In a similar fashion, a guided electromagnetic wave that is said to be substantially without the fundamental wave mode has either no fundamental wave mode or a non-dominant fundamental wave mode. A guided electromagnetic wave that is said to be substantially without a non-fundamental wave mode has either no non-fundamental wave mode(s) or only non-dominant non-fundamental wave mode(s). In some embodiments, a guided electromagnetic wave that is said to have only a single wave mode or a selected wave mode may have only one corresponding dominant wave mode.</div>

In another embodiment, the joint can create a gap between the feed point <b>1902</b>″ and an end of the core <b>1852</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">The cable <b>1850</b> can be coupled to the waveguide system <b>1865</b> or the waveguide system <b>1865</b>′. For illustration purposes only, reference will be made to the waveguide system <b>1865</b>′. It is understood, however, that the waveguide system <b>1865</b> or other waveguide systems can also be utilized in accordance with the discussions that follow. The waveguide system <b>1865</b>′ can be configured to select a wave mode (e.g., non-fundamental wave mode, fundamental wave mode, a hybrid wave mode, or combinations thereof as described earlier) and transmit instances of electromagnetic waves having a non-optical operating frequency (e.g., 60 GHz). The electromagnetic waves can be directed to an interface of the cable <b>1850</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">The instances of electromagnetic waves generated by the waveguide system <b>1865</b>′ can induce a combined electromagnetic wave having the selected wave mode that propagates from the core <b>1852</b> to the feed point <b>1902</b>″. The combined electromagnetic wave can propagate partly inside the core <b>1852</b> and partly on an outer surface of the core <b>1852</b>. Once the combined electromagnetic wave has propagated through the junction between the core <b>1852</b> and the feed point <b>1902</b>″, the combined electromagnetic wave can continue to propagate partly inside the feedline <b>1902</b> and partly on an outer surface of the feedline <b>1902</b>. In some embodiments, the portion of the combined electromagnetic wave that propagates on the outer surface of the core <b>1852</b> and the feedline <b>1902</b> is small. In these embodiments, the combined electromagnetic wave can be said to be guided by and tightly coupled to the core <b>1852</b> and the feedline <b>1902</b> while propagating longitudinally towards the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">When the combined electromagnetic wave reaches a proximal portion of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> (at a junction <b>1902</b>′ between the feedline <b>1902</b> and the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>), the combined electromagnetic wave enters the proximal portion of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> and propagates longitudinally along an axis of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> (shown as a hashed line). By the time the combined electromagnetic wave reaches the aperture <b>1903</b>, the combined electromagnetic wave has an intensity pattern similar to the one shown by the side view and front view depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>. The electric field intensity pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> shows that the electric fields of the combined electromagnetic waves are strongest in a center region of the aperture <b>1903</b> and weaker in the outer regions. In an embodiment, where the wave mode of the electromagnetic waves propagating in the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> is a hybrid wave mode (e.g., HE11), the leakage of the electromagnetic waves at the external surfaces <b>1907</b> is reduced or in some instances eliminated. It is further noted that while the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> is constructed of a solid dielectric material having no physical opening, the front or operating face of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> from which free space wireless signals are radiated or received will be referred to as the aperture <b>1903</b> of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> even though in some prior art systems the term aperture may be used to describe an opening of an antenna that radiates or receives free space wireless signals. Methods for launching a hybrid wave mode on cable <b>1850</b> is discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">In an embodiment, the far-field antenna gain pattern depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> can be widened by decreasing the operating frequency of the combined electromagnetic wave from a nominal frequency. Similarly, the gain pattern can be narrowed by increasing the operating frequency of the combined electromagnetic wave from the nominal frequency. Accordingly, a width of a beam of wireless signals emitted by the aperture <b>1903</b> can be controlled by configuring the waveguide system <b>1865</b>′ to increase or decrease the operating frequency of the combined electromagnetic wave.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">The dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> can also be used for receiving wireless signals, such as free space wireless signals transmitted by either a similar antenna or conventional antenna design. Wireless signals received by the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> at the aperture <b>1903</b> induce electromagnetic waves in the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> that propagate towards the feedline <b>1902</b>. The electromagnetic waves continue to propagate from the feedline <b>1902</b> to the junction between the feed point <b>1902</b>″ and an endpoint of the core <b>1852</b>, and are thereby delivered to the waveguide system <b>1865</b>′ coupled to the cable <b>1850</b>. In this configuration, the waveguide system <b>1865</b>′ can perform bidirectional communications utilizing the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>. It is further noted that in some embodiments the core <b>1852</b> of the cable <b>1850</b> (shown with dashed lines) can be configured to be collinear with the feed point <b>1902</b>″ to avoid a bend shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, a block diagram is shown illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> coupled to or integrally constructed with a lens <b>1912</b> in accordance with various aspects described herein. In one embodiment, the lens <b>1912</b> can comprise a dielectric material having a first dielectric constant that is substantially similar or equal to a second dielectric constant of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>. In other embodiments, the lens <b>1912</b> can comprise a dielectric material having a first dielectric constant that differs from a second dielectric constant of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>. In either of these embodiments, the shape of the lens <b>1912</b> can be chosen or formed so as to equalize the delays of the various electromagnetic waves propagating at different points in the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>. In one embodiment, the lens <b>1912</b> can be an integral part of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> as depicted in the top diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref> and in particular, the lens and dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> can be molded, machined or otherwise formed from a single piece of dielectric material. Alternatively, the lens <b>1912</b> can be an assembly component of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> as depicted in the bottom diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, which can be attached by way of an adhesive material, brackets on the outer edges, or other suitable attachment techniques. The lens <b>1912</b> can have a convex structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref> which is adapted to adjust a propagation of electromagnetic waves in the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>. While a round lens and conical dielectric antenna configuration is shown, other shapes include pyramidal shapes, elliptical shapes and other geometric shapes can likewise be implemented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">In particular, the curvature of the lens <b>1912</b> can be chosen in manner that reduces phase differences between near-field wireless signals generated by the aperture <b>1903</b> of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>. The lens <b>1912</b> accomplishes this by applying location-dependent delays to propagating electromagnetic waves. Because of the curvature of the lens <b>1912</b>, the delays differ depending on where the electromagnetic waves emanate from at the aperture <b>1903</b>. For example, electromagnetic waves propagating by way of a center axis <b>1905</b> of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> will experience more delay through the lens <b>1912</b> than electromagnetic waves propagating radially away from the center axis <b>1905</b>. Electromagnetic waves propagating towards, for example, the outer edges of the aperture <b>1903</b> will experience minimal or no delay through the lens. Propagation delay increases as the electromagnetic waves get close to the center axis <b>1905</b>. Accordingly, a curvature of the lens <b>1912</b> can be configured so that near-field wireless signals have substantially similar phases. By reducing differences between phases of the near-field wireless signals, a width of far-field signals generated by the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> is reduced, which in turn increases the intensity of the far-field wireless signals within the width of the main lobe, producing a relatively narrow beam pattern with high gain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">It should be noted that the lens <b>1912</b> can be configured in other lens configurations. For example, the lens <b>1912</b> can comprise concentric ridges <b>1914</b> configured to have a depth representative of a select wavelength factor. For example, a ridge can be configured to have a depth of one-quarter a wavelength of the electromagnetic waves propagating in the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>. Such a configuration causes the electromagnetic wave reflected from one ridge to have a phase difference of 180 degrees relative to the electromagnetic wave reflected from an adjacent ridge. Consequently, the out of phase electromagnetic waves reflected from the adjacent risers <b>1916</b> substantially cancel, thereby reducing reflection and distortion caused thereby.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0267">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</figref>, a block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of near-field signals <b>1928</b> and far-field signals <b>1930</b> emitted by the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> having an elliptical aperture in accordance with various aspects described herein is shown. The cross section of the near-field beam pattern <b>1928</b> mimics the elliptical shape of the aperture <b>1903</b> of the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>. The cross section of the far-field beam pattern <b>1930</b> have a rotational offset (approximately 90 degrees) that results from the elliptical shape of the near-field signals <b>1928</b>. The offset can be determined by applying a Fourier Transform to the near-field signals <b>1928</b>. While the cross section of the near-field beam pattern <b>1928</b> and the cross section of the far-field beam pattern <b>1930</b> are shown as nearly the same size in order to demonstrate the rotational effect, the actual size of the far-field beam pattern <b>1930</b> may increase with the distance from the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">The elongated shape of the far-field signals <b>1930</b> and its orientation can prove useful when aligning a dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> in relation to a remotely located receiver configured to receive the far-field signals <b>1930</b>. The receiver can comprise one or more dielectric antennas coupled to a waveguide system such as described by the subject disclosure. The elongated far-field signals <b>1930</b> can increase the likelihood that the remotely located receiver will detect the far-field signals <b>1930</b>. In addition, the elongated far-field signals <b>1930</b> can be useful in situations where a dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> coupled to a gimbal assembly, or other actuated antenna mount (not shown) In particular, the elongated far-field signals <b>1930</b> can be useful in situations where such as gimbal mount only has two degrees of freedom for aligning the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> in the direction of the receiver (e.g., yaw and pitch is adjustable but roll is fixed).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">Although not shown, it will be appreciated that the dielectric antenna <b>1901</b> can have an integrated or attachable lens <b>1912</b> as previously described to increase an intensity of the far-fields signals <b>1930</b> by reducing phase differences in the near-field signals.</div>

An array of pyramidal-shaped dielectric horn antennas <b>1901</b>′ covering 360 degrees can enable a one or more waveguide systems <b>1865</b>′ coupled to the antennas to perform omnidirectional communications with other communication devices or antennas of similar type.</div>

Similarly, the array of pyramidal-shaped dielectric horn antennas <b>1901</b>′ can be substantially or entirely devoid of conductive external surfaces and internal conductive materials as discussed above. For example, in some embodiments, the array of pyramidal-shaped dielectric horn antennas <b>1901</b>′ and their corresponding feed points <b>1902</b>′ can be constructed of dielectric-only materials such as polyethylene or polyurethane materials or with only trivial amounts of conductive material that does not significantly alter the radiation pattern of the antenna.</div>

The array <b>1976</b> of dielectric antennas <b>1901</b> can be conical shaped antennas <b>1901</b> or pyramidal-shaped dielectric antennas <b>1901</b>′. To perform beam steering, a waveguide system coupled to the array <b>1976</b> of dielectric antennas <b>1901</b> can be adapted to utilize a circuit <b>1972</b> comprising amplifiers <b>1973</b> and phase shifters <b>1974</b>, each pair coupled to one of the dielectric antennas <b>1901</b> in the array <b>1976</b>. The waveguide system can steer far-field wireless signals from left to right (west to east) by incrementally increasing a phase delay of signals supplied to the dielectric antennas <b>1901</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0274">For example, the waveguide system can provide a first signal to the dielectric antennas of column 1 (“C1”) having no phase delay. The waveguide system can further provide a second signal to column 2 (“C2”), the second signal comprising the first signal having a first phase delay. The waveguide system can further provide a third signal to the dielectric antennas of column 3 (“C3”), the third signal comprising the second signal having a second phase delay. Lastly, the waveguide system can provide a fourth signal to the dielectric antennas of column 4 (“C4”), the fourth signal comprising the third signal having a third phase delay. These phase shifted signals will cause far-field wireless signals generated by the array to shift from left to right. Similarly, far-field signals can be steered from right to left (east to west) (“C4” to “C1”), north to south (“R1” to “R4”), south to north (“R4” to “R1”), and southwest to northeast (“C1-R4” to “C4-R1”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">Utilizing similar techniques beam steering can also be performed in other directions such as southwest to northeast by configuring the waveguide system to incrementally increase the phase of signals transmitted by the following sequence of antennas: “C1-R4”, “C1-R3/C2-R4”, “C1-R2/C2-R3/C3-R4”, “C1-R1/C2-R2/C3-R3/C4-R4”, “C2-R1/C3-R2/C4-R3”, “C3-R1/C4-R2”, “C4-R1”. In a similar way, beam steering can be performed northeast to southwest, northwest to southeast, southeast to northwest, as well in other directions in three-dimensional space. Beam steering can be used, among other things, for aligning the array <b>1976</b> of dielectric antennas <b>1901</b> with a remote receiver and/or for directivity of signals to mobile communication devices. In some embodiments, a phased array <b>1976</b> of dielectric antennas <b>1901</b> can also be used to circumvent the use of the gimbal assembly or other actuated mount. While the foregoing has described beam steering controlled by phase delays, gain and phase adjustment can likewise be applied to the dielectric antennas <b>1901</b> of the phased array <b>1976</b> in a similar fashion to provide additional control and versatility in the formation of a desired beam pattern.</div>

In the present illustration, downlink communications represents a communication path from the pedestal <b>2004</b> to customer premises <b>2002</b>, while uplink communications represents a communication path from customer premises <b>2002</b> to the pedestal <b>2004</b>. In an embodiment where cable <b>1850</b> includes an inner conductor, cable <b>1850</b> can also serve the purpose of supplying power to the NID <b>2010</b> and <b>2020</b> and other equipment of the customer premises <b>2002</b> and the pedestal <b>2004</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0283">In customer premises <b>2002</b>, DSL signals can originate from a DSL modem <b>2006</b> (which may have a built-in router and which may provide wireless services such as WiFi to user equipment shown in the customer premises <b>2002</b>). The DSL signals can be supplied to NID <b>2010</b> by a twisted pair phone <b>2008</b>. The NID <b>2010</b> can utilize the integrated waveguide <b>1602</b> to launch within cable <b>1850</b> guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> directed to the pedestal <b>2004</b> on an uplink path. In the downlink path, DSL signals generated by the mini-DSLAM <b>2024</b> can flow through a twisted pair phone line <b>2022</b> to NID <b>2020</b>. The waveguide system <b>1602</b> integrated in the NID <b>2020</b> can convert the DSL signals, or a portion thereof, from electrical signals to guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> that propagate within cable <b>1850</b> on the downlink path. To provide full duplex communications, the guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> on the uplink can be configured to operate at a different carrier frequency and/or a different modulation approach than the guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> on the downlink to reduce or avoid interference. Additionally, on the uplink and downlink paths, the guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> are guided by a core section of cable <b>1850</b>, as previously described, and such waves can be configured to have a field intensity profile that confines the guide electromagnetic waves in whole or in part in the inner layers of cable <b>1850</b>. Although the guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> are shown outside of cable <b>1850</b>, the depiction of these waves is for illustration purposes only. For this reason, the guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> are drawn with “hash marks” to indicate that they are guided by the inner layers of cable <b>1850</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0284">On the downlink path, the integrated waveguide system <b>1602</b> of NID <b>2010</b> receives the guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> generated by NID <b>2020</b> and converts them back to DSL signals conforming to the requirements of the DSL modem <b>2006</b>. The DSL signals are then supplied to the DSL modem <b>2006</b> via a set of twisted pair wires of phone line <b>2008</b> for processing. Similarly, on the uplink path, the integrated waveguide system <b>1602</b> of NID <b>2020</b> receives the guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> generated by NID <b>2010</b> and converts them back to DSL signals conforming to the requirements of the mini-DSLAM <b>2024</b>. The DSL signals are then supplied to the mini-DSLAM <b>2024</b> via a set of twisted pair wires of phone line <b>2022</b> for processing. Because of the short length of phone lines <b>2008</b> and <b>2022</b>, the DSL modem <b>2006</b> and the mini-DSLAM <b>2024</b> can send and receive DSL signals between themselves on the uplink and downlink at very high speeds (e.g., 1 Gbps to 60 Gbps or more). Consequently, the uplink and downlink paths can in most circumstances exceed the data rate limits of traditional DSL communications over twisted pair phone lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0285">Typically, DSL devices are configured for asymmetric data rates because the downlink path usually supports a higher data rate than the uplink path. However, cable <b>1850</b> can provide much higher speeds both on the downlink and uplink paths. With a firmware update, a legacy DSL modem <b>2006</b> such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref> can be configured with higher speeds on both the uplink and downlink paths. Similar firmware updates can be made to the mini-DSLAM <b>2024</b> to take advantage of the higher speeds on the uplink and downlink paths. Since the interfaces to the DSL modem <b>2006</b> and mini-DSLAM <b>2024</b> remain as traditional twisted pair phone lines, no hardware change is necessary for a legacy DSL modem or legacy mini-DSLAM other than firmware changes and the addition of the NIDs <b>2010</b> and <b>2020</b> to perform the conversion from DSL signals to guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> and vice-versa. The use of NIDs enables a reuse of legacy modems <b>2006</b> and mini-DSLAMs <b>2024</b>, which in turn can substantially reduce installation costs and system upgrades. For new construction, updated versions of mini-DSLAMs and DSL modems can be configured with integrated waveguide systems to perform the functions described above, thereby eliminating the need for NIDs <b>2010</b> and <b>2020</b> with integrated waveguide systems. In this embodiment, an updated version of modem <b>2006</b> and updated version of mini-DSLAM <b>2024</b> would connect directly to cable <b>1850</b> and communicate via bidirectional guided electromagnetic wave transmissions, thereby averting a need for transmission or reception of DSL signals using twisted pair phone lines <b>2008</b> and <b>2022</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0289"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref> describe embodiments for downlink and uplink communications. Method <b>2100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> can begin with step <b>2102</b> where electrical signals (e.g., DSL signals) are generated by a DSLAM (e.g., mini-DSLAM <b>2024</b> of pedestal <b>2004</b> or from central office <b>2030</b>), which are converted to guided electromagnetic waves <b>2014</b> at step <b>2104</b> by NID <b>2020</b> and which propagate on a transmission medium such as cable <b>1850</b> for providing downlink services to the customer premises <b>2002</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0290">At step <b>2122</b> of method <b>2120</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, the DSL modem <b>2006</b> can supply electrical signals (e.g., DSL signals) via phone line <b>2008</b> to NID <b>2010</b>, which in turn at step <b>2124</b>, converts the DSL signals to guided electromagnetic waves directed to NID <b>2020</b> by way of cable <b>1850</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0291">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>, a block diagram <b>2151</b> illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of electric field characteristics of a hybrid wave versus a Goubau wave in accordance with various aspects described herein is shown. Diagram <b>2158</b> shows a distribution of energy between HE11 mode waves and Goubau waves for an insulated conductor. The energy plots of diagram <b>2158</b> assume that the amount of power used to generate the Goubau waves is the same as the HE11 waves (i.e., the area under the energy curves is the same). In the illustration of diagram <b>2158</b>, Goubau waves have a steep drop in power when Goubau waves extend beyond the outer surface of an insulated conductor, while HE11 waves have a substantially lower drop in power beyond the insulation layer. Consequently, Goubau waves have a higher concentration of energy near the insulation layer than HE11 waves. Diagram <b>2167</b> depicts similar Goubau and HE11 energy curves when a water film is present on the outer surface of the insulator. The difference between the energy curves of diagrams <b>2158</b> and <b>2167</b> is that the drop in power for the Goubau and the HE11 energy curves begins on an outer edge of the insulator for diagram <b>2158</b> and on an outer edge of the water film for diagram <b>2167</b>. The energy curves diagrams <b>2158</b> and <b>2167</b>, however, depict the same behavior. That is, the electric fields of Goubau waves are tightly bound to the insulation layer, which when exposed to water results in greater propagation losses than electric fields of HE11 waves having a higher concentration outside the insulation layer and the water film. These properties are depicted in the HE11 and Goubau diagrams <b>2168</b> and <b>2159</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0292">By adjusting an operating frequency of HE11 waves, e-fields of HE11 waves can be configured to extend substantially above a thin water film as shown in block diagram <b>2169</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21D</figref> having a greater accumulated field strength in areas in the air when compared to fields in the insulator and a water layer surrounding the outside of the insulator. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21D</figref> depicts a wire having a radius of 1 cm and an insulation radius of 1.5 cm with a dielectric constant of 2.25. As the operating frequency of HE11 waves is reduced, the e-fields extend outwardly expanding the size of the wave mode. At certain operating frequencies (e.g., 3 GHz) the wave mode expansion can be substantially greater than the diameter of the insulated wire and any obstructions that may be present on the insulated wire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0294" num="0293">By having e-fields that are perpendicular to a water film and by placing most of its energy outside the water film, HE11 waves have less propagation loss than Goubau waves when a transmission medium is subjected to water or other obstructions. Although Goubau waves have radial e-fields which are desirable, the waves are tightly coupled to the insulation layer, which results in the e-fields being highly concentrated in the region of an obstruction. Consequently, Goubau waves are still subject to high propagation losses when an obstruction such as a water film is present on the outer surface of an insulated conductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0295" num="0294">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>, block diagrams illustrating example, non-limiting embodiments of a waveguide system <b>2200</b> for launching hybrid waves in accordance with various aspects described herein is shown. The waveguide system <b>2200</b> can comprise probes <b>2202</b> coupled to a slideable or rotatable mechanism <b>2204</b> that enables the probes <b>2202</b> to be placed at different positions or orientations relative to an outer surface of an insulated conductor <b>2208</b>. The mechanism <b>2204</b> can comprise a coaxial feed <b>2206</b> or other coupling that enables transmission of electromagnetic waves by the probes <b>2202</b>. The coaxial feed <b>2206</b> can be placed at a position on the mechanism <b>2204</b> so that the path difference between the probes <b>2202</b> is one-half a wavelength or some odd integer multiple thereof. When the probes <b>2202</b> generate electromagnetic signals of opposite phase, electromagnetic waves can be induced on the outer surface of the insulated conductor <b>2208</b> having a hybrid mode (such as an HE11 mode).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0296" num="0295">The mechanism <b>2204</b> can also be coupled to a motor or other actuator (not shown) for moving the probes <b>2202</b> to a desirable position. In one embodiment, for example, the waveguide system <b>2200</b> can comprise a controller that directs the motor to rotate the probes <b>2202</b> (assuming they are rotatable) to a different position (e.g., east and west) to generate electromagnetic waves that have a horizontally polarized HE11 mode. To guide the electromagnetic waves onto the outer surface of the insulated conductor <b>2208</b>, the waveguide system <b>2200</b> can further comprise a tapered horn <b>2210</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>. The tapered horn <b>2210</b> can be coaxially aligned with the insulated conductor <b>2208</b>. To reduce the cross-sectional dimension of the tapered horn <b>2210</b>, an additional insulation layer (not shown) can placed on the insulated conductor <b>2208</b>. The additional insulation layer can be similar to the tapered insulation layer <b>1879</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18G and 18H</figref>. The additional insulation layer can have a tapered end that points away from the tapered horn <b>2210</b>. The tapered insulation layer <b>1879</b> can reduce a size of an initial electromagnetic wave launched according to an HE11 mode. As the electromagnetic waves propagate towards the tapered end of the insulation layer, the HE11 mode expands until it reaches its full size. In other embodiments, the waveguide system <b>2200</b> may not need to use the tapered insulation layer <b>1879</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0296">HE11 mode waves can be used to mitigate obstructions such as rain water. For example, suppose that rain water has caused a water film to surround an outer surface of the insulated conductor <b>2208</b>. Further assume that water droplets have collected at the bottom of the insulated conductor <b>2208</b>. The water film occupies a small fraction of the total HE11 wave. Also, by having horizontally polarized HE11 waves, the water droplets are in a least-intense area of the HE11 waves reducing losses caused by the droplets. Consequently, the HE11 waves experience much lower propagation losses than Goubau waves or waves having a mode that is tightly coupled to the insulated conductor <b>2208</b> and thus greater energy in the areas occupied by the water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0298" num="0297">It is submitted that the waveguide system <b>2200</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-22B</figref> can be replaced with other waveguide systems of the subject disclosure capable of generating electromagnetic waves having an HE mode.

In an embodiment, two or more MMICs <b>1870</b> of the waveguide system <b>1865</b>′ can be configured to generate electromagnetic waves of opposite phase to generate polarized e-fields such as those present in an HE mode. In another embodiment, different pairs of MMICs <b>1870</b> can be selected to generate HE waves that are polarized at different spatial positions (e.g., north and south, west and east, northwest and southeast, northeast and southeast, or other sub-fractional coordinates).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0299" num="0298">Although HE waves can have desirable characteristics for mitigating obstructions on a transmission medium, it is submitted that certain wave modes having a cutoff frequency (e.g., TE modes, TM modes or combinations thereof) may also exhibit waves that are sufficiently large and have polarized e-fields that are orthogonal (or approximately orthogonal) to a region of an obstruction enabling their use for mitigating propagation losses caused by the obstruction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0300" num="0299">Turning to the illustration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, the waveguide <b>2522</b> covers a first region <b>2506</b> of a core <b>2528</b>.

The inner surface <b>2523</b> of the waveguide <b>2522</b> can be constructed from a metallic material or other material that reflects electromagnetic waves and thereby enables the waveguide <b>2522</b> to be configured at step <b>2404</b> to guide the first electromagnetic wave <b>2502</b> towards the core <b>2528</b>. The core <b>2528</b> can comprise a dielectric core (as described in the subject disclosure) that extends to the inner surface <b>2523</b> of the waveguide <b>2522</b>. In other embodiments, the dielectric core can be surrounded by cladding (such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>), whereby the cladding extends to the inner surface <b>2523</b> of the waveguide <b>2522</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0301" num="0300">In the first region <b>2506</b>, the core <b>2528</b> comprises an interface <b>2526</b> for receiving the first electromagnetic wave <b>2502</b>. In one embodiment, the interface <b>2526</b> of the core <b>2528</b> can be configured to reduce reflections of the first electromagnetic wave <b>2502</b>. In one embodiment, the interface <b>2526</b> can be a tapered structure to reduce reflections of the first electromagnetic wave <b>2502</b> from a surface of the core <b>2528</b>. Other structures can be used for the interface <b>2526</b>. For example, the interface <b>2526</b> can be partially tapered with a rounded point. Accordingly, any structure, configuration, or adaptation of the interface <b>2526</b> that can reduced reflections of the first electromagnetic wave <b>2502</b> is contemplated by the subject disclosure. The first electromagnetic wave <b>2502</b> induces (or otherwise generates) a second electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b> that propagates within the core <b>2528</b> in the first region <b>2506</b> covered by the waveguide <b>2522</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0302" num="0301">A second region <b>2508</b> of the core <b>2528</b> is not covered by the waveguide <b>2522</b>, and is thereby exposed to the environment (e.g., air). In the second region <b>2508</b>, the second electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b> expands outwardly beginning from the discontinuity between the edge of the waveguide <b>2522</b> and the exposed core <b>2528</b>. To reduce the radiation into the environment from the second electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b>, the core <b>2528</b> can be configured to have a tapered structure <b>2520</b>. As the second electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b> propagates along the tapered structure <b>2520</b>, the second electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b> remains substantially bound to the tapered structure <b>2520</b> thereby reducing radiation losses. The tapered structure <b>2520</b> ends at a transition from the second region <b>2508</b> to a third region <b>2510</b>.

In the third region <b>2510</b> of the core <b>2528</b>, the second electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b> experiences a low propagation loss. In one embodiment, this can be accomplished by selecting a diameter of the core <b>2528</b> that enables the second electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b> to be loosely bound to the outer surface of the core <b>2528</b> in the third region <b>2510</b>. Alternatively, or in combination, propagation losses of the second electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b> can be reduced by configuring the MMICs <b>2524</b> to adjust a wave mode, wave length, operating frequency, or other operational parameter of the first electromagnetic wave <b>2502</b>.</div>

In the simulations, a first electromagnetic wave is injected at the endpoint of the core <b>2528</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.

As the second electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b> enters the second region <b>2508</b> (no longer covered by the waveguide section <b>2523</b>A), the tapered structure <b>2520</b> reduces radiation losses of the electromagnetic wave fields <b>2532</b> as it expands over the outer tapered surface of the core <b>2528</b>. As the second electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b> enters the third region <b>2510</b>, the electromagnetic wave fields <b>2532</b> stabilize and thereafter remain loosely coupled to the core <b>2528</b> (depicted in the longitudinal and orthogonal cross-sectional views), which reduces propagation losses.</div>

When it reaches the boundary between the second region <b>2508</b> and the first region <b>2506</b> (i.e., the edge of the waveguide <b>2522</b>), the electromagnetic wave <b>2504</b> propagates within the core <b>2528</b> confined by the inner surface <b>2523</b> of the waveguide <b>2522</b>.

In this illustration, the waveguide <b>2522</b> comprises a chamber <b>2525</b> in a first region <b>2506</b> of the core <b>2528</b>.

In the first region <b>2506</b>, the chamber <b>2525</b> of the waveguide <b>2522</b> has two tapered structures <b>2522</b>B′ and <b>2522</b>B″. These tapered structures <b>2522</b>B′ and <b>2522</b>B″ enable an electromagnetic wave to gradually enter or exit the chamber <b>2525</b> from either direction of the core <b>2528</b>. The MMICs <b>2524</b> can be configured with directional antennas to launch a first electromagnetic wave <b>2502</b> directed from east-to-west or from west-to-east in relation to the longitudinal view of the core <b>2528</b>. Similarly, the directional antennas of the MMICs <b>2524</b> can be configured to receive an electromagnetic waves propagating longitudinally on the core <b>2528</b> from east-to-west or from west-to-east.

The communication signals can be, for example, communication signals modulated according to a specific signaling protocol (e.g., LTE, 5G, DOCSIS, DSL, etc.) operating in a native frequency band (e.g., 900 MHz, 1.9 GHz, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, etc.), baseband signals, analog signals, other signals, or any combinations thereof. At step <b>2564</b>, the waveguide system can be adapted to generate or launch on a transmission medium a plurality of electromagnetic waves according to the communication signals by up-converting (or in some instances down-converting) such communication signals to one or more operating frequencies of the plurality of electromagnetic waves. The transmission medium can be an insulated conductor as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, or an uninsulated conductor that is subject to environmental exposure to oxidation (or other chemical reaction based on environmental exposure) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>. In other embodiments, the transmission medium can be a dielectric material such as a dielectric core described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0327" num="0326">To avoid interference, the waveguide system can be adapted to simultaneously launch at step <b>2564</b> a first electromagnetic wave using a TM00 wave mode, a second electromagnetic wave using an HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization, and a third electromagnetic wave using an HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization—see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Since the first, second and third electromagnetic waves are orthogonal (i.e., non-interfering) they can be launched in the same frequency band without interference or with a small amount of acceptable interference. The combined transmission of three orthogonal electromagnetic wave modes in the same frequency band constitutes a form of wave mode division multiplexing, which provides a means for increasing the information bandwidth by a factor of three. By combining the principles of frequency division multiplexing with wave mode division multiplexing, bandwidth can be further increased by configuring the waveguide system to launch a fourth electromagnetic wave using a TM00 wave mode, a fifth electromagnetic wave using an HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization, and a sixth electromagnetic wave using an HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization in a second frequency band that does not overlap with the first frequency band of the first, second and third orthogonal electromagnetic waves. It will be appreciated that other types of multiplexing could be additionally or alternatively used with wave mode division multiplexing without departing from example embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0328" num="0327">To illustrate this point, suppose each of three orthogonal electromagnetic waves in a first frequency band supports 1 GHz of transmission bandwidth. And further suppose each of three orthogonal electromagnetic waves in a second frequency band also supports 1 GHz of transmission bandwidth. With three wave modes operating in two frequency bands, 6 GHz of information bandwidth is possible for conveying communication signals by way of electromagnetic surface waves utilizing these wave modes. With more frequency bands, the bandwidth can be increased further.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0328">Now suppose a transmission medium in the form of an insulated conductor (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>) is used for surface wave transmissions. Further suppose the transmission medium has a dielectric layer with thickness proportional to the conductor radius (e.g., a conductor having a 4 mm radius and an insulation layer with a 4 mm thickness). With this type of transmission medium, the waveguide system can be configured to select from several options for transmitting electromagnetic waves. For example, the waveguide system can be configured at step <b>2564</b> to transmit first through third electromagnetic waves using wave mode division multiplexing at a first frequency band (e.g., at 1 GHz), third through fourth electromagnetic waves using wave mode division multiplexing at a second frequency band (e.g., at 2.1 GHz), seventh through ninth electromagnetic waves using wave mode division multiplexing at a third frequency band (e.g., at 3.2 GHz), and so on. Assuming each electromagnetic wave supports 1 GHz of bandwidth, collectively the first through ninth electromagnetic waves can support 9 GHz of bandwidth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0330" num="0329">Alternatively, or contemporaneous with transmitting electromagnetic waves with orthogonal wave modes at step <b>2564</b>, the waveguide system can be configured at step <b>2564</b> to transmit on the insulated conductor one or more high frequency electromagnetic waves (e.g., millimeter waves). In one embodiment, the one or more high frequency electromagnetic waves can be configured in non-overlapping frequencies bands according to one or more corresponding wave modes that are less susceptible to a water film such as a TM0m wave mode and EH1m wave mode (where m&gt;0), or an HE2m wave mode (where m&gt;1) as previously described. In other embodiments, the waveguide system can instead be configured to transmit one or more high frequency electromagnetic waves in non-overlapping frequency bands according to one or more corresponding wave modes that have longitudinal and/or azimuthal fields near the surface of the transmission medium that may be susceptible to water, but nonetheless exhibit low propagation losses when the transmission medium is dry. A waveguide system can thus be configured to transmit several combinations of wave modes on an insulated conductor (as well as a dielectric-only transmission medium such as a dielectric core) when the insulated conductor is dry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0331" num="0330">Now suppose a transmission medium in the form of an uninsulated conductor (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-30</figref>) is used for surface wave transmissions. Further consider that the uninsulated conductor or bare conductor is exposed to an environment subject to various levels of moisture and/or rain (as well as air and atmospheric gases like oxygen). Uninsulated conductors, such as overhead power lines and other uninsulated wires, are often made of aluminum which is sometimes reinforced with steel. Aluminum can react spontaneously with water and/or air to form aluminum oxide. An aluminum oxide layer can be thin (e.g., nano to micrometers in thickness). An aluminum oxide layer has dielectric properties and can therefore serve as a dielectric layer. Accordingly, uninsulated conductors can propagate not only TM00 wave modes, but also other wave modes such as an HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization, and an HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization at high frequencies based at least in part on the thickness of the oxide layer. Accordingly, uninsulated conductors having an environmentally formed dielectric layer such as an oxide layer can be used for transmitting electromagnetic waves using wave mode division multiplexing and frequency division multiplexing. Other electromagnetic waves having a wave mode (with or without a cutoff frequency) that can propagate on an oxide layer are contemplated by the subject disclosure and can be applied to the embodiments described in the subject disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0332" num="0331">In one embodiment, the term “environmentally formed dielectric layer” can represent an uninsulated conductor that is exposed to an environment that is not artificially created in a laboratory or other controlled setting (e.g., bare conductor exposed to air, humidity, rain, etc. on a utility pole or other exposed environment). In other embodiments, an environmentally formed dielectric layer can be formed in a controlled setting such as a manufacturing facility that exposes uninsulated conductors to a controlled environment (e.g., controlled humidity, or other gaseous substance) that forms a dielectric layer on the outer surface of the uninsulated conductor. In yet another alternative embodiment, the uninsulated conductor can also be “doped” with particular substances/compounds (e.g., a reactant) that facilitate chemical reactions with other substances/compounds that are either available in a natural environment or in an artificially created laboratory or controlled setting, thereby resulting in the creation of the environmentally formed dielectric layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0333" num="0332">Wave mode division multiplexing and frequency division multiplexing can prove useful in mitigating obstructions such as water accumulating on an outer surface of a transmission medium. To determine if mitigating an obstruction is necessary, a waveguide system can be configured at step <b>2566</b> to determine if an obstruction is present on the transmission medium. A film of water (or water droplets) collected on an outer surface of the transmission medium due to rain, condensation, and/or excess humidity can be one form of an obstruction that can cause propagation losses in electromagnetic waves if not mitigated. A splicing of a transmission medium or other object coupled to the outer surface of the transmission medium can also serve as an obstruction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0334" num="0333">Obstructions can be detected by a source waveguide system that transmits electromagnetic waves on a transmission medium and measures reflected electromagnetic waves based on these transmissions. Alternatively, or in combination, the source waveguide system can detect obstructions by receiving communication signals (wireless or electromagnetic waves) from a recipient waveguide system that receives and performs quality metrics on electromagnetic waves transmitted by the source waveguide system. When an obstruction is detected at step <b>2566</b>, the waveguide system can be configured to identify options to update, modify, or otherwise change the electromagnetic waves being transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0335" num="0334">Suppose, for example, that in the case of an insulated conductor, the waveguide system had launched at step <b>2564</b> a high order wave mode such as TM01 wave mode with a frequency band that starts at 30 GHz having a large bandwidth (e.g., 10 GHz) when the insulated conductor is dry. For illustration purposes, a 10 GHz bandwidth will be assumed for an electromagnetic wave having a TM01 wave mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0336" num="0335">Although it was noted earlier in the subject disclosure that a TM01 wave mode has a desirable electric field alignment that is not longitudinal and not azimuthal near the outer surface, it can nonetheless be subject to some signal attenuation which in turn reduces its operating bandwidth when a water film (or droplets) accumulates on the insulated conductor. An electromagnetic wave having a TM01 wave mode with a bandwidth of approximately 10 GHz (30 to 40 GHz) on a dry insulated conductor can drop to a bandwidth of approximately 1 GHz (30 to 31 GHz) when the insulated conductor is wet. To mitigate the loss in bandwidth, the waveguide system can be configured to launch electromagnetic waves at much lower frequencies (e.g., less than 6 GHz) using wave mode division multiplexing and frequency division multiplexing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0337" num="0336">For example, the waveguide system can be configured to transmit a first set of electromagnetic waves; specifically, a first electromagnetic wave having a TM00 wave mode, a second electromagnetic wave having an HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization, and a third electromagnetic wave having an HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization, each electromagnetic wave having a center frequency at 1 GHz. Assuming a useable frequency band from 500 MHz to 1.5 GHz to convey communication signals, each electromagnetic wave can provide 1 GHz of bandwidth, and collectively 3 GHz of system bandwidth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0338" num="0337">Suppose also the waveguide system is configured to transmit a second set of electromagnetic waves; specifically, a fourth electromagnetic wave having a TM00 wave mode, a fifth electromagnetic wave having an HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization, and a sixth electromagnetic wave having an HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization, each electromagnetic wave having a center frequency at 2.1 GHz. Assuming a frequency band from 1.6 GHz to 2.6 GHz, with a guard band of 100 MHz between the first and second sets of electromagnetic waves, each electromagnetic wave can provide 1 GHz of bandwidth, and collectively 3 GHz of additional bandwidth, thereby now providing up to 6 GHz of system bandwidth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0339" num="0338">Further suppose the waveguide system is also configured to transmit a third set of electromagnetic waves; specifically, a seventh electromagnetic wave having a TM00 wave mode, an eighth electromagnetic wave having an HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization, and a ninth electromagnetic wave having an HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization, each electromagnetic wave having a center frequency at 3.2 GHz. Assuming a frequency band from 2.7 GHz to 3.7 GHz, with a guard band of 100 MHz between the second and third sets of electromagnetic waves, each electromagnetic wave can provide 1 GHz of bandwidth, and collectively 3 GHz of additional bandwidth, thereby now providing up to 9 GHz of system bandwidth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0340" num="0339">The combination of the TM01 wave mode, and the three sets of electromagnetic waves configured for wave mode division multiplexing and frequency division multiplexing, provide a total system bandwidth of 10 GHz, thereby restoring a bandwidth of 10 GHz previously available when the high frequency electromagnetic wave having the TM01 wave mode was propagating on a dry insulated conductor. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates a process for performing mitigation of a TM01 wave mode subject to an obstruction such as a water film. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates a transition from a dry insulated conductor that supports a high bandwidth TM01 wave mode to a wet insulated conductor that supports a lower bandwidth TM01 wave mode that is combined with low frequency TM00 and HE11 wave modes configured according to wave mode division multiplexing (WMDM) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM) schemes to restore losses in system bandwidth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0341" num="0340">Consider now an uninsulated conductor where the waveguide system had launched at step <b>2564</b> a TM00 wave mode with a frequency band that starts at 10 GHz having a large bandwidth (e.g., 10 GHz). Suppose now that transmission medium propagating the 10 GHz TM00 wave mode is exposed to an obstruction such as water. As noted earlier, a high frequency TM00 wave mode on an insulated conductor is subject to a substantial amount of signal attenuation (e.g., 45 dB/M at 10 GHz) when a water film (or droplets) accumulates on the outer surface of the insulated conductor. Similar attenuations will be present for a 10 GHz (or greater) TM00 wave mode propagating on an “uninsulated” conductor. An environmentally exposed uninsulated conductor (e.g., aluminum), however, can have an oxide layer formed on the outer surface which can serve as a dielectric layer that supports wave modes other than TM00 (e.g., HE11 wave modes). It is further noted that at lower frequencies a TM00 wave mode propagating on an insulated conductor exhibits a much lower attenuation (e.g., 0.62 dB/M at 4 GHz). A TM00 wave mode operating at less than 6 GHz would similarly exhibit low propagation losses on an uninsulated conductor. Accordingly, to mitigate the loss in bandwidth, the waveguide system can be configured to launch electromagnetic waves having a TM00 wave mode at lower frequencies (e.g., 6 GHz or less) and electromagnetic waves having an HE11 wave mode configured for WMDM and FDM at higher frequencies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0342" num="0341">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, suppose then that the waveguide system detects an obstruction such as water at step <b>2566</b> on an environmentally exposed uninsulated conductor. A waveguide system can be configured to mitigate the obstruction by transmitting a first electromagnetic wave configured with a TM00 wave mode having a center frequency at 2.75 GHz. Assuming a useable frequency band from 500 MHz to 5.5 GHz to convey communication signals, the electromagnetic waves can provide 5 GHz of system bandwidth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0343" num="0342"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> illustrates a process for performing mitigation of a high frequency TM00 wave mode subject to an obstruction such as a water film detected at step <b>2566</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates a transition from a dry uninsulated conductor that supports a high bandwidth TM00 wave mode to a wet uninsulated conductor that combines a low frequency TM00 wave mode and high frequency HE11 wave modes configured according to WMDM and FDM schemes to restore losses in system bandwidth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0344" num="0343">It will be appreciated that the aforementioned mitigation techniques are non-limiting. For example, the center frequencies described above can differ between systems. Additionally, the original wave mode used before an obstruction is detected can differ from the illustrations above. For example, in the case of an insulated conductor an EH11 wave mode can be used singly or in combination with a TM01 wave mode. It is also appreciated that WMDM and FDM techniques can be used to transmit electromagnetic waves at all times and not just when an obstruction is detected at step <b>2566</b>. It is further appreciated that other wave modes that can support WMDM and/or FDM techniques can be applied to and/or combined with the embodiments described in the subject disclosure, and are therefore contemplated by the subject disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0345" num="0344">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, once a mitigation scheme using WMDM and/or FDM has been determined in accordance with the above illustrations, the waveguide system can be configured at step <b>2568</b> to notify one or more other waveguide systems of the mitigation scheme intended to be used for updating one or more electromagnetic waves prior to executing the update at step <b>2570</b>. The notification can be sent wirelessly to one or more other waveguide systems utilizing antennas if signal degradation in the electromagnetic waves is too severe. If signal attenuation is tolerable, then the notification can be sent via the affected electromagnetic waves. In other embodiments, the waveguide system can be configured to skip step <b>2568</b> and perform the mitigation scheme using WMDM and/or FDM at step <b>2570</b> without notification. This embodiment can be applied in cases where, for example, other recipient waveguide system(s) know beforehand what kind of mitigation scheme would be used, or the recipient waveguide system(s) are configured to use signal detection techniques to discover the mitigation scheme. Once the mitigation scheme using WMDM and/or FDM has been initiated at step <b>2570</b>, the waveguide system can continue to process received communication signals at steps <b>2562</b> and <b>2564</b> as described earlier using the updated configuration of the electromagnetic waves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0346" num="0345">At step <b>2566</b>, the waveguide system can monitor if the obstruction is still present. This determination can be performed by sending test signals (e.g., electromagnetic surface waves in the original wave mode) to other waveguide system(s) and awaiting test results back from the waveguide systems if the situation has improved, and/or by using other obstruction detection techniques such as signal reflection testing based on the sent test signals. Once the obstruction is determined to have been removed (e.g., the transmission medium becomes dry), the waveguide system can proceed to step <b>2572</b> and determine that a signal update was performed at step <b>2568</b> using WMDM and/or FDM as a mitigation technique. The waveguide system can then be configured to notify recipient waveguide system(s) at step <b>2568</b> of the intent to restore transmissions to the original wave mode, or bypass this step and proceed to step <b>2570</b> where it restores transmissions to an original wave mode and assumes the recipient waveguide system(s) know the original wave modes and corresponding transmission parameters, or can otherwise detect this change.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0347" num="0346">A waveguide system can also be adapted to receive electromagnetic waves configured for WMDM and/or FDM. For example, suppose that an electromagnetic wave having a high bandwidth (e.g., 10 GHz) TM01 wave mode is propagating on an insulated conductor as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> and that the electromagnetic wave is generated by a source waveguide system. At step <b>2582</b>, a recipient waveguide system can be configured to process the single electromagnetic wave with the TM01 wave mode under normal condition. Suppose, however, that the source waveguide system transitions to transmitting electromagnetic waves using WMDM and FDM along with a TM01 wave mode with a lower bandwidth on the insulated conductor, as previously described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. In this instance, the recipient waveguide system would have to process multiple electromagnetic waves of different wave modes. Specifically, the recipient waveguide system would be configured at step <b>2582</b> to selectively process each of the first through ninth electromagnetic waves using WMDM and FDM and the electromagnetic wave using the TM01 wave mode as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0348" num="0347">Once the one or more electromagnetic waves have been received at step <b>2582</b>, the recipient waveguide can be configured to use signal processing techniques to obtain the communication signals that were conveyed by the electromagnetic wave(s) generated by the source waveguide system at step <b>2564</b> (and/or step <b>2570</b> if an update has occurred). At step <b>2586</b>, the recipient waveguide system can also determine if the source waveguide system has updated the transmission scheme. The update can be detected from data provided in the electromagnetic waves transmitted by the source waveguide system, or from wireless signals transmitted by the source waveguide system. If there are no updates, the recipient waveguide system can continue to receive and process electromagnetic waves at steps <b>2582</b> and <b>2584</b> as described before. If, however, an update is detected at step <b>2586</b>, the recipient waveguide system can proceed to step <b>2588</b> to coordinate the update with the source waveguide system and thereafter receive and process updated electromagnetic waves at steps <b>2582</b> and <b>2584</b> as described before.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0349" num="0348">It will be appreciated that method <b>2560</b> can be used in any communication scheme including simplex and duplex communications between waveguide systems. Accordingly, a source waveguide system that performs an update for transmitting electromagnetic waves according to other wave modes will in turn cause a recipient waveguide system to perform similar steps for return electromagnetic wave transmissions. It will also be appreciated that the aforementioned embodiments associated with method <b>2560</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> and the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 through 32</figref> can be combined in whole or in part with other embodiments of the subject disclosure for purposes of mitigating propagation losses caused by an obstruction at or in a vicinity of an outer surface of a transmission medium (e.g., insulated conductor, uninsulated conductor, or any transmission medium having an external dielectric layer). The obstruction can be a liquid (e.g., water), a solid object disposed on the outer surface of the transmission medium (e.g., ice, snow, a splice, a tree limb, etc.), or any other objects located at or near the outer surface of the transmission medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0349">While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the respective processes are shown and described as a series of blocks in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, it is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methods described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0351" num="0350">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, block diagrams illustrating example, non-limiting embodiments for transmitting orthogonal wave modes according to the method <b>2560</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> are shown. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> depicts an embodiment for simultaneously transmitting a TM00 wave mode, an HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization, and an HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization as depicted in an instance in time in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. In one embodiment, these orthogonal wave modes can be transmitted with a waveguide launcher having eight (8) MMICs as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18K</figref> located at symmetrical locations (e.g., north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest). The waveguide launcher of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18H</figref> (or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18J</figref>) can also be configured with these 8 MMICs. Additionally, the waveguide launcher can be configured with a cylindrical sleeve <b>2523</b>A and tapered dielectric that wraps around the transmission medium (e.g., insulated conductor, uninsulated conductor, or other cable with a dielectric layer such as dielectric core). The housing assembly of the waveguide launcher (not shown) can be configured to include a mechanism (e.g., a hinge) to enable a longitudinal opening of the waveguide launcher for placement and latching around a circumference of a transmission medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0352" num="0351">With these configurations in mind, the waveguide launcher can include three transmitters (TX<b>1</b>, TX<b>2</b>, and TX<b>3</b>) coupled to MMICs having various coordinate positions (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25AG</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18W</figref>). The interconnectivity between the transmitters (TX<b>1</b>, TX<b>2</b>, and TX<b>3</b>) and the MMICs can be implemented with a common printed circuit board or other suitable interconnecting technology. The first transmitter (TX<b>1</b>) can be configured to launch a TM00 wave mode, the second transmitter (TX<b>2</b>) can be configured to launch an HE11 vertical polarization wave mode, and the third transmitter (TX<b>3</b>) can be configured to launch an HE11 horizontal polarization wave mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0353" num="0352">A first signal port (shown as “SP<b>1</b>”) of the first transmitter (TX<b>1</b>) can be coupled in parallel to each of the 8 MMICs. A second signal port (shown as “SP<b>2</b>”) of the first transmitter (TX<b>1</b>) can be coupled to a conductive sleeve <b>2523</b>A that is placed on the transmission medium by the waveguide launcher as noted above. The first transmitter (TX<b>1</b>) can be configured to receive a first group of the communication signals described in step <b>2562</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. The first group of communication signals can be frequency-shifted by the first transmitter (TX<b>1</b>) from their native frequencies (if necessary) for an orderly placement of the communication signals in channels of a first electromagnetic wave configured according to the TM00 wave mode. The 8 MMICs coupled to the first transmitter (TX<b>1</b>) can be configured to up-convert (or down-convert) the first group of the communication signals to the same center frequency (e.g., 1 GHz for the first electromagnetic wave as described in relation to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>). All 8 MMICs would have synchronized reference oscillators that can be phase locked using various synchronization techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0354" num="0353">Since the 8 MMICs receive signals from the first signal port of the first transmitter (TX<b>1</b>) based on the reference provided by the second signal port, the 8 MMICs thereby receive signals with the same polarity. Consequently, once these signals have been up-converted (or down-converted) and processed for transmission by the 8 MMICs, one or more antennas of each of the 8 MMICs simultaneously radiates signals with electric fields of the same polarity. Collectively, MMICs that are opposite in location to each other (e.g., MIMIC north and MIMIC south) will have an electric field structure aligned towards or away from the transmission medium, thereby creating at a certain instance in time an outward field structure like the TM00 wave mode shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Due to the constant oscillatory nature of the signals radiated by the 8 MMICs, it will be appreciated that at other instances in time, the field structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> will radiate inward. By symmetrically radiating electric fields with the same polarity the collection of opposing MMICs contribute to the inducement of a first electromagnetic wave having a TM00 wave mode that propagates on a transmission medium with a dielectric layer and can convey the first group of the communication signals to a receiving waveguide system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0355" num="0354">Turning now to the second transmitter (TX<b>2</b>) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, this transmitter has a first signal port (SP<b>1</b>) coupled to MMICs located in north, northeast and northwest positions, while a second signal port (SP<b>2</b>) of the second transmitter (TX<b>2</b>) is coupled to the MMICs located in south, southeast and southwest positions (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18K</figref>). The second transmitter (TX<b>2</b>) can be configured to receive a second group of the communication signals described in step <b>2562</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, which differs from the first group of the communication signals received by the first transmitter (TX<b>1</b>). The second group of communication signals can be frequency-shifted by the second transmitter (TX<b>2</b>) from their native frequencies (if necessary) for an orderly placement of the communication signals in channels of a second electromagnetic wave configured according to an HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization. The 6 MMICs coupled to the second transmitter (TX<b>2</b>) can be configured to up-convert (or down-conversion) the second group of the communication signals to the same center frequency as used for the TM00 wave mode (i.e., 1 GHz as described in relation to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>). Since a TM00 wave mode is orthogonal to an HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization, they can share the same center frequency in an overlapping frequency band without interference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0356" num="0355">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the first signal port (SP<b>1</b>) of the second transmitter (TX<b>2</b>) generates signals of opposite polarity to the signals of the second signal port (SP<b>2</b>). As a result, the electric field alignment of signals generated by one or more antennas of the northern MMIC will be of opposite polarity to the electric field alignment of signals generated by one or more antennas of the southern MMIC. Consequently, the electric fields of the north and south MMICs will have an electric field structure that is vertically aligned in the same direction, thereby creating at a certain instance in time a northern field structure like the HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Due to the constant oscillatory nature of the signals radiated by the north and south MMICs, it will be appreciated that at other instances in time, the HE11 wave mode will have a southern field structure. Similarly, based on the opposite polarity of signals supplied to the northeast and southeast MMICs by the first and second signal ports, respectively, these MMICs will generate at a certain instance in time the curved electric field structure shown on the east side of the HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Also, based on the opposite polarity of signals supplied to the northwest and southwest MMICs, these MMICs will generate at a certain instance in time the curved electric field structure shown on the west side of the HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0357" num="0356">By radiating electric fields with opposite polarity by opposing MMICs (north, northeast and northwest versus south, southeast and southwest), the collection of signals with a directionally aligned field structure contribute to the inducement of a second electromagnetic wave having the HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0358" num="0357">Turning now to the third transmitter (TX<b>3</b>) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, this transmitter has a first signal port (SP<b>1</b>) coupled to MMICs located in east, northeast and southeast positions, while a second signal port (SP<b>2</b>) of the third transmitter (TX<b>3</b>) is coupled to the MMICs located in west, northwest and southwest positions (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18K</figref>). The third transmitter (TX<b>3</b>) can be configured to receive a third group of the communication signals described in step <b>2562</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, which differs from the first and second groups of the communication signals received by the first transmitter (TX<b>1</b>) and the second transmitter (TX<b>2</b>), respectively. The third group of communication signals can be frequency-shifted by the third transmitter (TX<b>3</b>) from their native frequencies (if necessary) for an orderly placement of the communication signals in channels of a second electromagnetic wave configured according to an HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization. The 6 MMICs coupled to the third transmitter (TX<b>3</b>) can be configured to up-convert (or down-conversion) the third group of the communication signals to the same center frequency as used for the TM00 wave mode and HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization (i.e., 1 GHz as described in relation to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>). Since a TM00 wave mode, an HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization, and an HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization are orthogonal, they can share the same center frequency in an overlapping frequency band without interference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0358">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the first signal port (SP<b>1</b>) of the third transmitter (TX<b>3</b>) generates signals of opposite polarity to the signals of the second signal port (SP<b>2</b>). As a result, the electric field alignment of signals generated by one or more antennas of the eastern MMIC will be of opposite polarity to the electric field alignment of signals generated by one or more antennas of the western MIMIC. Consequently, the electric fields of the east and west MMICs will have an electric field structure that is horizontally aligned in the same direction, thereby creating at a certain instance in time a western field structure like the HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Due to the constant oscillatory nature of the signals radiated by the east and west MMICs, it will be appreciated that at other instances in time, the HE11 wave mode will have an eastern field structure. Similarly, based on the opposite polarity of signals supplied to the northeast and northwest MMICs by the first and second signal ports, respectively, these MMICs will generate at a certain instance in time the curved electric field structure shown on the north side of the HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0361" num="0360">Because of the orthogonality of the electromagnetic waves described above, a recipient waveguide system can be configured to selectively retrieve the first electromagnetic wave having the TM00 wave mode, the second electromagnetic wave having the HE11 wave mode with vertical polarization, and the third electromagnetic wave having the HE11 wave mode with horizontal polarization. After processing each of these electromagnetic waves, the recipient waveguide system can be further configured to obtain the first, second and third group of the communication signals conveyed by these waves. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> illustrates a block diagram for selectively receiving each of the first, second and third electromagnetic waves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0362" num="0361">Specifically, the first electromagnetic wave having the TM00 wave mode can be selectively received by a first receiver (RX<b>1</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> by taking the difference between the signals received by all 8 MMICs and the signal reference provided by the metal sleeve <b>2523</b>A as depicted in the block diagram in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0363" num="0362"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> illustrates a simplified functional block diagram of an MMIC. The MMIC can, for example, utilize a mixer coupled to a reference (TX) oscillator that shifts one of the communication signals supplied by one of the signal ports (SP<b>1</b> or SP<b>2</b>) of one of the transmitters (TX<b>1</b>, TX<b>2</b> or TX<b>3</b>) to a desired center frequency in accordance with the configurations shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. For example, in the case of TX <b>1</b>, the communication signal from SP<b>1</b> is supplied to a transmit path of each of the MMICs (i.e., NE, NW, SE, SW, N, S, E, and W). In the case of TX<b>2</b>, the communication signal from SP<b>1</b> is supplied to another transmit path of three MMICs (i.e., N, E, and NW). Note the transmit paths used by MMICs N, E and W for the communication signal supplied by SP<b>1</b> of TX<b>2</b> are different from the transmit paths used by the MMICs for the communication signal supplied by SP<b>1</b> of TX<b>1</b>. Similarly, the communication signal from SP<b>2</b> of TX<b>2</b> is supplied to another transmit path of three other MMICs (i.e., S, SE, and SW). Again, the transmit paths used by MMICs S, SE and SW for the communication signal supplied by SP<b>2</b> of TX<b>2</b> are different from the transmit paths used by the MMICs for the communication signals from SP<b>1</b> of TX<b>1</b>, and SP<b>1</b> of TX<b>2</b>. Lastly, in the case of TX<b>3</b>, the communication signal from SP<b>1</b> is supplied to yet another transmit path of three MMICs (i.e., E, NE, and SE). Note the transmit paths used for MMICs E, NE, and SE for the communication signal from SP<b>1</b> of TX<b>3</b> are different from the transmit paths used by the MMICs for the communication signals supplied by SP<b>1</b> of TX<b>1</b>, SP<b>1</b> of TX<b>2</b>, and SP<b>2</b> of TX<b>2</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0364" num="0363">Once the communication signals have been frequency-shifted by the mixer shown in the transmit path, he frequency-shifted signal generated by the mixer can then be filtered by a bandpass filter that removes spurious signals. The output of the bandpass filter in turn can be provided to a power amplifier that couples to an antenna by way of a duplexer for radiating signals in the manner previously described. The duplexer can be used to isolate a transmit path from a receive path. The illustration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> is intentionally oversimplified to enable ease of illustration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0365" num="0364">It will be appreciated that other components (not shown) such as an impedance matching circuit, phase lock loop, or other suitable components for improving the accuracy and efficiency of the transmission path (and receive path) is contemplated by the subject disclosure. Furthermore, while a single antenna can be implemented by each MMIC, other designs with multiple antennas can likewise be employed. It is further appreciated that to achieve more than one orthogonal wave mode with overlapping frequency bands (e.g., TM00, HE11 Vertical, and HE11 Horizontal wave modes described above), the transmit path can be repeated N times using the same reference oscillator. N can represent an integer associated with the number of instances the MMIC is used to generate each of the wave modes. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, MMIC NE is used three times; hence, MMIC NE has three transmit paths (N=3), MMIC NW is used three times; hence, MMIC NW has three transmit paths (N=3), MMIC N is used twice; hence, MMIC N has two transmit paths (N=2), and so on. If frequency division multiplexing is employed to generate the same wave modes in other frequency band(s) (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>), the transmit path can be further repeated using different reference oscillator(s) that are centered at the other frequency band(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0366" num="0365">In the receive path shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, N signals supplied by N antennas via the duplexer of each transmit path in the MMIC can be filtered by a corresponding N bandpass filters, which supply their output to N low-noise amplifiers. The N low-noise amplifiers in turn supply their signals to N mixers to generate N intermediate-frequency received signals. As before, N is representative of the number of instances the MMIC is used for receiving wireless signals for different wave modes. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, MMIC NE is used in three instances; hence, MMIC NE has three receive paths (N=3), MMIC N is used in two instances; hence, MMIC N has two receive paths (N=2), and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0367" num="0366">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, to reconstruct a wave mode signal, Y received signals supplied by receiver paths of certain MMICs or a reference from a metal sleeve is subtracted from X received signals supplied by other MMICs based on the configurations shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35-37</figref>. For example, a TM00 signal is reconstructed by supplying the received signals of all MMICs (NE, NW, SE, SW, N, S, E, W) to the plus port of the summer (i.e., X signals), while the reference signal from the metal sleeve is supplied to the negative port of the summer (i.e., Y signal)—see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. The difference between the X and Y signals results in the TM00 signal. To reconstruct the HE11 Vertical signal, the received signals of MMICs N, NE, and NW are supplied to the plus port of the summer (i.e., X signals), while the received signals of MMICs S, SE, and SW are supplied to the negative port of the summer (i.e., Y signals)—see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. The difference between the X and Y signals results in the HE11 vertical signal. Lastly, to reconstruct the HE11 Horizontal signal, the received signals of MMICs E, NE, and SE are supplied to the plus port of the summer (i.e., X signals), while the received signals of MMICs W, NW, and SW are supplied to the negative port of the summer (i.e., Y signals)—see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. The difference between the X and Y signals results in the HE11 horizontal signal. Since there are three wave mode signals being reconstructed, the block diagram of the summer with the X and Y signals is repeated three times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0368" num="0367">Each of these reconstructed signals is at intermediate frequencies. These intermediate-frequency signals are provided to receivers (RX<b>1</b>, RX<b>2</b> and RX<b>3</b>) which include circuitry (e.g., a DSP, A/D converter, etc.) for processing and to selectively obtain communication signals therefrom. Similar to the transmit paths, the reference oscillators of the three receiver paths can be configured to be synchronized with phase lock loop technology or other suitable synchronization technique. If frequency division multiplexing is employed for the same wave modes in other frequency band(s) (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>), the receiver paths can be further repeated using a different reference oscillator that is centered at the other frequency band(s).</div>

In place of the MMICs, or in combination, slotted launchers as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18D-18E, 18G, and 18I</figref> can be used. It is further appreciated that more or fewer sophisticated functional components can be used for transmitting or receiving orthogonal wave modes.

The modulated signals can be up-converted to adjacent frequency channels in downlink and uplink spectral segments <b>4426</b> and <b>4430</b>. In this fashion, while some adjacent frequency channels in a downlink spectral segment <b>4426</b> can include modulated signals originally in a same native/original frequency band, other adjacent frequency channels in the downlink spectral segment <b>4426</b> can also include modulated signals originally in different native/original frequency bands, but frequency converted to be located in adjacent frequency channels of the downlink spectral segment <b>4426</b>. For example, a first modulated signal in a 1.9 GHz band and a second modulated signal in the same frequency band (i.e., 1.9 GHz) can be frequency converted and thereby positioned in adjacent frequency channels of a downlink spectral segment <b>4426</b>.

Frequency shifting the downlink modulated signals in this manner preserves the signaling protocol and/or modulation technique used to generate the downlink modulated signals, and thereby enables any of the communication nodes <b>4404</b> to restore the downlink modulated signals in spectral segment <b>4426</b> to its respective native/original frequency bands with only a frequency conversion process.</div>

The spectral shape <b>4474</b>, for example, represents a control channel that is separate from reference signal <b>4479</b> and a clock signal <b>4478</b>. It should be noted that the clock signal <b>4478</b> is shown with a spectral shape representing a sinusoidal signal that may require conditioning into the form of a more traditional clock signal. In other embodiments however, a traditional clock signal could be sent as a modulated carrier wave such by modulating the reference signal <b>4479</b> via amplitude modulation or other modulation technique that preserves the phase of the carrier for use as a phase reference. In other embodiments, the clock signal could be transmitted by modulating another carrier wave or as another signal. Further, it is noted that both the clock signal <b>4478</b> and the reference signal <b>4479</b> are shown as being outside the frequency band of the control channel <b>4474</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0395" num="0394">In another example, the portion <b>4475</b> includes a portion of a downlink or uplink spectral segment <b>4426</b> and <b>4430</b> that is represented by a portion of a spectral shape that represents a portion of the bandwidth set aside for a control channel, reference signal, and/or clock signal. The spectral shape <b>4476</b> represents a control channel having instructions that include digital data that modulates the reference signal, via amplitude modulation, amplitude shift keying or other modulation technique that preserves the phase of the carrier for use as a phase reference. The clock signal <b>4478</b> is shown as being outside the frequency band of the spectral shape <b>4476</b>. The reference signal, being modulated by the control channel instructions, is in effect a subcarrier of the control channel and is in-band to the control channel. Again, the clock signal <b>4478</b> is shown with a spectral shape representing a sinusoidal signal, in other embodiments however, a traditional clock signal could be sent as a modulated carrier wave or other signal. In this case, the instructions of the control channel can be used to modulate the clock signal <b>4478</b> instead of the reference signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0396" num="0395">Consider the following example, where the control channel <b>4476</b> is carried via modulation of a reference signal in the form of a continuous wave (CW) from which the phase distortion in the receiver is corrected during frequency conversion of the downlink or uplink spectral segment <b>4426</b> and <b>4430</b> back to its original/native spectral segment. The control channel <b>4476</b> can be modulated with a robust modulation such as pulse amplitude modulation, binary phase shift keying, amplitude shift keying or other modulation scheme to carry instructions between network elements of the distributed antenna system such as network operations, administration and management traffic and other control data.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0397" num="0400">In a further example, the control channel data can be sent via ultra-wideband (UWB) signaling. The control channel data can be transmitted by generating radio energy at specific time intervals and occupying a larger bandwidth, via pulse-position or time modulation, by encoding the polarity or amplitude of the UWB pulses and/or by using orthogonal pulses. In particular, UWB pulses can be sent sporadically at relatively low pulse rates to support time or position modulation, but can also be sent at rates up to the inverse of the UWB pulse bandwidth. In this fashion, the control channel can be spread over an UWB spectrum with relatively low power, and without interfering with CW transmissions of the reference signal and/or clock signal that may occupy in-band portions of the UWB spectrum of the control channel.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0436" num="0439">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, a block diagram <b>4800</b> is shown illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a virtualized communication network in accordance with various aspects described herein. In particular a virtualized communication network is presented that can be used to implement some or all of the subsystems and functions of communication network <b>4700</b>, some or all of the embodiments associated with waveguide systems and methods thereof, some or all of the embodiments associated with distributed antenna systems, or other embodiments and methods thereof described by the subject disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0437" num="0440">In particular, a cloud networking architecture is shown that leverages cloud technologies and supports rapid innovation and scalability via a transport layer <b>4850</b>, a virtualized network function cloud <b>4825</b> and/or one or more cloud computing environments <b>4875</b>. In various embodiments, this cloud networking architecture is an open architecture that leverages application programming interfaces (APIs); reduces complexity from services and operations; supports more nimble business models; and rapidly and seamlessly scales to meet evolving customer requirements including traffic growth, diversity of traffic types, and diversity of performance and reliability expectations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0438" num="0441">In contrast to traditional network elements—which are typically integrated to perform a single function, the virtualized communication network employs virtual network elements <b>4830</b>, <b>4832</b>, <b>4834</b>, etc. that perform some or all of the functions of network elements <b>4750</b>, <b>4752</b>, <b>4754</b>, <b>4756</b>, etc. For example, the network architecture can provide a substrate of networking capability, often called Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) or simply infrastructure that is capable of being directed with software and Software Defined Networking (SDN) protocols to perform a broad variety of network functions and services. This infrastructure can include several types of substrates. The most typical type of substrate being servers that support Network Function Virtualization (NFV), followed by packet forwarding capabilities based on generic computing resources, with specialized network technologies brought to bear when general purpose processors or general purpose integrated circuit devices offered by merchants (referred to herein as merchant silicon) are not appropriate. In this case, communication services can be implemented as cloud-centric workloads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0439" num="0442">As an example, a traditional network element <b>4750</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>), such as an edge router can be implemented via a virtual network element <b>4830</b> composed of NFV software modules, merchant silicon, and associated controllers. The software can be written so that increasing workload consumes incremental resources from a common resource pool, and moreover so that it's elastic: so the resources are only consumed when needed. In a similar fashion, other network elements such as other routers, switches, edge caches, and middle-boxes are instantiated from the common resource pool. Such sharing of infrastructure across a broad set of uses makes planning and growing infrastructure easier to manage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0440" num="0443">In an embodiment, the transport layer <b>4850</b> includes fiber, cable, wired and/or wireless transport elements, network elements and interfaces to provide broadband access <b>4710</b>, wireless access <b>4720</b>, voice access <b>4730</b>, media access <b>4740</b> and/or access to content sources <b>4775</b> for distribution of content to any or all of the access technologies. In particular, in some cases a network element needs to be positioned at a specific place, and this allows for less sharing of common infrastructure. Other times, the network elements have specific physical layer adapters that cannot be abstracted or virtualized, and might require special DSP code and analog front-ends (AFEs) that do not lend themselves to implementation as virtual network elements <b>4830</b>, <b>4832</b> or <b>4834</b>. These network elements can be included in transport layer <b>4850</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0441" num="0444">The virtualized network function cloud <b>4825</b> interfaces with the transport layer <b>4850</b> to provide the virtual network elements <b>4830</b>, <b>4832</b>, <b>4834</b>, etc. to provide specific NFVs. In particular, the virtualized network function cloud <b>4825</b> leverages cloud operations, applications, and architectures to support networking workloads. The virtualized network elements <b>4830</b>, <b>4832</b> and <b>4834</b> can employ network function software that provides either a one-for-one mapping of traditional network element function or alternately some combination of network functions designed for cloud computing. For example, virtualized network elements <b>4830</b>, <b>4832</b> and <b>4834</b> can include route reflectors, domain name system (DNS) servers, and dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) servers, system architecture evolution (SAE) and/or mobility management entity (MME) gateways, broadband network gateways, IP edge routers for IP-VPN, Ethernet and other services, load balancers, distributers and other network elements. Because these elements don't typically need to forward large amounts of traffic, their workload can be distributed across a number of servers—each of which adds a portion of the capability, and overall which creates an elastic function with higher availability than its former monolithic version. These virtual network elements <b>4830</b>, <b>4832</b>, <b>4834</b>, etc. can be instantiated and managed using an orchestration approach similar to those used in cloud compute services.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0442" num="0445">The cloud computing environments <b>4875</b> can interface with the virtualized network function cloud <b>4825</b> via APIs that expose functional capabilities of the VNE <b>4830</b>, <b>4832</b>, <b>4834</b>, etc. to provide the flexible and expanded capabilities to the virtualized network function cloud <b>4825</b>. In particular, network workloads may have applications distributed across the virtualized network function cloud <b>4825</b> and cloud computing environment <b>4875</b> and in the commercial cloud, or might simply orchestrate workloads supported entirely in NFV infrastructure from these third party locations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0443" num="0446">It will be appreciated that any of the foregoing techniques can be applied or combined in whole or in party with any embodiments of the subsystems and functions of communication network <b>4700</b>, some or all of the embodiments associated with waveguide systems and methods thereof, some or all of the embodiments associated with distributed antenna systems, as well as other embodiments and methods thereof described by the subject disclosure.</div>

In one or more embodiments, the mobile network platform <b>5010</b> can generate and receive signals transmitted and received by base stations (e.g., base station devices <b>1504</b>, macrocell site <b>1502</b>, or base stations <b>1614</b>), central office (e.g., central office <b>1501</b> or <b>1611</b>), or transmission device <b>101</b> or <b>102</b> associated with the disclosed subject matter. Generally, wireless network platform <b>5010</b> can comprise components, e.g., nodes, gateways, interfaces, servers, or disparate platforms, that facilitate both packet-switched (PS) (e.g., internet protocol (IP), frame relay, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)) and circuit-switched (CS) traffic (e.g., voice and data), as well as control generation for networked wireless telecommunication. As a non-limiting example, wireless network platform <b>5010</b> can be included in telecommunications carrier networks, and can be considered carrier-side components as discussed elsewhere herein. Mobile network platform <b>5010</b> comprises CS gateway node(s) <b>5022</b> which can interface CS traffic received from legacy networks like telephony network(s) <b>5040</b> (e.g., public switched telephone network (PSTN), or public land mobile network (PLMN)) or a signaling system #7 (SS7) network <b>5060</b>.

It will be appreciated that the memory components described herein can be either volatile memory or nonvolatile memory, or can comprise both volatile and nonvolatile memory, by way of illustration, and not limitation, volatile memory, non-volatile memory, disk storage, and memory storage. Further, nonvolatile memory can be included in read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM), electrically programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable ROM (EEPROM), or flash memory.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0483" num="0486">Some of the embodiments described herein can also employ artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate automating one or more features described herein. For example, artificial intelligence can be used in optional training controller <b>230</b> evaluate and select candidate frequencies, modulation schemes, MIMO modes, and/or guided wave modes in order to maximize transfer efficiency. The embodiments (e.g., in connection with automatically identifying acquired cell sites that provide a maximum value/benefit after addition to an existing communication network) can employ various AI-based schemes for carrying out various embodiments thereof. Moreover, the classifier can be employed to determine a ranking or priority of the each cell site of the acquired network. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, . . . , xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x)=confidence (class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs, which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches comprise, e.g., naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0484" num="0487">As will be readily appreciated, one or more of the embodiments can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., via a generic training data) as well as implicitly trained (e.g., via observing UE behavior, operator preferences, historical information, receiving extrinsic information). For example, SVMs can be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, the classifier(s) can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions, including but not limited to determining according to a predetermined criteria which of the acquired cell sites will benefit a maximum number of subscribers and/or which of the acquired cell sites will add minimum value to the existing communication network coverage, etc.</div>
