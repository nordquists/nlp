<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to additive manufacturing techniques for printing three-dimensional (3D) parts. In particular, the present disclosure relates to additive manufacturing methods for printing 3D parts in a layer-by-layer manner from part materials having one or more semi-crystalline polymeric materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Additive manufacturing systems are used to print or otherwise build 3D parts from digital representations of the 3D parts (e.g., AMF and STL format files) using one or more additive manufacturing techniques. Examples of commercially available additive manufacturing techniques include extrusion-based techniques, jetting, selective laser sintering, powder/binder jetting, electron-beam melting, and stereolithographic processes. For each of these techniques, the digital representation of the 3D part is initially sliced into multiple horizontal layers. For each sliced layer, a tool path is then generated, which provides instructions for the particular additive manufacturing system to print the given layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, in an extrusion-based additive manufacturing system, a 3D part may be printed from a digital representation of the 3D part in a layer-by-layer manner by extruding a flowable part material. The part material is extruded through an extrusion tip carried by a print head of the system, and is deposited as a sequence of roads on a substrate in an x-y plane. The extruded part material fuses to previously deposited part material, and solidifies upon a drop in temperature. The position of the print head relative to the substrate is then incremented along a z-axis (perpendicular to the x-y plane), and the process is then repeated to form a 3D part resembling the digital representation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In fabricating 3D parts by depositing layers of a part material, supporting layers or structures are typically built underneath overhanging portions or in cavities of 3D parts under construction, which are not supported by the part material itself. A support structure may be built utilizing the same deposition techniques by which the part material is deposited. The host computer generates additional geometry acting as a support structure for the overhanging or free-space segments of the 3D part being formed. Support material is then deposited from a second nozzle pursuant to the generated geometry during the printing process. The support material adheres to the part material during fabrication, and is removable from the completed 3D part when the printing process is complete.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">Definitions</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Unless otherwise specified, the following terms as used herein have the meanings provided below:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The term “polymer” refers to a polymeric material having one or more monomer species, including homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The term “semi-crystalline polymer” refers to a polymer capable of exhibiting an average percent crystallinity in a solid state of at least about 10% by weight when allowed to crystallize to its fullest extent. The term “semi-crystalline polymer” includes polymeric materials capable of having crystallinities up to 100% (i.e., fully-crystalline polymeric materials). The term “amorphous polymer” refers to a polymer that is not a semi-crystalline polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Reference to “a” chemical compound refers one or more molecules of the chemical compound, rather than being limited to a single molecule of the chemical compound. Furthermore, the one or more molecules may or may not be identical, so long as they fall under the category of the chemical compound. Thus, for example, “a” polyamide is interpreted to include one or more polymer molecules of the polyamide, where the polymer molecules may or may not be identical (e.g., different molecular weights and/or isomers).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The terms “at least one” and “one or more of” an element are used interchangeably, and have the same meaning that includes a single element and a plurality of the elements, and may also be represented by the suffix “(s)” at the end of the element. For example, “at least one polyamide”, “one or more polyamides”, and “polyamide(s)” may be used interchangeably and have the same meaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Directional orientations such as “above”, “below”, “top”, “bottom”, and the like are made with reference to a layer-printing direction of a 3D part. In the embodiments shown below, the layer-printing direction is the upward direction along the vertical z-axis. In these embodiments, the terms “above”, “below”, “top”, “bottom”, and the like are based on the vertical z-axis. However, in embodiments in which the layers of 3D parts are printed along a different axis, such as along a horizontal x-axis or y-axis, the terms “above”, “below”, “top”, “bottom”, and the like are relative to the given axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Unless otherwise specified, characteristics of a material or a 3D part printed from the material refer to the characteristics as measured parallel to the orientation of the 3D part layers and perpendicular to the layer-printing direction, and is referred to as an “xy-direction”. Correspondingly, the term “z-direction”, with reference to characteristics of a material or a 3D part printed from the material refer to the characteristics as measured perpendicular to the orientation of the 3D part layers and parallel to the layer-printing direction. Unless the measurement direction is specified as “in the z-direction”, a measurement referred to herein is taken in the xy-direction. For example, a tensile strength of a 3D part of 10,000 psi refers to a tensile strength measured parallel to the layers of the 3D part. Alternatively, a tensile strength of a 3D part in the z-direction of 8,000 psi refers to a tensile strength measured perpendicular to the layers of the 3D part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Unless otherwise specified, temperatures referred to herein are based on atmospheric pressure (i.e. one atmosphere).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The term “additive manufacturing system” refers to a system that prints, builds, or otherwise produces 3D parts and/or support structures at least in part using an additive manufacturing technique. The additive manufacturing system may be a stand-alone unit, a sub-unit of a larger system or production line, and/or may include other non-additive manufacturing features, such as subtractive-manufacturing features, pick-and-place features, two-dimensional printing features, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The term “providing”, such as for “providing a consumable material”, when recited in the claims, is not intended to require any particular delivery or receipt of the provided item.

However, other embodiments may also be preferred, under the same or other circumstances. Furthermore, the recitation of one or more preferred embodiments does not imply that other embodiments are not useful, and is not intended to exclude other embodiments from the scope of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The terms “about” and “substantially” are used herein with respect to measurable values and ranges due to expected variations known to those skilled in the art (e.g., limitations and variabilities in measurements).</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The present disclosure is directed to an additive manufacturing method for printing 3D parts in a layer-by-layer manner from a part material that, in a preferred embodiment, compositionally includes a blend of one or more semi-crystalline polymers and one or more secondary materials that retard crystallization of the semi-crystalline polymer(s), such as one or more amorphous polymers that are at least partially miscible with the semi-crystalline polymer(s). In particular, the method involves controlling the crystallization kinetics of the semi-crystalline polymer(s) upon cooling from a melted state to minimize or otherwise reduce the percent crystallinity of the printed part material, while also generating enough crystallization-exothermic energy to induce molecular reptation at the extrudate-part interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">As discussed below, the manner in which the crystallization kinetics of the part material are controlled can vary depending on the additive manufacturing technique used, such as an extrusion-based additive manufacturing technique, an electrophotography-based additive manufacturing technique, or a selective laser sintering technique. These distinctions are primarily due to the different thermal states in which the printed layers are typically held for the given additive manufacturing techniques. As such, the following discussion initially focuses on controlling the crystallization kinetics in an extrusion-based additive manufacturing system, and the applications for use in an electrophotography-based additive manufacturing and a selective laser sintering system will be subsequently discussed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Extrusion-based additive manufacturing systems typically print or otherwise build 3D parts from amorphous polymeric materials, such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) resins and polycarbonate resins. During a printing operation, the amorphous polymeric material is melted and extruded as a series of roads, which cool down to form layers of a 3D part. Due to the layer-by-layer nature of the printing, the cooling of each successive layer generates residual stresses in the 3D part, which are a function of the coefficient of thermal expansion, percent shrinkage, and tensile modulus of the material. If not relieved, the residual stresses may physically distort the 3D part, such as by causing the edges and corners of the 3D part to curl up, referred to as “curl” or “curling”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Amorphous polymeric materials have little or no ordered arrangements of their polymer chains in their solid states. As such, these materials exhibit glass transition effects that can be controlled to partially relieve residual stresses. For example, as disclosed in Batchelder, U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,058, an amorphous polymeric material may be deposited into a heated chamber (or at least a locally-heat deposition region) maintained at a temperature that is between a solidification temperature and a glass transition temperature of the material. This anneals the successively-printed printed layers, allowing them to cool down and solidify slowly, which can partially relieve the residual stresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Semi-crystalline polymeric materials, however, have different mechanical and thermal characteristics from amorphous polymeric materials. For example, due to their achievable crystallinity, 3D parts printed with semi-crystalline polymeric materials may exhibit superior mechanical properties compared to 3D parts printed with amorphous polymeric materials. However, due to their higher levels of achievable crystallinity, semi-crystalline polymeric materials can exhibit discontinuous changes in volume upon solidification. Therefore, layers of a semi-crystalline polymeric material may contract and shrink when deposited, thereby accumulating residual stresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In comparison to amorphous polymeric materials, which can have relatively broad annealing windows, it has been conventionally difficult to maintain a temperature window that is suitable for annealing semi-crystalline polymers, particularly with extrusion-based additive manufacturing systems. For instance, curl will result if we hold the polymer above the window, as will curl result if below the window. Any variations outside of this small temperature window will result in solidification with discontinuous changes in volume, such as curl, if above or below the temperature window. The discontinuous changes in volume can be particularly troublesome for extrusion-based additive manufacturing systems where the printed 3D parts or support structures are coupled to underlying and non-shrinkable build sheets. Furthermore, sagging may occur if there is not enough crystallinity generated during the cooling process. Each of these conditions may result in distortions of the printed 3D part. As such, it has been difficult to print dimensionally stable 3D parts from semi-crystalline polymers using extrusion-based additive manufacturing systems, where the amount of crystallinity formed during the cooling process is sufficient such that the 3D parts do not sag, yet also do not induce curl forces that will curl the 3D part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">However, as discussed below, the crystallization kinetics of particular part materials can be controlled in an extrusion-based additive manufacturing system to print 3D parts having mechanical properties (e.g., strengths and ductilities) similar to those of semi-crystalline polymeric materials, while also being annealable in a heated chamber of an additive manufacturing system (or at least a locally-heated deposition region) to partially relieve residual stresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> illustrate system <b>10</b>, which is an example extrusion-based additive manufacturing system for printing or otherwise building 3D parts, from the part material blends discussed herein, in a manner that controls the crystallization kinetics, as discussed below. Suitable extrusion-based additive manufacturing systems for system <b>10</b> include fused deposition modeling systems developed by Stratasys, Inc., Eden Prairie, Minn. under the trademark “FDM”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>10</b> may include chamber <b>12</b>, platen <b>14</b>, platen gantry <b>16</b>, print head <b>18</b>, head gantry <b>20</b>, and consumable assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Chamber <b>12</b> is an example enclosed build environment that contains platen <b>14</b> for printing 3D parts and support structures, where chamber <b>12</b> may be may be optionally omitted and/or replaced with different types of build environments. For example, a 3D part and support structure may be built in a build environment that is open to ambient conditions or may be enclosed with alternative structures (e.g., flexible curtains).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In the shown example, the interior volume of chamber <b>12</b> may be heated with heater <b>12</b> <i>h </i>to reduce the rate at which the part and support materials solidify after being extruded and deposited (e.g., to reduce distortions and curling). Heater <b>12</b> <i>h </i>may be any suitable device or assembly for heating the interior volume of chamber <b>12</b>, such as by radiant heating and/or by circulating heated air or other gas (e.g., inert gases). In alternative embodiments, heater <b>12</b> <i>h </i>may be replaced with other conditioning devices, such as a cooling unit to generate and circulate cooling air or other gas. The particular thermal conditions for the build environment may vary depending on the particular consumable materials used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In further embodiments, the heating may be localized rather than in an entire chamber <b>12</b>. For example, the deposition region may be heated in a localized manner. Example techniques for locally-heating a deposition region include heating platen <b>14</b> and/or with directing heat air jets towards platen <b>14</b> and/or the 3D parts/support structures being printed). As discussed above, the heating in chamber <b>12</b> and/or the localized deposition region anneals the printed layers of the 3D parts (and support structures) to partially relieve the residual stresses, thereby reducing curling of the 3D parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Platen <b>14</b> is a platform on which 3D parts and support structures are printed in a layer-by-layer manner. In some embodiments, platen <b>14</b> may also include a flexible polymeric film or liner on which the 3D parts and support structures are printed. In the shown example, print head <b>18</b> is a dual-tip extrusion head configured to receive consumable filaments from consumable assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> (e.g., via guide tubes <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>) for printing 3D part <b>30</b> and support structure <b>32</b> on platen <b>14</b>. Consumable assembly <b>22</b> may contain a supply of the part material for printing 3D part <b>30</b> from the part material. Consumable assembly <b>24</b> may contain a supply of a support material for printing support structure <b>32</b> from the given support material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Platen <b>14</b> is supported by platen gantry <b>16</b>, which is a gantry assembly configured to move platen <b>14</b> along (or substantially along) a vertical z-axis. Correspondingly, print head <b>18</b> is supported by head gantry <b>20</b>, which is a gantry assembly configured to move print head <b>18</b> in (or substantially in) a horizontal x-y plane above chamber <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In an alternative embodiment, platen <b>14</b> may be configured to move in the horizontal x-y plane within chamber <b>12</b>, and print head <b>18</b> may be configured to move along the z-axis. Other similar arrangements may also be used such that one or both of platen <b>14</b> and print head <b>18</b> are moveable relative to each other. Platen <b>14</b> and print head <b>18</b> may also be oriented along different axes. For example, platen <b>14</b> may be oriented vertically and print head <b>18</b> may print 3D part <b>30</b> and support structure <b>32</b> along the x-axis or the y-axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">System <b>10</b> also includes controller <b>34</b>, which is one or more control circuits configured to monitor and operate the components of system <b>10</b>. For example, one or more of the control functions performed by controller <b>34</b> can be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, and the like, or a combination thereof. Controller <b>34</b> may communicate over communication line <b>36</b> with chamber <b>12</b> (e.g., with a heating unit for chamber <b>12</b>), print head <b>18</b>, and various sensors, calibration devices, display devices, and/or user input devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, controller <b>34</b> may also communicate with one or more of platen <b>14</b>, platen gantry <b>16</b>, head gantry <b>20</b>, and any other suitable component of system <b>10</b>. While illustrated as a single signal line, communication line <b>36</b> may include one or more electrical, optical, and/or wireless signal lines, allowing controller <b>34</b> to communicate with various components of system <b>10</b>. Furthermore, while illustrated outside of system <b>10</b>, controller <b>34</b> and communication line <b>36</b> may be internal components to system <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">System <b>12</b> and/or controller <b>34</b> may also communicate with computer <b>38</b>, which is one or more computer-based systems that communicates with system <b>12</b> and/or controller <b>34</b>, and may be separate from system <b>12</b>, or alternatively may be an internal component of system <b>12</b>. Computer <b>38</b> includes computer-based hardware, such as data storage devices, processors, memory modules and the like for generating and storing tool path and related printing instructions. Computer <b>38</b> may transmit these instructions to system <b>10</b> (e.g., to controller <b>34</b>) to perform printing operations. Controller <b>34</b> and computer <b>38</b> may collectively be referred to as a controller assembly for system <b>10</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">While liquefier assembly <b>44</b> is in its active state, thermal block <b>58</b> heats liquefier tube <b>56</b> to define heating zone <b>68</b>.

The upper region of liquefier tube <b>56</b> above heating zone <b>68</b>, referred to as transition zone <b>72</b>, is not directly heated by thermal block <b>58</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The molten portion of the part material (i.e., melt <b>70</b>) forms meniscus <b>74</b> around the unmelted portion of filament <b>52</b>. During an extrusion of melt <b>70</b> through nozzle <b>48</b>, the downward movement of filament <b>52</b> functions as a viscosity pump to extrude the part material of melt <b>70</b> out of nozzle <b>48</b> as extruded roads to print 3D part <b>30</b> in a layer-by-layer manner.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, controller <b>34</b> may servo or swap liquefier assemblies <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> between opposing active and stand-by states. For example, while liquefier assembly <b>46</b> is servoed to its active state for extruding the support material to print a layer of support structure <b>32</b>, liquefier assembly <b>44</b> is switched to a stand-by state to prevent the part material from being extruded while liquefier assembly <b>46</b> is being used. After a given layer of the support material is completed, controller <b>34</b> then servoes liquefier assembly <b>46</b> to its stand-by state, and switches liquefier assembly <b>44</b> to its active state for extruding the part material to print a layer of 3D part <b>30</b>. This servo process may be repeated for each printed layer until 3D part <b>30</b> and support structure <b>32</b> are completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">While liquefier assembly <b>46</b> is in its active state for printing support structure <b>32</b> from a support material filament, drive mechanism <b>42</b>, liquefier assembly <b>46</b>, and nozzle <b>50</b> (each shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may operate in the same manner as drive mechanism <b>40</b>, liquefier assembly <b>44</b>, and nozzle <b>48</b> for extruding the support material. In particular, drive mechanism <b>40</b> may draw successive segments of the support material filament from consumable assembly <b>24</b> (via guide tube <b>28</b>), and feed the support material filament to liquefier assembly <b>46</b>. Liquefier assembly <b>46</b> thermally melts the successive segments of the received support material filament such that it becomes a molten support material.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">As mentioned above, the part material compositionally includes a blend of one or more semi-crystalline polymers and one or more secondary materials that retard crystallization of the semi-crystalline polymer(s). Preferably, the secondary material(s) include one or more amorphous polymers that are at least partially miscible with the semi-crystalline polymer(s). The following discussion is made with reference to the secondary material(s) as amorphous polymer(s) with the understanding that the part material may alternatively include other non-amorphous polymer(s) to retard crystallization of the semi-crystalline polymer(s). Nonetheless, amorphous polymer(s) are preferred as they may also provide additional desired characteristics to the part material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">More preferably, the semi-crystalline polymer(s) and the amorphous polymer(s) are substantially miscible with each other. The substantially miscible blend may exhibit a co-continuous phase of the semi-crystalline polymer(s) and the amorphous polymer(s), or more preferably a single continuous phase of the semi-crystalline polymer(s) and the amorphous polymer(s). While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this miscibility allows the amorphous polymer(s) to physically impede the semi-crystalline polymer(s) from forming crystalline regions, which accordingly retards crystallization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the amorphous polymer(s) of the part material have substantially no measurable melting points (less than 5 calories/gram) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) pursuant to ASTM D3418-08. Correspondingly, in these embodiments, the semi-crystalline polymer(s) of the part material have measureable melting points (5 calories/gram or more) using DSC pursuant to ASTM D3418-08. As discussed below, the part material may also optionally include one or more additives dispersed in the blend.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a DSC plot for an exemplary part material of the present disclosure having a substantially miscible blend of one or more semi-crystalline polymers and one or more amorphous polymers. The DSC pot in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the various thermal transitions that the part material may exhibit. For example, during an initial heating phase, such as when the part material is melted in liquefier assembly <b>44</b>, the part material may produce a heating profile <b>80</b> with a glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>), a cold crystallization temperature (T<sub>c,cold</sub>), and a melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>). The glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) refers to the point along curve <b>80</b> where the part material undergoes a second-order transition to achieve an increase in its heat capacity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the semi-crystalline copolymer or blend may consist essentially of semi-crystalline polymers that exhibit substantial or complete miscibility. This may be the case for closely related polymers that are synthesized using (i) one or more base monomers, and (ii) a sizable fraction of one or more monomers that are structural or optical isomers of the base monomer(s) usually used in the synthesis. Other options include additional, unrelated monomers added in sufficient amounts to substantially alter the glass transition temperature, crystallization temperatures, re-crystallization temperatures, melting points, and/or enthalpies of fusion, as measured during heating or cooling at a specified, constant rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Examples of some suitable techniques for these embodiments include controlling the level of d-lactide and l-lactide incorporated into a final polylactic acid polymer to achieve a poly-DL-lactide. The DL polylactic acid copolymer has slower crystallization kinetics and may even exhibit characteristics of a completely amorphous polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Another useful example includes polyetherketoneketone (PEKK). Crystallinity, melting, point, enthalpy of fusion, crystallization rate, and even glass transition temperature have been seen to drop as the ratio of terephthalic moieties-to-isophtalic moieties in the copolymer backbone increases. In PEKK, an observed range from highly crystalline to practically amorphous behavior is observed in terephthalic-to-isophtalic moiety ratios from about 80/20 to about 60/40.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">A third useful example includes the synthesis of polyesters, specifically those based on a poly(ethyleneterephthalate) polymer. In this case, some isophthalic moeities may be used in place of a terephthalic moeities to impart similar adjustments in crystallinity and crystallization behavior as discussed above for PEKK. Additionally, one or more glycols may be exchanged with one or more ethylene glycols, propylene glycols, and/or butylene glycols, such as cyclohexanedimethanol, for example, to achieve similar effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>typically occurs due to the increased mobility of the polymer molecules after exceeding the glass transition temperature T<sub>g</sub>, which allows a portion of the semi-crystalline polymer(s) to form crystalline regions. Because the crystallization is an exothermic process, it releases thermal energy based on a first-order transition, as illustrated by the inverted peak in heating profile <b>80</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The melting temperature T<sub>m </sub>is the temperature at which the part material fully liquefies, also based on a first-order transition. Typically, the part material is quickly heated past its melting temperature T<sub>m </sub>in liquefier assembly <b>44</b> for extrusion. As such, during this point in the process, the glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>and the cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>are not overly relevant to the crystallization state of the extrudate, other than for potential melt flow and temperature control aspects in liquefier assembly <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The DSC plot in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also includes a cooling profile <b>82</b>, which illustrates hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot</sub>, and describes the crystallization kinetics of the part material as it cools down from its melting temperature T<sub>m</sub>. For example, after being extruded from nozzle <b>48</b>, the extruded part material may deposit as roads onto the previously-formed layer of 3D part <b>30</b>, and begin cooling down. In other words, the part material begins to follow cooling profile <b>82</b> at a cooling rate that depends on the environment temperature that 3D part <b>30</b> is printed in (e.g. in chamber <b>12</b>), as well as the particular composition of the part material and the size of 3D part <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Preferably, the layers of 3D part <b>30</b> are printed in chamber <b>12</b> (or at least in a locally-heated deposition region) that is maintained at a temperature between a solidification temperature and the cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>of the part material. This can anneal the successively-printed printed layers, allowing them to cool down and solidify slowly, which can partially relieve the residual stresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, chamber <b>12</b> or the locally-heated deposition region is maintained at a temperature between a solidification temperature and the glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>of the part material. These embodiments are suitable for part materials having low levels of crystalline regions, where the crystalline regions are not capable of supporting the printed layers at higher temperatures without slumping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Alternatively, in other embodiments, chamber <b>12</b> or the locally-heated deposition region is maintained at a temperature within an annealing window <b>84</b> having a lower limit at about the glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>of the part material and an upper limit that is less than the cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>of the part material. In particular, annealing window <b>84</b> preferably encompasses the plateau region <b>86</b> of DSC heating curve <b>80</b>, which is above the increased slope for the glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>and below the decreased slope for the cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold</sub>. These embodiments are suitable for part materials having enough crystalline regions to support the printed layers without slumping, despite being held above the glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>of the part material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">In further embodiments, such as for use with low-temperature materials (e.g., those with glass transition temperatures near ambient temperatures), chamber <b>12</b> may be omitted, and the part material may be printed at room temperature (e.g., 25° C.). Regardless of the annealing temperature, it has been found that the substantially-miscible blends for the part material modify the glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>of the part material from that of the amorphous polymer(s), typically flowing the Flory-Fox Equation. The substantially-miscible blends may also decrease the hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot </sub>of the part material from that of the pure semi-crystalline polymer(s). This provides a unique advantage in that the cumulative amount of crystallization for the part material upon cooling can be reduced, which accordingly allows the printed layers of the part material to have low levels of crystallinity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In particular, upon being extruded and deposited from nozzle <b>48</b>, the part material preferably is quickly cooled down past its hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot </sub>to its annealing temperature below the cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>of the part material (e.g., within annealing window <b>84</b>). This effectively supercools the part material down below its cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">It has been found that the level of crystallinity can be controlled based on the particular annealing temperature used. For instance, if more amorphous properties are desired, the annealing temperature may be set to be set within about 5° C. of the glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>of the part material. Alternatively, if more crystalline properties are desired, the annealing temperature may be set to be set within 5° C. of the cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>of the part material. Furthermore, any intermediate amorphous-crystalline variation may be achieved by maintaining the annealing temperature at a selected temperature within annealing window <b>84</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The incorporation of the amorphous polymer(s) also assists in physically impeding the semi-crystalline polymer(s) from grouping together in ordered arrangements to form crystalline regions. As such, as the part material quickly cools down from its melting temperature T<sub>m</sub>, the short residence time in the region between its hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot </sub>and its cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold</sub>, combined with the crystallization impedance, preferably minimizes or otherwise reduces the formation of crystalline regions in the part material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">For instance, if a given pure semi-crystalline polymer (i.e., non-blend) is capable of crystallizing to its fullest extent in about 3 seconds in the region between its hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot </sub>and its cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold</sub>, and if it quickly cools down such that it resides in this region for about one second, it may form about one-third of is achievable of crystalline regions. In comparison, the crystallization impedance of the part material blend may require more than a 10 to 20-fold increase in the time required to fully crystallize. As such, when the part material resides in this region between its hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot </sub>and its cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>for about one second, it may only form about 1-3% of its fully-achievable crystallinity, for example. In fact, it has been observed that the supercooled part material exhibits a translucent, substantially non-opaque appearance. This is an indication that crystallinity has been significantly retarded since crystalline regions typically modify the indices of refraction of the extruded layers to render them opaque.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The minimized or reduced crystallization correspondingly reduces the discontinuous changes in volume of the semi-crystalline polymer(s), thereby reducing the residual stresses on the printed layers. Furthermore, holding the printed layers at the annealing temperature (e.g., within annealing window <b>84</b>) also anneals the successively-printed printed layers, allowing them to cool down and solidify slowly, which can relieve the residual stresses typically associated with amorphous materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In other words, the part material is preferably supercooled quickly from its extrusion temperatures down to an annealing temperature in annealing window <b>84</b>, and then held within annealing window <b>84</b> for a suitable duration to relieve the residual stresses. After that, the printed layers of the part material may be cooled down further (e.g., below its glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>and/or its solidification temperature).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Another interesting property of the part materials of the present disclosure is that, despite the minimized or reduced crystallinity, the crystallization that does occur during the supercooling generates a sufficient amount of heat to induce extra or increased molecular reptation at the extrudate-part interface. In other words, the heat produced during the limited crystallization-exothermic reaction allows the polymer molecules at the extrudate-part interface to move and become highly entangled. It has been observed that, due to the heat of fusion of the extruded roads, the rate of temperature decay of the extruded part material can change, and cool down at a slower rate. For example, in an interior raster pattern, this can result in an interfacial temperature boost, causing better reptation in the X-Y build plane, as long as the rastered roads contact each other before the extruded part material cools down to the annealing temperature in chamber <b>12</b>. This accordingly increases the strength of the printed 3D part <b>30</b> in both the intra-layer x-y directions, and also in the interlayer z-direction. As a result, 3D part <b>30</b> may have mechanical properties (e.g., strengths and ductilities) similar to those of semi-crystalline polymer(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Once the printing operation is completed, 3D part <b>30</b> may then be cooled down to room temperature and optionally undergo one or more post-printing processes. Alternatively, 3D part <b>30</b> may be reheated in a post-printing crystallization step. In this step, 3D part <b>30</b> may be heated up to about its cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>for a sufficient duration to induce further crystallization of the semi-crystalline polymer(s). Examples of suitable annealing durations in the post-printing crystallization step range from about 30 minutes to 3 hours, and may vary depending on the dimensions of each 3D part <b>30</b> and the part material compositions. Correspondingly, examples of suitable annealing temperatures in the post-printing crystallization step range from about the cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>of the part material to within about 10° C. above its cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold</sub>, and more preferably to within about 5° C. above its cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The post-printing crystallization step can further increase the mechanical, thermal, and chemical resistance properties of 3D part <b>30</b> due to the increased formation of the crystalline regions. Additionally, this post-printing crystallization step is performed on 3D part <b>30</b> as a whole (i.e., congruent crystallization), rather than as the layers are individually printed. As such, any potential shrinkage on 3D part <b>30</b> from the formation of the crystalline regions occurs in a uniform manner similar to the effects in an injection molding process, rather than in a layer-by-layer manner that can otherwise result in curling effects. Another important feature with the post-printing crystallization step is that 3D part <b>30</b> is preferably de-coupled from platen <b>14</b> (e.g., from a build sheet of platen <b>14</b>), allowing 3D part <b>30</b> to be further crystallized without being restricted by any non-shrinkable build sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">As mentioned above, a 3D part <b>30</b> having a translucent, substantially non-opaque appearance is an indication that crystallinity has been retarded during the printing operation. Similarly, the transformation from the translucent, substantially non-opaque appearance to an opaque appearance is an indication that the part material of 3D part <b>30</b> has undergone significant crystallization in the post-printing crystallization step. After the post-printing crystallization step is completed, the resulting 3D part <b>30</b> may then be cooled down to room temperature and optionally undergo one or more post-printing processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The post-printing crystallization step may be performed in chamber <b>12</b> of system <b>10</b>, or alternatively in a separate annealing oven. A separate annealing oven may be preferred in many situations, such as when support structure <b>32</b> needs to be removed prior to the post-printing annealing step and/or when system <b>10</b> needs to be used for subsequent printing operations. For example, a printing farm of multiple systems <b>10</b> may operate in coordination with one or more separate annealing ovens to maximize the duty cycles of the systems <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">The above-discussed control of the crystallization kinetics of the part material requires the part material to have a blend of one or more semi-crystalline polymers and one or more secondary materials, preferably amorphous polymer(s), that retard crystallization of the semi-crystalline polymer(s) and that are at least partially miscible (or more preferably, substantially miscible) with the semi-crystalline polymer(s).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">In the embodiments including the above-discussed additional additives, the polymer blend preferably constitutes the remainder of the part material. As such, the polymer blend may constitute from about 55% to 100% by weight of the part material, and more preferably from about 75% to 100% by weight. In some embodiments, the polymer blend constitutes from about 90% to 100% by weight of the part material, more preferably from about 95% to 100% by weight. In further embodiments, the part material consists essentially of the polymer blend, and optionally, one or more colorants and/or anti-oxidants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Preferably, the polymer blend is also substantially homogenous, allowing each portion of the part material used in an additive manufacturing system to consistently exhibit the same thermal and physical properties. For example, with system <b>10</b> having print head <b>18</b>, the flow rate of the molten part material (i.e., melt <b>70</b>) from nozzle <b>48</b> is controlled by the rate at which filament <b>52</b> enters liquefier tube <b>56</b>, and the melting rate of filament <b>52</b> within heating zone <b>68</b>. System <b>10</b> may operate with preset instructions for extruding melt <b>70</b> at desired flow rates based on tool path geometries. These preset instructions are preferably based on the thermal properties of the part material, namely the melting rate and viscosity of the part material, as well as the crystallization kinetics of the part material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">As such, if the polymer blend were otherwise non-homogenous, the part material would not be uniform. This could cause successive segments of filament <b>52</b> to melt at different rates, affecting the height of meniscus <b>74</b>. This accordingly can change the extrusion rate of melt <b>70</b> from the preset instructions, which can impair part quality in 3D part <b>30</b>. Additionally, a non-homogenous blend may result in imbalances in the crystallization kinetics of the part material, which could reduce the above-discussed benefits of controlling the crystallization kinetics. Accordingly, filament <b>52</b> is preferably manufactured from a part material having a substantially homogenous polymer blend of the semi-crystalline polymer(s) and the secondary material(s) (e.g., amorphous polymer(s)). In embodiments that include one or more additives, the additive(s) are preferably dispersed in the polymer blend in a substantially uniform manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">As mentioned above, the above-discussed method may also be utilized with electrophotography-based additive manufacturing systems and selective laser sintering systems. With respect to electrophotography-based additive manufacturing systems, the part material may be provided in powder form for use in an electrophotography-based additive manufacturing system, such as those disclosed in Hanson et al., U.S. Publication Nos. 2013/0077996 and 2013/0077997, and Comb et al., U.S. Publication Nos. 2013/0186549 and 2013/0186558, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference to the extent that they do not conflict with the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">As discussed in these references, the electrophotography-based additive manufacturing systems preferably operate with layer transfusion assemblies that transfuse each successively-developed layer based on interlayer polymer entanglement (i.e., reptation). As such, the above-discussed method for controlling the crystallization kinetics of the part material for the extrusion-based additive manufacturing systems may also be used in the same manner with the electrophotography-based additive manufacturing systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">In comparison, however, selective laser sintering systems may print 3D parts from nylon materials in a manner in which a nylon material is held in a gelatinous, undercooled amorphous state between the melting temperature and the hot crystallization temperature of the nylon material. However, nylon materials typically have small temperature windows between their melting temperatures and the hot crystallization temperatures, rendering it difficult to hold the printed layers in this amorphous state after being melted with a laser beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">However, as discussed above, it has been found that the substantially miscible blends for the part material of the present disclosure decrease the hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot </sub>of the part material from that of the semi-crystalline polymer(s). Conversely, the melting temperature T<sub>m </sub>of the part material remains substantially unchanged. As such, the substantially miscible blend for the part material widens the operating window, referred to as operating window <b>88</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in which the printed layers may be held in the gelatinous, undercooled amorphous state to prevent warping and distortions. In this case, the powder materials may be selectively melted with the laser beam and held within this operating window <b>88</b> until the printing operation is completed. The whole 3D part <b>30</b> may then be cooled down in a conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">In embodiments involving the above-discussed technique used in a selective laser sintering system (e.g., systems disclosed in Deckard, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,863,538 and 5,132,143), the part material may be provided in powder form for use in other powder-based additive manufacturing systems. In some alternative embodiments, such as with some polyamide materials (e.g., glass-filled PA6/10 materials), this technique may also be utilized in extrusion-based and/or electrophotography-based additive manufacturing systems. This can accordingly produce 3D parts having high heat deflection temperatures, which can be beneficial for use with soluble support materials.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">The results in Table 1 show the relative changes in the glass transition temperature T<sub>g</sub>, cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold</sub>, melting temperature T<sub>m</sub>, and hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot </sub>for the different PEEK/PEI ratios. For example, the glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>increases substantially with the increased concentration of PEI. Furthermore, the cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>and the hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot </sub>converged closer together with the increased concentration of PEI, but the melting temperature T<sub>m </sub>remained relatively the same (e.g., 4 degree drop between Examples 1 and 3, versus a 22 degree drop for the hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">Accordingly, the differences between the glass transition temperatures T<sub>g </sub>and the cold crystallization temperatures T<sub>c,cold </sub>for Examples 1-3 provide suitable annealing windows (e.g., annealing window <b>84</b>) for printing 3D parts with extrusion-based and/or electrophotography-based additive manufacturing systems. Similarly, the differences between the melting temperatures T<sub>m </sub>and the hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot </sub>for Examples 1-3 provide suitable operating windows (e.g., operating window <b>88</b>) for printing 3D parts with selective laser sintering systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The DSC testing also involved reheating the part materials after the cooling step to simulate a post-printing crystallization step. During this reheating step, the part materials of Examples 2 and 3 each exhibited two different glass transition temperatures T<sub>g</sub>. The part material of Example 2 had a first glass transition temperature of 164° C. and a second glass transition temperature of 209° C. The part material of Example 2 had a first glass transition temperature of 167° C. and a second glass transition temperature of 210° C.

The filament was then fed from the consumable assembly to print head liquefier assembly of the system, melted, and extruded from print head nozzle to print 3D parts in a heated chamber maintained at 160° C. (i.e., below its glass transition temperatures T<sub>g</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates pellets and the printed 3D parts from the part material of Example 5. The printed 3D part and associated pellets exhibited a golden, translucent appearance due to the low levels of crystallinity. A corresponding 3D part and portions of the pellets were also reheated to about 200° C. (i.e., a post-printing crystallization process) for a sufficient duration to re-crystallize the PEEK in the part material. As shown, the annealed 3D part and pellets each exhibited an opaque appearance, which was more tan/whitish in color than the golden color of the non-re-crystallized part/pellets.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">III. Example 6</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Part materials of Example 6 were prepared as polyamide blends, where the semi-crystalline polyamide was a graft PA12 polyamide, having an impact modifier grafted to the PA12 backbone, commercially available under the tradename GRILAMID L16 from EMS-Chemie, Inc., Sumter, SC (business unit of EMS-Grivory), and the amorphous polyamide was a PA12 polyamide commercially available under the tradename GRILAMID TR90 from EMS-Chemie, Inc., Sumter, SC (business unit of EMS-Grivory).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">For each part material of Example 6, the semi-crystalline polyamide concentration in the part material ranged from 27.2%-28.2% by weight, and the amorphous polyamide concentration in the part material ranged from 65.2%-66.2% by weight, for a blend ratio of about 70:30 of the amorphous polyamide to semi-crystalline polyamide. The part material also included an impact modifier having a concentration in the part material ranging from 4.5%-5.5% by weight, and an anti-oxidant having a concentration in the part material ranging from 0.03%-0.13% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Each part material of Example 6 was analyzed using DSC to provide an average glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>of 55° C., an average cold crystallization temperature T<sub>c,cold </sub>of 130° C., an average melting temperature T<sub>n</sub>, of 178° C., and an average hot crystallization temperature T<sub>c,hot </sub>of 148° C. Each part material was also compounded into cylindrical filaments having an average diameter of about 0.07 inches and wound onto spools of consumable assemblies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">For each run, the consumable assembly was loaded to an extrusion-based additive manufacturing system commercially available from Stratasys, Inc., Eden Prairie, Minn. under the trademarks “FDM” and “FORTUS 400mc”. The liquefier temperature was set to 355° C. and the heated chamber temperature was set to 80° C., 100° C., or 120° C., depending on the 3D part geometry being printed. Each 3D part exhibited good dimensional stability and low levels of crystallinity.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">IV. Examples 7 and 8</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">A part materials of Example 7 was prepared as an impact-modified PET blend, where the semi-crystalline PET was a polyethylene terephthalate copolymer commercially available under the tradename “SKYPET BR” from SK Chemicals, South Korea, and the amorphous PET was a glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate commercially available under the tradename “SKYGREEN 52008” from SK Chemicals, South Korea. The part material included 76% by weight of the semi-crystalline PET, 19% by weight of the amorphous PET, and 5% by weight of an impact modifier commercially available under the tradename “ELVALOY PTW” from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Del.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">The part material of Example 7 was compounded into cylindrical filaments having an average diameter of about 0.07 inches and wound onto spools of consumable assemblies. For each run, the consumable assembly was loaded to an extrusion-based additive manufacturing system commercially available from Stratasys, Inc., Eden Prairie, Minn. under the trademarks “FDM” and “FORTUS 400mc”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">During the printing operations, the filament was melted and extruded from a print head at a temperature of 320° C. into a heated build chamber, where the temperature of the build chamber was held at 90° C., 100° C., 110° C., and 120° C. for four different runs. The part material had a glass transition temperature of about 78° C. As such, these different temperatures tested how the different annealing windows affected the level of crystallinity in the resulting 3D part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">After being printed, each of the four 3D parts was slowly heated and the resulting modulus was measured, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the part material annealed at 90° C. maintained a mostly-amorphous mechanical behavior, while the part material annealed at 120° C. maintained a mostly-semi-crystalline mechanical behavior. The part materials annealed at 100° C. and 110° C. fell between these two end points.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">As can be seen, over a heated chamber temperature range of about 30 degrees Celsius, the dynamic mechanical behavior of the tested part materials changed significantly from almost mostly amorphous to almost mostly crystalline. This is further illustrated by the tan-delta peak onset in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, where the peak onset occurred later as the temperature in the heated chamber increased, which corresponded to a more crystalline 3D part. Accordingly, these results confirm that the extent of crystallization in the resulting 3D part for the part materials can be controlled by a properly-selected annealing window.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">The part material of Example 8 included 70% by weight of the PET blend of Example 7 and 30% by weight of a glass-based filler. The part material of Example 8 was also printed as discussed above for the part materials of Example 6, where the heated chamber was held at only 80° C. to maintain a mostly-amorphous mechanical behavior. A portion of the 3D part samples were then reheated to about 135° C. (i.e., a post-printing crystallization process) for a sufficient duration to re-crystallize the semi-crystalline PET in the part material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">After being printed, each 3D part sample was then slowly heated and the resulting modulus was measured, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which also compares the results of the part material for Example 7 printed in the 120° C. heated chamber. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the post-printing crystallization process significantly increased the crystallinity of the part material compared to the initial samples.</div>
