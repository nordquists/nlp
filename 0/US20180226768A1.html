<li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0005">The invention relates generally to laser systems, and more particularly to improved devices, systems, and fabrication methods for vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), including those emitting wavelengths in the visible red spectrum (e.g., in some embodiments, in a range of about 600-700 nm), those having hybrid mirrors and those emitting near-infrared light (e.g., in some embodiments, about 720 nm).</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0006">Multi-mode 850-nm VCSELs based upon the AlGaAs materials system have been the standard optical source for application to glass optical-fiber-based data communication links. However, the implementation of VCSELs for other applications frequently requires different wavelengths and performance attributes than those for which the 850-nm multi-mode VCSELs have been optimized.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0007">As a first example, a very important optically based non-invasive medical-sensor application is oximetry. Pulse oximetry is well-established, and tissue or regional oximetry is an emerging application. Both of these versions of oximetry take advantage of the varying absorption coefficient as a function of wavelength for different types of hemoglobins, (i.e., oxyhemoglobin, reduced hemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, or methemoglobin). The sensors rely on the absorption of wavelengths in the regime from about 660 nm to 1000 nm, and as the number of hemoglobin types that are to be analyzed increases, the number of different wavelengths that are required also increases. These applications benefit from the narrow spectral linewidth and the slow spectral shift with temperature of the VCSEL, while wireless implementations benefit from the reduced power consumption of VCSELs as compared to light emitting diodes (LEDs). However, to be commercially viable, VCSEL wavelengths spanning the range from red to near-infrared are required, and in particular, red wavelengths are an important aspect of these systems.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0008">A second example application is plastic optical-fiber links based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) fiber materials that have been implemented for sensor and data links in automobiles, and are currently being considered for use in home networks. In some embodiments, PMMA-based fiber has a primary-absorption minimum in the green-wavelength region, and a secondary absorption minimum in the red-wavelength region. Absorption at 850 nm is too high to be practical for typical plastic fiber links having lengths of more than just a few meters.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0052]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0050" num="0052">Although the following detailed description contains many specifics for the purpose of illustration, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the following preferred embodiments of the invention are set forth without any loss of generality to, and without imposing limitations upon the claimed invention. Further, in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0053]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0051" num="0053">The leading digit(s) of reference numbers appearing in the Figures generally corresponds to the Figure number in which that component is first introduced, such that the same reference number is used throughout to refer to an identical component that appears in multiple figures. Signals and connections may be referred to by the same reference number or label, and the actual meaning will be clear from its use in the context of the description.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0054]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0052" num="0054">In some embodiments, the present invention provides VCSELs that emit high-quality (e.g., in some embodiments, single-mode) laser light useful for oximetry and/or plastic optical-fiber applications. While the potential for high-speed data rates and the packaging simplicity of VCSELs makes them ideal for this application, wavelengths in the range of about 650 nm to about 680 nm that are made available by the present invention are preferred in some plastic optical-fiber embodiments to provide low-loss links. Furthermore, because these fiber links are intended for the consumer market, a low-cost non-hermetic package made available by the present invention is also desirable.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0055]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0053" num="0055">Additional VCSEL applications, including printing or bar-code scanning, benefit from single-spatial-mode devices. Resolution achievable for print is improved by the use of shorter laser wavelengths, and a beam visible to the eye is much preferred for bar-code scanners.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0056]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0054" num="0056">Red VCSELs based upon the AlGaAs/AlGaInP materials system were demonstrated in the early 1990's but have taken significantly longer to commercialize. This commercialization delay can in part be explained by materials issues, such as the limited confinement potentials for quantum-well structures, the small available contrast in refractive index available in the AlGaAs mirrors due to the need to use compositions that are not absorbing at 650 nm to 700 nm, and the higher thermal resistance in the mirrors that results from the more limited composition range available for the mirrors.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0057]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0055" num="0057">Another issue limiting commercialization is the requirement of many non-data communication applications for alternative packaging options. While packaging flexibility is a strength of VCSEL technology, it often presents additional challenges. Traditionally, the 850-nm data-communication VCSEL products are packaged in a hermetic TO-style package. On the other hand, in some embodiments, a disposable medical sensor benefits from the low cost of a plastic surface-mount package that incorporates an organic encapsulant, which may raise questions of humidity resistance and reliability. Similarly, plastic-optical-fiber applications will likely benefit from low-cost non-hermetic packaging. These packaging techniques are used in some embodiments of the present invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0058]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0056" num="0058">In the development of single-mode VCSEL devices, short-cavity VCSELs were fabricated in order to eliminate longitudinal modes. However, while the short cavity did eliminate the problem of undesirable longitudinal modes, as is often the case in engineering, one or more other problems arose to take its place. One problem is known as thermal lensing and is thought to be a consequence of charge carriers and photons sharing a common path while traversing the VCSEL device distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirrors. Thermal lensing associated with heating of certain zones of the DBRs causes a variable refractive index distribution inside the VCSEL optical cavity and, although this effect often makes VCSEL devices more single mode, causes a degradation of the modulation characteristics (i.e., because the device is heating itself, the heating can cause the device to take an increased time to turn on or turn off).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0059]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0057" num="0059">In order to realize single-transverse-mode VCSEL operation, conventional VCSELs use a single oxide-aperture to both block the unwanted transverse modes and confine the electrical charge carriers. The size of the oxide aperture determines whether the VCSEL will exhibit multiple-mode or single-mode operation, with oxide-aperture diameters of less than about 5 microns typically being required to provide single-mode VCSEL operation.

In some embodiments, each of the mirrors is formed using a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirror structure that includes alternating layers of material, wherein each layer has a different index of refraction than that of its two adjacent neighbor layers. Typically a first index of refraction is used for each of the even-numbered layers and a second index of refraction, different than the first, is used for each of the odd-numbered layers. The thickness of each layer is, e.g., ¼ wavelength of the optical signal to be reflected (the thickness of a pair of layers (i.e., the combined thickness of an even-numbered layer and an odd-numbered layer) in each mirror is often called a period) such that the size of the period is determined by the desired wavelength of the VCSEL device <b>101</b> (i.e., in some embodiments, the free-space wavelength of the signal wavelength is between about 640 nm to about 700 nm).

In other embodiments, the entire substrate is be removed and either the wafer can be attached to a submount on the front side, and then the GaAs substrate etched off the back, or the device can be mounted to a temporary carrier on the front, the substrate etched away and then attached to a transparent submount, and then the front side temporary carrier removed.

<li> <para-num num="[0111]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0109" num="0111">One important question of interest in the production of devices may be the uniformity across a wafer. The wavelength of a VCSEL is approximately proportional to thickness of the layers, so a 1% variation of thickness can result in approximately a 7 nm variation in wavelength. In addition, the oxidation diameter can also vary across a wafer due to small differences in layer thickness, doping, or composition. Both of these effects can impact performance of a VCSEL. For instance, the temperature characteristics of a VCSEL depend upon the offset between the gain peak and the Fabry-Perot resonance. Since the gain peak wavelength is less sensitive to thickness and therefore nearly constant across the wafer, while the Fabry-Perot resonance may have a range of 5-10 nm, this offset varies across the wafer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0112]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0110" num="0112">Our testing allowed us to gather statistics on uniformity. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the results of probing approximately 60,000 VCSELs on a 4″ wafer.

The shaded region in the figure corresponds to the wavelength range constituting the majority of the devices on the wafer, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(<i>a</i>)</figref>. Threshold currents are less than 0.5 mA for the smallest devices and around 2.5 to 3 mA for the 15 μm apertures at 40° C. While the largest diameter devices appear to be quite a bit less uniform than the smallest diameter devices, on a percentage basis, the threshold current range of the 15 μm device is similar to that of the 7 and 10 μm devices. As one might expect, the threshold current rises as the emission wavelength increases, due to a larger offset between the gain peak and the Fabry-Perot cavity, but devices are still lasing at 709 nm, where the offset is approximately 40 nm. Peak output power at 40° C. versus wavelength for several aperture sizes is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(<i>c</i>)</figref>.

A large variation in wavelength across a single wafer was achieved by not rotating the wafer during growth. The gain peak wavelength was fairly constant at around 678 nm, while the Fabry-Perot resonance varied from 680 up to nearly 720 nm. The longest wavelengths, therefore, corresponded to a very large gain peak-Fabry Perot resonance offset, as large as 40 nm. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows the results from two devices at the higher end of the wavelength range. The devices lased continuous wave (CW) at room temperature. A 716 nm device (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(<i>a</i>)</figref>) had a threshold current of 7 mA and a peak output power of nearly 3.5 mW, while a 718.8 nm device had a threshold current of 7 mA and a peak output power of over 2 mW. The threshold current is high due to the large gain peak-resonance offset, so it is expected that even better performance could be achieved if the devices were optimally designed for this wavelength. Thus, good VCSEL performance spanning the entire wavelength range from 650 to 850 nm can be achieved using either an AlGaAs materials system, or AlGaInP materials for the active region.</div>

We have used 1 μsec pulse width for the evaluation, although shorter pulse widths can provide even higher peak power. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(<i>a</i>)</figref> illustrates the effect of the duty cycle on improved peak output power.

However, this leads to a question: if device lifetime is reduced by higher current drives, can one operate a device in pulsed mode at these higher current ranges without impacting the device lifetime? Furthermore, are there any transient effects, such as stress created by repeated temperature cycling resulting from the current cycling, that might actually accelerate the degradation of the devices? For instance, the dependence of VCSEL lifetime upon current density is commonly found to be reduced proportionally to the square of the current density, i.e., a 2× increase in current density would reduce device lifetime by a factor of 4. An increase of drive current from 15 mA to 60 mA might be expected to reduce the lifetime by a factor of 16.</div>
