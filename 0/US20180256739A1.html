<div class="abstract">An immunogenic composition having 13 distinct polysaccharide-protein conjugates and optionally, an aluminum-based adjuvant, is described. Each conjugate contains a capsular polysaccharide prepared from a different serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) conjugated to a carrier protein. The immunogenic composition, formulated as a vaccine, increases coverage against pneumococcal disease in infants and young children globally, and provides coverage for serotypes 6A and 19A that is not dependent on the limitations of serogroup cross-protection. Methods for making an immunogenic conjugate comprising Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19A polysaccharide are also provided in which the serotype 19A polysaccharide is co-lyophilized with a carrier protein and conjugation is carried out in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) via a reductive amination mechanism.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003"> <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae </i>is a leading cause of meningitis, pneumonia, and severe invasive disease in infants and young children throughout the world. The multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines have been licensed for many years and have proved valuable in preventing pneumococcal disease in elderly adults and high-risk patients. However, infants and young children respond poorly to most pneumococcal polysaccharides. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC, Prevnar®) was the first of its kind demonstrated to be highly immunogenic and effective against invasive disease and otitis media in infants and young children. This vaccine is now approved in many countries around the world. Prevnar contains the capsular polysaccharides from serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F, each conjugated to a carrier protein designated CRM<sub>197</sub>. Prevnar covers approximately 80-90%, 60-80%, and 40-80% of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the US, Europe, and other regions of the world, respectively [1,2]. Surveillance data gathered in the years following Prevnar's introduction has clearly demonstrated a reduction of invasive pneumococcal disease in US infants as expected (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) [3, 4].</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Surveillance of IPD conducted in US infants prior to the introduction of Prevnar demonstrated that a significant portion of disease due to serogroups 6 and 19 was due to the 6A (approximately one-third) and 19A (approximately one-fourth) serotypes [5,6]. Pneumococcal invasive disease surveillance conducted in the US after licensure, of Prevnar suggests that a large burden of disease is still attributable to serotypes 6A and 19A (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) [3]. Moreover, these two serotypes account for more cases of invasive disease than serotypes 1, 3, 5, and 7F combined (8.2 vs. 3.3 cases/100,000 children 2 years and under). In addition, serotypes 6A and 19A are associated with high rates of antibiotic resistance (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) [7,8,9]. While it is possible that serogroup cross-protection will result in a decline of serotype 6A and 19A disease as more children are immunized, there is evidence to suggest that there will be a limit to the decline, and a significant burden of disease due to these serotypes will remain (see below).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Given the relative burden and importance of invasive pneumococcal disease due to serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A, adding these serotypes to the Prevnar formulation would increase coverage for invasive disease to &gt;90% in the US and Europe, and as high as 70%-80% in Asia and Latin America. This vaccine would significantly expand coverage beyond that of Prevnar, and provide coverage for 6A and 19A that is not dependent on the limitations of serogroup cross-protection.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">Inclusion of Prevnar Serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">Data from IPD surveillance between 1995-1998 estimated that the seven serotypes in Prevnar were responsible for around 82% of IPD in children &lt;2 years of age [5]. In Northern California, the site of the efficacy trial, the Prevnar serotypes accounted for 90% of all cases of IPD in infants and young children [10]. Since introduction of the Prevnar vaccine in 2000, there has been a significant decrease in the overall IPD rates due to a decrease in disease due to the vaccine serotypes [3,4]. Therefore, there is no justification at this time to remove any of the Prevnar serotypes from the next generation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines but rather to add serotypes to obtain wider coverage.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0008">Inclusion of Serotypes 1, 3, 5 and 7F</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">In the US, the rate of IPD caused by serotype 1 in children under the age of 5 years is &lt;2%, about the same as for each of types 3 and 7F [1,6]. Serotypes 1 and 5 account for higher rates of IPD in US populations at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease. Specifically, serotype 1 causes 3.5% of IPD in Alaskan native children &lt;2 years of age, and 18% in children 2-4 years of age [11]. Both serotype 1 and serotype 5 significantly cause disease in other parts of the world and in indigenous populations in developed countries [12, 13, 14].</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">Serotype 1 may also be associated with more severe disease as compared with other pneumococcal serotypes [15]. This observation is based on the difference in rates of case identification between the US and Europe, and the associated difference in medical practice. Overall, the incidence of IPD is lower in Europe than in the US. However, the percent of IPD caused by serotype 1 in Europe is disproportionately higher than in the US (6-7%, vs. 1-2%, respectively). In Europe, blood cultures are obtained predominantly from hospitalized children. In the US, it is routine medical practice to obtain blood cultures in an outpatient setting from children presenting with fever ≥39° C. and elevated white blood cell counts. Given the difference in medical practice, it is postulated that the lower percent of disease caused by serotype 1 in the US may be diluted by higher rates of other serotypes causing milder disease, while the higher percent in Europe reflects more serious disease. In addition, seroepidemiology studies of children with complicated pneumonia demonstrate that serotype 1 is disproportionately represented [16, 17, 18]. This suggests that inclusion of serotype 1 may reduce the amount of severe pneumococcal disease, as well as, contribute to a total reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">The addition of serotypes 3 and 7F will increase coverage against IPD in most areas of the world by approximately 3%-7%, and in Asia by around 9%. Thus, an 11-valent vaccine would cover 50% in Asia and around 80% of IPD in all other regions [1,2]. These serotypes are also important with respect to otitis media coverage [19]. In a multinational study of pneumococcal serotypes causing otitis media, Hausdorff et al found serotype 3 to be the 8th most common middle ear fluid isolate overall [20]. Serotype 3 accounted for up to 8.7% of pneumococcal serotypes associated with otitis media. Thus, the importance of types 3 and 7F in otitis media, as well as in IPD, warrants their inclusion in a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">However, attempts to produce a multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that exhibits significant immunogenicity with respect to serotype 3 polysaccharides have been unsuccessful. For example, in a study of the immunogenicity and safety of an 11-valent pneumococcal protein D conjugate vaccine (11-Pn-PD), no priming effect was observed for serotype 3 in infants who had received three doses of the vaccine followed by a booster dose of either the same vaccine or a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Nurkka et al. (2004) <i>Ped. Inf. Dis. J., </i>23:1008-1014). In another study, opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) results from infants who had received doses of 11-Pn-PD failed to show antibody responses for serotype 3 at levels comparable to other tested serotypes (Gatchalian et al., 17<sup>th </sup>Annual Meeting of the Eur. Soc. Paed. Inf. Dis. (ESPID), Poster No. 4, P1A Poster Session 1, Istanbul Turkey, Mar. 27, 2001). In yet another study, which assessed the efficacy of an 11-Pn-PD in the prevention of acute otitis media, the vaccine did not provide protection against episodes caused by serotype 3 (Prymula et al. (2006) Lancet, 367:740-748). Accordingly, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine comprising capsular polysaccharides from serotype 3 and capable of eliciting an immunogenic response to serotype 3 polysaccharides provides a significant improvement over the existing state of the art.</div>

In addition, these serotypes are commonly associated with antibiotic resistance (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and play an important role in otitis media [6, 19, 20]. The ability of the current Prevnar vaccine to protect against disease due to 6A and 19A is not clear. The rationale for inclusion of 6A and 19A components in a 13vPnC vaccine is discussed below.</div>

Immunogenicity data generated at the time of formulation of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine demonstrated that a 6B monovalent vaccine induced antibody to both the 6A and 6B capsules. The data from several trials assessing IgG and opsonophagocyic assay (OPA) responses in a variety of populations with free polysaccharide and with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines suggested that IgG responses to 6A are induced by 6B B antigens, but the responses are generally lower, and the OPA activity with 6A organisms is different than with 6B organisms [22, 23, 24, 25]. In addition, subjects responding with high 6B antibody may have little or no activity against 6A.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0029]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0031" num="0029">In contrast to the chemical composition of the 6A and 6B capsular polysaccharides where there exists a high degree of similarity, the 19A and 19F capsules are quite different due to the presence of two additional side chains in the 19A polysaccharide. Not surprisingly, immune responses measured in human volunteers immunized with 19F polysaccharide vaccine showed that responses to 19F were induced in 80% of subjects, but only 20% of subjects had a response to 19A [26]. Low levels of cross-reactive IgG and OPA responses to serotype 19A after immunization with 19F polysaccharide have also been documented in trials with conjugate vaccines as well [24, 26].</div>

These studies are consistent with the findings of others, and demonstrate induction of cross-reactive functional antibody to 6A polysaccharide after immunization with 6B polysaccharide, although at a lower level, and very little functional antibody to 19A after immunization with 19F.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0031]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0033" num="0031">Animal models have been used to evaluate the potential for cross-protection with polysaccharide immunization. In an otitis media model developed by Giebink et al., chinchillas were immunized with a tetravalent polysaccharide outer membrane protein (OMP) conjugate vaccine (containing 6B, 14, 19F, 23F saccharides) or placebo [27]. In this trial there appeared to be some cross-protection for 6A; however this did not reach statistical significance and the level of protection was lower than with 6B against otitis media. In this same model there was 100% protection against 19F otitis media, but only 17% protection against 19A otitis media.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0032]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0034" num="0032">Saeland et al. used sera from infants immunized with an 8-valent pneumococcal tetanus conjugate vaccine (containing 6B and 19F) to passively immunize mice prior to an intranasal challenge with 6A organisms, in a lung infection model [28]. Of the 59 serum samples, 53% protected mice against bacteremia with 6B and 37% protected against 6A. Mice passively immunized with sera from infants immunized with four doses of an 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (containing 19F conjugated to tetanus toxoid) were given an intranasal challenge with 19A organisms in the same model [29]. Of 100 mice passively immunized and then challenged, 60 mice had no 19A organisms detected in lung tissue, whereas organisms were identified in all mice given saline placebo. However, passive immunization did not protect against challenge with 19F organisms in this model; therefore, the relevance of the model for serogroup 19 is questionable. In general these models provide evidence of some biological impact of 6B immunization on 6A organisms although the effect on the heterologous serotype was not as great as that observed with the homologous serotype. The impact of 19F immunization on 19A organisms is not well understood from these models.</div>

The numbers of invasive disease cases are too small to allow any conclusions to be drawn for serotypes 6A and 19A. However, the Finnish otitis media trial generated a large number of pneumococcal isolates [32].

After obtaining consent, medical and immunization history (subjects were considered immunized if they had received at least one dose of Prevnar) was obtained from parents and medical providers for cases and controls. The preliminary results were presented at the 2003 ICAAC meeting and a summary of the findings for 6B, 19F, 19A and 6A disease is presented in Table 2. These data indicate that Prevnar is able to prevent disease due to 6A, although at a level that may be somewhat lower than serotype 6B disease.

Furthermore, it appears the protection against 19A is limited. Therefore, a 13vPnC vaccine containing serotypes 6A and 19A provides coverage that is not dependent on the limitations of serogroup cross-protection by serotypes 6B and 19F.</div>

In order to improve the conjugation efficiency and to control the stability of the inherently labile serotype 19A polysaccharide, a co-lyophilization and conjugation process in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used in the conjugation of the serotype 19A polysaccharide to the carrier protein CRM<sub>197</sub>. This process provides improved conjugate characteristics in terms of molecular size and the percentage of free saccharide for serotype 19A as compared to the use of conjugation processes involving discrete lyophilization of polysaccharides and carrier proteins in DMSO or processes involving aqueous co-lyophilization of polysaccharides and carrier proteins without DMSO.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0071]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0073" num="0071">As described in more detail in Example 17 below, conjugation of the serotype 19A polysaccharide to the carrier protein, CRM<sub>197</sub>, is a two reaction-step process. The first step involves periodate oxidation (activation) to generate reactive aldehyde groups on the polysaccharide. The activated polysaccharide is then purified by ultrafiltration to remove saccharide fragments and small molecule reaction by-products. The activated polysaccharide and CRM<sub>197 </sub>are then combined and co-lyophilized with sucrose as a cryoprotectant. The conjugation step is performed in DMSO via a reductive amination mechanism in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride. Unreacted aldehyde groups are reduced (capped) by the addition of sodium borohydride. The conjugate is then purified to remove unreacted CRM<sub>197 </sub>and saccharide fragments (e.g., by diafiltration versus phosphate buffer followed by buffered saline), giving a final batch concentrate of the glycoconjugate in buffered saline.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0072]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0074" num="0072">Although a preferred carrier protein within the process described above is the mutated diphtheria toxin CRM<sub>197</sub>, other carrier proteins may be used for conjugation with the serotype 19A polysaccharide within the present methods. Carrier proteins are chosen to increase the immunogenicity of the bound serotype 19A polysaccharide and/or to elicit antibodies against the carrier protein which are diagnostically, analytically and/or therapeutically beneficial. Covalent linking of an antigenic molecule (e.g., a polysaccharide) to a carrier confers enhanced immunogenicity and T-cell dependence (Pozsgay et al. (1999) PNAS, 96:5194-97; Lee et al. (1976) J. Immunol., 116:1711-18; Dintzis et al. (1976) PNAS, 73:3671-75). As described herein, useful carrier proteins include inactivated bacterial toxins such as tetanus toxoid, pertussis toxoid, cholera toxoid (e.g., as described in International Patent Application WO2004/083251), <i>E. coli </i>LT, <i>E. coli </i>ST, and exotoxin A from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.

Two additional generations of seed stocks were produced. The first additional generation was made from an F3 vial, and the subsequent generation was made from a vial of the first additional generation. Seed vials were stored frozen (&lt;−70° C.) with synthetic glycerol as a cryopreservative. In addition to frozen vials, lyophilized vials were prepared for the F4 generation. For cell bank preparation, all cultures were grown in a soy-based medium.

The bottles were incubated at 36° C.±2° C. without agitation until growth requirements were met. A seed bottle was used to inoculate a seed fermentor containing soy-based medium and a 10 mM sterile NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>solution. A pH of about 7.0 was maintained with 3N NaOH. After the target optical density was reached, the seed fermentor was used to inoculate the production fermentor containing soy-based medium with a 10 mM NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>concentration. The pH was maintained with 3N NaOH. The fermentation was terminated after cessation of growth or when the working volume of the fermentor was reached. An appropriate amount of sterile 12% sodium deoxycholate was added to the culture to obtain a 0.12% concentration in the broth, to lyse the bacterial cells and release cell-associated polysaccharide. After lysing, the fermentor contents were held, with agitation, for a time interval between 8 and 24 hours at a temperature between 7° C. and 13° C. to assure that complete cellular lysis and polysaccharide release had occurred. Agitation during this hold period prevented lysate sediment from settling on the fermentor walls and pH probe, thereby allowing the pH probe integrity to be maintained. Next, the pH of the lysed culture broth was adjusted to approximately pH 4.5 with 50% acetic acid. After a hold time without agitation, for a time interval between 12 and 24 hours at a temperature between 15° C. and 25° C., a significant portion of the previously soluble proteins dropped out of solution as a solid precipitate with little loss or degradation of the polysaccharide, which remained in solution. The solution with the precipitate was then clarified by continuous flow centrifugation followed by depth filtration and 0.45 μm microfiltration.</div>

Studies #HT01-0021 and #HT01-0036 were designed to independently examine the effect of chemical conjugation of capsular polysaccharides (PSs) from <i>S. pneumoniae </i>to CRM<sub>197 </sub>and the effect of aluminum phosphate (AlPO<sub>4</sub>) adjuvant on the immune response to the 13vPnC vaccine in rabbits. These effects were characterized by antigen-specific ELISA for serum IgG concentrations and for antibody function by opsonophagocytic assay (OPA).</div>

The pneumococcal serotypes represented in the 13vPnC vaccine include types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F. Secondary objectives included an evaluation of the kinetics and duration of the antibody response. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized intramuscularly at week 0 and week 2 with the planned human clinical dose of each polysaccharide (2 μg of each PS, except 4 μg of 6B) formulated with or without AlPO<sub>4 </sub>(100 μg/dose).

A ratio of the IgG GMTs was used to compare responses from week 4 to week 0. These data demonstrate that the inclusion of AlPO<sub>4 </sub>in the 13vPnC formulation elicited higher levels of IgG antibody in comparison to the same vaccine without adjuvant. Although the antibody responses were greater when AlPO<sub>4 </sub>was included in the formulation, these increases were not statistically significant.</div>

When comparing vaccine formulations with or without adjuvant, higher OPA GMTs were observed in the 13vPnC+AlPO<sub>4 </sub>vaccine treatment group. OPA titers were detected in week 4 serum pools to all vaccine serotypes in both groups. For the majority of the serotypes, OPA titers measured at week 4 were at least 4-fold higher than those at week 0 (baseline).</div>

New Zealand White rabbits were immunized intramuscularly at week 0 and week 2 with a dose of 2.2 μg of each PS (except 4.4 μg of 6B). Animals received one of three vaccine preparations: (a) 13vPnC (PS directly conjugated to CRM<sub>197</sub>), (b) 13vPnPS, (free PS) or (c) 13vPnPS+CRM<sub>197 </sub>(free PS mixed with CRM<sub>197</sub>).

Additional analyses show the ratio of GMT values at week 4 to week 0. The data indicate that the conjugate vaccine preparation elicited greater serum IgG titers than free PS or free PS+CRM<sub>197 </sub>vaccine. With the exception of <i>S. pneumoniae </i>type 14, the 13vPnC vaccine was able to induce functional antibodies to the representative strains of <i>S. pneumoniae </i>in an OPA (Table 6). After two immunizations with either the 13vPnPS or 13vPnPS+CRM<sub>197 </sub>vaccine, neither could induce OPA titers ≥8-fold at week 4 relative to week 0 for 10 out of the 13 serotypes measured (Table 6).</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0245]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0253" num="0245">The following example describes a process for making an immunogenic conjugate comprising <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae </i>serotype 19A polysaccharide covalently linked to a carrier protein. In general, following periodate oxidation (activation) to generate reactive aldehyde groups on the polysaccharide, the serotype 19A polysaccharide was co-lyophilized with the carrier protein and conjugation was carried out in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) via a reductive amination mechanism in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride. As opposed to conjugation processes involving discrete lyophilization of polysaccharides and carrier proteins in DMSO, or processes involving aqueous co-lyophilization of polysaccharides and carrier proteins without DMSO, the following process improvement provided improved conjugation efficiency and control over the stability of serotype 19A polysaccharides as measured by molecular size and the percentage of free saccharide. Although this process is described for the serotype 19A polysaccharide, this process may also be used for serotypes that are structurally similar to serotype 19A, such as 6A, 6B, and 19F which also contain phosphodiester linkages between their repeat units.</div>

A target membrane challenge of 2 grams of polysaccharide per ft<sup>2 </sup>of membrane area was used for purification of the activated polysaccharide. The ultrafiltration system was equilibrated in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) prior to the addition of the oxidation reaction solution.

Characterization of the conjugate was performed as described in Example 4, including use of size exclusion chromatography media (CL-4B) to profile the relative molecular size distribution of the conjugate and a uronic acid assay to measure saccharide concentration. With respect to the long-term stability of the serotype 19A conjugate, a decrease in molecular size of about 10% with a concomitant increase in free saccharide levels of about 10% is expected over a period of 18 months. Accordingly, in the production of serotype 19A conjugates, a preferred value for conjugate molecular size is about 70% 0.3 Kd, with a preferred free saccharide level of below about 20-25%.</div>
