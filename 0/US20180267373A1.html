Specifically, the present invention relates to semiconductor devices and driving methods thereof. More specifically, the present invention relates to liquid crystal display devices and driving methods thereof, and particularly, liquid crystal display devices with improved contrast and driving methods thereof, and methods for improving quality of moving images.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, there has been growing interests in thin display devices. As substitutes for CRT displays, liquid crystal displays, plasma displays, projection displays, and the like have been developed and becoming popular. Further, field emission displays, inorganic electroluminescence displays, organic electroluminescence displays, electronic paper, and the like have been developed as next-generation display devices.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In a display portion provided in the above-described display device, pixels which are minimum units for forming an image are arranged. Each of the pixels emits light with luminance in accordance with image data, and an image is displayed on the display portion.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">When a moving image is displayed by such a display device, a plurality of images are displayed quickly, several tens of times per second. A cycle in which a plurality of images are displayed (or a cycle in which image data is input to the display device) is referred to as one frame period.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Here, driving methods of display devices can be classified according to temporal distribution of luminance of a pixel in one frame period. In a hold-type driving method which is used mainly in an active matrix display device, luminance of a pixel is constant in one frame period. On the other hand, in an impulse-type driving method which is used in CRT and the like, intense light is emitted once in one frame period and thereafter, luminance of a pixel immediately decreases and light is not emitted any more. In the impulse driving method, a non-lighting state dominates the most part of one frame period.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">It has become obvious that hold-type display devices have the following problems of motion blur: in displaying moving images, a moving object appears to have traces when a part of the image moves or the whole image is blurred when the whole image moves. It is said that this is because an image displayed on a hold-type display device is kept still during one frame period, while a human predicts motion of the moving object and sees a direction in which the moving object is supposed to move. That is, this is because a discrepancy between movement of human eyes and movement of the moving image. In an impulse-type display device, since an image appears for a moment and disappears immediately, there is no problem of such a discrepancy between human eyes and a moving image, and thus, a problem of motion blur does not occur.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Typically, two methods for solving the problem of motion blur in the hold-type display device are proposed (see Patent Document 1: Japanese Published Patent Application No. H4-302289). The first method is a method in which a period for displaying an original image and a period for display a black image are provided in one frame period. By this method, display can be closer to pseudo impulse-type display, and fewer afterimages can be perceived; thus, quality of moving images can be improved (see Patent Document 2: Japanese Published Patent Application No. H9-325715; and Patent Document 3: Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2000-200063). The second method is a method in which one frame period is shortened (i.e., frame frequency is increased). Accordingly, movement of an image can follow movement of human eyes and movement of the image is smooth, which leads to improvement of quality of moving images (see Patent Document 4: Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2005-268912). Further, as a technique for improving the first method, a method in which an image which is darker than an original image is displayed instead of a black image to improve quality of moving images is disclosed (see Patent Document 5: Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2002-23707; Patent Document 6: Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2004-240317; Non-patent Document 1: “New Technologies for Large-Sized High-Quality LCD TV”, SID'05 DIGEST, 60.2, pp. 1734-1737 (2005); Non-patent Document 2: “Amorphous Silicon Based 40” LCD TV Using Ultra Fast OCB Mode”, SID'06 DIGEST, 69.4, pp. 1950-1953 (2006); and Non-patent Document 3: “Progress of IPS-Pro Technology for LCD-TVs”, SID'06 DIGEST, 69.5, pp. 1954-1957 (2006)). Further, a method in which a driving method is changed depending on conditions is disclosed (see Patent Document 7: Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2002-91400; and Patent Document 8: Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2004-177575).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, a contrast ratio is one of indicators of quality of images to be displayed by a display device. The contrast ratio refers to a ratio of contrast of luminance that the display device can express (a ratio between the maximum luminance and the minimum luminance). A display device with higher contrast ratio can display a sharper and clearer image whose dynamic range of brightness is larger. Methods for improving a contrast ratio of a display device using a backlight are disclosed in Patent Document 9 and Non-patent Document 4, for example (Patent Document 9: Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2007-25187; and Non-patent Document 4: “RGB-LED Backlights for LCD-TVs with 0D, 1D, and 2D Adaptive Dimming”, SID '06 DIGEST, 44.4, pp. 1520-1523 (2006)).</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, a variety of methods have been studied to solve the problem of motion blur in hold-type display devices. However, such methods do not provide sufficient effects and have not yet have quality of moving images equal to that of impulse-type display devices. Further, in the method in which display of a black image is made closer to pseudo impulse-type display, flickers are increased. When a black image is displayed, luminance of an image is decreased, and power consumption is increased to provide the same level of luminance as in the case where a black image is not inserted. In the method of increasing frame frequency, data processing is complicated, and a driver circuit for high-speed processing is needed, which causes problems such as increase in manufacturing cost, heat generation due to the data processing, and increase in power consumption.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">Note that various types of switches, for example, an electrical switch and a mechanical switch can be used. That is, any element can be used without being limited to a particular type as long as it can control a current flow. For example, a transistor (e.g., a bipolar transistor or a MOS transistor), a diode (e.g., a PN diode, a PIN diode, a Schottky diode, a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diode, a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) diode, or a diode-connected transistor), a thyristor, or the like can be used as a switch. Alternatively, a logic circuit in which such elements are combined can be used as a switch.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">Examples of a mechanical switch include a switch formed using a micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology, such as a digital micromirror device (DMD). Such a switch includes an electrode which can be moved mechanically, and operates by controlling connection or non-connection based on movement of the electrode.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">When a transistor is used as a switch, polarity (a conductivity type) of the transistor is not particularly limited since it operates just as a switch. Note that when off-current is preferably to be suppressed, a transistor of polarity with smaller off-current is preferably used. Examples of a transistor with smaller off-current include a transistor having an LDD region and a transistor having a multi-gate structure. Further, an n-channel transistor is preferably used when a transistor operates with a potential of a source terminal closer to a potential of a low potential side power supply (e.g., V<sub>ss</sub>, GND, or 0 V). On the other hand, a p-channel transistor is preferably used when a transistor operates with a potential of a source terminal closer to a potential of a high potential side power supply (e.g., V<sub>dd</sub>). This is because when the n-channel transistor operates with the potential of the source terminal closer to the low potential side power supply and when the p-channel transistor operates with the potential of the source terminal closer to the high potential side power supply, an absolute value of gate-source voltage can be increased; thus, the transistor can more precisely operate as a switch. Moreover, this is because reduction in output voltage does not occur often because the transistor does not often perform a source follower operation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">Note that a CMOS switch may also be employed by using both n-channel and p-channel transistors. A CMOS switch can easily function as a switch since current can flow when one of the n-channel transistor and the p-channel transistor is turned on. For example, voltage can be output as appropriate whether voltage of an input signal to the switch is high or low. Further, since a voltage amplitude value of a signal for turning on/off the switch can be decreased, power consumption can be reduced.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">Note that when a transistor is used as a switch, the switch includes an input terminal (one of a source terminal and a drain terminal), an output terminal (the other of the source terminal and the drain terminal), and a terminal (a gate terminal) for controlling electrical conduction. On the other hand, when a diode is used as a switch, the switch does not have a terminal for controlling electrical conduction in some cases. Therefore, when a diode is used as a switch, the number of wirings for controlling terminals can be reduced compared with the case where a transistor is used as a switch.</div>

For example, a multi-gate structure having two or more gate electrodes may be employed. When the multi-gate structure is employed, a structure where a plurality of transistors are connected in series is provided since channel regions are connected in series. The multi-gate structure realizes reduction in off-current and improvement in reliability due to improvement in withstand voltage of the transistor. Further, by employing the multi-gate structure, drain-source current does not change much even if drain-source voltage changes when the transistor operates in a saturation region; thus, the slope of voltage-current characteristics can be flat. By utilizing the characteristics in which the slope of the voltage-current characteristics is flat, an ideal current source circuit and an active load having an extremely high resistance value can be realized. Thus, a differential circuit or a current mirror circuit having excellent properties can be realized. As another example, a structure where gate electrodes are formed above and below a channel may be employed. By employing the structure where gate electrodes are formed above and below the channel, a channel region is enlarged; thus, a subthreshold swing can be reduced because the amount of current is increased or a depletion layer is easily formed. When the gate electrodes are formed above and below the channel, it seems that a plurality of transistors are connected in parallel.</div>

Moreover, a structure where a source electrode or a drain electrode overlaps with a channel region (or part thereof) may be employed. By employing the structure where the source electrode or the drain electrode overlaps with the channel region (or part thereof), an unstable operation due to accumulation of charge in part of the channel region can be prevented. Alternatively, an LDD region may be provided. By providing the LDD region, off-current can be reduced, or reliability can be improved by improvement in withstand voltage of the transistor.

Accordingly, all of circuits which are necessary to realize a predetermined function can be formed using the same substrate. For example, all of the circuits which are necessary to realize the predetermined function can be formed using various substrates such as a glass substrate, a plastic substrate, a single crystalline substrate, or an SOI substrate. When all of the circuits which are necessary to realize the predetermined function are formed using the same substrate, cost can be reduced by reduction in the number of component parts or reliability can be improved by reduction in the number of connections between circuit components. Alternatively, part of the circuits which is necessary to realize the predetermined function may be formed using one substrate and another part of the circuits which is necessary to realize the predetermined function may be formed using another substrate. That is, not all of the circuits which are necessary to realize the predetermined function are required to be formed using the same substrate. For example, part of the circuits which is necessary to realize the predetermined function may be formed over a glass substrate by using transistors and another part of the circuits which is necessary to realize the predetermined function may be formed using a single crystalline substrate, and an IC chip formed by a transistor using the single crystalline substrate may be connected to the glass substrate by COG (chip on glass) so that the IC chip is provided over the glass substrate. Alternatively, the IC chip may be connected to the glass substrate by TAB (tape automated bonding) or a printed wiring board. When part of the circuits is formed using the same substrate in such a manner, cost can be reduced by reduction in the number of component parts or reliability can be improved by reduction in the number of connections between circuit components. In addition, circuits in a portion with high driving voltage or a portion with high driving frequency consume large power. Accordingly, the circuits in such portions are formed using a single crystalline substrate, for example, instead of using the same substrate, and an IC chip formed by the circuit is used; thus, increase in power consumption can be prevented.</div>

For example, one pixel corresponds to one color element, and brightness is expressed with one color element. Accordingly, in the case of a color display device having color elements of R (red), G (green), and B (blue), the smallest unit of an image is formed of three pixels of an R pixel, a G pixel, and a B pixel. Note that the color elements are not limited to three colors, and color elements of more than three colors may be used and/or a color other than RGB may be used. For example, RGBW can be employed by adding W (white). Alternatively, RGB added with one or more colors of yellow, cyan, magenta, emerald green, vermilion, and the like may be used. Further alternatively, a color similar to at least one of R, G, and B may be added to RGB. For example, R, G, B1, and B2 may be used. Although both B1 and B2 are blue, they have slightly different frequencies. Similarly, R1, R2, G, and B may be used. By using such color elements, display which is closer to a real object can be performed, and power consumption can be reduced. As another example, when brightness of one color element is controlled by using a plurality of regions, one region may correspond to one pixel. For example, when area ratio gray scale display is performed or a subpixel is included, a plurality of regions which control brightness are provided in one color element and gray scales are expressed with all of the regions, and one region which controls brightness may correspond to one pixel. In that case, one color element is formed of a plurality of pixels. Alternatively, even when a plurality of the regions which control brightness are provided in one color element, these regions may be collected and one color element may be referred to as one pixel. In that case, one color element is formed of one pixel. In addition, when brightness of one color element is controlled by a plurality of regions, regions which contribute to display may have different area dimensions depending on pixels in some cases. Alternatively, in a plurality of the regions which control brightness in one color element, signals supplied to respective regions may slightly vary to widen a viewing angle. That is, potentials of pixel electrodes included in the plurality of the regions in one color element may be different from each other. Accordingly, voltages applied to liquid crystal molecules vary depending on the pixel electrodes. Thus, the viewing angle can be widened.</div>

Accordingly, a display device with improved quality of still images and moving images and a driving method thereof can be obtained.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0078]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, when a display frame rate is made larger than a frame rate of input image data or pseudo impulse driving is performed, for example, a display device without the problem of motion blur and a driving method thereof can be obtained. When a cycle of change in brightness is shortened or the amount of change is reduced, for example, a display device without flickers and a driving method thereof can be obtained. Further, particularly in a liquid crystal display device, when an optimal liquid crystal mode is selected, for example, a display device with wider viewing angles and a driving method thereof can be obtained. Moreover, particularly in a liquid crystal display device, when voltage whose level is larger than original voltage is temporarily applied to the device, for example, a display device with higher response speed and a driving method thereof can be obtained. By a variety of methods, for example, when brightness is suppressed or driving frequency is reduced, a display device with lower power consumption in addition to the above-described effects and a driving method thereof can be obtained. Further, by a variety of methods, for example, when a circuit for which high driving frequency is not necessary is used or a manufacturing process is simplified, a display device with lower manufacturing cost and a driving method thereof can be obtained.</div>

Note that the present invention can be implemented in various modes, and it is easily understood by those skilled in the art that modes and details can be variously changed without departing from the scope and the spirit of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention is not construed as being limited to description of the embodiment modes.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0190]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0191" num="0190">In this embodiment mode, an example of a method of improving quality of images displayed on a display device is described. Specifically, a method of improving quality of images displayed on a display device in which a backlight is used is described. More specifically, a method in which temporal change (movement of images) of image data to be input is detected and an image in an intermediate state between the images is employed as an interpolation image, and a method in which the area of a backlight is divided into a plurality of regions and brightness of each of the plurality of regions is controlled in accordance with image data to be displayed are described.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0191]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0192" num="0191">First, a backlight in this embodiment mode is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The backlight in this embodiment mode is a lighting device which illuminates a display panel from behind an image display region, and has a structure where a light-emitting region is divided into a plurality of unit regions and brightness of each unit region can be individually controlled. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a structure example of a backlight. In this embodiment mode, the case where a light-emitting region is divided into tile patterns is described as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>; however, a division state of the light-emitting region in this embodiment mode is not limited thereto. For example, when the unit region is rectangular, the light-emitting region can be divided into brick patterns (delta patterns) as well as tile patterns. Alternatively, the unit region may be a parallelogram, a triangle, a hexagon, or a combination of pentagons and hexagons (a football shape). As described above, a variety of division states of the light-emitting region are possible.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0192]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0193" num="0192">When the light-emitting region is divided into tile patterns, a name is individually given to each unit region for explanation. In this embodiment mode, the number of division of the light-emitting region in the horizontal direction is denoted by I, the number of division of the light-emitting region in the vertical direction is denoted by J, the position of the light-emitting region in the horizontal direction is denoted by Xi, and the position of the light-emitting region in the vertical direction is denoted by Yj. In this embodiment mode, i is an integer of 1 to I, and j is an integer of 1 to J. For example, when the upper left of the light-emitting region is used as reference, a unit region which is the i-th region from the left and the j-th region from the top is referred to as a unit region XiYj. In this embodiment mode, the case where I=J=8 is described. Note that values of I and J are not limited to these and can be a variety of values.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0193]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0194" num="0193">Next, a display panel in this embodiment mode is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The display panel in this embodiment mode is a light valve device (a device for controlling the amount of light transmission) which is illuminated by a backlight from behind an image display region. The image display region is divided into a plurality of pixels, and the light valve device has a structure capable of individually controlling the amount of light transmission (also referred to as transmittance) in each pixel. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a structure example of a display panel. Detailed description of a division state of the image display region is omitted. The number of pixels included in the display panel is larger than the number of unit regions included in the backlight. For example, in the case of a display panel included in a display device used as a television receiver, it is preferable that the number of division in the horizontal direction be 1920×3 or more and the number of division in the lateral direction be 1050 or more. Accordingly, a precise image can be displayed on the image display region; thus, image quality of the display device can be improved. The operation that the number of division in the horizontal direction is multiplied by 3 is for displaying each of RGB to perform color display. Alternatively, the division in the vertical direction instead of the horizontal direction may be performed. In this case, it is preferable that the number of division in the horizontal direction be 1920 or more and the number of division in the lateral direction be 1050×3 or more. Further, for example, in the case of a display panel included in a display device used as a monitor of a personal computer, a variety of the number of division can be employed, such as <b>1920</b>, <b>1680</b>, <b>1440</b>, and <b>1280</b> in the horizontal direction and <b>1200</b>, <b>1050</b>, <b>900</b>, and <b>1024</b> in the lateral direction.

Specifically, a method is described in which temporal change (movement of images) of image data to be input is detected, an image in an intermediate state between the images is displayed as an interpolation image in the display panel, and brightness of each unit region included in the backlight is controlled in accordance with the image data to be displayed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0195]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0196" num="0195">First, an image displayed on the image display region of the display panel is described. The image displayed on the image display region has a period during which the image is displayed in accordance with image data to be input. The image data to be input has a given cycle, and an image displayed on the image display region is rewritten in accordance with the cycle. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates change of the image displayed on the image display region with time passing. In the display panel shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, an image <b>111</b> is displayed at a certain point.

Specifically, an image <b>114</b> can be displayed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In this embodiment mode, the image <b>114</b> is displayed at the time when a period obtained by multiplication of the cycle T<sub>in </sub>of image data to be input by ½ passes after the image <b>111</b> is displayed. Note that the image <b>114</b> can be displayed at a variety of timings without being limited thereto, and detailed description is omitted. Further, the image <b>114</b> is an image which is made to be in an intermediate state between images by detection of the amount of change in the display image to be input (movement of the images).

Accordingly, the movement of the object <b>112</b> to the position represented by the object <b>118</b> is displayed through intermediate display by the object <b>115</b>, and thus displayed smoothly.</div>

In other words, a display frame rate of the image display region of the display panel is twice an input frame rate of the image data to be input, and thus, this method is referred to as double-frame rate driving (frame rate conversion). Such display makes movement of the object in the image display region more smooth; thus, motion blur due to a hold-type display device can be reduced, and quality of display images, especially moving images can be improved.</div>

Specifically, when brightness of each unit region included in the backlight is individually controlled in accordance with an image displayed on the display panel, a dark portion in the image can be displayed as being darker and a bright portion in the image can be displayed as being brighter (a contrast ratio can be improved). This is particularly effective when a liquid crystal element is used in the display panel, for example. This is because the display panel in which the liquid crystal element is used slightly transmits light of the backlight when black is displayed. That is, even if the liquid crystal element is controlled so that black is displayed, light of the backlight is leaked when the backlight emits light. Accordingly, light is emitted slightly, and thus, black cannot be displayed as sheer black. This phenomenon is referred to as black blurring.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0202]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0203" num="0202">By using the method described in this embodiment mode, black blurring can be reduced. This is because when light is not emitted in a unit region of the backlight corresponding to a portion in which the liquid crystal element is controlled so that black is displayed, black blurring in the unit region can be avoided. Accordingly, the contrast ratio can be improved.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0203]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0204" num="0203">Note that a phenomenon of black blurring does not occur only in a liquid crystal display device. A phenomenon that black is not displayed as “black” likely occurs in any display device. In the method shown in this embodiment mode, light emission of a light-emitting element is stopped when black is displayed, and the method shown in this embodiment mode can be applied to a variety of display devices without being limited to a liquid crystal display device.</div>

That is, when the display panel is driven with double-frame rate driving, the backlight can also be driven with double-frame rate driving in synchronization with the display panel. Accordingly, a sharp image with a higher contrast ratio can be realized not only as a still image but also as a moving image. That is, when the light-emitting region of the backlight is divided into a plurality of unit regions and brightness of each unit region can be individually controlled, a contrast ratio of still images can be improved. Moreover, double-frame rate driving of the display panel can reduce motion blur. Furthermore, when the backlight is also driven with double-frame rate driving in synchronization with the display panel, display with reduced motion blur can be obtained as well as still images have a higher contrast ratio.</div>

For example, rational number multiple of the driving frequency, such as 3/2-fold frame rate driving, 4/3-fold frame rate driving, or 5/2-fold frame rate driving as well as integer multiple of the driving frequency, such as triple-frame rate driving, quadruple-frame rate driving, 5-fold frame rate driving, 6-fold frame rate driving, 7-fold frame rate driving, or 8-fold frame rate driving can be employed. In the case of any driving frequency, when driving frequencies of the display panel and the backlight are synchronized with each other, display with reduced motion blur can be obtained as well as still images have a higher contrast ratio.</div>

In such a manner, a light-emitting state of the backlight can be selected from (n+1) kinds of state: a non-light emission state and n kinds of light emission state. Note that the number of levels of brightness of the backlight can be reduced when N&gt;n is satisfied; thus, manufacturing cost of the backlight and a driver circuit of the backlight can be reduced.

On the other hand, when G<sub>lm </sub>is in the range of 1 to 256, k is equal to 1.

In other words, the method where the number n of levels of brightness of the backlight is set to be 1 is a method where states of brightness of the backlight are two states of non-light emission and light emission. Accordingly, the unit region of the backlight is in a non-light emission state only when the maximum gray scale value G<sub>lm </sub>in the unit region is 0 (when all of gray scale values of pixels in the unit region are 0), and a driving method for performing normal display can be employed except when the maximum gray scale value G<sub>lm </sub>in the unit region is 0. This driving method can prevent black blurring when black is displayed; thus, a contrast ratio can be improved. Further, when driving frequencies of the display panel and the backlight are synchronized with each other while this driving method is performed, display with reduced motion blur can be obtained as well as still images have a higher contrast ratio.</div>

This is because when k=2 and brightness of the backlight is L<sub>k</sub>=L, brightness with 256 levels can be displayed, and when k=1 and brightness of the backlight is L<sub>k</sub>=L/2, brightness which cannot be displayed in the case of L<sub>k</sub>=L can be displayed. Specifically, brightness with 256 levels can be displayed on the lower gray scale side of half of the maximum brightness (in the range of the gray scale level of 0 to 127); thus, brightness with 384 levels obtained by (256 (the lower gray scale level side)+128 (the higher gray scale level side)) can be displayed as a whole. A human eye is particularly sensitive to difference of brightness on the lower gray scale level side. Accordingly, a gray scale on the lower gray scale level side can be minutely expressed by this driving method; thus, image quality can be further improved particularly when images which mainly include dark images (e.g., a movie) are displayed.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0230]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0234" num="0230">Then, the case where the number n of levels of brightness of the backlight is 2 or more is considered. The number of levels of brightness to be displayed can be increased as brightness of the background is lower as described above, and attention is needed when overdriving is performed in this case. Specifically, in normal overdriving, overdrive voltage is obtained in accordance with image data input to the display device; in contrast, in the case where the number n of levels of brightness of the backlight is 2 or more, overdrive voltage is obtained from a gray scale value (or a voltage value) which is actually written to the display panel, not from the image data input to the display device itself. For example, the case of N=256 and n=2, that is, the case where gray scale values included in image data are 256 levels (8 bits) and the number of levels of brightness of the backlight is 3 (non-light emission, moderate brightness, and the maximum brightness) is considered. When the brightness of the backlight is moderate in particular, and for example, when the gray scale level of 51 of the image data is displayed, a gray scale value on the display panel side can be 102, and the brightness of the backlight can be L/2. At this time, not the gray scale level (51) of the image data but the gray scale value (102) on the display panel side is preferably used as data for obtaining overdrive voltage. This is because the gray scale value of 102 is actually given to the display panel. Therefore, when the gray scale level of 51 of the image data is used for overdrive voltage, the obtained overdrive voltage and optimal overdrive voltage vary.</div>

Therefore, in a display device in which the number n of levels of brightness of the backlight can be 2 or more, a circuit for performing overdriving (an overdrive circuit) may have a structure in which information on brightness of the backlight or the gray scale value (or the voltage value) which is actually written to the display panel is input. Accordingly, in the display device in which the number n of levels of brightness of the backlight is 2 or more, appropriate overdrive voltage can be obtained. Thus, even in a display device in which an element whose response time is long, such as a liquid crystal element, is used, quality of moving images can be improved. Moreover, when driving frequencies of the display panel and the backlight are synchronized with each other while this driving method is performed, display with reduced motion blur can be obtained as well as still images have a higher contrast ratio. Further, when the number of levels of brightness of the backlight is increased, a gray scale on the lower gray scale level side is more minutely expressed, and thus image quality can be further improved. Furthermore, when brightness of unit regions of the backlight is controlled depending on difference in brightness of the unit regions of the backlight, a phenomenon that a boundary of the unit region stands out can be avoided.</div>

This is effective in using source line inversion or gate line inversion, for example, because flickers are relatively noticeable in these driving methods. Accordingly, frequency of inversion driving can be increased, so that flickers in the display panel can be reduced. As specific values, when a frame rate of image data to be input is 60 Hz and the driving frequencies of the display panel and the backlight are 120 Hz, the frequency of inversion driving can be 60 Hz (synchronization). The operation that the frequency of inversion driving is synchronized with the driving frequencies of the display panel and the backlight refers to a state in which positive voltage is written to a pixel, and thereafter, negative voltage is written for the next writing, and positive voltage is written for the next writing. When a liquid crystal element is used in a display device, such an operation can prevent direct-current voltage from being applied to the liquid crystal element; thus, the life of the liquid crystal element can be increased, and flickers can be reduced.</div>

Specifically, the driving frequency of inversion driving of the display panel can be frequency obtained by dividing the driving frequencies of the display panel and the backlight by an integer. This is effective in using dot inversion, for example, because dot inversion can effectively reduce flickers even when the driving frequency is relatively low. Accordingly, the driving frequency of inversion driving of the display panel can be reduced, so that power consumption can be reduced. As specific values, when a frame rate of image data to be input is 60 Hz and the driving frequencies of the display panel and the backlight are 120 Hz, the frequency of inversion driving can be 30 Hz (half). The operation that the frequency of inversion driving is half the driving frequencies of the display panel and the backlight refers to a state in which positive voltage is written to a pixel, and thereafter, positive voltage is also written for the next writing, and then, negative voltage is written for the next writing, and negative voltage is also written for the next writing, and then, positive voltage is written for the next writing.

When a peripheral driver circuit such as a gate driver or a source driver is formed using the SOI substrate, driving voltage of the circuit can be reduced; thus, power consumption can be reduced. When an image data processing circuit, a timing generation circuit, or the like is formed using the SOI substrate, driving voltage of the circuit can be reduced; thus, power consumption can be reduced. The use of the SOI substrate is more effective when the liquid crystal display device can perform overdriving. This is because image data is frequently processed by overdriving, and thus an effect of reducing power consumption due to reduction in driving voltage is more significant. Further, in the case of a circuit using a memory, such as a lookup table, an effect of reducing power consumption due to reduction in driving voltage is significant. Similarly, when a device has a structure capable of performing driving (double-frame rate driving) in which a frame rate of image data input to the liquid crystal display device is converted into a higher frame rate to perform display, the use of the SOI substrate is quite effective. This is because while driving frequency of a pixel circuit and a peripheral driver circuit becomes significantly high because of double-frame rate driving, driving voltage can be reduced when the circuit is formed using the SOI substrate; thus, power consumption can be drastically reduced.</div>

Since a transistor formed using a semiconductor substrate has high mobility, the size of the transistor can be decreased. Accordingly, the number of transistors per unit area can be increased (the degree of integration can be improved), and the size of the substrate can be decreased as the degree of integration is increased in the case of the same circuit structure. Thus, manufacturing cost can be reduced. Further, since the circuit scale can be increased as the degree of integration is increased in the case of the same substrate size, more advanced functions can be provided without increase in manufacturing cost. Moreover, reduction in variations in characteristics can improve manufacturing yield. Reduction in operating voltage can reduce power consumption.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0677]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0681" num="0677">Depending on how many images which can be displayed without motion compensation to the input image data are included in images to be displayed, the conversion ratio can be determined. Specifically, the smaller conversion ratio (n/m) becomes, the higher the proportion of images which can be displayed without motion compensation to the input image data becomes. When motion compensation is performed less frequently, power consumption can be reduced because a circuit which performs motion compensation operates less frequently. Further, the likelihood of generation of an image including an error by motion compensation (an intermediate image which does not correctly reflect motion of an image) can be decreased, so that image quality can be improved. In the case where n is 10 or less, examples of such a conversion ratio include 1, 2, 3, 3/2, 4, 5, 5/2, 6, 7, 7/2, 8, 9, 9/2, and 10. By employing such a conversion ratio, especially when an intermediate image obtained by motion compensation is used as an interpolation image, the image quality can be improved and power consumption can be reduced. This is because the number (half the total number of images input) of images which can be displayed without motion compensation to the input image data is comparatively large, and motion compensation is performed less frequently in the case where conversion ratio (n/m) is 2; and because the number (equal to the total number of images input) of images which can be displayed without motion compensation to the input image data is large, and motion compensation cannot be performed in the case where conversion ratio (n/m) is 1. On the other hand, the larger conversion ratio (n/m) becomes, the smoother motion of images can be made because an intermediate image which is generated by motion compensation with high accuracy is used.</div>

Here, the response time of the liquid crystal element is the time from when voltage applied to the liquid crystal element is changed until when the liquid crystal element responds. When the response time of the liquid crystal element differs depending on the amount of change of the voltage applied to the liquid crystal element, an average of the response times of plural typical voltage changes can be used. Alternatively, the response time of the liquid crystal element can be defined as MPRT (moving picture response time). Then, by frame rate conversion, the conversion ratio can be determined so that the length of the image display cycle can be near the response time of the liquid crystal element. Specifically, the response time of the liquid crystal element is preferably the time from the value obtained by multiplication of the cycle of input image data and the inverse number of the conversion ratio, to approximately half that value. In this manner, the image display cycle can be made to correspond to the response time of the liquid crystal element, so that the image quality is improved. For example, when the response time of the liquid crystal element is more than or equal to 4 milliseconds and less than or equal to 8 milliseconds, double-frame rate driving (120 Hz driving) can be employed. This is because the image display cycle of 120 Hz driving is approximately 8 milliseconds, and the half of the image display cycle of 120 Hz driving is approximately 4 milliseconds. Similarly, for example, when the response time of the liquid crystal element is more than or equal to 3 milliseconds and less than or equal to 6 milliseconds, triple-frame rate driving (180 Hz driving) can be employed; when the response time of the liquid crystal element is more than or equal to 5 milliseconds and less than or equal to 11 milliseconds, 1.5-fold frame rate driving (90 Hz driving) can be employed; when the response time of the liquid crystal element is more than or equal to 2 milliseconds and less than or equal to 4 milliseconds, quadruple-frame rate driving (240 Hz driving) can be employed; and when the response time of the liquid crystal element is more than or equal to 6 milliseconds and less than or equal to 12 milliseconds, 1.33-fold frame rate driving (80 Hz driving) can be employed.

In this manner, a display method can be made close to pseudo impulse type display without decrease in brightness. Accordingly, deterioration of quality of moving images due to a hold-type display method can be prevented. Here, a gamma characteristic is a degree of brightness with respect to a level (a gray scale) of brightness. In general, a line of the gamma characteristic is adjusted so as to be close to a linear shape. This is because a smooth gray scale can be obtained when change in brightness is proportional to one gray scale in the level of brightness. In the gamma correction method, the curve of the gamma characteristic of one sub-image is deviated from the linear shape so that the one sub-image is brighter than a sub-image in the linear shape in a region of intermediate brightness (halftone) (the image in halftone is brighter than as it usually is). Further, a line of the gamma characteristic of the other sub-image is also deviated from the linear shape so that the other sub-image is darker than the sub-image in the linear shape in a region of intermediate brightness (the image in halftone is darker than as it usually is). Here, the amount of change for brightening the one sub-image than that in the linear shape and the amount of change for darkening the other sub-image than the sub-image in the linear shape are preferably almost the same.

Although the timing when the first sub-image is displayed is the same as that when the original image determined in the first step is displayed, and the timing when the second sub-image is displayed can be optionally decided regardless of the timing when the original image determined in the first step is displayed, the sub-image itself may be changed in accordance with the timing when the second sub-image is displayed. In this manner, even if the timing when the second sub-image is displayed is changed variously, human eyes can be made to perceive as if the original image is displayed. Specifically, if the timing when the second sub-image is displayed is earlier, the first sub-image can be brighter and the second sub-image can be darker. Further, if the timing when the second sub-image is displayed is later, the first sub-image can be darker and the second sub-image can be brighter. This is because brightness perceived by human eyes changes in accordance with the length of a period when an image is displayed. More specifically, the longer the length of the period when an image is displayed becomes, the higher brightness perceived by human eyes becomes, whereas the shorter the length of the period when an image is displayed becomes, the lower brightness perceived by human eyes becomes. That is, by making the timing when the second sub-image is displayed earlier, the length of the period when the first sub-image is displayed becomes shorter and the length of period when the second sub-image is displayed becomes longer. This means human eyes perceive as if the first sub-image is dark and the second sub-image is bright. As a result, a different image from the original image is perceived by human eyes. In order to prevent this, the first sub-image can be made brighter and the second sub-image can be made darker. Similarly, in the case where the length of the period when the first sub-image is displayed becomes longer and the length of the period when the second sub-image is displayed becomes shorter by making the timing when the second sub-image is displayed later, the first sub-image can be made much darker and the second sub-image can be made much brighter.</div>

On the other hand, when the mechanism for performing the procedures in the second step is decided in the design phase of the device in advance, driver circuits optimal for respective driving methods can be used.
