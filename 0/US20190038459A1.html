<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to medical devices, systems, and methods, particularly for those which employ cold for treatment of neuromas or fibromas associated with limb pain in a patient. Embodiments of the invention include cryogenic cooling needles that can be advanced through skin or other tissues to treat neuromas and fibromas, and/or to inhibit transmission of pain signals.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Over 100 million patients in the United States suffer from chronic pain. Chronic pain conditions are often debilitating, taking a toll on a patient's physical and mental welfare. Though a variety of pain management techniques currently exist, the most common nonsurgical options provide slow-acting and/or short-term relief. Medication, often in the form of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids, comes with an array of side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Medication also presents the possibility of more serious effects such as increased risk of heart attack and stroke, and tolerance or dependency issues. Surgical strategies tend to be reserved for more severe cases and are limited by the risks and complications typically associated with surgery including bleeding, bruising, scarring, and infection.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">A nonsurgical, minimally invasive, long-lasting approach to chronic pain management is desirable. In general, it would be advantageous to provide improved devices, systems, and methods for management of chronic and/or acute pain. Such improved techniques may avoid or decrease the systemic effects of toxin-based neurolysis and pharmaceutical approaches, while decreasing the invasiveness and/or collateral tissue damage of at least some known pain treatment techniques.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Many embodiments provide a novel, minimally invasive device and method for providing focused cold therapy to target peripheral sensory nerve tissue that offers long-lasting pain relief through cryoanalgesia. The device and method may operate on the cryobiology principle that localized exposure to controlled moderately low temperature conditions can alter tissue function. The device and therapy may treat nerves with low temperatures via a cold probe in the form of an assembly of small diameter needles, creating a highly localized treatment zone around the probe. This focused cold therapy (FCT) may create a conduction block that prevents nerve signaling. Further, preliminary studies have provided preliminary evidence of the device and method effectiveness on motor nerves and have been shown to be safe with no serious device-related adverse events.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0045]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0046" num="0045">The present invention provides improved medical devices, systems, and methods. Embodiments of the invention may facilitate remodeling of target tissues disposed at and below the skin, optionally to treat pain associated with a sensory nerve. Embodiments of the invention may utilize a handheld refrigeration system that can use a commercially available cartridge of fluid refrigerant. Refrigerants well suited for use in handheld refrigeration systems may include nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. These can achieve temperatures approaching −90° C.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0046]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0047" num="0046">Sensory nerves and associated tissues may be temporarily impaired using moderately cold temperatures of 10° C. to −5° C. without permanently disabling the tissue structures. Using an approach similar to that employed for identifying structures associated with atrial fibrillation, a needle probe or other treatment device can be used to identify a target tissue structure in a diagnostic mode with these moderate temperatures, and the same probe (or a different probe) can also be used to provide a longer term or permanent treatment, optionally by ablating the target tissue zone and/or inducing apoptosis at temperatures from about −5° C. to about −50° C. In some embodiments, apoptosis may be induced using treatment temperatures from about −1° C. to about −15° C., or from about −1° C. to about −19° C., optionally so as to provide a longer lasting treatment that limits or avoids inflammation and mobilization of skeletal muscle satellite repair cells. In some embodiments, axonotmesis with Wallerian degeneration of a sensory nerve is desired, which may be induced using treatment temperatures from about −20° C. to about −100° C. Hence, the duration of the treatment efficacy of such subdermal cryogenic treatments may be selected and controlled, with colder temperatures, longer treatment times, and/or larger volumes or selected patterns of target tissue determining the longevity of the treatment.

To achieve this, metering coolant flow could maintain a large thermal gradient at its outside edges. This may be particularly advantageous in applications for creating an array of connected cooling zones (i.e., fence) in a treatment zone, as time would be provided for the treatment zone to fully develop within the fenced in portion of the tissue, while the outer boundaries maintained a relatively large thermal gradient due to the repeated application and removal of refrigeration power. This could provide a mechanism within the body of tissue to thermally regulate the treatment zone and could provide increased ability to modulate the treatment zone at a prescribed distance from the surface of the skin.

Probe <b>300</b> includes an array of three distally extending needle shafts <b>302</b>, each having a sharpened, tissue penetrating tip <b>304</b>. Using three linearly arranged needles allows a greater area of tissue to be treated as compared with a single needle. In use, coolant flows through lumens <b>310</b> into the needle shafts <b>302</b> thereby cooling the needle shafts <b>302</b>. Ideally, only the distal portion of the needle shaft <b>302</b> would be cooled so that only the target tissue receives the cryogenic treatment. However, as the cooling fluid flows through the probe <b>300</b>, probe temperature decreases proximally along the length of the needle shafts <b>302</b> towards the probe hub <b>318</b>. The proximal portion of needle shaft <b>302</b> and the probe hub <b>318</b> contact skin and may become very cold (e.g. −20° C. to −25° C.) and this can damage the skin in the form of blistering or loss of skin pigmentation. Therefore it would be desirable to ensure that the proximal portion of needle shaft <b>302</b> and hub <b>318</b> remains warmer than the distal portion of needle shaft <b>302</b>. A proposed solution to this challenge is to include a heater element <b>314</b> that can heat the proximal portion of needle shaft <b>302</b> and an optional temperature sensor <b>312</b> to monitor temperature in this region.

In some embodiments of the invention, nerve entrapment (also known as a pinched nerve) causing pain in the foot of a patient may be treated by targeting the associated sensory nerves of the foot with cooling treatment. Nerve entrapment may occur at various regions of the foot. A nerve entrapment is frequently caused by trauma, such as pressure created by swelling, excess pressure from a tight shoe, or blunt trauma. Symptoms of nerve entrapment include shooting, burning pain or sensitivity on the top portion of the foot.</div>

Morton's neuroma is a disorder caused by digital nerve entrapment under the intermetatarsal ligament and results in benign thickening of the nerve. This occurs most commonly at the second and third intermetatarsal spaces (i.e., between the third and fourth toes). Symptoms include burning or shooting pain in the area between the third and fourth toes, most often with walking. Another common symptom is a vague feeling of pressure beneath the toes, as if a sock was bunched-up underneath them. Morton's neuroma occurs more frequently in women, possibly because of the frequency of narrow or high-heeled shoe wear. Advantageously, cryogenic cooling of the neuroma may treat that neuroma rather than simply blocking pain signals. Additionally, forefoot neuropathy associated with gout may be treated in some embodiments.</div>

A paired two-tailed t-test was employed to account for the possibility of subjects worsening over the course of the study, and the test was performed using a statistical significance level of P&lt;0.05. The point improvements from baseline at post-treatment, Day 7 and Day 30 were tested against the null hypothesis and produced P-values of 5.10E-07, 0.03, and 0.61, respectively (Table 5).

Wallerian degeneration of the nerve axons following focused cold therapy suspends conduction of entrapped nerve pain. Further, resulting inflammation may address the mechanism of entrapment so when the nerve axons regenerate they may no longer be entrapped and the chronic pain may not return.</div>

With needles less than 7 mm in length, larger gauge needles (smaller diameter) may be preferred so as to limit mechanical injury to the skin and tissue to be treated. For example, in some embodiments, it may be beneficial to use 27 gauge needles.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0140]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0149" num="0140">Optionally, longer needles may be used in some embodiments (e.g., 8-15 mm, 20 mm, 90 mm etc.). Longer needles may require a smaller gauge (larger diameter) needle so they have sufficient rigidity to maintain consistent spacing when placed deep in the tissue, but not so large as to create significant mechanical injury to the skin and tissue when inserted (e.g., greater than 20 ga). Alternate configurations of the device may have two or more needles spaced generally 3-5 mm apart of lengths ranging from up to 20 mm or greater, typically of 25 gauge or 23 gauge. Single needle configurations may be even longer (e.g., 90 mm) for reaching target tissues that are even deeper (e.g., &gt;15 mm or so below the dermis). Longer needle devices (e.g., &gt;10 mm) may not need active heating of the skin warmer and/or cladding found in designs using shorter needle(s) as the cooling zone may be placed sufficiently deep below the dermis to prevent injury. In some embodiments, devices with single long needle configurations may benefit from active nerve location such as ultrasound or electrical nerve stimulation to guide placement of the needle. Further, larger targets may require treatment from both sides to make sure that the cold zone created by the needle fully covers the target. Adjacent treatments placing the needle to either side of a nerve during two successive treatment cycles may still provide an effective treatment of the entire nerve cross-section.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0141]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0150" num="0141">In some situations, a probe with multiple spaced apart needles may be preferable (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more). A device employing multiple needles may decrease the total treatment duration by creating larger cooling zones. Further, a multi-needle device may be configured to provide continuous cooling zones between the spaced apart needles. In some embodiments, the needles may be spaced apart by 1-5 mm. The spacing may be dependent on the type of tissue being targeted. For example, when targeting a nerve, it may be preferable to position the nerve between the two or more needles so that cooling zones are generated on both sides of the nerve. Treating the nerve from both sides may increase the probability that the entire cross-section of the nerve will be treated. For superficial peripheral nerves, the nerves may be at depths ranging from 2-6 mm and may be smaller in diameter, typically &lt;2 mm. Accordingly, devices for treating foot pain and/or Morton's neuroma or other superficial peripheral nerves may comprises two or more 27 gauge needles spaced ≤2 mm apart and having typical lengths less than 7 mm (e.g., 6.9 mm); however longer needles may be required to treat the full patient population in order to access patients with altered nerve anatomy or patients with higher amounts of subcutaneous tissue such as those with high BMIs. Neuroma treatment may involve treating the neuroma directly. In some embodiments, it may be preferable to treat proximal to the neuroma so as to lead to a longer period of time required for nerve axon degeneration followed by nerve axon regeneration in the vicinity of the neuroma. Advantageously, focused cold therapy may relieve pain associated with neuroma in addition to reducing the size of the neuroma to relieve and/or cure the symptom.</div>

Furthermore the procedure may be used either pre- or post-operatively. Before total knee replacement surgery, the procedure may be used to limit pain, allow patients to strengthen the joint which may improve surgical outcomes. Post surgically, the procedure may be used to limit the use of opioids or other pain killers and or allow the patient to reduce residual post-surgical pain.</div>

In some embodiments, a pre-warming cycle can range from 0 to up to 30 seconds, preferably 5-15 seconds sufficient to pre-warm the cryoprobe and opposing skin. Treatment cooling may range from 5-120 seconds, preferably 15-60 seconds based on the flow rate, geometry of the cryoprobe, size of the therapy zone, size of the target nerve or tissue and the mechanism of action desired. Post warming can range from 0-60 seconds, preferably 10-15 seconds sufficient to return the cryoprobe to a steady state thermal condition and possibly to free the cryoprobe needle(s) from the frozen therapy zone (e.g., at least 0° C.) prior to removing the cryoprobe needles. For example, in some embodiments, devices with 6.9 mm long cladded needles may be warmed with a 30° C. heater. The treatment cycle may comprise a 10 second pre-warm phase, a 35 second cooling phase, and a 15 second post-warm phase.

Similarly, treatment cycles may be configured with warming phases operating a temperatures ranging between 10-45° C. depending on the length of cooling phases, number of needles, needle spacing, etc. in order to generate a desired cryozone. Generally, with higher degree warming phases, the duration of the pre-warm phase and the cooling phase will be longer, however the post-warm phase duration may be reduced.

For example, larger needle devices (e.g., 30-90 mm) may not require a pre-heat/warm phase. Larger needles may rely on the body's natural heat to bring the needle to a desired temperature prior to a cooling phase.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0148]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0157" num="0148">Although the above described procedures treated foot pain using cold, other methods and devices could be used to temporarily or permanently disable neuromas or fibromas. Examples include thermal nerve ablation such as with RF energy, or neurolysis using injections of phenol or ethyl alcohol.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0149]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0158" num="0149">In some embodiments of the present invention, treatment guidance can rely on rigid or boney landmarks because they are less dependent upon natural variations in body size or type, e.g. BMI. Soft tissues, vasculature and peripheral nerves pass adjacent to the rigid landmarks because they require protection and support. The target nerve to relieve pain can be identified based on the diagnosis along with patients identifying the area of pain, biomechanical movements that evoke pain from specific areas, palpation, and diagnostic nerve blocks using an temporary analgesic (e.g. 1-2% Lidocaine). Target nerve (tissue) can be located by relying on anatomical landmarks to indicate the anatomical area through which the target nerve (tissue) reside. Alternatively, nerve or tissue locating technologies can be used. In the case of peripheral nerves, electrical stimulation or ultrasound can be used to locate target nerves for treatment. Electrical nerve stimulation can identify the nerve upon stimulation and either innervated muscle twitch in the case of a motor nerve or altered sensation in a specific area in the case of a sensory nerve. Ultrasound is used to visualize the nerve and structures closely associated with the nerve (e.g. vessels) to assist in placing the cryoprobe in close proximity to the target nerve. By positioning the patient's skeletal structure in a predetermined position (e.g. knee bent 30 degrees or fully extended), one can reliably position the bones, ligaments, cartilage, muscle, soft tissues (including fascia), vasculature, and peripheral nerves. External palpation can then be used to locate the skeletal structure and thereby locate the pathway and relative depth of a peripheral nerve targeted for treatment.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0150]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0159" num="0150">A treatment of peripheral nerve tissue to at least −20° C. is sufficient to trigger 2nd degree Wallerian degeneration of the axon and mylinated sheath. Conduction along the nerve fibers is stopped immediately following treatment. This provides immediate feedback as to the location of the target peripheral nerve or associated branches when the associated motion or sensation is modified. This can be used to refine rigid landmark guidance of future treatments or to determine whether addition treatment is warranted.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0151]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0160" num="0151">By using rigid landmarks, one may be able to direct the treatment pattern to specific anatomical sites where the peripheral nerve is located with the highest likelihood. Feedback from the patient immediately after each treatment may verify the location of the target peripheral nerve and its associated branches. Thus, it should be understood that in some embodiments, the use of an electronic nerve stimulation device to discover nerve location is not needed or used, since well-developed treatment zones can locate target nerves. This may be advantageous, due the cost and complexity of electronic nerve stimulation devices, which are also not always readily available.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0152]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0161" num="0152">In alternative embodiments of the invention, one could use an electronic nerve stimulation device (either transcutaneous or percutaneous) to stimulate the target peripheral nerve and its branches. With transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) the pathway of the nerve branch can be mapped in an X-Y coordinates coincident with the skin surface. The Z coordinate corresponding to depth normal to the skin surface can be inferred by the sensitivity setting of the electrical stimulation unit. For example, a setting of 3.25 mA and pulse duration of 0.1 ms may reliably stimulate the frontal branch of the temporal nerve when it is within 7 mm of the skin surface. If a higher current setting or longer pulse duration is required to stimulate the nerve, then the depth may be &gt;7 mm. A percutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (PENS) can also be used to locate a target peripheral nerve. Based on rigid anatomical landmarks, a PENS needle can be introduced through the dermis and advanced into the soft tissues. Periodic stimulating pulses at a rate of 1-3 Hz may be used to stimulate nerves within a known distance from the PENS needle. When the target nerve is stimulated, the sensitivity of the PENS can be reduced (e.g. lowering the current setting or pulse duration) narrowing the range of stimulation. When the nerve is stimulated again, now within a smaller distance, the PENS sensitivity can be reduced further until the nerve stimulation distance is within the therapy zone dimensions. At this point, the PENS needle can be replaced with the focused cold therapy needle(s) and a treatment can be delivered. The PENS and focused cold therapy needles can be introduced by themselves or through a second larger gage needle or cannula. This may provide a rigid and reproducible path when introducing a needle and when replacing one needle instrument with another. A rigid pathway may guide the needle to the same location by preventing needle tip deflection, which could lead to a misplaced therapy and lack of efficacy.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0153]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0162" num="0153">While many of the examples disclosed herein related to puncturing the skin in a transverse manner to arrive at a target sensory nerve, other techniques can be used to guide a device to a target sensory nerve. For example, insertion of devices can be made parallel to the surface of the skin, such that the (blunted) tip of the device glides along a particular fascia to arrive at a target sensory nerve. Such techniques and devices are disclosed in U.S. Pub. No. 2012/0089211, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference. Possible advantages may include a single insertion site, and guidance of a blunt tip along a layer common with the path or depth of the target nerve. This technique may be a position-treatment—thaw, reposition treatment, thaw, etc.</div>
