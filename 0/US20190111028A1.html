<li> <para-num num="[0050]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0057" num="0050">The amount of pharmaceutical compositions administered will firstly be dependent on the mammal being treated. In the instances where pharmaceutical compositions are administered to a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician with the dosage generally varying according to the age, sex, diet, weight, general health and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, the precise indication or condition being treated, the severity of the indication or condition being treated, time of administration, route of administration, the disposition of the composition, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the discretion of the prescribing physician. Also, the route of administration vary depending on the condition and its severity. The pharmaceutical composition is, in some embodiments, in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. For convenience, in some embodiments, the total daily dosage is divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. The amount and frequency of administration will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician physician considering such factors as described above. Thus the amount of pharmaceutical composition to be administered is variable depending upon the circumstances. Administration occurs in an amount of between about 0.001 mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day (administered in single or divided doses), or at least about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight per day. A particular therapeutic dosage includes, in some embodiments, from about 0.01 mg to about 7000 mg of compound, or, from about 0.05 mg to about 2500 mg. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation is, in some embodiments, varied or adjusted from about 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, from about 1 mg to 300 mg, or 10 mg to 200 mg, according to the particular application. In some instances the particular therapeutic dosage is about 200 mg, about 300 mg, about 400 mg, about 500 mg, about 600 mg, about 700 mg or about 800 mg. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range are more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses are employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day. In combinational applications in which the compound is not the sole therapy, it is possible to administer lesser amounts of compound and still have therapeutic or prophylactic effect.</div>

This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient. For example, the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered first, especially if it is a cytotoxic agent, and then the treatment continued with the administration of the compounds, compound forms and compositions as described herein followed, where determined advantageous, by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent, and so on until the treatment protocol is complete. Thus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician can modify each administration protocol for treatment according to the individual patient's needs, as the treatment proceeds. The attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the patient as well as more definite signs such as relief of disease-related symptoms.

In certain instances, hyperuricemia is characterized by higher than normal blood levels of uric acid, sustained over long periods of time. In certain instances, increased blood urate levels may be due to enhanced uric acid production (˜10-20%) and/or reduced renal excretion (˜80-90%) of uric acid. In certain instances, causes of hyperuricemia may include obesity/weight gain, excessive alcohol use, excessive dietary purine intake (foods such as shellfish, fish roe, scallops, peas lentils, beans and red meat, particularly offal—brains, kidneys, tripe, liver), certain medications, including low-dose aspirin, diuretics, niacin, cyclosporine, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, some high blood pressure drugs and some cancer chemotherapeutics, immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents, specific disease states, particularly those associated with a high cell turnover rate (such as malignancy, leukemia, lymphoma or psoriasis), and also including high blood pressure, hemoglobin diseases, hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia, various nephropathies, myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative diseases, hyperparathyroidism, renal disease, conditions associated with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, and in transplant recipients, and possibly heart disease, inherited enzyme defects, abnormal kidney function (e.g. increased ATP turn over, reduced glomerular urate filtration) and exposure to lead (plumbism or “saturnine gout”).</div>

It is often related to an inherited abnormality in the body's ability to process uric acid, but may also be exacerbated by a purine rich diet. Defective uric acid processing may lead to elevated levels of uric acid in the blood causing recurring attacks of joint inflammation (arthritis), uric acid deposits in and around the joints, tophaceous gout, the formation of tophi, decreased kidney function, and kidney stones. Approximately 3-5 million people in the United States suffer from attacks of gout with attacks more prevalent in men than in women. In certain instances, gout is one of the most common forms of arthritis, accounting for approximately 5% of all arthritis cases. In certain instances, kidney failure and urolithiasis occur in 10-18% of individuals with gout and are common sources of morbidity and mortality from the disease.</div>

In certain instances, individuals suffering from gout excrete approximately 40% less uric acid than non-gouty individuals for any given plasma urate concentration. In certain instances, urate levels increase until the saturation point is reached. In certain instances, precipitation of urate crystals occurs when the saturation point is reached. In certain instances, these hardened, crystallized deposits (tophi) form in the joints and skin, causing joint inflammation (arthritis). In certain instances, deposits are be made in the joint fluid (synovial fluid) and/or joint lining (synovial lining). Common areas for these deposits are the large toe, feet, ankles and hands (less common areas include the ears and eyes). In certain instances, the skin around an affected joint becomes red and shiny with the affected area being tender and painful to touch. In certain instances, gout attacks increase in frequency. In certain instances, untreated acute gout attacks lead to permanent joint damage and disability. In certain instances, tissue deposition of urate leads to: acute inflammatory arthritis, chronic arthritis, deposition of urate crystals in renal parenchyma and urolithiasis. In certain instances, the incidence of gouty arthritis increases 5 fold in individuals with serum urate levels of 7 to 8.9 mg/dL and up to 50 fold in individuals with levels &gt;9 mg/dL (530 μmol/L). In certain instances, individuals with gout develop renal insufficiency and end stage renal disease (i.e., “gouty nephropathy”). In certain instances, gouty nephropathy is characterized by a chronic interstitial nephropathy, which is promoted by medullary deposition of monosodium urate.</div>

In certain instances, more than 50% of individuals suffering from lead nephropathy suffer from gout. In certain instances, acute attacks of saturnine gout occur in the knee more frequently than the big toe. In certain instances, renal disease is more frequent and more severe in saturnine gout than in primary gout. In certain instances, treatment consists of excluding the individual from further exposure to lead, the use of chelating agents to remove lead, and control of acute gouty arthritis and hyperuricemia. In certain instances, saturnine gout is characterized by less frequent attacks than primary gout.

In certain instances, LNS is caused by a genetic deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). In certain instances, LNS is an X-linked recessive disease. In certain instances, LNS is present at birth in baby boys. In certain instances, the disease leads to severe gout, poor muscle control, and moderate mental retardation, which appear in the first year of life. In certain instances, the disease also results in self-mutilating behaviors (e.g., lip and finger biting, head banging) beginning in the second year of life. In certain instances, the disease also results in gout-like swelling in the joints and severe kidney problems. In certain instances, the disease leads neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in Huntington's disease. The prognosis for individuals with LNS is poor. In certain instances, the life expectancy of an untreated individual with LNS is less than about 5 years.

In certain instances, it is metabolized to the corresponding xanthine analogue, alloxanthine (oxypurinol), which is also an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. In certain instances, alloxanthine, though more potent in inhibiting xanthine oxidase, is less pharmaceutically acceptable due to low oral bioavailability. In certain instances, fatal reactions due to hypersensitivity, bone marrow suppression, hepatitis, and vasculitis have been reported with Allopurinol. In certain instances, the incidence of side effects may total 20% of all individuals treated with the drug. Treatment for diseases of uric acid metabolism has not evolved significantly in the following two decades since the introduction of allopurinol.</div>

In certain instances, 25-50% of individuals treated with probenecid fail to achieve reduction of serum uric acid levels &lt;6 mg/dL. In certain instances, insensitivity to probenecid results from drug intolerance, concomitant salicylate ingestion, and renal impairment.

Initiation of treatment depends upon the underlying causes of hyperuricemia, such as renal function, diet, and medications. While gout is a treatable condition, there are limited treatments available for managing acute and chronic gout and a number of adverse effects are associated with current therapies. Medication treatment of gout includes pain management, prevention or decrease in joint inflammation during an acute gouty attack, and chronic long-term therapy to maintain decreased serum uric acid levels.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0081]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0089" num="0081">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective anti-inflammatory medications for acute gout but are frequently associated with irritation of the gastrointestinal (GI) system, ulceration of the stomach and intestines, and occasionally intestinal bleeding. Colchicine for acute gout is most commonly administered orally as tablets (every 1-2 hours until there is significant improvement in pain or the patient develops GI side effects such as severe diarrhea, nausea and vomiting), or intravenously. Corticosteroids, given in short courses, can be administered orally or injected directly into the inflamed joint.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0082]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0090" num="0082">Medications are available for reducing blood uric acid levels that either increase renal excretion of uric acid by inhibiting re-uptake or reduce production of uric acid by blockade of xanthine oxidase. These medicines are generally not initiated until after the inflammation from acute gouty arthritis has subsided because they may intensify the attack. If they are already being taken prior to the attack, they are continued and only adjusted after the attack has resolved. Since many subjects with elevated blood uric acid levels may not develop gouty attacks or kidney stones, the decision for prolonged treatment with uric acid-lowering medications is individualized.</div>

A portion of the solvent (˜200 mL) was removed under low vacuum and fresh ethyl acetate (200 mL) was added, followed by another distillation cycle, during which crystallization began. The temperature of the water bath was slowly increased to 70° C., during which time four additional ethyl acetate addition/distillation cycles were carried out to a final volume of ˜200 mL. The mixture was allowed to cool slowly to room temperature and then placed in the fridge overnight.

An incident x-ray beam was produced using a CuKα (λ=1.5418 Å) anode (tube voltage=40 kV, current=40 mA), made parallel with a 1.0 mm primary Soller slit on the source side and 1.0 mm secondary Soller slit on the detector side. CuKβ radiation was removed with a graphite monochromator slit of 1.0 mm on the detector side. A scintillation detector (NaI) was used with slit of 0.1 mm. A continuous scan of 0.02°2θ step size and 5s per step from 2-50°2θ was used. Approximately 25 mg of material was carefully pressed onto a Si zero background wafer to ensure a flat preparation. Data were collected using Bruker Diffrac<sup>plus </sup>XRD Commander v2.3 software. Peak lists were generated using Bruker Diffrac<sup>plus </sup>EVA v9.0 software with background subtraction and Kα2 stripping. The instrument alignment check was done with a NIST alumina standard SRM1976. XRPD (Bruker D8 Advance) instrument conditions are summarized in the table below:</div>
