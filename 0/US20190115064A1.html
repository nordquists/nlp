<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Memory devices are typically provided as internal, semiconductor, integrated circuits in computers or other electronic systems. There are many different types of memory including volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory can require power to maintain its data (e.g., host data, error data, etc.) and includes random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static random access memory (SRAM), synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM), and thyristor random access memory (TRAM), among others. Non-volatile memory can provide persistent data by retaining stored data when not powered and can include NAND flash memory, NOR flash memory, and resistance variable memory such as phase change random access memory (PCRAM), resistive random access memory (RRAM), and magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), such as spin torque transfer random access memory (STT RAM), among others.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Electronic systems often include a number of processing resources (e.g., one or more processors), which may retrieve and execute instructions and store the results of the executed instructions to a suitable location. A processor can comprise a number of functional units such as arithmetic logic unit (ALU) circuitry, floating point unit (FPU) circuitry, and/or a combinatorial logic block (referred to herein as functional unit circuitry (FUC)), for example, which can be used to execute instructions by performing logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR logical operations on data (e.g., one or more operands). For example, the FUC may be used to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or division on operands.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">A number of components in an electronic system may be involved in providing instructions to the FUC for execution. The instructions may be generated, for instance, by a processing resource such as a controller and/or host processor. Data (e.g., the operands on which the instructions will be executed) may be stored in a memory array that is accessible by the FUC. The instructions and/or data may be retrieved from the memory array and sequenced and/or buffered before the FUC begins to execute instructions on the data. Furthermore, as different types of operations may be executed in one or multiple clock cycles through the FUC, intermediate results of the instructions and/or data may also be sequenced and/or buffered.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In various instances, it can be beneficial to perform exclusive OR (XOR) operations on data. For instance, XOR operations can be used in association with error detection and/or correction (e.g., in association with parity value calculations) and/or in association with performing arithmetic and other operations on operands. However, performing XOR operations on operands stored as data values in an array of memory cells typically involves transferring the data out of the array (e.g., to FUC via input/output (I/O) lines), which can involve enabling decode signal lines in association with a data line address access, for instance. Furthermore, depending on the amount of data (e.g., number of bits) being “XORed,” and/or on the capacity of the FUC being used, transferring the data from the array via I/O lines to perform the XOR operation(s) can involve increased time and/or power as compared to performing the operation(s) without transferring the data out of the array.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">The present disclosure includes apparatuses and methods for performing an exclusive OR (XOR) operation using sensing circuitry. An example method can include performing a number of operations using sensing circuitry to perform an XOR operation on data stored in a number of memory cells. The number of operations can include a NAND operation, an OR operation, an AND operation, and/or an invert operation. The number of operations can be performed without transferring data from the memory array via an input/output (I/O) line.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">As will be described further herein, in a number of embodiments, the XOR operation can be performed without transferring data from a memory array via an input/output (I/O) line (e.g., a local I/O line). For instance, sensing circuitry (e.g., sensing circuitry described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>) can be operated to perform a number of logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NAND, NOR, NOT) in association with data stored in the array without transferring data via a sense line address access (e.g., without firing a column decode signal). Performing such logical operations using sensing circuitry, rather than with processing resources external to the sensing circuitry (e.g., by a processor associated with a host and/or other processing circuitry, such as ALU circuitry) can provide benefits such as reducing system power consumption, among other benefits.</div>

In a number of embodiments, the result of an XOR performed on data values stored in memory cells of respective sense lines can be determined by performing a number of operations without transferring data out of the array via an I/O line. As an example, an XOR value can be determined for the data stored in memory cells <b>203</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>203</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>203</b>-<b>3</b> by performing an XOR on the data values stored in those memory cells (e.g., bit values “1,” “1,” and “0”, respectively).

A second XOR operation can be performed on the result of the first XOR operation (e.g., bit value “0”) and a data value stored in memory cell <b>203</b>-<b>3</b> (e.g., bit value “0”). The second XOR operation (on bit values “0” and “0”) results in a bit value of “0” (e.g., “0” XOR “0” is “0”).

As described further below, in a number of embodiments of the present disclosure, XOR operations can be performed without transferring data out of the array via an I/O line (e.g., without transferring data via a sense line address access). In a number of embodiments, performing an XOR operation on a pair of data values comprises performing a NAND operation on the pair of data values, performing an OR operation on the pair of data values, and then performing an AND operation on the NAND resultant value and the OR resultant value.</div>

By substituting operation of the ANDinv control signal for operation of the AND control signal, and/or substituting operation of the ORinv control signal for operation of the OR control signal in the AND and OR operations described above, the logical operations can be changed from {Row X AND Row Y} to {˜Row X AND Row Y} (where “˜Row X” indicates an opposite of the Row X data value, e.g., NOT Row X) and can be changed from {Row X OR Row Y} to {˜Row X OR Row Y}. For example, during an AND operation involving the inverted data values, the ANDinv control signal can be asserted instead of the AND control signal, and during an OR operation involving the inverted data values, the ORInv control signal can be asserted instead of the OR control signal. Activating the ORinv control signal causes transistor <b>714</b>-<b>1</b> to conduct and activating the ANDinv control signal causes transistor <b>714</b>-<b>2</b> to conduct. In each case, asserting the appropriate inverted control signal can flip the sense amplifier and cause the result initially stored in the sense amplifier <b>706</b> to be that of the AND operation using inverted Row X and true Row Y data values or that of the OR operation using the inverted Row X and true Row Y data values. A true or compliment version of one data value can be used in the accumulator to perform the logical operation (e.g., AND, OR), for example, by loading a data value to be inverted first and a data value that is not to be inverted second.</div>

The advantage of the apparatuses and methods described herein is not realized in terms of single instruction speed, but rather the cumulative speed that can be achieved by an entire bank of data being computed in parallel without ever transferring data out of the memory array (e.g., DRAM) or firing a column decode. In other words, data transfer time can be eliminated.

An apparatus and/or methods according to the present disclosure can also use less energy/area than configurations where the CPU is discrete from the memory. Furthermore, an apparatus and/or methods of the present disclosure can improve upon the smaller energy/area advantages since the in-memory-array logical operations save energy by eliminating certain data value transfers.</div>
