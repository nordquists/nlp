<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to devices and methods for contactless dielectrophoresis (DEP) for manipulation of cells or particles. The devices and methods of the present invention provide for the application of DEP in which electrodes are not in direct contact with the subject sample.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Isolation and enrichment of cells/micro-particles from a biological sample is one of the first crucial processes in many biomedical and homeland security applications [1]. Water quality analysis to detect viable pathogenic bacterium [2-6] and the isolation of rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for early cancer detection [7-19] are important examples of the applications of this process. Conventional methods of cell concentration and separation include centrifugation, filtration, fluorescence activated cell sorting, or optical tweezers. Each of these techniques relies on different cell properties for separation and has intrinsic advantages and disadvantages. For instance, many of the known techniques require the labeling or tagging of cells in order to obtain separation. These more sensitive techniques may require prior knowledge of cell-specific markers and antibodies to prepare target cells for analysis.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is the motion of a particle in a suspending medium due to the presence of a non-uniform electric field [28, 29]. DEP utilizes the electrical properties of the cell/particle for separation and identification [29, 30]. The physical and electrical properties of the cell, the conductivity and permittivity of the media, as well as the gradient of the electric field and its applied frequency are substantial parameters determining a cell's DEP response.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The application of dielectrophoresis to separate target cells from a solution has been studied extensively in the last two decades. Examples of the successful use of dielectrophoresis include the separation of human leukemia cells from red blood cells in an isotonic solution [7], entrapment of human breast cancer cells from blood [8], and separation of U937 human monocytic from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [9]. DEP has also been used to separate neuroblastoma cells from HTB glioma cells [9], isolate cervical carcinoma cells [10], isolate K562 human CML cells [11], separate live yeast cells from dead [12], and segregate different human tumor cells [13]. Unfortunately, the microelectrode-based devices used in these experiments are susceptible to electrode fouling and require complicated fabrication procedures [33, 34].</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) has also been employed to concentrate and separate live and dead bacteria for water analysis[2]. In this method, electrodes inserted into a microfluidic channel create an electric field which is distorted by the presence of insulating structures. The devices can be manufactured using simple fabrication techniques and can be mass-produced inexpensively through injection molding or hot embossing[35, 36]. iDEP provides an excellent solution to the complex fabrication required by traditional DEP devices however, it is difficult to utilize for biological fluids which are highly conductive. The challenges that arise include joule heating and bubble formation[37]. In order to mitigate these effects, oftentimes the electrodes are placed in large reservoirs at the channel inlet and outlet. Without an additional channel for the concentrated sample[36], this could re-dilute the sample after it has passed through a concentration region.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">While many have had success designing and fabricating different DEP and iDEP microdevices to manipulate particles in biological fluids, there are some potential drawbacks of these techniques. The traditional DEP technique suffers from fouling, contamination, bubble formation near integrated electrodes, low throughput, and an expensive and complicated fabrication process [33, 34]. The insulating obstacles employed by iDEP are meant to address these shortcomings and are less susceptible to fouling than integrated electrodes [38]. The iDEP fabrication process is also much less complicated; the insulating obstacles can be patterned while etching the microchannel in one step. This technique has the added benefit of making the process more economical in that mass fabrication can be facilitated through the use of injection molding. Unfortunately, one of the primary drawbacks of an iDEP system is the presence of a high electric field intensity within the highly conductive biological fluid inside the microchannel [33, 39]. The relatively high electrical current flow in this situation causes joule heating and a dramatic temperature increase. The ideal technique would combine the simple fabrication process of iDEP and resistance to fouling with the reduced susceptibility to joule heating of DEP while preserving the cell manipulation abilities of both methods.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0056]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0057" num="0056">The present invention provides methods, devices, and systems to manipulate micro-particles suspended in biological fluids using their electrical signatures without direct contact between the electrodes and the sample. Contactless dielectrophoresis (cDEP) employs the simplified fabrication processes of iDEP yet lacks the problems associated with the electrode-sample contact [40].</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0057]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0058" num="0057">cDEP relies upon reservoirs filled with highly conductive fluid to act as electrodes and provide the necessary electric field. These reservoirs are placed adjacent to the main microfluidic channel and are separated from the sample by a thin barrier of a dielectric material. The application of a high-frequency electric field to the electrode reservoirs causes their capacitive coupling to the main channel and an electric field is induced across the sample fluid.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0058]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0059" num="0058">Similar to traditional DEP, cDEP may exploit the varying geometry of the electrodes to create spatial non-uniformities in the electric field. However, by utilizing reservoirs filled with a highly conductive solution, rather than a separate thin film array, the electrode structures employed by cDEP can be fabricated in the same step as the rest of the device; hence the process is conducive to mass production [40]. The various embodiments of the present invention provide devices and methods for performing cDEP, as well as methods for fabricating cDEP devices.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0059]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0060" num="0059">In general, the present invention provides devices and methods that allow cell sorting to identify, isolate or otherwise enrich cells of interest based on electrical and physical properties. An electric field is induced in a main sorting microchannel using electrodes inserted in a highly conductive solution which is isolated from the microchannel by thin insulating barriers. The insulating barriers exhibit a capacitive behavior and an electric field is produced in the isolated microchannel by applying an AC electric field. Electrodes do not come into contact with the sample fluid inside the microchannel, so that electrolysis, bubble formation, fouling and contamination is reduced or eliminated. In addition, the electric field is focused in a confined region and has a much lower intensity than that found in traditional insulator-based dielectrophoresis, so heating within the sample channel is negligible and the likelihood of cell lysis is greatly reduced. The system can also be used for characterizing and sorting micro- or nanoparticles.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0061]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method to induce DEP to manipulate cells or micro/nano particles without direct physical contact between the electrodes and the sample solution with a simplified and inexpensive micro-fabrication process. Further examples of manipulation of cells and micro/nano particles are given below.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0062]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0063" num="0062">In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method to induce an electric ac field without direct physical contact between the electrodes and the sample solution with a simplified and inexpensive micro-fabrication process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0063]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0064" num="0063">In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method whereby cDEP can be used to measure the current through a system and measure the electrical resistance/impedance of a system for detection purposes. cDEP electrodes can be placed on an object to deliver a known amount of electrical current though the object. By measuring the electric potential at different places on the object, the electrical impedance of the object can be calculated. In this embodiment, the electrical impedance may be measured so that it is possible to determine when a certain number of particles are trapped or isolated. Once the requisite number of particles are trapped, e.g. the number required for downstream analysis, the impedance will reach a pre-set level and the current can be turned off, allowing the particles to be released.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0064]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0065" num="0064">In another embodiment of the present invention, cDEP can be used as a non-invasive method to monitor living animal cells in vitro. The cells are grown on an insulating thin barrier. The electrode channels are under this thin barrier. The impedance of the cultured cells on the insulating barrier is measured at one specific frequency as a function of time. Because of the insulating properties of the cell membrane, the impedance of the system increases with increasing the number of cells on the surface. The 3D geometrical changes of layered cells on the surface can be monitored because the current through the layers of cells and around the cells changes due to the shape change of the cells.</div>

As a non-limiting example, once the particles of interest are captured in a device, the inlet solution may be change to a solution different from that of the sample, for example a buffer. The particles may be released into the buffer. As a non-limiting example, cancer cells may be concentrated from a blood sample in the device. The inlet solution may then be changed to a suitable buffer, allowing the cancer cells to be purified and concentrated from blood and suspended in the buffer.</div>

Current enrichment techniques for sample preparation include density gradient based centrifugation or membrane filtration (57), fluorescent and magnetic activated cell sorting (F/MACS) (61), cell surface markers (55), and laser tweezers (49). Each of these techniques relies on different cell properties for separation and has intrinsic advantages and disadvantages. Typically more sensitive techniques may require prior knowledge of cell-specific markers and antibodies to prepare target cells for analysis.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0131]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0132" num="0131">One alternative to these methods is dielectrophoresis (DEP) which is the motion of a particle due to its polarization in the presence of a non-uniform electric field (28,29). Currently, typical dielectrophoretic devices employ an array of thin-film interdigitated electrodes placed within the flow of a channel to generate a non-uniform electric field that interacts with particles near the surface of the electrode array (63). Such platforms have shown that DEP is an effective means to concentrate and differentiate cells rapidly and reversibly based on their size, shape, and intrinsic electrical properties such as conductivity and polarizability. These intrinsic properties arise due to the membrane compositional and electrostatic characteristics, internal cellular structure, and the type of nucleus (56) associated with each type of cell.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0132]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0133" num="0132">The application of dielectrophoresis to separate target cells from a solution has been studied extensively in the last two decades. Examples of the successful use of dielectrophoresis include the separation of human leukemia cells from red blood cells in an isotonic solution (7), entrapment of human breast cancer cells from blood (8), and separation of U937 human monocytic from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (9). DEP has also been used to separate neuroblastoma cells from HTB glioma cells (9), isolate cervical carcinoma cells (10), isolate K562 human CML cells (11), separate live yeast cells from dead (12), and segregate different human tumor cells (13). Unfortunately, the microelectrode-based devices used in these experiments are susceptible to electrode fouling and require complicated fabrication procedures (33,34).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0133]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0134" num="0133">Insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) is a practical method to obtain the selectivity of dielectrophoresis while overcoming the robustness issues associated with traditional dielectrophoresis platforms. iDEP relies on insulating obstacles rather than the geometry of the electrodes to produce spatial non-uniformities in the electric field. The basic concept of the iDEP technique was first presented by Masuda et al. (60). Others have previously demonstrated with glass insulating structures and AC electric fields that iDEP can separate DNA molecules, bacteria, and hematapoietic cells (64). It has been shown that polymer-based iDEP devices are effective for selective trapping of a range of biological particles in an aqueous sample (51). The patterned electrodes at the bottom of the channel in DEP create the gradient of the electric field near the electrodes such that the cells close enough to the bottom of the channel can be manipulated. However, the insulator structures in iDEP that usually transverse the entire depth of the channel provide non uniform electric field over the entire depth of the channel. iDEP technology has also shown the potential for water quality monitoring (35), separating and concentrating prokaryotic cells and viruses (58), concentration and separation of live and dead bacteria (2), sample concentration followed by impedance detection (36), and manipulation of protein particles (59).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0134]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0135" num="0134">While many have had success designing and fabricating different DEP and iDEP microdevices to manipulate particles in biological fluids, there are some potential drawbacks of these techniques. The traditional DEP technique suffers from fouling, contamination, bubble formation near integrated electrodes, low throughput, and an expensive and complicated fabrication process (33,34). The insulating obstacles employed by iDEP are meant to address these shortcomings and are less susceptible to fouling than integrated electrodes (38). iDEP's fabrication process is also much less complicated; the insulating obstacles can be patterned while etching the microchannel in one step. This technique has the added benefit of making the process more economical in that mass fabrication can be facilitated through the use of injection molding.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0135]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0136" num="0135">Unfortunately, one of the primary drawbacks of an iDEP system is the presence of a high electric field intensity within the highly conductive biological fluid inside the microchannel (33, 39). The relatively high electrical current flow in this situation causes joule heating and a dramatic temperature increase. The ideal technique would combine iDEP's simple fabrication process and resistance to fouling with DEP's reduced susceptibility to joule heating all-the-while preserving the cell manipulation abilities of both methods.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0136]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0137" num="0136">The inventors have developed an alternative method to provide the spatially non-uniform electric field required for DEP in which electrodes are not in direct contact with the biological sample. The absence of contact between electrodes and the sample fluid inside the channel prevents bubble formation and mitigates fouling. It is also important to note that without direct contact between the electrodes and the sample fluid, any contaminating effects of this interaction can be avoided. In fact, the only material in contact with the sample fluid is the substrate material the device is patterned on. In the present method, an electric field is created in the microchannel using electrodes inserted in a highly conductive solution which is isolated from the main channel by thin insulating barriers. These insulating barriers exhibit a capacitive behavior and therefore an electric field can be produced in the main channel by applying an AC electric field across them. Furthermore, non-uniformity of the electric field distribution inside the main channel is provided by the geometry of insulating structures both outside and inside the channel.</div>

Modeling of the non-uniform electric field distribution in the device was accomplished through an equivalent electronic circuit and finite element analysis of the microfluidic device. The effects of different parameters such as total applied voltage, applied frequency, and the electrical conductivity of the fluid inside and outside of the main channel on the resulting DEP response were simulated and then observed through experimentation. A DEP response was observed primarily as a change in cell trajectory or velocity as it traveled through the device. Further evidence of this DEP response to the non-uniform electric field is provided by the electrorotation of cells, and their aggregation in “pearl chain” formations.</div>

The method relies on the application of a high-frequency AC electric signal to electrodes that are capacitively coupled to a microfluidic channel. In the subject device, the geometry of the electrodes and channels create the spatial non-uniformities in the electric field required for DEP. Three separate DEP responses were observed in the device, namely, translational velocity, rotational velocity, and chaining. In order to observe the devices effects in these three categories, three different cell lines were inserted into the devices and their individual responses recorded. Each cell line exhibited a response unique to its type due to the cell's specific electrical properties. This result highlights the ability of this technique to differentiate cells by their intrinsic electrical properties.</div>

Because the induced electric field is not as intense as comparable methods and is focused just at the trapping zone, it is theorized that the Joule heating within the main microfluidic channel is negligible. This could mitigate the stability and robustness issues encountered with conventional iDEP (39), due the conductivity distribution's strong dependence on temperature. Furthermore, challenges associated with cell lysing due to high temperatures (37) or irreversible electroporation due to high field strengths (50, 65) are overcome with the new design approaches disclosed herein.</div>

Water quality analysis to detect viable pathogenic bacterium (2-6) and the isolation of rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for early cancer detection (7-19) are important examples of the applications of this process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0193]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0208" num="0193">Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is the motion of a particle in a suspending medium due to the presence of a non-uniform electric field (28, 29). DEP utilizes the electrical properties of the cell/particle for separation and identification (29, 66). The physical and electrical properties of the cell, the conductivity and permittivity of the media, as well as the gradient of the electric field and its applied frequency are substantial parameters determining a cell's DEP response.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0194]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0209" num="0194">One unique advantage of DEP over existing methods for cell separation is that the DEP force is strongly dependent on cell viability. The cell membrane, which is normally impermeable and highly insulating, typically becomes permeable after cell death (31). This results in the release of ions from the cytoplasm through the structural defects in the dead cell membrane and the cell conductivity will increase dramatically (32). This alteration in electrical properties after cell death make DEP live/dead cell separation and isolation possible.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0195]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0210" num="0195">The utilization of DEP to manipulate live and dead cells has previously been demonstrated through several approaches. To start, Suehiro et al. were able to utilize dielectrophoretic impedance measurements to selectively detect viable bacteria (67). Conventional interdigitated electrode DEP micro devices have also been used to separate live and heat-treated Listeria cells (68). Huang et al. investigated the difference in the AC electrodynamics of viable and non-viable yeast cells through DEP and electrorotation experiments (69) and a DEP-based microfluidic device for the selective retention of viable cells in culture media with high conductivity was proposed by Docoslis et al. (70).</div>

In this method, electrodes inserted into a microfluidic channel create an electric field which is distorted by the presence of insulating structures. The devices can be manufactured using simple fabrication techniques and can be mass-produced inexpensively through injection molding or hot embossing (35, 36). iDEP provides an excellent solution to the complex fabrication required by traditional DEP devices however, it is difficult to utilize for biological fluids which are highly conductivity. The challenges that arise include joule heating and bubble formation (37). In order to mitigate these effects, oftentimes the electrodes are placed in large reservoirs at the channel inlet and outlet. Without an additional channel for the concentrated sample (36), this could re-dilute the sample after it has passed through a concentration region.</div>

This technique provides the non-uniform electric fields in microfluidic channels required for DEP cell manipulation without direct contact between the electrodes and the sample (40). In this method, an electric field is created in the sample microchannel using electrodes inserted into two conductive microchambers, which are separated from the sample channel by thin insulating barriers. These insulating barriers exhibit a capacitive behavior and therefore an electric field can be produced in the main channel by applying an AC field across the barriers (40).</div>

Similar to iDEP, cDEP lends itself to a much simpler fabrication procedure. Devices are typically molded from a reusable silicon master stamp that has been fabricated from a single mask lithographic process. Once the master stamp has been fabricated, cDEP devices can be produced from the stamp outside of the cleanroom environment, allowing for rapid, mass fabrication of cDEP microfluidic devices.</div>

Two cDEP microfluidic devices were designed and fabricated out of polydemethilsiloxane (PDMS) and glass using standard photolitography. The DEP response of the cells was investigated under various electrical experimental conditions in the range of the power supply limitations.

Silicon oxide was grown on the silicon master using thermal oxidation for four hours at 1000° C. and removed with HF solvent to reduce surface scalloping. Liquid phase polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was made by mixing the PDMS monomers and the curing agent in a 10:1 ratio (Sylgrad 184, Dow Corning, USA).

Local maximums in the gradient of the electric field occurred in line with the edges of the insulating pillars while the minimum gradient was experienced as cells passed through the region between two pillars.

At 0.02 mL/hour, trapping efficiencies greater than 90% were observed at all tested frequencies (200 kHz, 300 kHz, 400 kHz, and 500 kHz). However, lysing was seen at all frequencies when a voltage of 50 Vrms was applied.

However, there are minute regions at the sharp corners inside the main channel with a high electric field intensity (350V/cm) that induces electroporation (IRE), which is what was observed during the experiments.

Repeatability, high efficiency, sterility, and an inexpensive fabrication process are benefits inherent to cDEP over more conventional methods of cell separation. This method is also unique in that direct evaluation is possible with little or no sample preparation. The resulting time and material savings are invaluable in homeland security and biomedical applications.

Sensitive analysis procedures, especially those in the biomedical field, often require a concentration procedure before any analysis is performed. Several methods to perform this concentration have arisen including: density gradient based centrifugation or filtration [57], fluorescent and magnetic activated cell sorting, cell surface markers [55], and laser tweezers [79]. While, each of these techniques is unique in its inherent advantages and disadvantages, all are forced to compromise between high sample throughput and highly specific isolation. The more selective of these techniques oftentimes require extensive sample preparation before being performed. If the automation of laboratory analysis procedures is to be facilitated, a concentration technique capable of high sample throughput as well as highly specific concentration is critical.</div>

Typically, sample concentration through DEP involves the placement of an array of interdigitated electrodes under a microfluidic channel through which the sample fluid is passing. This electrode array creates a non-uniform electric field in the channel with which passing cells or micro-particles interact. DEP-based concentration techniques benefit from the fact that particles are isolated based upon their physical characteristics; allowing these techniques to be extremely specific without extensive sample preparation.</div>

Examples of the successful use of DEP include the separation of human leukemia cells from red blood cells in an isotonic solution [7] and the entrapment of human breast cancer cells from blood [8]. DEP has additionally been found effective to separate neuroblastoma cells from HTB glioma cells [9], isolate cervical carcinoma cells [10], K562 human CML cells [11], and to separate live yeast cells from dead [12].</div>

Insulator-based Dielectrophoresis (iDEP) seeks to simplify the fabrication required to perform DEP-based concentration in order to facilitate more widespread usage. iDEP relies upon the presence of insulating structures in the microfluidic channel to create non-uniformities in the electric field necessary for DEP [38, 51]. These insulating structures are typically patterned in the same process as the microfluidic channel itself; thus, iDEP naturally lends itself to mass production systems such as injection molding and hot embossing [35]. iDEP has been demonstrated in combination with other forms of on-chip analysis, such as impedance detection [36], to faun fully integrated systems.</div>

The high electric field intensity employed by iDEP produces undesirable results such as joule heating, bubble formation, and electrochemical effects when the sample solution is of high conductivity [37]. In addition, the electrode placement at the channel inlet and outlet necessitates the presence of large reservoirs at these locations to mitigate electrolysis effects. These reservoirs have the negative consequence of re-diluting the sample after it has passed through the region of concentration, further complicating the extraction of a sample for off-chip analysis. For DEP to truly represent an attractive alternative to traditional sample concentration techniques, it must be devoid of these negative influences upon the sample and yet retain a simplified fabrication process.</div>

These reservoirs are placed adjacent to the main microfluidic channel and are separated from the sample by a thin barrier of a dielectric material as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>h. </i>The application of a high-frequency electric field to the electrode reservoirs causes their capacitive coupling to the main channel and an electric field is induced across the sample fluid Similar to traditional DEP, cDEP exploits the varying geometry of the electrodes to create spatial non-uniformities in the electric field. However, by utilizing reservoirs filled with a highly conductive solution, rather than a separate thin film array, the electrode structures employed by cDEP can be fabricated in the same step as the rest of the device; hence the process is conducive to mass production [80].</div>

A microfluidic device was fabricated by creating a PDMS mold of a silicon master produced by a single-mask photolithographic process. This device has shown the ability of cDEP to separate live cells from dead [47] a powerful capability of DEP systems[67-70, 81]. In order to demonstrate the concentration abilities of cDEP, this microfluidic device was used to enrich THP-1 human leukemia cells and 2-μm polystyrene beads from a background media. The device exhibited the ability to concentrate THP-1 cells through positive DEP and 2 μm beads via negative DEP. This is the first cDEP microfluidic device presenting negative DEP. Furthermore, the use of a silicon master stamp allows for the large-scale reproduction of the device. These experiments illustrate that the use of cDEP as an expedited process for sample concentration and enrichment, which may have an immense impact in biomedical and homeland security applications where rapid, accurate results are extremely valuable.</div>

Four different configurations with the same applied voltage and frequency were studied and the results shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. The DEP effects caused by having electrodes 1 and 2 charged and electrodes 3 and 4 grounded (case 1) are similar to the configuration with electrodes 1 and 4 charged and electrodes 2 and 3 grounded (case 3). The same can be said for the cases with electrodes 1, 2, and 4 charged (case 2) and electrode 3 grounded or electrode 1 charged and electrode 2 grounded (case 4). The surface plot of the gradient of the electric field with respect to these four cases of the electrode configurations were shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> <i>b. </i> </div>

A benefit of this analysis is that one may change the cell/particle manipulation strategy by changing the electrode configurations. For example, the configuration used in case 4 (electrodes on just one side of the main channel) can deflect the target cell/particle trajectory in the main channel such that it leads to a specific reservoir.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0267]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0309" num="0267">The validity of the numerical modeling was confirmed by demonstrating the system's ability to concentrate particles through both positive and negative DEP. Live THP-1 cells were observed to be trapped efficiently due to positive DEP force at V<sub>1</sub>=V<sub>2</sub>=70 Vrms at 300 kHz, V<sub>3</sub>=V<sub>4</sub>=Ground (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>). Particles parallel to the electric field attract each other due to dipole-dipole interaction, resulting in pearl-chain formations of the trapped cells in the direction of the electric field [29, 53, 66]. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36<i>b</i> </figref>, particles concentrated through positive DEP should show a predisposition to group at locations with a high gradient of the electric field, in this case at the edges of the electrode reservoirs. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, this is indeed the case. The pearl chain formations attach to the side wall at locations with a high gradient of the electric field and then spread towards the center of the channel.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0268]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0310" num="0268">The selectivity of the device to differentiate two different particles with almost the same size was also examined via separation of THP-1 cells from 10 μm beads. The THP-1 cells were observed to be trapped at 70 Vrms and 300 kHz and the 10 μm beads went through the main channel without significant DEP disturbance (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>). However, in order to increase the trapping efficiency, the voltage and/or frequency of the applied signal should be increased such that the particles passing through the middle of the channel experience strong DEP effect. At these higher voltage/frequencies that both cells and beads close to the channel walls were observed to be trapped, reducing the device's selectivity. This effect may be attributed to the non-uniform gradient of the electric field across the main channel and between the side channels.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0269]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0311" num="0269">Particle concentration through negative DEP was displayed using 2 μin beads suspended in DI water at V1=V2=190 V<sub>rms </sub>at 300 kHz and V3=V4=Ground. These experimental results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. As is consistent with a negative DEP response, the beads grouped in regions away from high gradients of the electric fields which, in this case, is in the centerline of the channel (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40<i>b </i>and <i>c</i> </figref>). The inability to focus the microscope on all of the trapped beads simultaneously indicates that the beads were trapped at multiple heights in the main channel.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0271]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0313" num="0271">The use of a straight channel in this design has several advantages over more complicated configurations. The trajectory of a particle, without DEP influence, is easily predicted and the lack of detailed features simplifies production and replication of the devices. This same lack of complicated features in the channel helps to mitigate fouling effects caused by cell trapping. However, it should be noted that the DEP effect may be reduced significantly at the middle of the channel for wider channels. One method of addressing this negative effect is to use insulating structures inside the main channel. These structures distort the electric field and provide a sufficient gradient for DEP manipulation of cells passing through the center of the channel. These types of designs may help increase the throughput and trapping efficiency of cDEP devices.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0272]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0314" num="0272">The device presented in this paper exhibited the concentration of microparticles at specific trapping regions within the device during the application of an electric field. The removal of this electric field allows the trapped cells to flow from the device at an increased concentration and these cells may be diverted to a separate reservoir off chip. This “trap and release” concentration strategy can also be incorporated with on-chip analysis systems by diverting the concentrated group of cells into a side channel as has been illustrated with iDEP[36].</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0273]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0315" num="0273">Forthcoming generations of cDEP devices may also utilize a “chip and manifold” configuration relying upon disposable, injection molded “chips” inserted into a reusable manifold containing the necessary fluidic and electrical connections. This arrangement would allow metal electrodes in the manifold to be re-used for thousands of experiments while shifting the manufacturing burden to the replication of inexpensive fluidic chips. This use of polymer chips manufactured through injection molding has been demonstrated previously for iDEP[36].</div>

Numerical modeling revealed the flexibility of this system's multiple electrode configurations to divert the particles into a desired trajectory and the device showed the ability to concentrate micro-particles through both positive and negative DEP. By relying upon the particle's electrical properties to accommodate enrichment, cDEP should be able to achieve a high degree of specificity without extensive sample preparation.</div>
