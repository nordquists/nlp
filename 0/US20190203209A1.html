<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The process of tissue repair as a part of wound healing involves two phases. The first phase is the regenerative phase, in which injured cells are replaced by cells of the same type. The second phase is the formation of fibrous tissues, also called fibroplasia or fibrosis, in which connective tissue replaces normal parenchymal tissues. The tissue repair process can become pathogenic if the fibrosis phase continues unchecked, leading to extensive tissue remodeling and the formation of permanent scar tissue (Wynn, <i>Nature Rev. Immunol. </i>4, 583 (2004)).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been estimated that up to 45% of deaths in the United States can be attributed to fibroproliferative diseases, which can affect many tissues and organ systems. (Wynn, supra, at 595 (2004)). Major organ fibrotic diseases include interstitial lung disease (ILD), characterized by pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. ILD is known to have a number of causes such as sarcoidosis, silicosis, collagen vascular diseases, and systemic scleroderma. However, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a common type of ILD, has no known cause. Other organ fibrotic disorders include liver cirrhosis, liver fibrosis resulting from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, kidney disease, heart disease, and eye diseases including macular degeneration and retinal and vitreal retinopathy. Fibroproliferative disorders also include systemic and local scleroderma, keloids and hypertrophic scars, atherosclerosis, and restenosis. Additional fibroproliferative diseases include excessive scarring resulting from surgery, chemotherapeutic drug-induced fibrosis, radiation-induced fibrosis, and injuries and burns (Wynn, supra, page 585).</div>

However, the mechanisms involved in regulation of fibrosis appear to be distinctive from those of inflammation, and anti-inflammatory therapies are not always effective in reducing or preventing fibrosis (Wynn, supra, page 591). Therefore, a need remains for developing treatments to reduce and prevent fibrosis and control fibrotic disorders.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides methods of modulating fibroblast accumulation and collagen deposition in a tissue by modulating the amount or activity of the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in the tissue. TSLP has been found to induce fibroblast accumulation and collagen deposition characteristic of fibrotic disorders in animals. In one aspect, the invention provides a method of increasing fibrosis in situations where this may be advantageous, by administering TSLP or TSLP agonists. In another aspect, the present invention provides methods and compositions for reducing or preventing fibrosis in a subject suffering from a fibrotic disorder by treating the subject with a therapeutically effective amount of at least one antagonist to TSLP.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">As used herein the term “fibroproliferative disease” or “fibrotic disease or disorder” refers to conditions involving fibrosis in one or more tissues. As used herein the term “fibrosis” refers to the formation of fibrous tissue as a reparative or reactive process, rather than as a normal constituent of an organ or tissue. Fibrosis is characterized by fibroblast accumulation and collagen deposition in excess of normal deposition in any particular tissue. As used herein the term “fibrosis” is used synonymously with “fibroblast accumulation and collagen deposition”. Fibroblasts are connective tissue cells, which are dispersed in connective tissue throughout the body. Fibroblasts secrete a nonrigid extracellular matrix containing type I and/or type III collagen. In response to an injury to a tissue, nearby fibroblasts migrate into the wound, proliferate, and produce large amounts of collagenous extracellular matrix. Collagen is a fibrous protein rich in glycine and proline that is a major component of the extracellular matrix and connective tissue, cartilage, and bone. Collagen molecules are triple-stranded helical structures called α-chains, which are wound around each other in a ropelike helix. Collagen exists in several forms or types; of these, type I, the most common, is found in skin, tendon, and bone; and type III is found in skin, blood vessels, and internal organs.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">Scleroderma is a fibrotic disorder characterized by a thickening and induration of the skin caused by the overproduction of new collagen by fibroblasts in skin and other organs. Scleroderma may occur as a local or systemic disease. Systemic scleroderma may affect a number of organs. Systemic sclerosis is characterized by formation of hyalinized and thickened collagenous fibrous tissue, with thickening of the skin and adhesion to underlying tissues, especially of the hands and face. The disease may also be characterized by dysphagia due to loss of peristalsis and submucosal fibrosis of the esophagus, dyspnea due to pulmonary fibrosis, myocardial fibrosis, and renal vascular changes. (Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 26<sup>th </sup>Edition, Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1995)). Pulmonary fibrosis affects 30 to 70% of scleroderma patients, often resulting in restrictive lung disease (Atamas et al. <i>Cytokine and Growth Factor Rev </i>14: 537-550 (2003)).</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) refers to a four α-helical bundle type I cytokine which is a member of the IL-2 family but most closely related to IL-7. Cytokines are low molecular weight regulatory proteins secreted in response to certain stimuli, which act on receptors on the membrane of target cells. Cytokines regulate a variety of cellular responses. Cytokines are generally described in references such as Cytokines, A. Mire-Sluis and R. Thorne, ed., Academic Press, New York, (1998).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">TSLP was originally cloned from a murine thymic stromal cell line (Sims et al <i>J. Exp. Med </i>192 (5), 671-680 (2000)), and found to support early B and T cell development. Human TSLP was later cloned and found to have a 43 percent identity in amino acid sequence to the murine homolog (Quentmeier et al. <i>Leukemia </i>15, 1286-1292 (2001), and U.S. Pat. No. 6,555,520, which is herein incorporated by reference). The polynucleotide and amino acid sequence of human TSLP are presented in SEQ ID NO: 1 and 2 respectively. TSLP was found to bind with low affinity to a receptor chain from the hematopoietin receptor family called TSLP receptor (TSLPR), which is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/895,945 (publication No: 2002/0068323) (SEQ ID NO: 4 and 5). The polynucleotide sequence encoding human TSLPR is presented as SEQ ID NO: 3 of the present application, and the amino acid sequence is presented as SEQ ID NO: 4 of the present application respectively. The soluble domain of the TSLPR is approximately amino acids 25 through 231 of SEQ ID NO: 4. TSLP binds with high affinity to a heterodimeric complex of TSLPR and the interleukin 7 receptor alpha IL-7Rα (Park et al., <i>J. Exp. Med </i>192:5 (2000), U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/895,945, publication number U.S. 2002/0068323). The sequence of IL-7 receptor α is shown in FIG. 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,416, which is herein incorporated by reference. The sequence of the soluble domain of the IL-7 receptor a is amino acid 1 to 219 of FIG. 2 in U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,416.</div>

Modified TSLP retains activity but the full length sequence is more easily expressed in microbial or mammalian cells.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">TSLP is produced in human epithelial cells including skin, bronchial, tracheal, and airway epithelial cells, keratinocytes, stromal and mast cells, smooth muscle cells, and lung and dermal fibroblasts, as determined by quantitative mRNA analysis (Soumelis et al, <i>Nature Immunol. </i>3 (7) 673-680 (2002)). Both murine and human TSLP are involved in promoting allergic inflammation. Soumelis et al, supra reported that the TSLP heterodimer receptor complex is expressed on human CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC cells). Dendritic cell culture experiments have shown that TSLP binding to DC cells induces the production of T<sub>H</sub>2 cell attracting chemokines TARC (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine; also known as CCL17) and MDC (macrophage-derived chemokine, also known as CCL22), and upregulates costimulatory molecules HLA-DR, CD40, CD80, CD86, and CD83 on the surface of cells. TSLP-activated DCs in cell culture induced naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> (Soumelis, supra) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation into pro-allergic effector cells (Gilliet et al, <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>197 (8), 1059-1063 (2003)) which produce pro-allergic cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-α while down-regulating IL-10 and interferon-γ (Soumelis et al., supra, Gilliet et al., supra). TSLP has been reported to be expressed in tissue samples of inflamed tonsilar epithelial cells, and keratinocytes within the lesions of atopic dermatis patients. (Soumelis et al., supra).</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">TSLP activities can be measured in an assay using BAF cells expressing human TSLPR (BAF/HTR), which require active TSLP for proliferation as described in PCT patent application publication WO 03/032898. The BAF/HTR bioassay utilizes a murine pro B lymphocyte cell line, which has been transfected with the human TSLP receptor (cell line obtained from Steven F. Ziegler, Virginia Mason Research Center, Seattle, Wash.). The BAF/HTR cells are dependent upon huTSLP for growth, and proliferate in response to active huTSLP added in test samples. Following an incubation period, cell proliferation is measured by the addition of Alamar Blue dye I (Biosource International Catalog # DAL1100, 10 uL/well). Metabolically active BAF/HRT cells take up and reduce Alamar Blue, which leads to change in the fluorescent properties of the dye. Additional assays for huTSLP activity include, for example, an assay measuring induction of T cell growth from human bone marrow by TSLP as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,555,520. Another TSLP activity is the ability to activate STATS as described in the reference to Levin et al., <i>J. Immunol. </i>162:677-683 (1999) and PCT patent application WO 03/032898. Additional assays include TSLP induced CCL17/TARC production from primary human monocytes and dendritic cells as described in the reference to Soumelis et al. supra.</div>

Antagonizing TSLP activity would result in preventing or decreasing fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition in a tissue. The present invention provides methods and compositions for reducing or preventing fibrosis in a subject afflicted with a fibrotic disorder by administering one or more TSLP antagonist to the subject.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein the term “profibrotic factors” refers to cytokines, growth factors or chemokines in addition to TSLP which have been observed to promote the accumulation of fibroblasts and deposition of collagen in various tissues. A number of cytokines and growth factors have been reported to be involved in regulating tissue remodeling and fibrosis. These include the “profibrotic cytokines” such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and interleukin-13 (IL-13), which have been shown to stimulate collagen synthesis and fibrosis in fibrotic tissues (Letterio et al. <i>Ann Rev. Immunol. </i>16, 137-161 (1998), Fertin et al., <i>Cell Mol. Biol. </i>37, 823-829 (1991), Doucet et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>101, 2129-2139 (1998). Interleukin-9 (IL-9) has been shown to induce airway fibrosis in the lungs of mice (Zhu et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>103, 779-788 (1999)). In addition to TGF-3, other cytokines or growth factors which have been reported to increase fibrosis in the fibrotic disorder idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) include granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (Kelly et al. <i>Curr Pharmaceutical Des </i>9: 39-49 (2003)). Cytokines and growth factors reported to be involved in promoting pulmonary fibrosis occurring in scleroderma include TGF-β, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin M (OSM), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), the type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, IL-9, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (CCL2/MCP-1), and pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL18/PARC) (Atamas et al., <i>Cyto Growth Fact Rev </i>14: 537-550 (2003)). Therefore, in one embodiment, the methods and compositions of the present invention further comprise administering at least one additional antagonist to one or more of fibrotic factors in addition to TSLP to reduce or prevent fibrosis in a subject suffering from a profibrotic disorder. These include, but are not limited to, the following cytokines, growth factors or chemokines: interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), interleukin-9 (IL-9), interleukin-13 (IL-13), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß), granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin M (OSM), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (CCL2/MCP-1), and pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL18/PARC).

As used herein, the term “antibody” refers to refers to intact antibodies including polyclonal antibodies (see, for example Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane (eds), Cold Spring Harbor Press, (1988)), and monoclonal antibodies (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. RE 32,011, 4,902,614, 4,543,439, and 4,411,993, and Monoclonal Antibodies: <i>A New Dimension in Biological Analysis</i>, Plenum Press, Kennett, McKearn and Bechtol (eds.) (1980)). As used herein, the term “antibody” also refers to a fragment of an antibody such as F(ab), F(ab′), F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>, Fv, complementarity determining regions (CDR) fragments, single chain antibodies (scFv), or combinations of these, which can be produced by DNA recombinant techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Antibodies also include polypeptides such as fusion proteins that contain at least a portion of an immunoglobulin that is sufficient to confer specific antigen binding to the polypeptide. Antibodies also include dAb (V<sub>H </sub>domain), diabodies (bivalent antibodies comprising two polypeptide chains, each having V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>chains), and triabodies and tetrabodies (antibodies with three and four polypeptide chains respectively, each having V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>chains). Antibodies also include minibodies (as described in WO 94/09817), and maxibodies or scFv-Fc fusions (Powers et al, <i>J.

Immunol. </i>79:315-321 (1990), Kostelny et al., <i>J. Immunol. </i>148:1547-1553 (1992)). As used herein the term “antibody” also refers to chimeric antibodies, that is, antibodies having a human constant antibody immunoglobulin domain is coupled to one or more non-human variable antibody immunoglobulin domain, or fragments thereof (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,595,898 and 5,693,493). Antibodies also refer to “humanized” antibodies, and human antibodies produced by transgenic animals, both of which are described more fully below. The term “antibodies” also includes multimeric antibodies, or a higher order complex of proteins such as heterdimeric antibodies. “Antibodies” also includes anti-idiotypic antibodies.

It may be useful to conjugate the antigen polypeptide to a carrier protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum, albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor. Also, aggregating agents such as alum may be used to enhance the immune response. After immunization, the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer.</div>

Examples of suitable methods for preparing monoclonal antibodies include the hybridoma methods of Kohler et al. <i>Nature </i>256:495-97 (1975) and the human B-cell hybridoma method (Kozbor, <i>J. Immunol. </i>133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., <i>Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications </i>51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1987).

One embodiment is a “chimeric” antibody in which a portion of the heavy (H) and/or light (L) chain is identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0040]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0042" num="0040">A monoclonal antibody may also be a “humanized” antibody. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089 and 5,693,762. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non-human. Humanization can be performed, for example, using methods described in the art (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 and WO 94/10332, Jones et al., <i>Nature </i>321:522-25 (1986); Riechmann et al., <i>Nature </i>332:323-27 (1998); Verhoeyen et al., <i>Science </i>239:1534-36 (1988)), by substituting at least a portion of a rodent complementarity-determining region for the corresponding regions of a human antibody.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0041]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0043" num="0041">Antibodies may be human antibodies. Using transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production such antibodies are produced by immunization with the appropriate antigen (i.e., having at least 6 contiguous amino acids), optionally conjugated to a carrier. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </i>90:2551-55 (1993); Jakobovits et al., <i>Nature </i>362:255-58 (1993) Bruggermann et al., <i>Year in Immuno. </i>7:33 (1993), Mendez et al., <i>Nature Genetics </i>15:146-156 (1997), and U.S. Pat. No. 6,300,129, which is herein incorporated by reference). In one method, such transgenic animals are produced by incapacitating the endogenous loci encoding the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains therein, and inserting loci encoding human heavy and light chain proteins into the genome thereof.

Both methods involve stepwise syntheses whereby a single amino acid is added at each step starting from the C-terminus of the peptide (See, Coligan et al., Curr Prot Immunol, Wiley Interscience, 1991, Unit 9). On completion of chemical synthesis, the synthetic peptide can be deprotected to remove the t-BOC or FMOC amino acid blocking groups and cleaved from the polymer by treatment with acid at reduced temperature (e.g., liquid HF-10% anisole for about 0.25 to about 1 hours at 0° C.). After evaporation of the reagents, the peptides are extracted from the polymer with 1% acetic acid solution that is then lyophilized to yield the crude material. This can normally be purified by such techniques as gel filtration on Sephadex G-15 using 5% acetic acid as a solvent. Lyophilization of appropriate fractions of the column will yield the homogeneous peptides or peptide derivatives, which can then be characterized by such standard techniques as amino acid analysis, thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, molar rotation, solubility, and quantitated by the solid phase Edman degradation.</div>

Briefly, a phage library is prepared (using e.g. ml 13, fd, or lambda phage), displaying inserts of amino acid residues. The inserts may represent, for example, a completely degenerate or biased array. Phage-bearing inserts that bind to the desired antigen are selected and this process repeated through several cycles of reselection of phage that bind to the desired antigen. DNA sequencing is conducted to identify the sequences of the expressed peptides. The minimal linear portion of the sequence that binds to the desired antigen can be determined in this way. The procedure can be repeated using a biased library containing inserts containing part or all of the minimal linear portion plus one or more additional degenerate residues upstream or downstream thereof. These techniques may identify peptides with still greater binding affinity for the cytokines or their receptors.

<li> <para-num num="[0072]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0074" num="0072">Antagonists to TSLP and other profibrotic cytokines according to the present invention include antagonists which prevent or reduce expression of the cytokine or its receptor. These include antisense or sense oligonucleotides comprising a single-stranded polynucleotide sequence (either RNA or DNA) capable of binding to target mRNA (sense) or DNA (antisense) sequences. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides, according to the invention, comprise fragments of the targeted polynucleotide sequence encoding either the cytokine or its receptor. Such a fragment generally comprises at least about 14 nucleotides, typically from about 14 to about 30 nucleotides. The ability to derive an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide, based upon a nucleic acid sequence encoding a given protein is described in, for example, Stein and Cohen (<i>Cancer Res. </i>48:2659, 1988), and van der Krol et al. (<i>BioTechniques </i>6:958, 1988). Binding of antisense or sense oligonucleotides to target nucleic acid sequences results in the formation of duplexes that block or inhibit protein expression by one of several means, including enhanced degradation of the mRNA by RNAse H, inhibition of splicing, premature termination of transcription or translation, or by other means. The antisense oligonucleotides thus may be used to block expression of proteins. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides further comprise oligonucleotides having modified sugar-phosphodiester backbones (or other sugar linkages, such as those described in WO91/06629) and wherein such sugar linkages are resistant to endogenous nucleases. Such oligonucleotides with resistant sugar linkages are stable in vivo (i.e., capable of resisting enzymatic degradation) but retain sequence specificity to be able to bind to target nucleotide sequences.</div>

Further still, intercalating agents, such as ellipticine, and alkylating agents or metal complexes may be attached to sense or antisense oligonucleotides to modify binding specificities of the antisense or sense oligonucleotide for the target nucleotide sequence.</div>

This response is increased over the six-week time course and was accompanied by observed skin thickening, edema, and significant cellular accumulation in the epidermis, dermis and subcutin. This response demonstrates the involvement of TSLP in the promotion of fibrotic disease.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0113]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0119" num="0113">In a follow-up experiment, five groups of 8-week-old Balb/c female mice (Charles River) were treated according to the following protocol. Each group contained 5 mice. The groups were injected intradermally on distinct parts of the back with 100 ul total volume as described above. Group 1 received one injection for one week (one injection total) of 10 ug MSA (mouse serum albumin, a negative control), 10 ug TSLP, and PBS on distinct parts of the back. Group 2 was injected once a week for two weeks (two injections total) with 10 ug MSA, 10 ug TSLP, and PBS on distinct parts of the back. Group 3 was injected three times a week for two weeks (6 injections total) with 10 ug MSA, 10 ug TSLP, and PBS on distinct parts of the back. Group 4 was injected three times a week for two weeks (six injections total) with 1 ug MSA, 1 ug TSLP, and PBS on distinct parts of the back. Group 5 was injected 3 times a week for two weeks (six injections total) with 0.1 ug MSA, 0.1 ug TSLP, and PBS on distinct parts of the back. 72 hours after the final injection, the animals in each group were sacrificed, the skin was harvested, fixed in formalin, and made into slides for H&amp;E staining for pathological evaluation. Evidence of subcuticular fibrosis from the skin samples was scored on a scale from 1 to 4. Fibrosis was visually scored based on fibroblast accumulation in the subcuticular region of the skin sections. The results are given in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the single weekly dosage of TSLP for one week (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, Group 1), or for two weeks (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, Group 2) did not result in evidence of fibrosis. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the 10 ug dosage of TSLP administered three times a week for two weeks (Group 3) induced the greatest degree of fibrosis found in the skin, resulting a score of 3. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the 1 ug dosage of TSLP administered three times a week for two weeks (Group 4) resulted in a score of 2, and, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the 0.1 ug dosage of TSLP administered three times a week for two weeks (Group 5) resulted in a score of 1. The control MSA, and PBS alone did not induce any sign of fibrosis in the skin of the mice in any of the groups, with the exception of a single animal scoring a 1 for PBS in Group 4 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). This second experiment demonstrates that TSLP induces fibrosis in animals in a dose dependent manner.</div>
