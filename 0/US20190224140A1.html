<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Pain is one of the most common reasons for a patient to seek medical care and in consequence, pain results in a tremendous number of lost work days per year.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">There are three general classes of pain: nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, and psychogenic pain. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> describes the different types of pain and how certain types of diseases such as allodynia and multiple sclerosis are classified.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In nociceptive pain, the stimulation of the sensory nerve endings called nociceptors causes the sensation of pain. Such pain often occurs after injury or surgery. The pain signals are transmitted by the nociceptors to the brain. Often the pain is localised, constant and has an aching or throbbing quality. Once the damage to the tissue heals the pain usually resolves. Treatment with opioids may resolve nociceptive pain.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Psychogenic pain, is a pain disorder that is associated with psychological factors. Some types of mental or emotional problems can cause pain. They can also increase or prolong pain. Headaches, muscle pains, back pain, and stomach pains are some of the most common types of psychogenic pain. People with this pain disorder actually have real pain. The diagnosis is made when all physical causes of pain are ruled out.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Neuropathic pain is the result of an injury or malfunction of the peripheral or the central nervous system. The pain may be triggered by an injury but not necessarily by an injury of the nervous system itself. Neuropathic pain is frequently chronic and is often less responsive to treatment with opioids, but may respond to treatment with anticonvulsant or antidepressant drugs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Neuropathic pain is caused by abnormalities in the nerves, spinal cord or brain and is a chronic type of non-malignant pain with an estimated prevalence of over 1% of the population. Optimising pain relief in these patients is crucial in helping a patient regain control of his or her life.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">The most common cause of neuropathic pain is injury or dysfunction of nerves. Injury or dysfunction of peripheral nerves or nerves descending from the spinal cord results in disinhibition of nerve impulses at the spinal cord which in consequence results in pain.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Neuropathic pain can also be centrally mediated, rather than peripheral, in conditions such as spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Neuropathic pain can therefore be divided into two further classes; peripheral neuropathic pain and central neuropathic pain depending on whether the peripheral or central nervous system is affected.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Patients with peripheral neuropathic pain often experience pain which feels like a burning or electrical pain, whereas others describe their pain as feeling like extreme cold or pins and needles.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">The pain may be worsened by activity or by wearing clothes over the affected area.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">The pain may also follow a daily pattern, which may mean it is worse at certain times of the day.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">Allodynia is a type of peripheral neuropathic pain. This is a painful response to a typically non-painful stimulus, for example brushing the affected area with a fingertip. The pain tends to increase with repeated stimulation and may spread from the affected area. Allodynic pain can be evoked in response to chemical, thermal (cold or heat) or mechanical low or high intensity stimuli applied either statically or dynamically to skin, joints, bone, muscle or viscera. It is thought that the presence of allodynic pain is a more suitable means of grouping patients suffering from peripheral neuropathic pain than by the specific disease that led to the neuropathic pain.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">It is clear that patients that suffer from neuropathic pain can have their quality of life greatly affected by it. The pain can interfere with work and social activities as well as with the amount and quality of sleep that a patient experiences. A successful treatment for the relief of neuropathic pain should improve both the amount of pain that the patient is experiencing as well as improving the patient's quality of life.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">Non-pharmaceutical methods of treating neuropathic pain include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and acupuncture.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">The use of pharmaceuticals is the most common treatment for neuropathic pain. These include topical creams applied directly to the site of pain. Analgesics, antidepressants and anticonvulsants are the other drug classes generally in use. The drug carbamezepine, which is an anticonvulsant, is currently the only FDA approved drug which has an indication for neuropathic pain. It has been suggested in post-marketing studies that there is a five- to eight-fold increase in the risk of blood dyscrasias in patients taking carbamezepine. In 7% of patients there has been shown to be a 25% decrease in their white blood cell count, this usually reverses within the first 4 months of therapy.</div>

Recent methods have sought to find new ways to deliver cannabinoids to a patient including those which bypass the stomach and the associated first pass effect of the liver which can remove up to 90% of the active ingested dose and avoid the patient having to inhale unhealthy tars and associated carcinogens into their lungs.</div>

This purification results in a purity of greater than 99% (w/w) of the target cannabinoid. To a certain extent, these purified cannabinoids can be considered to be the same as synthetic cannabinoids as they consist only of the target cannabinoid.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0148]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0154" num="0148">In the acute administration tests the cannabinoid-containing plant extract that comprised the cannabinoids CBD and THC proved to be clearly more efficacious at the relief of neuropathic pain than either of the pure compounds THC and CBD. Pure THC was shown to have a pain relieving effect but this effect was short-lived and the amount of relief when compared to the vehicle treated animals was lower than that of the cannabinoid-containing plant extract.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0149]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0155" num="0149">In the repeated administration tests the cannabinoid-containing plant extract that comprised the cannabinoids CBD and THC again provided a more effective relief of neuropathic pain than either of the pure compounds THC and CBD. Interestingly rather than the pure THC that was shown to produce pain relief in the acute administration experiments, pure CBD produced a pain relieving effect after repeated administration of the drug. The summary tables above show that this effect was not as effective as the cannabinoid-containing plant extract that comprised the cannabinoids CBD and THC.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0150]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0156" num="0150">The reason why the cannabinoid-containing plant extract that comprised the cannabinoids CBD and THC are more efficacious than the pure compounds at the relief of neuropathic pain may be due to a synergistic effect of the two cannabinoids. However, it is possible that the other compounds that exist as part of the cannabinoid-containing plant extract, as described in Table 1, play a part in the mechanism of action of the relief of neuropathic pain by cannabinoids.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0151]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0157" num="0151">These data show that overall the cannabinoid-containing plant extract that comprised the cannabinoids CBD and THC are more suitable for use in the treatment of neuropathic pain.</div>
