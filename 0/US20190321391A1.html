<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a disorder of the lower urinary tract, and in particular, reducing the symptoms (including treatment) of interstitial cystitis in vivo. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to, treatment formulations and methods for reducing interstitial cystitis in patients.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic progressive disorder of the lower urinary tract that causes urinary urgency and frequency and/or pelvic pain. For many years, urologists regarded IC as a rare disease for which they had no broadly effective treatment. In fact, the condition is quite common. In 1999, prevalence in the United States was estimated at 750,000 cases (Curhan, et al. J Urol 161(2):549-552 (1999)). However the true prevalence of IC is estimated to be at least 1-2 million patients who are suffering from severe chronic pelvic pain.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Treatments with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), approved for IC in 1977 on the basis of data from uncontrolled trials, can be useful with weekly intravesical instillations for 6 to 8 weeks then every two weeks for 3-12 months for maintenance. However DMSO therapy results in benefit for approximately 50% of IC patients treated and the treatment takes a long time to reduce symptoms. Furthermore, this therapy causes pain that is unrelieved by local anesthetics by themselves due to their lack of absorption into the bladder wall. Narcotics are given fur immediate relief of symptoms however they are only minimally effective. Some patients benefit from formal 8- to 12-week, one-on-one course of behavior modification. Patients are also advised to avoid potassium-rich foods, particularly citrus fruits, tomatoes, chocolate, and coffee.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, treatments that would both benefit a larger portion of the patient population, provide immediate relief of symptoms without causing additional pain, without requiring extensive alterations in diet, and further provide reversal of the disease process over time are necessary. The present invention meets that challenge by providing compositions, detection methods and novel IC management treatment methods with the benefits described herein.</div>

Heparan sulfate contains fewer sulfate groups, so is not as effective as an anticoagulant as heparin. Heparin and heparan sulfate are both characterized by repeating units of disaccharides containing a uronic acid (glucuronic or iduronic acid) and glucosamine, which is either N-sulfated or N-acetylated. The sugar residues may be further O-sulfated at the C-6 and C-3 positions of the glucosamine and the C-2 position of the uronic acid.

Typically, the osmolar component is 0.9% sodium chloride, or somewhat less as the other components in the solution also contribute to the solution's osmolarity and thus should be taken into account. Typically the osmolar component is a salt, such as sodium chloride, or a sugar or a combination of two or more of these components. The sugar may be a monosaccharide such as dextrose, a disaccharide such as sucrose or lactose, a polysaccharide such as dextran 40, dextran 60, or starch, or a sugar alcohol such as mannitol. It should be obvious to those skilled in the art that all components of the composition contribute to the osmolarity of the solution but to achieve an isotonic or near-isotonic solution, the contributions of these components should he taken into account to ensure that the proper osmolar component is added and not added in excess which would result in a hypertonic solution.</div>

The most current estimate of the true prevalence of IC is that the disease affects as many as 1 in 4.5 women [Parsons, et al. Urology 60:573-578 (2002)] and 1 in 20 men [Nickel, et al. J Urol 165:842-845 (2001)] in the United States. In our extensive clinical experience, the multimodal treatment regimen is effective in up to 85-90% of cases of IC. The current prevalence estimates come from true prevalence studies in which a general population was screened for the characteristic symptom complex of IC. Previous prevalence studies have focused on screening a population for individuals who have already received a diagnosis of IC, and have used diagnostic criteria that recognized only the fraction of the IC patient population that has severe, advanced disease.</div>

As used herein, “cystoscopic examination” and “cystoscopy” refers to an examination that uses a cytoscope. As used herein, “cystoscope” refers to an endoscopic, instrument to visualize the lower urinary tract that includes the bladder and the urethra. As used herein. “urethra” refers to a tube draining the urine to the outside. As used herein, “bladder” refers to a hollow muscular organ that stores urine until it is excreted from the body.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0147]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0148" num="0147">The diagnosis of IC is relatively simple if the clinician takes the following approach: look for the characteristic pattern of IC symptoms (Table 1) in the appropriate clinical setting, rule out other definable causes of the patient's urgency/frequency and/or pelvic pain and rely on the potassium sensitivity test (PST; described below) to confirm the diagnosis.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0148]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0149" num="0148">The symptoms of IC tend to occur in a pattern of sudden flares followed by remissions, with the flares becoming more severe and more continuous as the disease progresses. Moderate to severe IC can severely impair a patient's physical, emotional, social, and professional life. Several clinical situations should alert the physician that IC might be present. One example is women with recurrent urinary tract infections. Usually these episodes are IC flares, as shown by negative urine cultures. Another example are women or men with dyspareunia; most will have IC. Another example is women with a diagnosis of “overactive bladder, dry.” Most likely, these patients have IC. As used herein, the terms “subject” and “patient” refer to any animal, such as a mammal like a dog, cat, livestock, and a human (e.g. a human with a disease). In one embodiment, a patient has one or more of urinary urgency, urinary frequency, pelvic pain, recurrent urinary tract infections, dyspareunia, overactive bladder, dry, etc. As used herein, “urinary tract infections” refers to a condition that includes an inflamed urethra and painful urination. In some embodiments, a urinary tract infection is caused by bacteria. In some embodiments, a urinary tract infection is not caused by bacteria. As used herein, “recurrent urinary tract infections” refers to frequent episodes of urinary tract infections. As used herein, “dyspareunia” refers to pain during intercourse. As used herein, “overactive bladder” refers to a sudden involuntary contraction of the muscular wall of the bladder causing urinary urgency, an immediate unstoppable need to urinate and a form of urinary incontinence. As used herein, “urinary incontinence” refers to the unintentional loss of urine and inability to control urination or prevent its leakage.

Even if a patient urinates more than 8 times in 24 hours, the frequency may have developed so gradually that he or she has not recognized it as abnormal. A 24-hour voiding log or the Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency (PUF) Scale (described in the following section) or both are useful in obtaining a true picture of the patient's voiding patterns.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0150]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0151" num="0150">The pain of IC, rather than symptoms of urgency/frequency, is what usually brings a patient to the doctor. The location of the pain is what guides the patient to choose either a urologist or a gynecologist. Unfortunately, the pain does not necessarily point to the origin of the problem, which is the lower urinary tract. A patient with IC may perceive the pain anywhere in the pelvis, in 1 or more locations in any combination (Table 1). IC pain often includes pain during or immediately after sexual intercourse. A number of factors can influence the severity of a patient's symptoms on any given day (Table 2), Thus, IC is extremely variable in its presentation; its symptoms can be mistaken for signs of a different urologic or gynecologic problem. However, it is important to detect this condition because effective therapy is available, and early cases respond more readily to treatment than do advanced cases.</div>

A voided urine specimen should be obtained for analysis. Because patients with IC often void low volumes, if the voided specimen is not negative, it is optimal to obtain a catheterized urine specimen for analysis (Brendler, In: Walsh, et al, eds., Campbell's Urology, 7th ed. Philadelphia, Pa.: WB Saunders Co; 144 (1998)). An IC patient's catheterized specimen should show no bacteria and probably will show no red or white blood cells. As used herein, “catheter” refers to a tube passed through the body for draining fluids or injecting them into body cavities. It may be made of elastic, elastic web, rubber, glass, metal, or plastic. As used herein, “catheterization” refers to the insertion of a slender tube through the urethra or through the anterior abdominal wall into the bladder, urinary reservoir, or urinary conduit to allow urine drainage. As used herein, “catheterized” refers to the collection of a specimen by a catheterization. The terms “sample” and “specimen” are used in their broadest sense and encompass samples or specimens obtained from any source. As used herein, the term “biological samples” refers to samples or specimens obtained from animals (including humans), and encompasses cells, fluids, solids, tissues, and gases. Biological samples include tissues (e.g., biopsy material), urine, cells, mucous, blood, and blood products such as plasma, serum and the like.

If urinary potassium is allowed to penetrate the epithelium, it can depolarize nerves and muscle and cause the symptoms of urinary urgency or pain (or both) as well as tissue damage (Parsons et al. J Urol 159(6):1865-1867 (1998).</div>

In 1999, prevalence in the United States was estimated at 750,000 cases (Curhan, et al. J Urol 161(2):549-552 (1999)).

These findings were confirmed in a larger follow-up study with controls, in which the PST result was positive in 198 (81%) of 244 pelvic pain patients and in none of the controls. As the size of the nation's CH patient population has been estimated at 9 million women or more, (Mathias, et al. Obstet Gynecol 87(3):321-327 (1996)) these findings suggest that the number of IC patients may be at least 10 times higher than the estimate published in the most recent epidemiologic study (Curhan, et al.

Heparinoids are similar in structure to the glycosaminoglycans in the bladder surface mucus and are believed to help repair or restore the epithelium (Parsons, Urology 49(5A suppl);100-104 (1997) in individuals who have abnormal epithelial permeability. As used herein, “heparinoid” refers to any molecule comprising a “glycosaminoglycan” which refers to a molecule comprising a network of long, branched chains of sugars (e.g. chondroitin sulphate, heparan sulphate, hyaluronic add, keratin sulphate, dermatan sulphate, hyaluronan and the like) and optimally further comprising smaller, nitrogen-containing molecules (e.g. low molecular weight molecules). Glycosaminoglycan also refers to “mucopolysaccharide.” It is not meant to limit the present invention to any one glycosaminoglycan (GAG) or source of GAG. GAG molecules include but are not limited to low molecular weight (LMW) GAGs, naturally derived GAGS, biotechnologically prepared GAGS, chemically modified GAGS, synthetic GAGS, and the like. It is not meant to limit the present invention to salts (e.g. sodium sale, calcium salt and the like) and sulfites and includes other terms of these molecules. It is not meant to limit the present invention to any one heparinoid molecule or source of heparinoid molecule. In some embodiments, a heparinoid comprises a heparin-like molecule (e.g. heparan sulfate), For example, a heparin-like molecule such as heparan sulfate is a glycoprotein with a structure similar to heparin with the difference being that heparan has undergone less polymerization than heparin and so has more glucuronic acid and N-acetyl glucosamine than heparin. Heparan contains fewer sulfate groups, so is not as effective as an anticoagulant as heparin. Heparin and heparan sulfate are both characterized by repeating units of disaccharides containing a uronic acid (glucuronic or iduronic acid) and glucosamine, which is either N-sulfated N-acetylated. The sugar residues may be further O-sulfated at the C-6 and C-3 positions of the glucosamine and the C-2 position of the uronic acid. There are at least 32 potential unique disaccharide units in this class of compounds. In some embodiments, a heparinoid comprises a heparin molecule (e.g. a heparin sodium), a pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) and the like. As used herein, “heparin” refers to a heterogeneous group of straight-chain anionic glycosaminoglycans, as described above, having anticoagulant properties with a molecular weight ranging from 2,000 to 40,000 Da.</div>

LMW heparins are made by enzymatic or chemical controlled hydrolysis of unfractionated heparin and have very similar chemical structure as unfractionated heparin except for some changes that may have been introduced due to the enzymatic or chemical treatment. While not intending to limit the mechanism of action of the invention's compositions, it is the inventor's view that mechanism of action of these drugs is similar to that of full-length heparin. LMW heparins are usually isolated from hulk heparin. In one embodiment, heparin is a heparin salt (e.g. heparin sodium, pentosan polysulfate sodium, heparan sulfate). As used herein, the phrases “pharmaceutically acceptable salts”, “a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof” or “pharmaceutically accepted complex” for the purposes of this application are equivalent and refer to derivatives prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids or bases including inorganic acids and bases and organic acids and bases. Since the compound of the present invention is acidic, salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids.

The invention resolves symptoms of pain and urgency by neural desensitization by the alkalinized lidocaine—the underlying urothelium integrity is improved by the heparin sodium. With the guidance of the physician, the patient should make his or her own treatment decisions. In the treatment process, it is important for the clinician to help the patient develop an understanding of what to expect from the disease and from the treatment over the long term. Many IC patients have suffered for years before finding a physician who recognizes the source of their symptoms.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0172]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0173" num="0172">The IC symptoms of frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain present differently among patients who have IC, and can vary from one day to the next in a single affected individual. IC is a progressive disorder that tends to present as a series of flares and remissions in its early stages. Typically, IC symptoms do not become both severe and continuous until the disease has been present for many years [Parsons, et al. Urology 57:428-33 (2001); Hand, J Urol 61:291-310 (1949); Parsons, Neurourol Urodyn 9:241-50 (1990); and Koziol, et al. J Urol 149:465-9 (1993)].</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0173]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0174" num="0173">A patient may perceive IC pain as dysuria and/or as pain m the suprapubic area, the lower abdomen, the lower hack, the medial thighs, the inguinal area, the urethra, the vagina or vulva in women, and the scrotum or testes in men [Parsons, et al. Urology 57:428-33 (2001); Hand, J Urol 61:291-310 (1949)]. A given patient may experience pain in one or more of these locations, in any combination. Recent studies suggest there are significant numbers of IC patients in the populations of men and women who seek treatment for chronic pelvic pain [Parsons, et al. Urology 60:573-578 (2002); Parsons, et al. Am. J. Obstet Gynecol 187:1395-1400 (2002); Parsons and Albo, J Ural 168:1054-1057 (2002)]. Approximately 3 out of 4 IC patients, both male and female, have pain associated with sexual activity. Pain may be the patient's only symptom of IC, as some IC patients experience no urinary urgency/frequency. In my clinical experience, a female patient who has dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain has an 80% chance of having a genitourinary source for that pain, regardless of where in the pelvis the pain is perceived.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0174]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0175" num="0174">It is well known that a number of factors provoke flares of IC symptoms in affected individuals. These include hormonal fluctuations, the activity of seasonal allergies, physical stress, emotional stress, and sexual activity [Parsons, et al. Urology 57:428-33 (2001); Parsons, Neurourol Urodyn 9:241-250 (<b>1990</b>); Koziol, Urol Clin North Am. 21:7-71 (1994); Held, et al. in Interstitial Cystitis, Hanno, et al (Eds), Springer-Verlag, London, p:29-48 (1990)]. In addition, a patient's symptoms will depend on the lower urinary tract tissues affected by the disease. There is increasing evidence that IC is part of a larger disorder that can be called Lower Urinary Dysfunctional Epithelium (LUDE) [Parsons, et al. Urology 57:428-33 (2001); Parsons, et al. Urology 60:573-578 (2002); Parsons, et al. Am J Obstet Gynecol 187:1395-1400 (2002); Parsons and Albo, J Urol 168:1054-1057 (2002)]. LUDE can affect the bladder, the urethra, and (in men) the prostate. For all of these reasons, it is more accurate to regard IC as a continuum than as a disease with a single, characteristic clinical presentation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0175]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0176" num="0175">In the effort to provide symptom relief for the IC patient, an important first step is to identify and quantify all of the IC symptoms from which the patient currently suffers. A recently validated IC symptom questionnaire of the present invention, the Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency Patient Symptom Scale (PUF Scale, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can be extremely useful tier this purpose [Parsons, et al. Urology 60:573-578 (2002)]. The PUF Scale is a self-administered questionnaire that can be completed by the patient in less than 5 minutes. It contains questions that elicit and quantify urinary frequency and/or urgency (if any), pelvic pain, and/or pain associated with sexual activity, The result is a single numeric score from 0 through 35. The higher the PUS score, the greater the likelihood that the individual has IC [_Parsons, et al. Urology 60573-578 (2002)]; for this reason, the PUF can be useful in distinguishing IC from other disorders during the process of diagnosis.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0176]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0177" num="0176">A patient's responses on the PUF Scale also may make the clinician aware of any IC symptoms the patient may experience but may not recognize as abnormal. Individuals who have urinary frequency (that is, voiding 8 or more times per day) may not report it as a problem because it has always been normal for them, or does not worry them. Nevertheless, it is a symptom that indicates the presence of a pathophysiologic process that must be recognized so that treatment can be initiated as early as possible in the disease process. Frequency is typically the first symptom to appear in an individual who has IC. Urinary urgency often follows, and pain tends to be a later manifestation of the disease. In clinical experience, pain—especially acute pain—usually is the symptom that prompts the patient to seek treatment for IC.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0177]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0178" num="0177">Bladder epithelial permeability and urinary potassium appear to play a key role in the development of many cases of the disease [Parsons, et al. J Urol 159:1862-1867 (1998)]. In the healthy bladder, a mucus layer containing glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) forms a barrier that prevents urine and its contents from leaking through the urothelium and damaging the underlying nerves and muscle [Lilly and Parsons, Burg. Gynecol Obstet 171:493-496 (1990)]. Most individuals with IC have an epithelial dysfunction that renders the urothelium abnormally permeable. As a result, potentially harmful substances in urine are allowed to leak through the epithelium and penetrate the bladder muscle. Potassium, which occurs in high concentrations in normal urine, does not damage or penetrate a healthy urothelium but is highly toxic to tissues such as the bladder muscularis. The depolarization of sensory nerves in the bladder muscle by potassium could produce the symptoms of IC as well as cause its progression.</div>

Although use of the PST is not yet generally accepted, a number of centers around the world have reported results of more than 2200 PST's performed on IC patients [Parsons, et al.

For these reasons, the clinician should assess the results of heparinoid therapy only after at least a year of treatment in cases of mild to moderate disease, and only after at least two years of treatment in a case of severe IC. In general, if a patient does not appear to be responding to heparinoid therapy, adding other treatments to the regimen rather than discontinuing the heparinoid therapy is recommended.</div>

One of the methods of the present invention combines heparin and lidocaine buffered with sodium bicarbonate to pH&gt;8.0 via direct catheter delivery to the bladder, providing immediate and long term pain relief for chronic. IC sufferers. In some embodiments, the solution contains 10,000-40,000 units of heparin. In some embodiments, heparin is replaced by 100-200 mg PPS (the contents of an oral capsule dissolved in 10 mL buffered normal saline), 10 mL 1% lidocaine or 16 mL 2% lidocaine, and 3 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (w/v). The solution is instilled into the empty bladder and retained for approximately 30 minutes, The principal difference between this therapeutic solution and other such solutions is the presence of sodium bicarbonate, which dramatically increases the absorption of the lidocaine. In one preliminary study using PPS, 41 of 55 patients (75%) experienced significant immediate relief of their IC symptoms. Use of the solution 3-7 times weekly for two weeks or more resulted in sustained pain relief in 85% of patients Parsons and Davis, Practice Building Today Sep. 18-22 (2003)).</div>

After 47 patients had been treated with one instillation of this solution, and no adverse events or side effects had developed, it was decided to increase the amount of lidocaine in the solution. Subsequently, all subjects received this modified solution, which was identical to the original solution, except that it contained 8 mL of 2% lidocaine (160 mg; group 2). All patients were evaluated for pain and urgency relief within 20 minutes of the single instillation. Group 2 patients were evaluated by telephone follow-up 24 to 48 hours after the instillation to determine the duration of their relief. In addition, group 2 patients who elected to receive additional instillations of the 2% lidocaine solution were evaluated to determine whether the efficacy of the solution persisted after a course of three treatments per week for 2 weeks, All patients were evaluated using the Patient Overall Rating of Improvement of Symptoms scale (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) on which they rated their symptoms of pain and urgency as “worse” or from “no better” (0% improvement) to “symptoms gone” (100% improvement) in 25% increments.

The difference in the response rates between groups 1 and 2 was statistically significant (P&lt;0.01; chi-square analysis). Twenty-eight patients in group 2 were available for the evaluation of the duration of relief by telephone follow-up 24 to 48 hours after the single instillation. One half of these patients experienced at least 4 hours of symptom relief from the instillation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Twenty patients in group 2 agreed to receive a course of three instillations per week for 2 weeks. Of the 2.0 patients, 16 (80%) reported significant sustained relief of pain and urgency.

If a patient receiving oral PPS has signs of gastrointestinal distress, or if the patient feels otherwise unable to take the oral PPS, the PPS can be administered via the intravesical therapeutic solution described above. This alternative bypasses the oral route of administration and the accompanying potential for drag side effects. It is also less expensive than oral PPS treatment.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0200]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0201" num="0200">IC is a relatively common disorder that may affect as many as 1 in 4.5 women [Parsons, et al. Urology 60:573-578 (20023)] and 1 in 20 men [Nickel, et al. J Urol 165;842-845 (2001)]. The disease can readily be detected from the characteristic pattern of its symptoms in the appropriate clinical setting and in the absence of other definable causes. In establishing the diagnosis, tools such as the PUF Scale and the PST are useful. The majority of cases of IC can be treated successfully using a multimodal program of therapy directed at restoring lower urinary epithelial function, reversing neural activation, and controlling any allergies. In severe or long-standing eases of IC, an intravesical treatment program can be an important adjunct that provides both immediate and long-term symptom relief (Table 5 and 6, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, respectively).</div>
