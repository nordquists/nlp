<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention discloses methods and novel apparatus(es) for the purifying and conditioning air in areas occupied by humans and pets, by passing the air through a vessel containing a liquid absorbent media.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Environmental pollutants that are known to have harmful effects when introduced into inhabited areas represent a significant health hazard to humans and pets that occupy such areas, because of the acute and/or chronic toxicity caused by exposure to such pollutants. Such pollutants may not be easily controlled at the source, i.e., may be a result of regional air pollution. Certain environmental spaces, such as medical facilities, food storage areas, are particularly susceptible to air pollutants, or biological contamination. Methods for remediating the air and protecting the occupants and contents from exposure to such pollutants and health hazards would therefore be beneficial.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In enclosed spaces, often such methods include passing the air via an air handling system through a fixed solid filter, such as those found on a typical HVAC furnace filter, HEPA filters, or containing an adsorbent material such as charcoal or carbon-black. While this methodology may remove particulate matter, it has limited utility because the filters may become saturated and/or blocked even on short term use. Furthermore this approach is unsatisfactory for the removal of certain other pollutants, including Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) and gasses, such as formaldehyde (see Clary, John J., et al., “Formaldehyde: Toxicology, Epidemiology, Mechanisms”, First Edition 1983; “Formaldehyde and Other Aldehydes”, Committee on Aldehydes, Board on Toxicology and Environmental Health Hazards, Assembly of Life Scientists, National Research Council, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. (1981); and “Formaldehyde Health and Safety Guide, IPCS International Programme on Chemical Safety, Health and Safety Guide No. 57). Formaldehyde is a particular problem because it is used widely in furniture and construction. The plywood used, for example may contain a glue resin such as urea-formaldehyde, or phenol formaldehyde resin. In such systems, formaldehyde can gradually release from the resin for as long as 15 years. The formaldehyde vapor often accumulates in an enclosed space as a result. Formaldehyde vapor may also arise from synthetic fibers, plastics, or insulation foam, within or nearby the space. Furthermore, because of the size requirements, the use of traditional air handling units and air purifiers in some enclosed spaces such as small buildings other than homes or offices, trucks, automobiles or motor homes are not practical. Often the only solution has been to ventilate the enclosed space by exchanging its air with outside air, but this solution can necessitate the need to recondition, e.g., cool, reheat, humidify or dehumidify, the air, added to the expense of such a solution. Furthermore, some particles are too small to catch even with HEPA filters. The use of porous porcelain material in filtration systems to catch small particles has been described, but this leads to blockage of the pores and huge energy consumption (and frequent replacement of filter materials). In addition, volatile organic chemicals can get easily saturated on solid media, such as C-black or charcoal, commonly used material for absorbing volatile organic compounds such as formaldehyde. Once saturation of the solid media occurs, it can be released from the solid phase. This is especially true for formaldehyde because of its high volatility (bp of −19° C.), making it readily released from C-black.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">For infectious disease-related bacteria or viruses, it is important to not only capture and kill (sterilize or disinfect) the pathogens but also prevent them from growing in the air cleaning process. Removal of harmful microorganisms with such filtration technology is also problematic, because in strong winds or air currents, they can be blown away from solid support (such as charcoal) and released back into the air. Even more problematic, microorganisms may find solid media as ideal environment in for multiplication (growth) before circulating back to the air. The problem is not easily mediated by adding biocides to solid support, because it is inefficient in dry condition or the charcoal may become less absorbent if it is made wet. Furthermore, biocides in solid form may dissociate from the solid support and be released directly into the air, resulting in safety concerns.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">A second approach to removing pollutants, such as formaldehyde, from air is referred to as “air washing” and involves systems in which a large quantity of water is recirculated through an airstream. For example, the airflow passing through heating/ventilation ductwork within is subjected to a spray or cascading surface of water, or comes in contact with a water treated media, such as a moistened moving belt, agitated packing material, or frothy interface. The formaldehyde is absorbed into the water, and the formaldehyde/water mixture can be removed and the air washing system can be replenished with fresh formaldehyde-free water. (See Pedersen et al., <i>Environment International, </i>12, 439-447, 1986; U.S. Pat. No. 6,641,635; US 2004 0028586; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,669,946, 7,758,025). Similarly, air scrubbing devices are disclosed in which air is passed through a chamber, where a cascade of water circulates, and the water is disinfected by means of a germicidal light source (U.S. Pat. No. 7,722,708) or the scrubbing action is accomplished by means of a central rotor which disperses a liquid through a specially shaped bowl that brings it in contact with passing air (U.S. Pat. No. 3,936,283). Because air washing methods typically result in some of the liquid being entrained in the moving air in droplet form, the addition of an apparatus called an eliminator is employed to remove the droplets. An air washer design with no eliminator is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,493.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">A third general approach are various systems designed to remove contaminants such as particulates and/or biodegradable vapors, in which environmental air is pumped below the surface of one or more chambers or compartments containing water and/or another liquid; the water may contain an additive, such as a surfactant, a biologically active microorganism or a biocide which reacts/degrades the contaminants (U.S. Pat. No. 4,818,59; US 2003 0232424; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,616,733; 5,908,491; 5,078,759; 5,080,793; 5,078,759; 7,022,297; 7,156,895; 7,988,909; 6,626,983; 2,209,775; 5,848,592). This general method of removing pollutants has also been applied to industrial waste streams, where additives are selected to specifically decompose the contaminants. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,251,486). These devices frequently also function as humidifiers, i.e., adding moisture to the air as it is cleaned.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">In industrial work areas where environmental hazards are well defined, specialized personal protection equipment have been developed and are routinely used. In contrast, convenient methods to protect individuals from chronic exposure to harmful gasses and particulate matter in public outdoor areas are not readily available, despite deteriorating air quality because of environmental pollution. In some areas of the world, smog has been so severe, that if it contains PM2.5, governments of many countries advise individuals to stay indoors and to keep doors and windows shut to prevent it from entering into houses or vehicles. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less, and is also referred to as “fine” particles and believed to pose the greatest health risks.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, there is a need for a generally applicable and practical method and devices to remove pollutants, including particulates, volatile contaminants, biological hazards such as germs and viruses from the air of enclosed air spaces and to prevent or reduce exposure of these pollutants to individuals in outdoor environments where needed.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0121]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0116" num="0121">Disclosed herein are methods for removal of airborne pollutants either from an enclosed space or outdoor environment, thereby protecting the contents, humans and/or pets occupying the enclosed space or outdoor environment from these pollutants. Pollutants include particulate matter such as PM 2.5, PM 0.5, and other particles, heavy metals and other harmful materials attached to those particles, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds, bacteria, virus particles. The method includes the removal of such pollutants by passing the air from the enclosed space or outdoor environment through a media, such as a liquid, a liquid mixed with solid, a slurry, or a solid phase that is optional supported with a liquid. The liquid can be water alone, or an aqueous solution of a reagent or scavenger, which removes or chemically reacts with the pollutant, leaving reaction products, if any, in the water. Once having passed through the absorbent media, the purified air is released into the environmental space, via tubing or other conduit so that the quality of the air within the environmental space is improved. The conduit may optionally be designed to direct the purified air directly to an individual that can breathe the air, or diffused into the enclosed space or, if so designed with multiple conduits, into multiple spaces.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0122]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0117" num="0122">The method also optionally includes a means for transferring air from the space to an absorbent media. Air may be transferred by normal flow of air by movement of the device or user/device, or by ambient wind currents, or by an air transferring device. The air transferring device may be an air pump, or fan or an air blower which exerts a positive pressure causing the air to be directed through the absorbent media by tubing, conduit, ducts and the like. Alternatively, the air may be directed through the media in which the air transfer device is arranged to create a negative pressure on the exit port of the media, causing the air to be drawn through the media by a sucking action. In addition, the air may be directed through the media using both a positive and a negative air transferring devices in tandem.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0123]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0118" num="0123">The air transferring device is typically one that is powered by electricity, including AC current common to the region, or DC battery powered, e.g., portable battery packs or batteries from a vehicle or a solar powered battery.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0125]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0120" num="0125">In accordance with this aspect, an air pumps capable of capturing the air in the enclosed space and moving it through an exit port can be used as the air transferring device. The exit port can be fitted with tubing, pipes or similar flexible conduit to direct the captured air to the absorbent media. For example, the tubing can be immersed in an absorbent liquid, such as water, water containing another solvent, scavenger or other additive, so the air from the exit port passes through the liquid. To improve the effectiveness of absorption of the pollutants in the exit port air, the tube may be fitted with a diffusing device such as air stone so that smaller air bubbles are formed. The agitation of the air in the water promotes mixing of the liquid absorbent media, but further agitation or stirring can also be applied to maximize contact of the exit port air with all components of the absorbent media. Thus the pollutants are collected in the absorbable media and depending on the presence of additional scavenging agents, are further neutralized, chelated, entrained, or chemically transformed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0126]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0121" num="0126">When two non-miscible liquids are used as the absorbent media, the pollutant is removed into one or both liquids. In one embodiment when two non-miscible liquids are used, one being water and the other a hydrophobic liquid such as silicone or vegetable oil, the pollutant is selectively extracted from the air by absorption into the water layer and the oily layer being less dense than water lays on top of the water layer, acting as a barrier preventing the water trapped pollutants for re-entering the enclosed space. The ratio of oily to aqueous liquids can be adjusted. Another advantage of this system is that when the upper layer is an oil, evaporation of water is reduced, particularly when the device is not in use. An additional advantage is that retention of water soluble contaminants such as formaldehyde is improved.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0127]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0122" num="0127">Combinations of one or more aqueous or non-aqueous liquids can also be used, either combined in one vessel or can used individually in different vessels, e.g., one vessel can have water and another vessel can oil. The selection of liquids and number of containers provides for customizing systems depending on the contaminants present. Furthermore, the disposal and replenishment of each liquid can be performed on an as-needed basis.</div>

One such example is a cartridge filter which contains a solid support such as cotton, and the cotton contains pre-absorbed water up to the saturation point. Alternatively, another cartridge can be containing a drying agent, such as anhydrous calcium chloride, sodium sulfate and the like.</div>

Adding a disinfectant such as hydrogen peroxide or peracid into the sparging solution, one may control viruses, bacterial or mold spores. Such additives, or scavengers can be added in a sparging solution as needed.

Examples of such would be mixing of acids and bases such as sulfuric acid and an amine, strong oxidants and reducible materials such as permanganate and glycol. Those skilled in the art would recognize such incompatible additives and not make such combinations. On the other hand, an advantageous aspect of the invention is that such normally incompatible additives can be placed in separate vessels when more than one vessel is used in a sparging system, such as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-15</figref>, and because of their different properties, enhance the utility of the system for the removal of wide variety of contaminants.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0140]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0131" num="0140">Some volatile compounds can be also added to absorbent liquid as additives for achieving similar or different functions. For example, bleach can be used for air disinfection; others such as fragrances, e.g., vanilla can be added. Release of the desirable disinfectant or fragrance can be controlled by sparging through the absorbent liquid that contains substances (additives) of low solubility in the absorbent liquid, and/or with a vapor pressure sufficient to cause release into the environmental space. The amount of disinfectant can be controlled to the desirable level by varying the properties of the absorbent liquid.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0141]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0132" num="0141">Some additives can also serve as indicators, i.e., to alert a user of that absorbent liquid has lost effectiveness, and should be changed or replenished.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0142]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0133" num="0142">Some additives, such as salt, may be suspended in the absorbent liquid in excess beyond saturation in order to extend the absorbing liquid (sparging solution) use time, allowing the prolonged use of the sparging solutions and avoiding frequent replenishment of the sparging solution. Through a simple calculation, one may determine the amount of extra solid NaCl that is needed to be added to a sparging solution in order to achieve certain length of time for effective humidity control. For example, the solubility of NaCl is 359 g/L or 35.9 g/100 mL, thus if 359 g excess solid NaCl is added to a NaCl saturated solution, this excess NaCl will be able to take 1 liter of water from the air moisture to form saturated NaCl solution, which can continue take water from moist air.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0173]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0164" num="0173">It has been shown that formaldehyde is readily removed by sparging the contaminated air through a vessel containing water as the absorbent liquid. Even in the absence of formaldehyde neutralizers or scavengers as additives, water is an effective solvent for formaldehyde because of its high solubility in water. The high formaldehyde solubility is due to the hydration of formaldehyde in water. Formaldehyde forms methylene diol or hydrated formaldehyde. Methylene diol, compared to formaldehyde itself, is much more stable in water and gaseous formaldehyde in the air is highly volatile.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0174]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0165" num="0174">While sparging of the environmental air contaminated with formaldehyde can be achieved using a single vessel containing a formaldehyde-absorbent liquid, such as water, an aspect of the present includes a dual sparging solution system using two vessels or reservoirs for removal or trapping formaldehyde. This allows for more thorough removal because after the first sparging solution, the remaining formaldehyde vapor exiting the first vessel is again spared through the second vessel solution to effectively significantly reduce the formaldehyde concentration.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0175]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0166" num="0175">The humidity control as provided in one aspect of the present invention is of added benefit for the application of the invention for air cleaning, such as for formaldehyde removal. Without humidity control the use of water alone as absorbent liquid, while removing formaldehyde could raise the humidity level of the environmental space to unacceptable levels. In addition, sparging into a vessel containing water in the absence of a humidity modifier additive will produce purified, but highly humid air, raising the humidity of the remove and requiring frequent replenishing or replacement of the water in the vessel. However, through the use of other absorbent liquids such as saturated sodium chloride or glycerin, the formaldehyde is removed and humidity remains in a desired level. Many other materials can serve the same purpose as drying agents, including most inorganic salts and super water absorbents (SWA). Details can be found from the book: “Desiccants and humectants (Chemical technology review)” 1973 by Ronald W James.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0176]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0167" num="0176">A feature of this aspect is that the level of the absorbent liquid is maintained throughout the bubbling process, as compared to the use of water alone.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0177]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0168" num="0177">In another aspect of the invention, the absorbent liquid can be pure water (only) which is frequently changed and discarded as pollutants are removed. This would be especially for initial use when the air is highly contaminated or dirty, such as found in new construction, where the air is heavily polluted; (2) use formulated liquid which lasts for long time due to evaporation control. Once the air has reached a lower level of contamination, the absorbent liquid can be changed to one which does not readily evaporate and can control humidity.</div>

Systems as described in the examples below and the figures provide for methods that can be used in places where users are not able to prevent such smoke from occurring such as hotel rooms, public areas such as airports, train stations, offices and restrooms. The rooms may be subjected to air cleaning using the sparging method described in order to remove smoke that may be present. The air in multiple rooms of a house, hotel or office building can be purified simultaneously by a single, central apparatus, with appropriate conduits for collecting and returning the air to each room. The most harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke can be removed easily by current technology. Nicotine is both water soluble and also oil soluble. A few other chemicals, like nicotine, belong to alkaloids, can be easily retained by acidic liquid after forming salts. These salts are no longer volatile which are otherwise very difficult to scavenge. Other harmful components such as carbon monoxide, cyanide can be also removed after passing a liquid phase.</div>

By using an absorbent liquid, containing an oxidant or other neutralizer, removal of known odor causing vapors such as sulfur-containing organics, hydrogen sulfide, thiols and the like can be readily removed. Additives that employ complex or precipitation technology can be combined either in series or together with the oxidants to reduce the volatility of the stench-causing compound sand make them to stay in absorbent liquid. For example, an additive would be the use of simple metal ions such as Cu<sup>2+</sup>, which forms stable precipitates or complexes with many undesirable contaminants containing thiol (—SH) groups. These S-containing compounds are often degraded protein materials causing bad order and smell. One may also use vegetable oil as the absorbent liquid in order to dissolve hydrophobic compounds, e.g., thiols.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0208]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0195" num="0208">Recently, there has been an interest in the field of building science and architecture in using humidity buffering as a passive indoor climate control, thus reducing the need for air conditioning and ventilation. An example is silica gel which is used to buffer relative humidity inside museum display cases, packaged clothing, electronics and anything that might be damaged by condensation, or in the example of museum display cases, being too low an RH (relative humidity) as the silica will help protect the objects displayed from mechanical damage due to shrinking and growing with RH changes. There is also a particular need to control humidity in geographic areas subject to seasonal variations of climate, resulting in uncomfortable conditions for occupants, and for conditions which may result in spoilage of food or goods from spoilage or insect damage.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0209]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0196" num="0209">An aspect of the current invention provides a method for humidity buffering.in and enclosed space, thus reducing the need for air conditioning and ventilation. The relative humidity is controlled by taking advantage of the hygroscopic property of an aqueous solution containing a humidity controlling agent. In practice, the humidity can be controlled in several ways depending on the ambient relative humidity of the environmental air and the exact composition of the aqueous solution/controlling agent. For example, a glycerin/water solution may serve as drying purpose if a high concentration of glycerin is used. This drying power will diminish if enough water is captured by the sparging system. Conversely, if the glycerin concentration is low enough or if the environment is dry enough, a glycerin/water solution can return water to the air using the same device Thus, a desired humidity can be reached and maintained by the sparging apparatus, by selecting the appropriate water/glycerin/additive combination.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0210]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0197" num="0210">The use of sodium chloride solution especially a more concentrated sodium chloride solution has several advantages. Sodium chloride is inexpensive, non-toxic, household chemical which is easily available. The humidity range from the sparging technology falls in the comfortable range for human beings and many other animals including pets (40-70% for human). This makes saturated sodium chloride a very practical liquid for humidity control, in that one may conveniently dispose the used sparging solution.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0211]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0198" num="0211">By use of the aspects taught in the present invention, humidity can be controlled so that the comfort range is achieved. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, a sparging system is illustrated in which two vessels are utilized, each of which containing a separate liquid. Solution A for example may contain a solution such as sat sodium chloride which will remove moisture from the air and Solution B may contain just water which will add humidity to the air. It would be expected that feedback from sensors for humidity can be coupled either mechanically or electronically to a switch as illustrated, directing air to one vessel or the other as needed, in order to maintain relative humidity in the desired range. Other absorbent liquids, such as glycerin, or an absorbent liquid additive mixture can be used for the control of humidity of the enclosed spaces, as shown in the examples below.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0212]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0199" num="0212">In another aspect of the invention, the temperature of the air being treated can be controlled by controlling the temperature of the absorbent liquid, and the volume of liquid used in the vessel. In one embodiment of this aspect, the vessel can be a large reservoir of water that originates from natural sources, such as lakes, rivers, streams or ground water which are normally found at a constant temperature, usually cooler than summer air temperatures found in environmental spaces and warmer than that found in winter. The sparging of the air through such a large reservoir of water will result in heat exchange from the air to the water, cooling the air in summer, and warming it in winter. This can take place concomitantly with removal of pollutants from the same air.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0213]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0200" num="0213">The water from these sources can be used as the absorbent liquid, either alone or in combination with additives as described above. Disposal of the liquid used in the treatment in which contaminants may be present can be returned to the original source either directly, or after treatment by conventional means is required to remove undesirable contaminants captured from the air. In one embodiment, the contaminated water can be stored in temporary holding tanks which can be decontaminated by additives, flocculants and the like, or be exposed to sunlight, or added UV light, to bring about chemical degradation of the contaminants, with the optional addition of catalysts such as titanium dioxide. The holding tank may also function as a heat exchanger, allowing the contents to reach ambient temperatures; this embodiment would be effective in regions where the day/night temperature range differs significantly.</div>
