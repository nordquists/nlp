<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Pirfenidone is small molecule with a molecular weight of 185.23 daltons whose chemical name is 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone. Pirfenidone has anti-fibrotic properties and has been investigated for therapeutic benefits to patients suffering from various fibrotic conditions. It is approved in Japan for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) under the trade name Pirespa®.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Pirfenidone has been shown to be metabolized by various isoforms of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) protein [See the Report on the Deliberation Results, Evaluation and Licensing Division, Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau, Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare, Sep. 16, 2008]. Specifically, several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1) were involved in the earliest stages of oxidative metabolism of pirfenidone.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Fluvoxamine belongs to a class of therapeutics known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The SSRIs are a group of antidepressants with similar pharmacologic effects, but with different chemical structures. Fluvoxamine has been approved for treatment of social anxiety disorder (social phobia), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and has been prescribed to treat major depression, and other anxiety disorders such as panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder [McClellan et al., (Drugs October 2000). “Fluvoxamine An Updated Review of its Use in the Management of Adults with Anxiety Disorders”. <i>Adis Drug Evaluation </i>60 (4): 925-954]. In addition to fluvoxamine, other clinically available SSRIs are citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline. The elimination of these lipophilic compounds proceeds predominantly via oxidation catalysed by CYP in the liver. SSRIs have the potential for inhibition of CYP enzymes [Brosen, The pharmacogenetics of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. <i>Clin Invest </i>71(12):1002-1009, 1993]. Jeppesen et al. reported that fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 in humans in vivo [Jeppesen et al., Dose-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 by citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine. <i>Eur J Clin Pharmacol </i>51: 73-78, 1996]. Fluvoxamine has also been shown to be a very potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 in vitro [Brosen et al., Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P4501A2<i>. Biochem Pharmacol </i>45:1211-1214, 1993; Rasmussen et al., Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and theophylline metabolism in human liver microsomes: potent inhibition by fluvoxamine. <i>Br J Clin Pharmacol </i>39:151-159, 1995].</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention disclosed herein is based on the discovery of an adverse drug interaction between pirfenidone and fluvoxamine.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention generally relates to improved uses and methods of administering pirfenidone to a patient in need of pirfenidone therapy, and to methods of preparing or packaging pirfenidone medicaments, containers, packages and kits. In any of the aspects or embodiments, the patient may have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and the medicament is for treatment of IPF. In any of the aspects or embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount of pirfenidone being administered may be a daily dosage of 2400 mg or 2403 mg per day. In any of the aspects of the invention, the daily dosage may be administered in divided doses three times a day, or two times a day, or alternatively is administered in a single dose once a day. In any of the aspects of the invention, the pirfenidone may be administered with food. For example, the daily dosage of 2400 mg or 2403 mg pirfenidone per day may be administered as follows: 801 mg taken three times a day, with food.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In some aspects, the invention provides a method of administering pirfenidone therapy to a patient in need of pirfenidone therapy (e.g., a patient with IPF), involving administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of pirfenidone, and avoiding administration of fluvoxamine despite the patient being in need of fluvoxamine therapy.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">In other aspects, the invention provides a method of administering pirfenidone therapy to a patient in need of pirfenidone therapy, comprising discontinuing administration of fluvoxamine to avoid an adverse drug interaction and administering a therapeutically effective amount of pirfenidone. In one embodiment, the patient is in need of and thus is receiving fluvoxamine, and fluvoxamine is discontinued concurrent with starting administration of pirfenidone. In another embodiment, fluvoxamine is discontinued within at least 3 days to 1 month prior to or after starting pirfenidone therapy. This time period, for example, permits adequate time for tapering and withdrawal without adverse effects. In one example, in a method of administering a therapeutically effective amount of pirfenidone to a patient with IPF, the invention provides an improvement that comprises avoiding or discontinuing administration of fluvoxamine and administering a therapeutically effective amount of pirfenidone.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, an adverse drug interaction can include reduced clearance of pirfenidone, the potential for reduced clearance of pirfenidone, increased exposure to pirfenidone, or the potential for increased exposure to pirfenidone.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, an aspect of the invention provides pirfenidone for use in treating a patient in need of pirfenidone therapy, characterized in that the treating comprises avoiding, contraindicating or discontinuing concomitant use (or co-administration) of fluvoxamine. In some embodiments, the concomitant use of fluvoxamine is avoided, contraindicated or discontinued, in order to avoid reduced clearance of pirfenidone, or the potential for reduced clearance of pirfenidone. In some embodiments, the concomitant use of fluvoxamine is avoided, contraindicated or discontinued, in order to avoid increased exposure to pirfenidone, or the potential for increased exposure to pirfenidone. Administration of pirfenidone in patients that concomitantly use or are being administered fluvoxamine results in about a 6-fold increase in pirfenidone exposure. It is understood that any of the aspects or embodiments or examples described herein with respect to methods of treatment apply to this aspect of the invention that provides pirfenidone for use in treating a patient. For example, the patient may be a patient with IPF, and the therapeutically effective amount administered may be 2400 or 2403 mg per day.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Similarly, a further aspect of the invention provides the use of pirfenidone in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a patient in need of pirfenidone therapy, characterized in that the treating comprises avoiding, contraindicating or discontinuing concomitant use (or co-administration) of fluvoxamine. It is understood that any of the aspects or embodiments or examples described herein with respect to methods of treatment or “pirfenidone for use” in treating a patient apply to this aspect of the invention that provides for the use of pirfenidone in manufacture of a medicament. For example, the patient may be a patient with IPF, and the therapeutically effective amount administered may be 2400 or 2403 mg per day.</div>

In some embodiments, the patient is a patient in need of therapy with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, or a moderate to strong CYP1A2 inhibitor. In some embodiments, the patient is a patient in need of fluvoxamine therapy. In some embodiments, the patient is a patient who is avoiding concomitant use of fluvoxamine, e.g. because concomitant use of pirfenidone with fluvoxamine is contraindicated. In some embodiments, the patient is a patient who was or is being administered a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, or a moderate to strong CYP1 A2 inhibitor, e.g. fluvoxamine. In some embodiments, the patient is a patient who has discontinued use of a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, or a moderate to strong CYP1A2 inhibitor prior to the initiation of pirfenidone therapy in order to avoid reduced clearance (or increased exposure to) pirfenidone, or the potential for reduced clearance of (or increased exposure to) pirfenidone. In some embodiments, the patient is a patient who has discontinued use of fluvoxamine prior to the initiation of pirfenidone therapy in order to avoid reduced clearance of pirfenidone, or the potential for reduced clearance of pirfenidone. In some embodiments, the patient is a patient who has discontinued use of fluvoxamine prior to the initiation of pirfenidone therapy in order to avoid increased exposure to pirfenidone, or the potential for increased exposure to pirfenidone. In some embodiments, the patient is a patient who has discontinued administration of the strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, or moderate to strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, e.g., fluvoxamine, within 1 month, or within 2 weeks, prior to starting pirfenidone therapy, or concurrent with starting pirfenidone therapy.

<li> <para-num num="[0037]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0037">Pirfenidone is an orally active, anti-fibrotic agent. Results of in vivo experiments indicated that pirfenidone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (approx. 48%) with multiple other CYPs contributing as well (each &lt;13%) (i.e., 1A1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 2J2, 3A4, 3A5, 4A11, and 4F2). Oral administration of pirfenidone results in the formation of four metabolites, 5 hydroxymethyl-pirfenidone, 5 carboxy-pirfenidone, 4′-hydroxy-pirfenidone, and the 5 O-acyl glucuronide metabolite of 5 carboxy-pirfenidone. In humans, only pirfenidone and 5-carboxy-pirfenidone are present in plasma in significant quantities; none of the other metabolites occur in sufficient quantities to allow for PK analysis. There are no unique human metabolites.</div>

It also resulted in an average 2-fold increase in Cmax, the mean maximum plasma concentration. Depending on the circumstances, FDA draft guidance suggests that a drug-drug interaction is present when comparisons indicate twofold or greater systemic exposure for a drug when given in combination with the second drug, compared to when given alone.

Fifty-four subjects were to be enrolled in two groups, consisting of 27 subjects who were smokers (Group 1) and 27 subjects who were nonsmokers (Group 2). Smoking induces CYP1A2 activity. Each group (smokers and nonsmokers) was to include a minimum of nine females and nine males, and attempts were to be made to enroll equal numbers of each sex in each group. Each subject was to receive a single 801-mg dose of pirfenidone on Days 1 and 11. Fluvoxamine dosing was started on Day 2 and titrated to the final dose according to the following schedule:

The structural model for the analysis was obtained from a preliminary population PK analysis. This population PK model was fit to the pirfenidone and 5 carboxy-pirfenidone plasma concentration-time data from Days 1 and 11 separately. Once a final population PK model was defined, AUC<sub>0-28 </sub>estimates were generated by simulating plasma PK profiles and compared for statistically significant differences between days (to test the effect of fluvoxamine co-administration) and between groups (to test the effect of smoking status).</div>

The analysis of the effect of fluvoxamine (i.e., Day 1 versus Day 11) was analyzed using the FDA criteria for bioequivalence for paired data (FDA 2003). The ratio of AUC<sub>0-28 </sub>on Day 11 to that on Day 1 was used to test for the interaction between smoking status and fluvoxamine coadministration. If other subject characteristics (such as body size or age) were also associated with the ratio of AUC<sub>0-28 </sub>on Day 11 to that on Day 1, the significance of these covariates was also tested. The significance of differences in pirfenidone and 5-carboxy-pirfenidone AUC<sub>0-28 </sub>estimates on Day 1 in smokers and nonsmokers was tested using multivariable linear regression in order to take into account the effects of other significant covariates.</div>
