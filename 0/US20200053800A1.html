<h2>Abstract</h2>

<div class="abstract">Methods, devices and systems are provided for performing a random access (RA) procedure. A wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU) may be configured to receive RA resource sets, where each of the RA resource sets is associated with a node-B directional beam, select an RA resource set from among the RA resource sets, and initiate an RA procedure based on the selected RA resource set. The RA procedure may include selecting multiple preambles which include a preamble for each resource of a plurality of resources corresponding to the selected RA resource set. The WTRU may be configured to sequentially transmit the selected multiple preambles in sequential RA transmissions, and may be configured to receive, from a node-B, in response to the RA transmissions, at least one RA response (RAR), where each of the received at least one RAR corresponds to one of the transmitted multiple preambles.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to meet the high data rate required for the next generation of cellular communication systems, above-6 GHz frequencies, e.g., at centimeter wave (cmW) and millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies, have been explored. The large bandwidth available at these frequencies may provide enormous capacity improvements for user-specific data transmissions. One challenge of using these above-6 GHz frequencies may be characteristics related to their propagation which may be unfavorable for wireless communication, especially in an outdoor environment. For example, higher frequency transmissions may experience higher free space path loss. Rainfall and atmospheric gasses, e.g., oxygen, may add further attenuation and foliage may cause attenuation and depolarization. The narrow beam pattern which may be used to counter these losses may pose challenges for an evolved node B (eNB), for example, in delivering cell-specific or broadcast information. As a result, initial mmW access link system design may focus on specific cellular system procedures that enable add-on mmW data transmissions, for example, at least downlink transmissions to an existing network such as a small cell Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0078]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, a directional transmit or receive beam is formed by a WTRU applying specific weight to each antenna elements of the antenna solution, be it a digital antenna array implementation as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in which the weight is comprised of both amplitude and phase, or an analogue phase antenna array implementation as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which comprises a phase-only weight. The weights are selected by an algorithm or function within the WTRU to form an antenna pattern, i.e., a transmit beam or a receive beam, with the main lobe of the beam (the maximum gain of the antenna pattern) pointed to a direction in both azimuth and elevation plan (3D direction) that is intended by the algorithm and function. A receive beam sweep is performed by applying a set of weights, sequentially, one at a time, and each time the applied weight is changed an antenna pattern is generated whose main lobe will be placed at a new direction. The covered direction of each beam over time will constitute a sweep coverage which can be the sum of the antenna pattern coverage. For example, consider if an antenna array is configured to form a 15-degree receive beam in azimuth plane and to provide a 90 degree coverage. In such a case, there will be six weights and each weight will move the main lobe of the beam by 15 degrees. If each antenna pattern is maintained for one TTI, this beam sweep of 90 degree coverage will take 6 TTIs. In contrast, an omnidirectional antenna is a class of antenna which radiates radio wave power uniformly in all directions in one plane, with the radiated power decreasing with elevation angle above or below the plane, dropping to zero on the antenna's axis.</div>

This may result in a flat effective channel by excluding angular incoming paths outside of its beamwidth. A Release 12 LTE WTRU may be assumed to have an omni-directional receive beam pattern and consequently may perceive a superimposed channel impulse response over the entire angular domain. Therefore, an aligned mmW transmit beam and mmW receive beam pair (i.e., mmW or narrow transmit and receive beam pair) may provide an additional degree of freedom in the angular domain compared with the current LTE system. Accordingly, the mmW downlink system design for the SCmB deployment is focused on integrating the directivity of a narrow transmit and receive beam pair into cellular system procedures including L1 control signaling, mmW data scheduling, narrow beam paring, beam measurement, mmW L1 control information feedback, and the like.</div>
