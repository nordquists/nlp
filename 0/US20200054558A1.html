</li> <heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Disclosed embodiments relate generally to aerosol formulations and medical devices, systems and methods for delivering the same. More particularly, disclosed embodiments relate to compositions, systems and methods for delivering medicaments transnasally into the lungs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Aerosolized medicines are frequently used to treat individuals suffering from respiratory disease. For example, one known method for treating cystic fibrosis (CF) includes restoring hydration to the affected airway surfaces via the inhalation of a hypertonic osmolyte solution, which draws water onto the airway surface. Known methods often administer a seven percent (7%) hypertonic saline (HS) solution Rehydration of the lubricant periciliary layer (PCL) of the airway surface facilitates mucus clearance (MC) and, therefore, the removal of inhaled infectious agents.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Known methods for delivering aerosolized medicaments include the inhalation of aerosols orally i.e., via an oral mouth piece or a spacer inserted into the patient's mouth. Some known systems for oral inhalation include nebulizer devices, such as jet nebulizers, vibrating mesh nebulizers or ultrasonic nebulizers, or metered dose inhalers (MDIs), or dry powder inhalers (DPIs) to generate respirable aerosol particles (e.g., particles that are &lt;10 μm in diameter) from a liquid medicament, suspension and/or dry powder. Such known systems and methods for oral delivery, however, often present an undesirable time burden on the patient. For example, some known systems require 10-20 minutes to deliver a single dose of medication. For subjects with chronic pulmonary disease for which the treatment regiment includes multiple daily aerosol treatments, the time burden associated with oral drug delivery via jet nebulizers can become substantial. It is not uncommon for patients undergoing treatment for cystic fibrosis to spend 2-3 hours per day on the recommended treatments (Flume et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007 Nov. 15:176(10):957-69: Sawicki et al., J Cyst Fibros. 2009 March; 8(2):91-6).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, some studies of treatment protocols for cystic fibrosis have suggested that an increased number of treatments per day and/or delivery of higher amounts of salt. For example, two studies have described (1) the short term (two weeks) beneficial effects of inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) four times daily on pulmonary function, MCC, and quality of life (Donaldson et al., N Engl J Med. 2006 Jan. 19; 354(3):241-50) and (2) the long term (one year) benefits of inhaled HS twice daily on lung function and reduction in pulmonary exacerbations (Elkins et al., N Engl J Med, 354(3):229-40(2006)). A comparison of the Donaldson versus Elkins suggests that the “more salt” delivered, the greater the benefit in lung function. In particular, subjects in the Donaldson study exhibited a mean improvement in lung function (147 ml improvement in FEV1) with four times daily administration (3.6 ml of 7% HS predicted pulmonary deposition), which as approximately twice the improvement that was achieved in the Elkins study (68 ml improvement in FEV1) with B.I.D. dosing (1.58 ml of 7% HS predicted pulmonary deposition) Thus, as treatment regimens are improved to maximize the benefits of HS administration, the time burden associated with oral drug deliver via jet nebulizers will likely be exacerbated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to the undesirable time burden associated with known methods for oral delivery of aerosolized medicaments, known methods of periodic delivery over relatively short time periods (e.g., 5 to 20 minutes per treatment) results in the delivery of medicaments as concentrated “boluses,” which can be undesirable. The delivery of medicaments as a bolus leads to a rapid increase of the active therapeutic agent at the targeted location over a short period of time, often at levels above the necessary therapeutic concentration. Similarly, bolus delivery can lead to high systemic exposure to such agents. Such peak local and systemic concentrations following bolus administration of inhaled aerosols can lead to undesirable safety and tolerability profiles, which may prevent adoption of the therapy into the standard of care. For example, chronic inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to have disease-modifying impact on the rate of lung function decline in CF (Ren et al, J Pediatr., 153(6):746-51(2008), de Boeck et al., Eur Respir J. 37(5): 1091-5 (2011)). Such methods, however, are accompanied by patients' decreased linear growth, and increased insulin/oral hypoglycemic use due to the systemic exposure. As such, inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended for general treatment of CF lung disease (Flume et al, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007 Nov. 15; 176(10):957-69).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In response to the high time burden associated with oral delivery and/or the desire increase the mass of salt delivered, some known nebulizers have been developed to deliver an aerosol dose more quickly, such as, for example, within two to five minutes. Although such known systems and methods may slightly shorten the treatment duration, even short aerosol administrations of several different therapeutic agents several times per day can result in a significant treatment burden. Moreover, as discussed above, some therapeutic agents may not be suitable (effective and/or safe) for administration via an aerosol bolus delivered over short periods.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, delivery of up to 12% HS was evaluated (Robinson et al., Thorax 1997 October; 52(10):900-3), and resulted in the conclusion that HS concentrations higher than seven percent are not well tolerated using known methods of aerosol delivery. Lack of tolerability of HS therapy can be related to high rates of emission of NaCl mass from the nebulizer mouthpiece, which leads to high exposure of oropharyngeal surfaces to HS. Similarly, the high rates of NaCl mass deposition in the lung can lead to adverse events such as chest tightness, cough and acute decreases in lung function (Elkins et al.). In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), high rates of NaCl delivery initiate histamine release, which contributes to airway spasm (Taube et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2001 Nov. 15; 164 (10 Pt 1): 1810-5). On a cellular level, administration of high rate of NaCl mass to the airway epithelium substantially dehydrates the airway epithelial cells, which can lead to cell shrinkage, inhibition of ciliary beat frequency and release of inflammatory stimuli leading to pulmonary inflammation (Zhou et al., Journal of Cystic Fibrosis Vol, lOSupplement 1, Page S I 8). Accordingly, using known methods to increase the rate of delivery of an aerosolized medicament can be undesirable.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Other known methods for delivering aerosolized medicaments include transnasal delivery of the aerosolized medicament to the affected airways. Some known systems for transnasal delivery include a long, relatively narrow nasal cannula, through which the aerosolized medicament is transported. Such known systems and methods for transnasal delivery, however, often result in undesirable rainout and/or sputtering of the medicament as it passes through the nasal cannula.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, known systems and methods for transnasal delivery often result in very low deposition efficiencies of aerosol deposition in the lung due to aerosol impaction in the nasal passages. For example, a study by Chua et al. showed overall deposition efficiencies of less than about three percent (as compared with deposition efficiencies of approximately 15 percent or higher for oral delivery of aerosolized medicaments). In particular, the study showed that only 0.3% of the emitted dose was deposited in the lungs in infants 0.3 to 1.4 month of age; only 2.9% of the emitted dose deposited in the lungs of pediatric subjects 6.3 to 11.5 years of age; and only 2.7% of the emitted dose deposited in the lungs of subjects 15 years of age and older. (See generally H Chua et al., <i>Eur. Respir. J. </i>7, 2185-2191 (1994)). More recently, Vecellio et al. reported a 3.7% pulmonary deposition efficiency based on the dose from a nasal sonic jet nebulizer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, a need exists for improved compositions, systems and methods for delivering medicaments transnasally into the lungs.</div>

For example, in some embodiments, the nasal cannula assembly <b>500</b> can be configured such that a flow therethrough having a VMD of not greater than approximately 1.9 μm will result in minimal rainout and/or sputtering. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the aerosol preparation assembly <b>100</b> can be configured to receive an input aerosol A<sub>IN </sub>(see e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and produce an outlet aerosol A<sub>OUT </sub>(see e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) having a VMD of not greater than approximately 1.9 μm. In this manner the aerosol delivery system <b>10</b> can effectively perform the methods described herein.</div>

More particularly, it is known that the nose is an effective filter for particles that are greater than approximately 2-3 μm. Thus, transnasal delivery of aerosols having a VMD of, for example, 6 μm, will result in low rates of deposition into the lower airways. Accordingly, in addition to configuring the aerosol delivery system <b>10</b> to produce a flow of aerosol in which rainout and/or sputtering is minimized, in some embodiments, the delivery system <b>10</b> is also configured to produce an aerosol having a particle size within a predetermined range (e.g., 1.4 μm) to accommodate a particular method of treatment and/or to deliver a medicament having a particular composition.</div>

The cartridge <b>2300</b>′ includes a medicament reservoir/container <b>2310</b> and a valve <b>2330</b>. The reservoir <b>2310</b> defines a volume <b>2312</b> containing a medicament to be delivered. The valve <b>2330</b> controls flow between the reservoir <b>2310</b> and the aerosol generator. In some embodiments, the valve <b>2330</b> can be further configured to limit head pressure on the aerosol generator. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> shows the valve <b>2330</b> in an open position, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A, 17C</figref> shows the valve <b>2330</b> in a closed position. In this manner, aspects of some embodiments are operable to prevent damage to the aerosol generator, ensure desired performance of the aerosol generator or the like.

As also illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-17B</figref>, the valve <b>2330</b> can extend through the reservoir <b>2310</b> to provide a manipulation means for switching the open/closed state of the valve.</div>

In some embodiments, a nasal cannula is configured to minimize rainout and/or sputtering of the aerosolized particles. For example, in some embodiments, a nasal cannula can be configured to minimize and/or eliminate sedimentation and/or impaction of the aerosol as the aerosol is conveyed therethrough. In some embodiments, a nasal cannula and a portion of the aerosol preparation assembly (e.g., the cannula outlet port <b>1230</b>) can be configured to collectively include a substantially continuous inner surface at the junction between the nasal cannula and the aerosol preparation assembly, as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0137]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0139" num="0137">In some embodiments, delivery of an aerosol via nasal cannula over extended periods of time (e.g., longer than 30 minutes) while minimizing rainout is performed by a delivery system (e.g., the system <b>1000</b>) that includes a nasal cannula that is matched to (i.e., that functions cooperatively with) the aerosol preparation device (e.g., the aerosol preparation device <b>1110</b>). For example, nasal cannulas with larger diameter tubing and fewer impaction surfaces may be used to deliver aerosols containing a larger volume of particles above 2, 3 and 4 μm, respectively. Conversely, nasal cannulas with smaller diameter tubing may result in a higher velocity of the aerosol therethrough, but may also result in increased impaction. Accordingly, smaller diameter cannulas may be more capable of conducting aerosols over extended periods of time and at sufficient output levels where the aerosol contains a smaller volume of particles above 2, 3, and 4 μm, respectively. Thus, in some embodiments, a nasal cannula assembly includes components and is sized to be tolerable to patients (e.g., having an appropriate diameter, being configured to minimize rainout and/or sputter), while also being capable of delivering the desired dosage.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0138]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0140" num="0138">More specifically, in some embodiments, an inner diameter of a nasal cannula assembly can be selected to reduce gravitational sedimentation of the aerosol particles, which can accumulate as rainout in the cannula. For example, sedimentation may be reduced by decreasing the diameter of the tubing (such as the tube <b>1530</b>) used in the cannula assembly, thereby producing an increased velocity with which the aerosol travels through the nasal cannula. Moreover, methods according to an embodiment can include increasing the airflow from 1 to 2 L/min to 3 to 4 L/min, and/or higher.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0139]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0141" num="0139">In some embodiments, a nasal cannula assembly can be configured to reduce inertial impaction of the aerosol particles on the side walls thereof, which can accumulate as rainout in the cannula assembly. For example, in some embodiments, a nasal cannula assembly can include a bifurcation structure having a geometric shape to reduce impaction at a bifurcation point (e.g., at the interface between the supply tubing and the face-piece tubing). In other embodiments, portions of a nasal cannula assembly can be constructed such that the inner surfaces are smooth and substantially free from ridges, surface roughness or the like.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0140]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0142" num="0140">In some embodiments, a nasal cannula assembly can be devoid of a bifurcation joint. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, reduced rainout may be achieved, for example, by eliminating the bifurcation junction and by using a single line of supply tubing. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, a nasal cannula assembly <b>1700</b> includes supply tubing <b>1710</b>, a dummy face-piece arm <b>1730</b> and nasal prongs <b>1740</b>. Notably, the nasal cannula assembly <b>1700</b> does not include a bifurcation junction, and therefore, the rainout prior to the nose prongs <b>1740</b> may be reduced. In some embodiments, the dummy face-piece arm <b>1730</b> may be included to help secure the prongs <b>1740</b> on the patient; however, the face-piece arm <b>1730</b> may or may not be in fluid communication with the prongs <b>1740</b>. A stopper or wall (not shown) may separate the prongs <b>1740</b> from the dummy face-piece arm <b>1730</b> such that the delivered aerosol A<sub>DEL </sub>is prevented from entering the dummy face-piece arm <b>1730</b>. It should be understood that, in some embodiments, the dummy face-piece arm <b>1730</b> may be a hollow tube fluidly connected to the prongs <b>1740</b> and/or provide a drainage conduit for removing rainout and/or sputter.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0141]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0143" num="0141">In some embodiments, rainout and/or sputtering may be reduced by using two separate supply lines.

Accordingly, a bifurcation junction from a single supply tubing line is eliminated, and two separate inputs to the nasal prongs <b>1840</b> are provided. An exit from the particle selection chamber <b>1230</b> (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) can be modified to include two outputs to accommodate such dual supply lines. Furthermore, two independent particle selection chambers connected to single or two independent aerosol entrainment chambers can be used to provide aerosol supply into the dual cannula supply tubing lines. Furthermore, two or more complete aerosol preparation assembly systems (nebulizer, entrainment chamber and particle selection chamber) can be used to feed into the supply lines. Such an approach may also be used to increase the output from the prongs of the nasal cannula assembly <b>1800</b>.</div>

The individual nasal prongs <b>1940</b>A, <b>1940</b>B reduce rainout and/or sputtering as compared with conventional nasal prongs that induce abrupt changes in the flow path, which may lead to inertial impaction and rainout.</div>

In particular, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, during an 8 hour run with a seven foot Salter HF 1600 cannula (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>) and the aerosol delivery system from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, a rainout of ˜1.1 ml was observed, which caused a reduction in the aerosol output towards the later portion of 8 hour run. During a similar 8 hour run with the nasal cannula <b>1700</b> (which also has a length of 7 feet), a rainout of ˜0.3 ml occurred, and there was substantially no decrease in the aerosol output towards the later portion of 8 hour run (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>).

It was reasoned that the tPAD device must be able to achieve a minimum lung dose to show a clinical benefit. For example, for hypertonic saline use in cystic fibrosis, a NaCl dose previously shown to have clinical benefit is ˜110 mg of NaCl, deposited in the lungs per oral aerosol administration per subject per day, achieved by Elkins et al. via BID dosing of 7% HS with a Pari LC Plus nebulizer. Larger benefits in FEV<sub>1 </sub>were achieved with 250 mg of NaCl, deposited in the lungs per subject per day, as achieved by Donaldson et al. via QID dosing of 7% HS with a Pari LC Plus nebulizer trans-orally. The previously published work on trans-nasally delivery aerosols reported ˜1.5% pulmonary deposition efficiency. Thus, the targeted 5% deposition efficiency was a challenging goal. Once the design of the tPAD device was optimized, the pulmonary deposition of HS administered via the tPAD device in healthy human subjects was evaluated.</div>

Prior to the first deposition study, spirometry testing was performed and a transmission scan, using a planar <sup>57</sup>Co source, was used to outline lung boundaries and define central/peripheral pulmonary regions of interest. We delivered to each subject 7% HS containing <sup>99m</sup>Tc-DTPA, as a radiotracer to quantitate via external radiation counting of deposited aerosol, for 15 minutes with each delivery device during separate study visits according to established methods. The specific activity of the isotope used was adjusted to achieve a similar deposited lung activity after 15 min of nebulization, given the predicted differences in device output (˜0.1 mCi/ml for Pari LC Star and 0.4 mCi/ml for tPAD device). Exhaled aerosols were captured by filter systems uniquely designed for both nebulizer systems to minimize exposure to the volunteers and prevent re-inhalation of aerosols that could confound the interpretation of the data. To acclimatize the subject to the exhalation filter system prior to dosing the radiotracer, unlabeled 7% HS was administered by the tPAD device for 15 minutes. For both devices, subjects were instructed to use their spontaneous breathing patterns. Before the start of nebulization, tPAD and LC Star devices with fill dose of 7% HS (containing <sup>99m</sup>Tc-DTPA) were imaged via a gamma (radiation counting) camera to allow mass balance calculation. Immediately after 15 minutes of 7% HS (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-DTPA) inhalation, an initial radio-aerosol deposition scan was acquired and continuous 1 minute images were recorded for the next 30 minutes. Post-dose spirometry testing was performed after radio-aerosol deposition scans were completed.

The deposition in nasal passages was relatively low and accounted for 7+7% (n=6) of the emitted dose, plus an additional 5±3% (n=6) likely associated with nasal deposition, that was cleared and swallowed prior to initial deposition scan. The tPAD aerosol deposited in a uniform, peripheral airway pattern (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>), with C/P ratio of 1.06±0.07 (n=6), consistent with the optimal dosing for many lung diseases.</div>

Accounting for residual volume left in the LC Star following the completion of 15 minute inhalation, the deposition efficiency based on fill dose was ˜18% which is consistent with previously published values. Based on the C/P analysis (C/P ratio of 1.31±0.21 for Pari LC Star, n=6), the Pari LC Star generated more centrally deposited aerosol, which is consistent with the larger aerosol particles produced by the LC Star (3.6 μm VMD).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0191]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0196" num="0191">Surprisingly, the tPAD trans-nasal delivery performed as well as the most refined of oral jet nebulizers i.e. the LC Star. The tPAD device produces almost an order of magnitude more efficient pulmonary deposition than any other known system to administer aerosols trans-nasally. Based on the 38% deposition efficiency, the tPAD device can administer NaCl doses exceeding the designated 250 mg of NaCl that showed clinical benefit in CF per Donaldson et al. For example, the output of 32 μl/min (or 2.2 mg/min with 7% HS), with an “average” Aeroneb Pro nebulizer, would result in a deposited dose of 401 mg of NaCl over 8 hours (2.2 mg/min×0.38 efficiency×480 min). With “higher-performing” Aeroneb Pro nebulizers, an output of 50 μl/min (or 3.5 mg/min with 7% HS) has been achieved, which would result in a deposited dose of 638 mg. Validated methods to “detune” the performance of the tPAD device to achieve the designated 250 mg dose are readily available (e.g. duty cycle modification for a vibrating mesh nebulizer). Lastly, the observed low nasal deposition was well tolerated in the present study and should be compatible with long term safety and with sleep. In summary, with 30-50 μl/min nasal prong output, 38% deposition efficiency, a desirable peripheral airways deposition pattern in the lung, and favorable safety and tolerability profiles, the tPAD device is able to support trans-nasal administration of therapeutically effective doses of aerosolized therapeutic agents, including overnight HS dosing in CF patients with delivery of therapeutically effective NaCl doses.</div>

In some embodiments, a system and/or method of transnasal delivery can produce a deposition efficiency of greater than 40%, greater than 45%, greater than 50%, greater than 55%, greater than 60%, greater than 65%, greater than 70%, greater than 75% and as much as approximately 80%. For example, when a system is run only during the inhalation cycle, a deposition greater than 40% and/or up to about 80% deposition efficiency can be achieved. In another example, when a system is run continuously, a deposition efficiency of up to about 40% can be achieved. In some embodiments, for example, a method can include producing an aerosol of HS having a concentration of 7% and a VMD of approximately 1.4 μm. The method includes delivering, transnasally, the aerosol into the lungs such that a deposition efficiency of approximately 40% is achieved.</div>

As shown in Table 3, at least 19 μl/min of aerosolized 7% HS emitted from the prongs of nasal cannula is delivered assuming very high 40% depositing of such intranasal aerosol in the lung. Additionally, the method and systems described herein include producing such output consistently and substantially continuously over 8 hours without excessive rainout to deliver the desirable therapeutic dose and be well-tolerated by the patients. By delivering the therapeutic compound at a low rate of deposition over a longer period of time, increased saline concentration can be employed. For example, in some embodiments, a method includes delivering 21% hypertonic saline at a deposition efficiency of 40%, and at an output of 6 μl/min to produce delivery of 250 mg of NaCl into the deep lung of CF patients. If only 50 mg dose of NaCl mass deposited in the lung of patients during eight hour extended aerosol administration would be therapeutically sufficient, with aerosol deposition efficiency of 25% an output of only 2 μl/min of 21% HS aerosol emitted from the prongs of nasal cannula would be needed. For other more potent therapeutic agents, an output of 10-fold or 100-fold lower magnitude (0.2 and 0.02 μl/min respectively) could be sufficient.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0197]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0204" num="0197">In some embodiments, the administering is carried out by aerosol administration. In some embodiments, the administering is carried out by inhalation administration. In some embodiments, the administering is carried out overnight. In some embodiments, the administering is carried out while the subject is sleeping. In some embodiments, the administering is carried out during the day. In some embodiments, the administering is carried out while the subject is awake. In some embodiments, the administering is carried out to a human subject. In some embodiments, the administering is carried out to an animal subject. In some embodiments, the aerosol particle size emitted from the device has 0.5 to 2.5 μm VMD (volume median diameter), with more preferred 1 to 2 μm VMD and most preferred 1.2 to 1.6 μm VMD. In some embodiments, the aerosol particle size distribution is such that there are not more than 10%, 5%, 2.5% and in the most preferred embodiment not more than 1% particles larger than 4 μm based on volume normalized amounts. In some embodiments, the solution can by hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic. In more preferred embodiments, the solution is hypertonic. In some embodiments, NaCl is used to modulate the tonicity of the solution, so that the overall rate of NaCl deposition is likely below 3 mg/min, 2 mg/min or 1 mg/min of NaCl deposited on the surface of the airway epithelium. In some embodiments, NaCl is used to modulate the tonicity of the solution either alone or with combination(s) with other therapeutic agent(s). In some embodiments, other osmolyte agents such as sodium bicarbonate, mannitol, glucose and others are used to modulate the tonicity of the aerosol solution, either alone or in combination with other therapeutic agent(s). In some embodiments, the osmolyte agent concentration is used to modulate deposition fraction of the aerosol in individual portions of the airways (e.g. large airways vs. small airways vs. alveolar regions). In some embodiments, the higher osmolyte concentration is used to increase central deposition of the aerosol, compared to lower osmolyte concentration leading to more peripheral deposition. In some embodiments, the aerosol administration is conducted for extended periods of time, i.e. 60 min to 8 hours and longer, e.g., about 8 to about 24 hours (by sustained administering, infusion administering, or cyclical administering). In some embodiments, the aerosol administration is conducted for shorter periods of time, i.e. 60 min or shorter as a replacement for aerosol administration via 1) jet, vibrating mesh, vibrating horn and ultrasonic nebulizers; 2) MDIs; and 3) DPIs. In some embodiments, the administration is carried out by trans-nasal administration of the aerosol. For example, the aerosol administration can be carried out over a period of more than about 1 hour, or up to about 4 hours, or up to about 6 hours, or up to about 8 hours, or up to about 10 hours, or up to 12 hours, or up to 14 hours, or up to 16 hours, or up to 18 hours, or up to 20 hours, or up to 22 hours, or up to 24 hours, and the aerosol may be administered once each day or multiple times each day if possible.

Abnormal mucus clearance is an important contributor to the phenotype of patients with chronic bronchitis due to environmental or genetic causes. Normal mucus clearance requires 1) adequate hydration of the airway surface and 2) an absence of strong adhesive interaction between the mucus and cell surface. Hydration is formally defined by the concentrations of mucins in the periciliary and mucus layers. Ion transport properties regulate the amount of salt and water (i.e. the solvent) and goblet cells and glands control the concentration of mucins on the airway surface. Both cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and subjects with chronic bronchitis associated with cigarette smoke exposure, i.e., COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), exhibit increases in mucus concentration as quantified by % solids, as a result of reduced airway hydration and mucin hypersecretion, consequent to goblet cell and glandular hyperplasia. Both as a function of disease severity, and in acute exacerbations, raised mucin/mucus concentrations produce adherent mucus that sticks to epithelial cells, initiates inflammatory responses and airway wall injury, and serves as a growth medium for pathogenic microorganisms (Boucher, R. C., “New concepts of the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease-”, European Respiratory Journal 23(1):146-158 (2004) and Matsui, H., Grubb, B. R., Tarran, R., Randell, S. H., Gatzy, J.

Furthermore, upon aerosolization and delivery of the aerosol to lung airway surfaces, the buffering agents can maintain the physiological pH of lung airway surfaces. For example, the pH of the airway surface liquid is regulated to values of ˜pH 7 to 7.4, and airways host defense in part depends on maintenance of the pH. Buffering agents used in formulations of aerosolized therapies, therefore, may be are useful for 1) preventing acidification of the airway surface occurring with hyperosmolar therapies; 2) normalization of the pH of the airway surface for diseases accompanied or associated or caused by lower than normal airway surface pH; and 3) to prevent or attenuate the drop in the airway surface following administration of aerosols that would otherwise be formulated at pH lower than the airway surface (pH=˜7 to 7.4) or causing acidification of the airway surface following deposition in the lung. The use of bicarbonate anion as a buffering agent may be particularly useful, given its natural role as a buffering agent on the airway surface, and its depletion in diseases associated or caused by CFTR dysfunction such as CF and COPD.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0222]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0226" num="0222">The buffering agent can be any compound comprising an anionic component which is able to maintain a pH from about 6.8 to about 7.6. In one embodiment, the anionic component is able to maintain a pH from about 6.9 to about 7.5. In another embodiment, the anionic component is able to maintain a pH from about 7.0 to about 7.4. Examples of the anionic component include, but are not limited to, carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub> <sup>2−</sup>) and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>−</sup>). Examples of the buffering agent include, but are not limited to, any alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salt of carbonate and bicarbonate, such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, calcium bicarbonate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium bicarbonate, lithium carbonate, and lithium bicarbonate.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0223]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0227" num="0223">There are two key considerations that link HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>−</sup> as a buffer to CFTR. First, recent findings indicate that, although the relative ratio of HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>−</sup> conductance/Cl<sup>−</sup> conductance is between 0.1 and 0.2 for single CFTR channels activated with cAMP and ATP, the ratio in the sweat duct can range from virtually 0 to almost 1.0, depending on conditions of stimulation. That is, combining cAMP+cGMP+α-ketoglutarate can yield CFTR HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>−</sup> conductance almost equal to that of Cl<sup>−</sup> conductance (Quiton et al. Physiology, 22(3):212-225 (2007)). Therefore, CFTR conducts HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>−</sup>, and hence CF airway surfaces may be HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>−</sup> depleted, or acidic, and in need of replacement therapy. Second, absent CFTR-dependent bicarbonate secretion can lead to chronic airway surface acidification and impaired capacity of CF airways to respond to airway conditions associated with acute acidification of airway surface liquid layer e.g. gastric acid inspiration (Coakley et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, </i>100(26): 16083-8 (2003)).</div>

For example, in cystic fibrosis the most common bacteria causing chronic infection is <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>(<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) and antibiotics that are effective against this bacteria are a major component of treatment (Flume, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 176(10):957-69 (2007)). Also bacteria such as <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(<i>S. aureus</i>), <i>Burkholderia cepacia </i>(<i>B. cepacia</i>) and other gram negative organisms as well as anaerobes are isolated from respiratory secretions and people with CF may benefit from treatment of these pathogens to maintain their lung health. Anaerobic bacteria are also recognized as a feature of CF airways, sinuses in subjects with chronic sinusitis, and likely airways of subjects with COPD. Similarly, aspirations or microaspirations, especially in the elderly population and during sleep, are associated with a chemical pneumonitis, anaerobic infections and subsequent bronchiectasis. An ideal treatment of aspiration-related pneumonitis and anaerobic infection would be an immediate treatment. As such, antibiotics are used to eradicate early infections, during pulmonary exacerbations and as chronic suppressive therapy.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0276]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0280" num="0276">The primary measure of antibiotic activity is the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The MIC is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that completely inhibits the growth of a microorganism in vitro. While the MIC is a good indicator of the potency of an antibiotic, it indicates nothing about the time course of antimicrobial activity. PK parameters quantify the lung tissue level time course of an antibiotic. The three pharmacokinetic parameters that are most important for evaluating antibiotic efficacy are the peak tissue level (Cmax), the trough level (Cmin), and the Area Under the tissue concentration time Curve (AUC). While these parameters quantify the tissue level time course, they do not describe the killing activity of an antibiotic.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0277]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0281" num="0277">Integrating the PK parameters with the MIC gives us three PK/PD parameters which quantify the activity of an antibiotic: the Peak/MIC ratio, the T&gt;MIC, and the 24 h-AUC/MIC ratio. The Peak/MIC ratio is simply the Cpmax divided by the MIC. The T&gt;MIC (time above MIC) is the percentage of a dosage interval in which the serum level exceeds the MIC. The 24 h-AUC/MIC ratio is determined by dividing the 24-hour-AUC by the MIC. The three pharmacodynamic properties of antibiotics that best describe killing activity are time-dependence, concentration-dependence, and persistent effects. The rate of killing is determined by either the length of time necessary to kill (time-dependent), or the effect of increasing concentrations (concentration-dependent). Persistent effects include the Post-Antibiotic Effect (PAE). PAE is the persistent suppression of bacterial growth following antibiotic exposure.</div>

Therefore, the 24 h-AUC/MIC ratio, and the Peak/MIC ratio are important predictors of antibiotic efficacy. For aminoglycosides, it is best to have a Peak/MIC ratio of at least 8-10 to prevent resistence. For fluoroquinolones vs gram negative bacteria, the optimal 24 h-AUC/MIC ratio is approximately 125. Versus gram positives, 40 appears to be optimal. However, the ideal 24 h-AUC/MIC ratio for fluoroquinolones varies widely in the literature.</div>

For beta-lactams and erythromycin, maximum killing is seen when the time above MIC is at least 70% of the dosing interval.</div>

For example, carbapenam antibiotics are susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis in vivo by the enzyme dehydropeptidase-I, thus leading to a short elimination half-life (less than 2 hr). The best measure of efficacy of this class of antibiotics is based on the minimum percentage of time the drug concentration is above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the target tissue. Most dose regimens target a time above the MIC (TaM) of at least 50%, thus the need for a continuous infusion.
