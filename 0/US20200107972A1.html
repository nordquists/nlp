</li> <heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to absorbent articles (e.g., diapers, adult incontinence articles, feminine hygiene pads) having improved leg cuffs that yield a more garment-like article, as well as having improved functional characteristics (e.g., reduced leakage, reduced sagging, fecal material containment).</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">It has long been known that absorbent articles such as conventional absorbent articles (e.g., diapers, adult incontinence articles, feminine hygiene pads) offer the benefit of receiving and containing urine and/or other bodily exudates (e.g., feces, menses, mixture of feces and urine, mixture of menses and urine, etc.). To effectively contain bodily exudates, the article should provide a snug fit around the waist and legs of a wearer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Current diaper designs frequently include the use of a barrier leg cuff to prevent leakage of bodily exudates and an outer cuff which provides a covering over the barrier leg cuff to minimize the visibility of exudates through the barrier cuff and provide a secondary means to capture bodily exudates should they breach the barrier leg cuff. The barrier leg cuff may be made using a hydrophobic nonwoven and may be disposed on the body-facing surface of the absorbent article or connected to the body-facing surface of the film backsheet layer. The barrier leg cuff may be a substantially liquid impervious layer that prevents bodily exudates from passing out of the sides of the article and may also be highly breathable, allowing outside air to reach the skin to help maintain a healthy level of skin hydration. In many current diapers, the outer cuff comprises the polymeric film layer of the backsheet to provide the high opacity required to cover the barrier leg cuff as well as to prevent molten adhesive from passing through the cuff to the garment-facing surface of the article during manufacturing. The outer cuff contains the outer leg elastic strands, which create the contraction forces and gathers, and can be sandwiched between the cuff material and backsheet material. The elastic strands in the leg cuffs are typically joined with molten adhesive during manufacture, and the hot adhesive has the potential to pass through nonwoven materials during manufacture, causing contamination of manufacturing lines as well as the potential for stickiness on the outside surface of the article. The polymeric film is generally used to prevent these issues, however, results in a plastic-like look as well as a noisy application process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Because of manufacturing tolerances when cutting, tracking, and combining materials, the outer leg elastic strands are generally spaced inboard from the longitudinal edge of the article in the crotch region. This prevents inadvertent cutting or exposure of the outer leg elastic strands during the manufacturing process. This design results in the outermost portion of the longitudinal edge of the product not continuously contacting closely to the skin of the user during wear. Thus, the ability of the elastic strand(s) to control the edge of the article diminishes as the distance between the outermost elastic and the edge increases, leading to a more random distribution of larger gathers which contact the skin at larger intervals or sometimes not at all. This effect can lead to user perception that the diaper may leak where the longitudinal edge does not contact the skin of the user. In addition, many articles currently available contain only two to three outer leg elastics per side to create the gathers, increasing the difficulty of achieving the desired appearance of a wide finished leg cuff or more garment-like cuff such as the elasticized hemmed edge of the arm cuff of a sweater. If the elastics are spaced more closely, the result is a narrow section of elasticized zone, which results in a less finished, less comfortable, and less clothing-like appearance. If the elastics are spaced farther apart, the gathers can appear to separate further from the skin of the user, leading to a perception of potential leakage risk. As discussed above, this is driven by having less control of the gathers between strands of increasing separation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an absorbent article with a folded outer cuff design having finished edges with elastics that are close to the edge to maintain a close proximity to the skin to create improved fit, a more aesthetically pleasing, clothing-like design and improved leakage protection.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, achieving such aesthetically pleasing, clothing-like absorbent article designs (e.g., by including folded outer cuff designs having finished edges) will generally result in articles that have a wider outermost-to-outermost elastic spacing. Because the outermost-to-outermost elastic cross dimensional length determines the effective width of the chassis, one drawback of these designs is that the effective crotch width is greater when compared to traditional absorbent articles. Articles with wider effective crotch widths tend to fit lower in the crotch, and the extra material creates a “c” shape cupping around the crotch area. Accordingly, the “c” shape cupping around the crotch area is larger for absorbent articles with folded outer cuff designs having finished edges versus traditional outer cuff designs. Moms often view the larger “c” shape cupping negatively as sagging and/or poor fitting in the crotch area.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, it is of continued interest to provide an economically viable disposable absorbent article with the ability to minimize the negative effects of bodily extrudate leaks, while also reducing the appearance of sagging. To that end, it is of continued interest to provide a disposable absorbent article having sufficient retention capability to safely and cleanly retain bodily extrudate away from the wearer's clothing and/or skin throughout the expected time of article use, while also maintaining the desired appearance of a proper fit on the body.</div>

The channels <b>149</b>, <b>149</b>′ may generally align with the channels <b>126</b>, <b>126</b>′ in the absorbent core, although this disclosure is not so limited. The radius of curvature may typically be at least equal (and may be at least 1.5 or at least 2.0 times this average transverse dimension) to the average transverse dimension of the absorbent layer; and also straight but under an angle of (e.g., from 5°) up to 30°, up to 20°, up to 10° with a line parallel to the longitudinal axis. The radius of curvature may be constant for a channel, or may vary along its length. This may also include channels with an angle therein, provided the angle between two parts of a channel is at least 120°, at least 150°; and in any of these cases, provided the longitudinal extension of the channel is more than the transverse extension. The channels of the LMS <b>150</b> may also be branched. For example, a central channel superposed with the longitudinal axis in the crotch region <b>107</b> which branches towards the second waist edge <b>14</b> and/or towards the first waist edge <b>13</b> of the absorbent article. There may be no channel in the LMS <b>150</b> that coincides with the longitudinal axis <b>100</b> of the absorbent article. When present as symmetrical pairs relative to the longitudinal axis <b>100</b>, the channels may be spaced apart from one another over their whole longitudinal dimension. The smallest spacing distance may be at least 5 mm, at least 10 mm, or at least 15 mm, for example.</div>

Leaks of this type often happen because the snug fit between user's body and the attached absorbent article do not allow enough room for the runny bowel movement to remain contained within the absorbent article during the wearer's movement. One advantage of the leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> as detailed herein, in combination with the leg gasketing system(s) as detailed herein, are the additional pocketed areas that provide extra void volumes within the leg cuffs for containment of bodily extrudate (e.g., fecal material). When the wearer moves, a portion of the bodily extrudate will migrate into the leg gasketing system pocket <b>47</b> for containment and be held/trapped between two layers of nonwoven within the leg gasketing system before it can leak out in an area between the wearer's back and the back waist region of the absorbent article or an area between the leg cuffs and wearer's legs of the absorbent article.

Having gap closure in the waist regions may create an article with better fit and containment, resulting in improved leakage performance. One way to achieve gap closure is to provide a waistband that is flush coterminous with the rear lateral edge of the absorbent article. Because there is variation in the application process, a waistband may be present in both the first and second waist regions of the absorbent article. However, while a highly contracted waistband is desirable for the back waist region to provide stretch, it may be more desirable to have a less contracted waistband in the front waist region to aid in application. Therefore, articles detailed herein may be directed to “differential contraction” or waistband laminates having different installed elongation strands in the front versus the back, such that only one waistband laminate is cut. Cutting of the waistband laminate is subsequent to the waistband application to the article; the waistband is applied such that it spans the intended article separation (cut) zone. Thus, the same waistband laminate can deliver different levels of contraction in the back and front, resulting in higher contraction in the back to help close the gap and lower contraction in the front.</div>

Presently, most waistbands are either foam based which have good cushion/caliper for comfort and containment but are limited in the amount of contraction or the waistbands are a combination of elastic strands and nonwoven where the elastic strands are pulled at high strain which delivers high contraction, but very little caliper/cushion in use. Thus, one article disclosed herein is directed to “consolidation” which provides a waistband having the nonwoven material and the elastic strand(s) combined under a higher first strain (installed elongation) and the resulting waistband attached to the article under a lower applied waistband strain, such that the folded up nonwoven in the waistband provides a cushion/caliper in both the relaxed and stretched/in use states.</div>

The above polymers may be used as homopolymers, copolymers, e.g., copolymers of ethylene and propylene, blends, and alloys thereof. The N-fiber layer may be bonded to the other nonwoven component layers by any suitable bonding technique, such as the calendar bond process, for example, also called thermal point bonding.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0229]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0234" num="0229">The use of an N-fiber layer in a nonwoven web may provide a low surface tension barrier that is as high as other nonwoven webs that have been treated with a hydrophobic coating or a hydrophobic melt-additive, and still maintain a low basis weight (e.g., less than 15 gsm or, alternatively, less than 13 gsm). The use of the N-fiber layer may also provide a soft and breathable (i.e., air permeable) nonwoven material that may be used in single web layer configurations in applications which previously used double web layer configurations. Furthermore, the use of the N-fiber layer may at least reduce the undesirable migration of hydrophilic surfactants toward the web and, therefore, may ultimately result in better leak protection for an associated absorbent article. Also, when compared to an SMS web having a similar basis weight, the use of a nonwoven web comprising the N-fiber layer may decrease the number of defects (i.e., holes or pinholes through the mechanical bond site) created during the mechanical bonding process. N-fibers are further discussed in WO 2005/095700 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/024,844.</div>
