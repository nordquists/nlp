<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">With the growth of the use of the Internet, the growth of data usage in private networks and the growth of data used by companies and other entities, both internal and external data, the need for massive data storage and massive computing power has risen. Therefore, many entities are turning to cloud computing. The terms “the cloud” or “cloud computing” may refer generally to large scale data centers that are maintained by a third party, or a company or entity, for example one that maintains systems and/or software that work with the data center(s), where the storage and computing capabilities of the numerous servers within the data center are offered to internal or external customers through one or more network connections. Because relatively small entities may have access to the large scale storage and computing power of many servers, the entities can have access to large-scale computing power that is flexible and available while lowering or eliminating the costs needed to maintain the data centers. Various databases, such as communications databases and/or databases in a cloud computing data center, may be useful for storing massive amounts of data, but in various database approaches, the data is stored in a decentralized manner, across several servers or nodes, and information regarding the relationships or correlations between the data may not be stored. In various databases, for example, communications databases and/or other forms of databases, large-scale data is formatted or structured to be most easily used for task-specific computations. In other words, data may be analyzed at the outset, for example a particular relationship may be analyzed, and then the data and the resulting conclusion are stored in a specific format. For various databases, this is called a schema. Once the initial analysis is done, it may be very time consuming and difficult to re-structure and/or re-analyze data to find a new value, short of retrieving, harvesting and/or archiving locally all the data the user is interested and then organizing and/or performing computations or routines on the data to analyze relationships.</div>

Managing this data has become a major problem for the IT departments of these companies and organizations. For many years, the changes in business requirements have made it more and more difficult and expensive for enterprises to keep abreast of the changes in data—firstly, because of continuous changes in the tools and standards, and secondly because of the exponential increase in the amount of data that is being made available.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0030]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0031" num="0030">The present disclosure describes one or more systems, methods, routines, techniques and/or tools for a Data Relationships Storage Platform (DRSP). The DRSP may provide benefits of cloud computing while preserving valuable information. The DRSP may determine and/or analyze relationships or correlations between data and may save this correlation information when the data is stored to a database, and/or at a later point in time after the data is stored, for example, a communications database and/or other database for other form(s) of data. The DRSP may reconstruct data in various ways that are useful to an entity, for example a company, and various relationships between the data that are useful to the entity may be determined, for example according to strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of and to the entity within and across the data. Saving the correlation information and/or other information may also be referred to as mapping the information to the database, for example, a communications database and/or other database for other form(s) of data. Correlation information may refer generally to information that indicates how one or more pieces of data relate to each other. One example of correlation information, using an example of data within a communications database, may be the relationship between individual messages within an email thread or a social media thread.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0031]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0032" num="0031">The DRSP may allow users to quickly explore, analyze, manipulate and interact with stored data and correlation information, for example, in real time and receiving quick responses. One benefit of the DRSP may be that, because relationships between data are stored in addition to the data, and because new relationships can be discovered or generated at a later time, users may explore relationships between data on the fly, for example, relationships that the user may not have intended to explore when they saved the data. The DRSP may create an agile-style data model (e.g., referred to as “Data Modeling”) that allows dynamic analysis of data, where the data and relationships may be kept live and readily accessible by users. The DRSP may offer benefits over other various database approaches that may require a user to retrieve, harvest and/or archive all the data the user is interested in from the database, for example, a communications database and/or other database for other form(s) of data, and then organize and/or perform integrations, computations, formulas and/or routines on the data to analyze relationships or other aspects of the data. The DRSP may allow users to re-use relationship and other information about the data in various ways without having to re-create data relationship sets. The DRSP may provide data management and analysis capabilities similar to those offered by various relational databases, while offering the power and flexibility of non-relational databases and other forms of databases often found in cloud computing (e.g. referred to as “Asynchronous Analysis”). The DRSP may allow applications that are built around relational databases to continue running like normal (i.e. as the application may normally run on a relational database) while still taking advantage of cloud computing. The DRSP may integrate with various sorts of internal and external enterprise data and systems, and those data and systems of other entities.</div>

A data glob may contain data in various forms, for example, structured data, unstructured data, both structured and unstructured data, communications data or other form of data. A data glob may include multiple pieces of data content, related users, relevant access rules and the like. As one example, a data glob may include a block of messages, including the content of the messages, related profiles, times, access rules and the like. Each data glob may store information about the data glob, information similar to metadata, for example a name, a description, a unique identifier and the like. Data globs may reside in a database, for example, a communications database or some other form of database, and/or a cloud data center, either in a relatively centralized manner or data globs may be stored in a distributed fashion, for example, with different parts of the data glob being stored on different servers. Data globs may be easily interacted with.

For example, multiple data globs may be assembled into a larger piece of data, which may constitute a new data glob. One efficient approach to using data globs may be to reuse as much of an existing data glob as possible, changing only details that differ from the data glob being used. For example, when a new data glob is created using an existing data glob, much of the existing data glob may be useable, and extra and/or different data may be added to the data glob to create a new data glob. In this respect, the DRSP <b>200</b> may analyze the content inside of a data glob as opposed to just treating a data glob like a black box. This manner of reusing portions of existing data globs to create new data globs, optionally with some additional or different information, may be referred to as “integration.” In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the DRSP <b>200</b> may include an integration tool that may manage existing data globs and utilize existing data globs to create new data globs.

As one example, these methods, routines, code, components and the like that utilize and/or interface with the database software program may be referred to as the database management program, and as one example, the database management program <b>212</b> may be part of the manager <b>206</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

A key-value pair (KVP) is a set of two linked data items: a key, which is a unique identifier for some item of data, and the value, which is either the data that is identified or a pointer to the location of that data. Key-value pairs are frequently used in lookup tables, hash tables and configuration files. The keys may facilitate searching the data store <b>210</b> for information related to data correlation information. One or more of the unique keys may be associated with one or more of the components (or “data primitives”) of the DRSP <b>200</b>.

The seed, length and type are mandatory. The seed may be 0, but must be there. In one or more embodiments, the timestamp and padding are optional, but at least one of the timestamp and the padding (or another uniquely defined value) must always be present. If the timestamp cannot be guaranteed to make the record unique because other records of the same type may have the same timestamp in a particular system, then some padding may be used. Typically the padding is 16 bytes. In one or more embodiments, the record row key may comprise: a seed represented by 1 byte, a timestamp represented by 8 bytes, a padding represented by 16 bytes, a type represented by 2 bytes, and a length represented by 1 byte. To represent these 28 bytes it takes a 56 character ASCII string.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0049]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0050" num="0049">The first (i.e. most significant) byte may be the seed byte. The purpose of the seed is to avoid long sequences of records being written at the same time due to a stream of incoming data. A random or “pseudo-random” sequence of seed values may be generated by selecting either one of the least significant bytes of the time stamp field (described below) or the padding field (also described below). This random or pseudo-random choice improves the write throughput of the system by distributing the records across different region-servers. This avoids the phenomenon of “region-server hotspotting” where data is written to the same part of a storage system multiple times in succession. The next field may be the timestamp field. This field is normally derived from the date at which the record was published. It is the milliseconds elapsed since the start of the Java epoch (midnight on Jan. 1, 1970 using Universal Standard Time.) This field is always 8 bytes. The next field is an optional padding field. It can be used for a number of purposes, the most significant of which is to differentiate records that occur at the same instance of time. The value of this field may be programmatically derivable from the contents of the record, by, perhaps, using the value of a tag where that tag is known to be a unique value for each record (say an IP address, or some kind of UUID, or a URL, or a hash of the important fields.) The width of the padding field can be defined via the RecordKey API—part of the SDK. The type field is a two-character code corresponding to the type of the Record. See Table 1 below for a list of record type codes. The final field is the total number of bytes in the row key, as an integer value.</div>

The data store architecture may tag data (e.g., all data types). These tags may be searched, compared, created.

The source indicates where the message came from, for example, an email system, or a computer log file, or an RSS field. The timestamp indicates when the message happened. The one or more pieces of information (e.g., what the message is about) may depend on the message. In some embodiments, there must always be some kind of information, whether it's a simple piece of logging status, a telephone number or a full multipart MIME email message with attachments. Optionally, it may be possible to infer or report who appears to have actually received a message.

The ability to observe and record these changes may be very useful to create an improved data store. Various data stores may apply tags. A tag may refer to a “named property”. A tag may include a name and a value. A tag may have a type, for example, indicating what kind of value is stored in the tag. Tags may be added, modified or removed from any item or element stored in a data store. Tags may be a useful component in building a flexible and evolving semi-structured data model. A tag may be associated with a message or profile or blob or other data element. Messages, profiles, documents (blobs), and perhaps other data elements may each be tagged. In various embodiments, tags may: 1) have values that are searchable as text; 2) be generated by running analyzers on the data store and updating existing objects with more metadata; 3) be used in non-text search and analysis operations; and 4) be user-defined.

Additionally, users can be members of groups that share a common privilege or a certain set of privileges, but where only some members of the group are allocated certain other privileges.
