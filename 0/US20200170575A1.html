<div class="abstract">Systems and methods are provided for monitoring a subject, and particularly, for inferring an underlying brain state present in absence of current conditions. In some aspects, a method for monitoring the subject is provided including steps of receiving physiological feedback from at least one sensor configured to acquire physiological information from locations associated with a subject's brain, assembling a set of time-series data using the received physiological feedback, and identifying portions of the set of time-series data that indicate a burst suppression state. The method also includes identifying a burst characteristic profile associated with a burst pattern determined from the identified portions, and comparing the burst characteristic against a reference set of burst profiles. The method further includes determining, based on the comparison, a likelihood of a brain state of the subject underlying the burst suppression state, and generating a report indicative of the likelihood of the determined brain state.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for monitoring a subject. Specifically, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for directly determining brain states, as well as inferring underlying brain states that would be present in absence of current conditions, by way of analyzing physiological feedback, such as electroencephalogram (“EEG”) data associated with burst suppression states.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Since 1846 and the first public uses of ether as a means to control pain during surgical procedures, anesthesia, analgesics, and other administered compounds to control pain have been a mainstay of medicine. However, while the use of the anesthetic and the number of compounds with anesthetic properties in clinical use have grown astronomically since the initial uses of ether, the scientific understanding of the operation of the body when under anesthesia is still developing. For example, a complete understanding of the effects of anesthesia on patients and operation of the patient's brain over the continuum of “levels” of anesthesia is still lacking. As such, anesthesiologists are trained to recognize the effects of anesthesia and extrapolate an estimate of the “level” of anesthetic influence on a given patient based on the identified effects of the administered anesthesia.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Unfortunately, there are a great number of variables that can influence the effects, effectiveness, and, associated therewith, the “level” of anesthetic influence on a given patient. Some clear variables include physical attributes of the patient, such as age, state of general health, height, or weight, but also less obvious variables that are extrapolated, for example, based on prior experiences of the patient when under anesthesia. When these variables are compounded with the variables of a given anesthesiologists' practices and the variables presented by a particular anesthetic compound or, more so, combination of anesthetic compounds, the proper and effective administration of anesthesia to a given patient can appear to be an art and a science.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The anesthetized brain, though profoundly inactivated, is characterized by rich electrophysiological dynamics. At deep levels of anesthesia, the brain reaches a state of burst suppression. Burst suppression is an electroencephalogram pattern that consists of a quasi-periodic alternation between isoelectric quiescence (suppressions) lasting seconds or minutes as the brain becomes more inactivated, and high-voltage brain activity (bursts). Burst suppression appears to be a fundamental characteristic of the deeply anesthetized brain, and can also occur in a range of conditions including hypothermia, deep general anesthesia, certain infant encephalopathy and coma. It is also used in neurology as an electrophysiological endpoint in pharmacologically induced coma for brain protection after traumatic injury and during status epilepticus. However, despite the presence of burst suppression in this broad range of inactivated brain states, its biophysical mechanisms are poorly understood.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Classically, burst suppression has been regarded as a homogenous brain state. This perspective has been derived from EEG studies that burst and suppressions have been shown to occur concurrently across the scalp. However, because scalp EEG is spatially blurred, the underlying dynamics are not fully understood. In vivo studies in anesthetized animals have helped to identify the potential cellular correlates of burst suppression, showing that although nearly all cortical neurons are inhibited during suppression periods, a subset of thalamocortical neurons can continue firing at delta frequencies.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">In search of a more detailed and complete mechanistic understanding, recent studies have shown that burst suppression is associated with enhanced excitability in cortical networks. These studies implicate extracellular calcium as a correlate for the switches between burst and suppression. A recent study has proposed an alternative mechanism, using computational methods, where burst suppression manifests in a state of reduced neuronal activity and cerebral metabolism. In such a state, insufficient production of adenosine triphosphate (“ATP”) in local cortical networks can gate neuronal potassium channels, leading to suppression of action potentials. Such a mechanism accounts for the general features of burst suppression previously observed, as well as its occurrence under multiple etiologies, and also predicts a specific frequency structure for the neuronal activity within each burst.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, as can be appreciated, the underlying phenomenon and, hence, a more encompassing understanding of just one brain state, represented by or correlated with burst suppression, is lacking. As such, the ability to accurately discern the current or predict a future state of the individual based on the observed physiological tracking information, such as elicited by EEG data, has been elusive.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, it would be desirable to have a system and method to determine or predict a current and/or future state of a subject, based on physiological tracking or monitoring information.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">The disclosure overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks by providing systems and methods directed to neurophysiological dynamics of cortical circuits driving various physiological states in a subject's brain. Specifically, the present disclosure is directed to analysis of physiological data across multiple cortical sites, for example, in a substantially simultaneous fashion, to reveal spatial and temporal brain activity patterns across the human cortex. Therefore, as will be described, the present disclosure recognizes complexities associated with burst suppression states of a subject, which go beyond presently accepted understanding, and introduces a conceptual shift in the assessment of brain states for purposes of monitoring and treatment. Specifically, an approach is presented herein for analyzing spatial variation in burst suppression states which could, for example, provide valuable insight into neural circuit dysfunction underlying a given pathology, as well as improve monitoring, say, of a medically-induced coma. In addition, analysis of temporal dynamics within burst epochs of a burst suppression state could help assess an underlying non-burst suppression brain state. Such approach could be explored, for example, as a prognostic tool for recovery from a coma, or for guiding treatment of status epilepticus.</div>

For example, a BSP may be computed using a state-space model approach. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, most channels exhibit high BSP that can change appreciably over time. Specifically, a subset of channels exit burst suppression (e.g., Channel <b>44</b>), while other channels maintain high BSPs (e.g. channel <b>5</b> remains in burst suppression with a BSP above 0.5). The standard deviation of the BSP across the recording sites may range from 0.04 to as high as 0.2, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>. The increasing standard deviation demonstrates that the BSPs in different cortical regions are becoming uncoupled as they diverge into different states. The mean range of the BSP across the grid of electrodes <b>500</b> at a given point in time is approximately 0.46, demonstrating a large average difference in burst dynamics across channels. These measures indicate that burst suppression dynamics can often diverge substantially across different cortical areas, with different cortical regions exhibiting different propensities for suppression.</div>

Thus, it may be advantageous to determine indications regarding whether a state of burst suppression is limited to any particular cortical region. Specifically, periods when any subset of channels exit burst suppression may identified using the raw or processed time-series data. For instance, periods when any particular channel does not undergo a suppression over a time interval of say, 30 seconds, may be defined as having exited burst suppression, although other values are possible. By way of example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows time-series data from different cortical regions measured with channels <b>12</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>55</b> described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, where all exhibit burst suppression, but with bursts being asynchronous for the respective regions. An example from a later recording using the same configuration is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. Specifically, channel <b>55</b> exhibits burst suppression, while channels <b>12</b> and <b>17</b> do not. Hence, the state of burst suppression is not necessarily cortex-wide.</div>

The amount of time spent in spatially isolated burst suppression may also be quantified by identifying the total time that some channels were deeply suppressed, while other channels remained nearly continuous. Epochs of deep suppression can be defined, for example, as those where any 3 channels include BSP values over 0.5. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5E</figref>, amounting to 15.9 minutes in duration, 4.6 minutes (28.7%) include at least 3 other channels that have a BSP less than 0.2, that is, at least 3 channels that remained in a lighter state of suppression.</div>

Burst suppression can therefore occur in limited cortical regions, and does not necessarily reflect a cortex-wide phenomenon.

The spatial distribution of individual bursts may be examined in order to test whether bursts are sometimes constrained to a limited cortical region, as suggested by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Each burst can be individually analyzed and identified to determine which grid channels participated in the burst by selecting those with nearby burst onset times.</div>

As illustrated in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, burst periods can change as a function of location and time. For example, a burst at t=42 seconds involves all channels measured, but the burst at t=5 seconds occurs in only a small subset of electrodes, indicating that a limited cortical region is bursting. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, bursts were observed in only a subset of the grid channels while other regions remained suppressed. These local bursts were interspersed with global bursts that occurred across all channels, demonstrating that the state of burst suppression was present across cortex but that individual bursts could occur asynchronously.</div>

The median percentage of channels involved in a single burst is approximately 76% (quartiles: 52%-94%), demonstrating that local bursts made up a substantial portion of total bursting, as indicated by the long leftward tail to the distribution. As a result, bursts can be either global or local, and local bursts may reflect activation in a limited cortical area while other regions continue to be suppressed. In addition, suppressions can continue in one region despite high-amplitude bursts in a neighboring region, suggesting that a profoundly inactivated state can be confined to specific cortical regions.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0084]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0085" num="0084">Despite the presence of spatially localized bursts, it is also clear that many bursts occur broadly across a subject's cortex, as nearly a third of bursts (31%) occurred in over 90% of channels, as shown in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. It can therefore be tested whether these ‘global’ bursts across multiple channels begin simultaneously in each channel, or whether there are consistent time lags between distant channels. This may be accomplished by comparing burst onset times between any pair of electrodes, such that the mean differences in burst onset time are significantly correlated with the distance between pairs of channels.</div>

As illustrated in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, onset time differences may be larger between more distant pairs of channels, for instance, increasing from 225±83 ms (mean±s.d.) in adjacent (1 cm) channels to 368±107 ms (mean±s.d.) in channels separated by more than 4 cm (difference=143 ms, p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Because the difference in burst times is correlated with distance (R=0.30, p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>), these timing differences cannot be attributed simply to noise in the automated segmentation algorithm; even if the entire difference between adjacent channels was due to segmentation noise, an additional 143 ms would remain as the mean difference in burst timing between distant channels. To further ensure that these results are not an artifact of the burst detection algorithm, the analysis can be repeated using the variance of the raw signal to detect burst onsets, as will be described below. Results, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, therefore demonstrate that even a single ‘global’ burst can be locally differentiated, and can begin hundreds of milliseconds apart in different cortical regions, as illustrated by channel <b>32</b>, that starts hundreds of milliseconds before the bursts in channels <b>36</b> and <b>24</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0086]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0087" num="0086">By way of example, a plot of difference in burst onset times between pairs of electrodes is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, illustrating substantial timing differences in burst onsets between distant electrodes, with distant electrodes showing larger gaps in burst timing. Specifically, the top line <b>700</b> represents the mean and standard error of the difference in burst onset times, and the bottom stars <b>702</b> mark distances that are significantly different than pairs 1 cm apart. In addition, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> shows that spatial heterogeneity can be further tested, for example, by computing the probability that two different electrodes are simultaneously in a bursting state. As illustrated in the example <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, adjacent electrodes had a 78.1% probability of being in a burst state simultaneously, whereas more distant electrodes shared only a 62.0% chance of simultaneous bursting (p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>). Similar to results from the differences in burst timing of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, this demonstrates that burst onsets are asynchronous across cortex, with significant lags between distant cortical regions participating in a simultaneous burst. In addition, the probability decreases with distance, demonstrating that distant electrodes are less likely to be simultaneously in a burst state.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0087]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0088" num="0087">Taken together, above-described results demonstrate that there can be substantial heterogeneity in bursting dynamics across the cortex, and suggest that bursts are spatially clustered. To explicitly test for spatial clustering of bursts, a principal components analysis can be performed, for example, on the burst state across multiple grid electrodes. By way of example, each panel of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows one of the first four principal components from a patient, whereby a color variation across the grid indicates how burst probability is locally differentiated. As may be appreciated from the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each of the components was found to be significantly spatially clustered (p&lt;0.05), demonstrating that burst properties are anatomically clustered and differ in distant cortical regions. Further, it was determined that 78% of the variance could be explained by the first 4 components of multiple patients (not shown). Specifically, to test whether spatial clustering was present in these first 4 principal components the spatial derivative of the estimated components was compared to a randomly shuffled grid. This shuffling analysis demonstrated that 15 out of the 16 components were significantly spatially clustered (p&lt;0.05), indicating that clusters of anatomically close cortical areas tended to share burst properties. Therefore, although burst suppression was sufficiently correlated across a cortex to produce a seemingly synchronous pattern in scalp EEG recordings, the underlying dynamics exhibited substantial local heterogeneity.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0088]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0089" num="0088">The previously discussed spatially differentiated dynamics may suggest, for example, that bursts and suppressions depend on local cortical state. This finding may be compatible with a previously described model for the generation of burst suppression, that proposes a depressed cerebral metabolism could lead to burst suppression by producing a slow cycle in ATP levels. This model makes specific predictions about the spectral content within individual bursts: first, that they can recover the dynamics of the state immediately preceding burst suppression, and second, that the recovered oscillatory features will decelerate through the course of each burst.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0089]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0090" num="0089">As a result, at process block <b>206</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a burst spectral content may also be determined, for example, for use in identifying whether a spectral content of bursts returned to the pre-burst suppression state, such as lighter stage of general anesthesia. For instance, general anesthesia using profol produces two striking features in an EEG: a large increase in low frequency (e.g., 0.1-4 Hz) power, and an alpha (e.g., ˜10 Hz) rhythm that occurs predominantly in frontal cortex regions. As such, a within-burst spectrum across multiple channels may be computed, for example, to test whether these features were present. In certain scenarios, electrocorticography (“ECoG”) channels may be used, and classified as ‘frontal’ if it is anterior to the central sulcus, as defined by visual inspection of, say, reconstructed MRI images, and ‘posterior’ otherwise. Spectra may then calculated, for example, using data from two seconds following burst onset, and averaged separately for frontal and posterior channels. By way of example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows spectral dynamics propofol-induced general anesthesia. As shown, posterior channels had a strong power component at slow frequencies, and frontal channels had both increased slow power as well as a pronounced alpha oscillation, which displays the average spectra (+/−std. err.) within a burst across all channels, categorized by anatomical location. In other words, the plot of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows that the bursts contain increased slow power relative to the awake state, and a frontal alpha oscillation.</div>

For example, given that the propofol-induced alpha rhythm was shown to resume during bursts, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it was investigated whether its frequency decelerated throughout a burst by first selecting all channels with a peak in power in the alpha band, defined as higher power in the alpha (e.g., 8-14 Hz) band than in the theta (e.g., 4-7 Hz) band. The time course of alpha dynamics was examined by comparing the early (e.g., 0-1.5 s) and late (e.g., 1.5-3 s) components of bursts, restricting the analysis to bursts lasting at least 3 seconds. Specifically, the spectra showed that alpha rhythms can decelerate throughout a burst, with a peak frequency dropping from approximately 10.25 Hz in the early period to approximately 9.28 Hz in the late period of the burst (p&lt;10′), as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, which shows a significant decrease in peak frequency between the early and late components of bursts.

Informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with the local institutional review board. Electrode placement was determined solely by clinical criteria. One patient was implanted only with depth electrodes and the other four had a combination of depth electrodes and subdural grid and strip electrodes, with 1 cm spacing between electrode contacts. Recordings were collected throughout induction of general anesthesia using propofol, at the beginning of a surgery to explant the electrodes. A portion of one recording from one patient was previously reported in a separate analysis of slow oscillations. ECoG data was recorded with a sampling rate of 2000 Hz, lowpass filtered at 100 Hz and resampled to 250 Hz. For all analyses of spatial dynamics (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>), grid channels were referenced with a Laplacian montage in that the average of all available neighboring channels (up to four nearest neighbors) was subtracted, in order to minimize spatial spread of the signals. When analyzing temporal structure across all channels (grid, strip, and depth electrodes; <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>), they were referenced in a bipolar scheme as the depth and strip electrodes were positioned in 1-dimensional arrays.

An automated method to segment bursts and suppressions was used. The method first required manual labeling of unambiguous suppression periods in the first 60 seconds of the recording. The data was then transformed in three steps: 1) signals were high-pass filtered with a finite impulse response filter of length <b>2206</b>, with a gain of 0 from 0-2.55 Hz and a gain of 1 from 3-125 Hz. 2) the Hilbert transform of the transformed signal was used to calculate the instantaneous amplitude, and 3) the instantaneous amplitude was smoothed with a moving average filter with a span of 50 samples (200 ms). These transformations yielded a continuous measure approximating high-frequency power. The value of this measure during the manually labeled suppression periods was used to set a threshold for burst detection (mean plus four standard deviations of the value during manually-labeled suppressions). Threshold crossings lasting over 500 ms were labeled as bursts, and burst terminations were labeled when the measure returned below threshold for ms. 500 ms was used as a computational requirement for threshold crossings but manually confirmed that our method successfully detected the slow timescale shifts characteristic of burst suppression. In particular, the median duration of suppressions was 4.76 s, with an inter-quartile range of 3.76-7.31 s. To ensure that the results on burst timing were not an artifact of the burst detection algorithm, an alternative variance-based method was implemented. In this method, the variance of the raw signal was computed in 100 ms sliding windows and this measure replaced the instantaneous amplitude as the segmentation threshold.</div>

The approach provided may be used for analyzing variations in burst suppression dynamics in different cortical regions to determine that regions are most profoundly inactivated. For example, during burst suppression induced by propofol general anesthesia, this method can accurately extract the features of lighter propofol general anesthesia. The dynamics of scalp EEG recordings within a burst can be tracked to reveal underlying epileptic activity. In addition, different brain regions can be tracked to identify and understand that isolated states of burst suppression occur, and that spatial differences can be observed in the scalp EEG to help determine and predict current and future brain states of a subject.

As described herein, high correlation of bursts across cortex have been observed, demonstrating that, on average, bursts are broadly synchronous. However, substantial local variation in burst dynamics has also been identified. Burst timing differs consistently across cortex, with larger timing offsets between bursts in distant regions. In addition, both bursts and suppressions frequently occur locally, limited to a small cluster of electrodes while other cortical regions were in a different state. One possible explanation for this could be local variation in cerebral metabolism: when metabolism is globally depressed, bursts can spread across cortex, producing a gradient of timing differences; whereas when metabolic rates are more varied in different regions, they may enter dissociated states with different burst suppression probabilities and different refractory periods, leading to spatially isolated bursts and suppressions. This interaction could resolve the contrast inherent in these results, as this mechanism would produce dynamics which bursts are often correlated but can nevertheless demonstrate substantial local variation.</div>

In addition, the present disclosure recognizes that even when all of the cortex undergoes a ‘global’ burst, there are significant differences in the timing of onset of bursts between disparate cortical regions, that, within each burst, the frequency structure matches the brain state that was present prior to the onset of burst suppression.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0119]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0120" num="0119">In addition to monitoring spectral dynamics within a burst, the spatial heterogeneity of burst suppression has implications for understanding of neurological disease, and could impact clinical treatment. First, results presented herein indicate that patients exhibiting burst suppression may in fact have substantial local variation in brain function. Neurologists may therefore wish to examine spatial differences in burst suppression to ascertain whether specific cortical regions are more susceptible to circuit dysfunction, as inactivation in different brain structures may be a function of underlying pathology. Furthermore, these results suggest that medically-induced coma, as used for treatment of status epilepticus and traumatic brain injury, could be monitored across multiple cortical regions and the treatment adjusted accordingly, as dynamics in one brain region may not fully reflect the ongoing state. In addition, the ability to observe and characterize local expression of suppression epochs could allow for more precise tracking of anesthetic induction and emergence, and of hypothermia induced during surgery. Specialized monitoring systems, in accordance with the present disclosure, could be designed, for example, to exploit EEG spatial patterns in order to facilitate superior control of drug dosages when inducing burst suppression to control status epilepticus or for treatment of traumatic brain injury, ensuring that a desired burst suppression ratio is achieved throughout the brain rather than at a single cortical site.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0120]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0121" num="0120">Examples presented herein are consistent with the neuronal and metabolic mechanisms proposed in recent computational work, that has suggested that lowered cerebral metabolism leads to periods of suppression, but that the activity within each burst recovers the oscillatory dynamics of the state preceding burst suppression. An alternative hypothesis is that bursts are due to cortical hyperexcitability. In the case of propofol general anesthesia, the EEG prior to burst suppression contains two distinct rhythms: a slow (i.e., 0.1-1 Hz) oscillation that is asynchronous across cortex, and an alpha (i.e., ˜10 Hz) rhythm that is highly coherent across frontal electrodes. The slow oscillation contains EEG deflections that mark brief (&lt;1 s) periods of local cortical neuron inactivation. These inactivated periods occur both during sleep and general anesthesia, and correlate with loss of consciousness. The present disclosure has found that bursts indeed replicated the EEG signatures of lighter stages of general anesthesia: they exhibited both a slow oscillation and a frontal alpha oscillation that decelerated throughout the burst, as predicted by the decreased cerebral metabolism model. Because slow oscillations were contained within bursts suggests that burst suppression may be due to prolonged epochs of suppression overriding the ongoing cortical state. Bursts would then reflect a transient recovery in that the oscillatory rhythms characteristic of the preceding state (i.e. the slow and alpha oscillations) resume. This theory is additionally consistent with the fact that patients remain anesthetized during bursts, as their EEG continues to reflect the signatures of propofol general anesthesia. Therefore, the main emergent feature of burst suppression may in fact be the suppression, that acts as an intermittent but prolonged interruption of ongoing cortical activity. The burst content could then serve as a readout of the previous cortical state, that could provide useful clinical information when monitoring patients during burst suppression.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0121]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0122" num="0121">The spatial heterogeneity observed is also consistent with the metabolic model. In particular, it would follow from the model that bursts and suppressions may be shorter or longer in different brain regions depending on regional variations in perfusion, local network activity, ATP concentration, and metabolic state. These spatial results are also compatible with a calcium-based mechanism for burst suppression. Namely, it has been suggested that transient increases and decreases in extracellular calcium, leading to synaptic disfacilitation, are a key determinant in suppression duration. Again, such a mechanism would naturally lead to local variability due to calcium distribution and expression. Taken together, the present disclosure supports a model in that burst suppression is driven by local variations in cortical dynamics, and are consistent with the hypothesis that suppressions are caused by decreased cerebral metabolism.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0122]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0123" num="0122">Although data presented herein, by way of example, is the result of studies focused on the cortical dynamics of burst suppression, subcortical structures, however, may also be a determinant in the expression of burst suppression in the brain. The local differences shown in cortical measurements are suggestive of nontrivial subcortical participation in each burst and suppression. The state of burst suppression can be viewed as a severe reduction in the ability of cortical neurons to sustain continued processing. Whether the reason is protective, for instance by metabolic mechanisms, or otherwise, the neurons in question simply cannot fire for prolonged periods of time. In contrast, previous research on the cellular correlates of burst suppression has shown that certain subcortical populations, namely thalamic reticular and relay cells, may exhibit ongoing activity even during cortical suppressions. The generation of individual bursts is thought to be caused by input from these relay neurons once cortical post-suppression refractory periods subside. The extent to which burst suppression is expressed differentially in the cortex may thus be a reflection of the integrity of specific thalamocortical networks. In this scenario, the dynamic range in some subcortical loops, and the efficacy of ascending and descending excitation, can remain largely intact, despite existing in a significantly inactivated brain. These differences suggest that there are differential sensitivities of cortical regions and their associated functions to anesthetic drugs at high concentrations, hypothermia and diffuse brain injury.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0123]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0124" num="0123">Hence, the present disclosure provides for new insight into the neurophysiology of the profoundly inactivated brain. Despite trends towards synchronous activity, local cortical dynamics vary across time and space, and can lead to uncoupled burst suppression states across cortex. Results presented demonstrate previously unknown complexity in neural circuit dynamics during deep general anesthesia, and suggest new roles for cortical and subcortical structures in producing neurophysiological diversity during profound neural inactivation. These findings indicate that burst suppression in neurological conditions can benefit from examination of how cortical activity varies within bursts and across electrodes, as these dynamics may be highly variable. In this manner, spatiotemporal structure of burst suppression patterns could improve patient monitoring and the effectiveness of clinical treatments.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0124]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0125" num="0124">Given that burst suppression can be both a symptom of neurological conditions (i.e., in post-anoxic coma) as well as the result of induced treatment for conditions such as status epilepticus and traumatic brain injury, findings, as described herein, could have significant impact on clinical practice. In particular, detection of the spectral content within each burst could reveal the neural dynamics that remain intact when not interrupted by the suppression epochs. For instance, bursts may contain activity synonymous with general anesthesia as observed here, or they could be morphologically similar to epileptiform patterns associated with seizure.</div>
