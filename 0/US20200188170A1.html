<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="docdb" mxw-id="PA401606865" source="national office">
<div class="abstract">Apparatuses, systems, and methods for implanting an intraocular lens into an eye are described. For example, an intraocular lens injector may include a plunger and an injector body that includes an insertion depth guard and a nozzle extending therefrom. The insertion depth guard is disposed at a distal end of the injector body to limit a distance that the nozzle penetrates the eye. The intraocular lens injector may also include a biasing element configured to generate a counterforce to distal movement of the plunger through the injector rod. An example intraocular lens injector may include a biasing element to produce a counterforce that opposes advancement of the plunger through the injector body. The counterforce provides for a more continuous advancement of the plunger while reducing or substantially eliminating abrupt changes in the rate at which the plunger is advanced through the injector body.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">The human eye in its simplest terms functions to provide vision by transmitting and refracting light through a clear outer portion called the cornea, and further focusing the image by way of the lens onto the retina at the back of the eye. The quality of the focused image depends on many factors including the size, shape and length of the eye, and the shape and transparency of the cornea and lens. When trauma, age or disease cause the lens to become less transparent, vision deteriorates because of the diminished light which can be transmitted to the retina. This deficiency in the lens of the eye is medically known as a cataract. The treatment for this condition is surgical removal of the lens and implantation of an artificial intraocular lens (“IOL”).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Many cataractous lenses are removed by a surgical technique called phacoemulsification. During this procedure, an opening is made in the anterior capsule and a thin phacoemulsification cutting tip is inserted into the diseased lens and vibrated ultrasonically. The vibrating cutting tip liquefies or emulsifies the lens so that the lens may be aspirated out of the eye. The diseased lens, once removed, is replaced by an artificial lens.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The IOL is injected into the eye through the same small incision used to remove the diseased lens. An IOL injector is used to deliver an IOL into the eye.</div>

In still other implementations, the angle θ may be between 0° and 70°; 0° and 80°; or 0° and 90°. Generally, the angle θ may be selected to be any desired angle.

The central member <b>2510</b> has an arcuate cross-section that is received onto the body portion <b>200</b> of the plunger <b>30</b>. The arc shape of the wings <b>2520</b> may conform or substantially conform to the shape of the biasing element <b>260</b>. The advancement stop <b>2500</b> may be retained on the plunger <b>30</b> such as by a frictional engagement and/or a detent between one or more portions of the plunger, e.g., biasing element <b>260</b> and/or body portion <b>200</b>, to name a few examples, and the advancement stop <b>2500</b>, e.g., surfaces of the advancement stop <b>2500</b> abutting the biasing element <b>260</b>, the collar <b>261</b>, and/or flange <b>240</b>, to name a few examples. The advancement stop <b>2500</b> may be formed from a rigid material, such as a polymer, composite material, metal, or any other suitable material.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0100]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0101" num="0100">Advancement stop <b>2500</b> may operate similarly to the advancement stop <b>2300</b>. When coupled to the plunger <b>30</b>, the advancement stop <b>2500</b> limits an amount the plunger <b>30</b> may be displaced within the injector body <b>20</b>. In some instances, when the plunger <b>30</b> has been displaced within the injector body <b>20</b> by the selected amount, a distal end of the central member <b>2510</b> contacts the proximal end <b>50</b> of the injector body <b>20</b>. The central member <b>2510</b> transmits any force to the flange <b>240</b>, thereby preventing actuation of the biasing element <b>260</b>. In other instances, the collar <b>261</b> may contact the proximal end <b>50</b> of the injector body <b>20</b>. However, the close engagement between the biasing element <b>260</b> and the conforming wings <b>2520</b> prevents outward flexure of the biasing element <b>260</b>, thereby preventing actuation of the biasing element <b>260</b>.</div>
