No. 15/112,180, which is a national stage of International Patent Application No. PCT/IB2015/050436, filed Jan. 20, 2015, which claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/929,559, filed Jan. 21, 2014.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of pharmaceutical biocompatible carriers and the targeted delivery of active agents for therapeutic, prophylaxis, imaging, and diagnostic applications. More specifically, the invention relates to a biocompatible hybrid carrier resulting from controlled unification of a naturally secreted biocompatible delivery module (BDM) and an engineered drug encapsulation module (EDEM).</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Contemporary drug therapy approaches are mainly based on the development of new therapeutic molecules as well as on the advancement of combined treatment schedules. However, clinical efficacy of these approaches is inherently limited by their physical-chemistry, pharmacokinetics and cross-reactivity attributes, inadvertently arising from a restricted concentration at the intended site of action and an extensive overall bio-distribution.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In an effort to address this challenge, the emerging command of nanotechnology is facilitating the delivery of drug molecules to non-healthy organs, tissues and/or cells. The most advanced nanotechnology inspired drug delivery platforms are focused on the entrapment of therapeutically active molecules in synthetic lipid-based carrier systems. Encapsulation facilitates the isolation of a drug from the in vivo environment, hereby overcoming a drug's non-ideal properties, including limited solubility, serum stability, circulation half-life and biodistribution.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The ideal synthetic nanocarrier which is composed of non-toxic constituents and is specifically internalized by target cells remains elusive to date. Therefore, these systems don't harness the full potential that nanotechnology can provide. Insights into how molecules are transmitted in nature may provide the blueprint for efficient and biocompatible drug delivery vehicles.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">It is known that cells exchange information through the secretion of soluble factors or by direct interaction. Recent studies have come to the conclusions that cells also release membrane-derived vesicles that have an impact on both neighboring and distant cells (Marcus &amp; Leonard, 2013). These extracellular vesicles are secreted by most cells, and are physiological constituents of most biological fluids (Vlassov, Magdaleno, Setterquist, &amp; Conrad, 2012). Extracellular vesicles entail the subtypes apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, and exosomes (EL Andaloussi, Mager, Breakefield, &amp; Wood, 2013)</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Although the research on how extracellular vesicles can act as mediators of intercellular communication is still in its early stages, exploring their inherit role in delivering bioactive cargo from “donor” cells to “recipient” cells is contributing valuable insights into the complexity of optimal drug delivery. Various studies have identified several conditions in which extracellular vesicles can function as therapeutic carriers. There is increasing evidence that these carriers possess distinct characteristics rendering them pharmaceutically superior to synthetic drug carriers. Of particular significance for this superiority is a collection of membrane proteins and distinct lipids integrated in the surface composition of extracellular vesicles.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Several obstacles exist that hinder exploiting or mimicking natures' carriers for efficient drug delivery systems. Most notably, transforming extracellular vesicles from message couriers to drug carriers requires the introduction of therapeutic or diagnostic molecules exogenous to the “donor” cell. The respective engineering methodologies proposed to date include the use of bioengineering procedures on “donor” cells (i.e. genetic modification, viral transfection, toxic cationic lipofection, etc.) as well as vigorous or damaging manipulation mechanisms applied to isolated vesicles (i.e. electroporation, conjugation chemistry, etc.). These methods ultimately raise safety as well as scalability concerns and hamper a translation into the clinic. Other important issues that still need to be addressed include control over structural integrity of the carrier, efficient encapsulation of active cargo and the incorporation of additional targeting moieties.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Ideally, intricate bio-mimetic functionalization approaches requiring numerous bioactive membrane components incorporated into a synthetic nanocarrier could be circumvented if intact extracellular vesicle membranes would be exploited. Conversely, in order to overcome the dire consequences of biotechnological protocols, strategies to introduce therapeutic as well as targeting components exogenous to the extracellular vesicles, should preferably be independent of cellular manipulation. Based on these premises, it may be beneficial to replace bioengineering techniques with nanotechnological strategies employed in modern nano-particular drug delivery systems.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0055]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0056" num="0055">In a first aspect the present invention provides a hybrid biocompatible carrier (hybridosome) which comprises structural and bioactive elements originating from at least one biocompatible delivery module (BDM) and at least one engineered drug encapsulation module (EDEM) comprising at least one tunable fusogenic moiety.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0056]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0057" num="0056">As used herein, the terms “hybrid biocompatible carrier” or “hybridosome” refer to a hybrid biocompatible carrier which comprises structural and bioactive elements (e.g., lipids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, polynucleotides or polypeptides) originating from at least one biocompatible delivery module (BDM) (e.g. exosomes, microvesicles, apoptotic bodies) and at least one engineered drug encapsulation module (EDEM) comprising a tunable fusogenic moiety. In a specific embodiment, the internal volume of the hybridosome contains at least one bioactive agents originating from a BDM secreted in vivo (e.g. endogenous polynucleotides, enzymes or polypeptides) and at least one bioactive agent encapsulated in an EDEM manufactured in vitro. In another embodiment, the internal volume of the hybridosome only comprises natural components originating from the BDMs and may be further treated. The hybridosome of the invention results from uniting one</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0057]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0058" num="0057">BDM with one EDEM, several BDMs with one EDEM, several EDEMs with one BDM, or several BDMs with several EDEMs. The uniting event may be controlled via the size of the BDMs and EDEMs, their respective charges, and the conditions applied during a uniting reaction such as the ratio BDM/EDEM, the pH, the temperature and the reaction time. Such a modular strategy to assemble a novel composition from separate units can offer a new level of engineering flexibility. This unification of messenger and therapeutic components could confer unique characteristics to the resulting hybrid carrier which are not otherwise attainable by the single systems.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0058]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0059" num="0058">As used herein, “Biocompatible Delivery Module (BDM)” refers to a naturally secreted vesicle comprising a lipid bilayer, which is produced in vivo and is released into the extracellular environment. BDMs are secreted by various types of cells, including but not limited to epithelial cells, tumor cells and other immune cells (e.g. mast cells, T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells). BDMs used in the present invention are either isolated from physiological fluids or a tissue sample taken from a subject, preferably a human subject, or are isolated from culture mediums. In one specific embodiment, BDMs used in the present invention derive from a cell culture wherein the cells are either natural or have been previously immortalized and/or engineered. The cell culture may be homogeneous (one type of cells) or heterogeneous (several types of cells), and may be composed of isolated cells and/or tissue. BDMs can be isolated or derived from an organism including prokaryotes, eukaryotes, bacteria, fungi, yeast, invertebrates, vertebrates, reptiles, fish, insects, plants and animals. Media taken from cultured cells (“conditioned media”, cell media, or cell culture media) may be a biological fluid.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0059]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0060" num="0059">BDMs may be collected and isolated using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For instance, BDMs can be collected from a cell culture or a tissue supernatant by one or more techniques selected from the group consisting of, but not limited to, differential ultracentrifugation, gradient ultracentrifugation, filtration, tangential flow filtration (TFF), low-pressure track-etched membrane filtration and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the BDMs used in the present invention are prepared by centrifugation of culture supernatant to pellet unwanted cell debris followed by ultracentrifugation to pellet exosomes, density gradient ultracentrifugation (for example, with sucrose gradient) or a combination of these methods.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0060]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0061" num="0060">BDMs useful for the present invention range in size from about 30 nm to about 2000 nm and may contain biologically active molecules (e.g. polynucleotide and/or polypeptides). Examples of BDMs include but are not limited to, “exosomes” (about 30 nm to about 200 nm in diameter), “microvesicles” (about 100 nm to about 2000 nm in diameter), and “apoptotic bodies” (about 300 nm to about 2000 nm in diameter). The term BDM is used interchangeably with “exosome”, “microvesicle” or “apoptotic body”, “membrane particles”, “membrane vesicles”, “exosome-like vesicles”, “ectosome-like vesicles”, “ectosomes” or “exovesicles”. The BDM lipid bilayer is derived from membranes of the donor cell. BDMs derived from different cell types may show differences in lipid composition compared to the plasma membrane. During the genesis of exosomes, transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins can be embedded in the vesicle membrane, and at the same time, cytosolic components may also be incorporated into the vesicles.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0061]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0062" num="0061">As used herein, the term “endogenous” refers to a compound naturally produced by a cell and derived from the cell. For example, a BDM contains an endogenous polypeptide if that polypeptide was produced within the cell the BDM is derived from.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0062]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein the term “naturally secreted” as applied to a carrier, a particle, a vesicle or molecule refers to a carrier, a particle, a vesicle or molecule that is released to the environment from a cell, an organism or tissue by a process found in nature. For example, exosome that can be isolated from a source and which has not been physically translocated from within the boundaries of the source by a human in the laboratory is naturally secreted.

These include, for example, sonication, extrusion, high pressure/homogenization, microfluidization, detergent dialysis, calcium-induced fusion of small liposomes and lipid film hydration methods. For example, LNPs can be made using the previously described preformed vesicle method (Maurer et al., 2001). Typically, the method consists of extruding LNPs through a small-pore polycarbonate membrane to reduce LNPs sizes to a well-defined size distribution and in a later stage, if required, therapeutic agents are loaded into the preformed vesicles. Alternatively, EDEMS can be prepared via spontaneous self-assembly in a microfluidic system. Protocols for producing well-defined size distribution with such manufacturing techniques are known in the art (Belliveau et al., 2012). Preferably, the EDEMs used in the present invention are substantially homogeneous in size and density distribution to facilitate separation from subpopulations of BDMs and hybridosomes. The separation is made by using techniques well known in the art, for instance, size exclusion chromatography and density gradient centrifugation. In one specific embodiment, the density of the EDEMs is lower than the one of the hybridosome, thereby facilitating the separation of the hybrid vesicles from the EDEMs via sucrose density gradient centrifugation.</div>

For example, the first membrane may be from the EDEM while the second membrane encompasses the BDM. Alternatively, the first membrane may be the one of the hybridosome while the second membrane is an outer cell surface membrane, an endosomal membrane, a lysosomal membrane or a nuclear membrane. The fusogenic moiety increase the interaction of the EDEM or of the hybridosome comprising said fusogenic moiety with a second membrane, thereby promoting the mixing of the membrane lipids and the mixing of the internal volume and encapsulated contents.

On the one hand, EDEMs can be designed to have precisely defined physicochemical properties, tunable fusogenicity, high encapsulation efficiencies for a wide range of active agents, withstand harsh environments needed for conjugation chemistry and meet clinical manufacturing requirements. On the other hand, BDMs have safe toxicity and immunogenicity profiles, show innate specificity for a target (e.g. a cell, tissue or organ) and are optimized with regard to organism circulation properties. Therefore, the hybridosome of the invention is of particular interest for therapy, imaging and diagnostic applications. A wide variety of active agents may be easily encapsulated in vitro into EDEMs, and by uniting said EDEMs with specific BDMs originating from the subject, a personalized biocompatible hybridosome including the active agents is generated. The hybridosome of the invention may also present one or more of the following advantages: (a) a reduction of sequestration from the macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (RES); (b) a reduction of the immune system response; (c) an increased circulation lifetime; (d) the delivery with specific and enhanced targeting; and (e) an increase in therapeutic and/or monitoring effects.</div>

In that way, this tailored hybridosome can readily extravasate through fenestrations of the vasculature and directly target the tumor cells from the interstitial space. Similarly, in order to target hepatocytes, one or more of the basic modules may be selected/engineered so that the resulting hybridosome is smaller than the fenestrations of the endothelial layer lining hepatic sinusoids in the liver.

This targeting moiety binds specifically to an intracellular membrane surface or antigen, such as a protein. In certain embodiments, an intracellular targeting moiety will enhance the localization of a substance to desired intracellular location. In some embodiments, the second targeting moiety is proteinaceous, and in certain embodiments is an antibody or antibody-like molecule. Other second targeting moieties include peptides, such as for example the synthetic melittin peptide analogues, and organic macromolecules which by virtue of their size (a molecular weight of &gt;500 g), charge, or other physicochemical properties, are unable or poorly able to enter cells independently. In some embodiments, the second targeting moiety is a nucleic acid aptamer. The second targeting moiety may bind to cytosolic proteins; proteins bound to the inner face of the plasma membrane, or the nuclear, mitochondrial or other membranes in the cell; or nuclear proteins or proteins in other subcellular compartments. It will be evident to those skilled in the art that targeting moiety which blocks critical functions of intracellular signaling will be good candidates for use as second targeting moieties. Second targeting moieties may directly inhibit the activity of a protein, or block an interaction with a protein's substrate, or they may block protein-protein interactions.</div>

An example for enhanced intracellular transport is achieved by employing targeting moieties capable of “hijacking”, binding or engaging natural active cellular transport systems. For example, binding one of these proteins of the microtubule motor complex with a motor protein-binding peptide allows for active transport along the microtubule transport network. Exemplary motor proteins include, but are not limited, to dynein and kinesin.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0096]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0097" num="0096">In certain embodiments, the second targeting moiety possesses a dual role, namely membrane penetrating capacities and intracellular targeting functionalities. For example the peptide melittin or analogues thereof possess a membrane interaction ability at low pH and a nuclear-homing functionality within the cytosol. This dual role maybe attributed to a segment of the second targeting moiety. For example, nuclear targeting functions mediated through nuclear localization sequences (e.g. peptide sequence “KRKR”) and amphipathic α-helix segments contained within the same second targeting moiety. Hence, in certain embodiments the dual role of a second targeting moiety can mediate two complementary functions to the hybridosome. Exemplary hybridosome compositions modified with dual-purpose second targeting moiety is described in the Examples below.</div>

These peptides are characterized by their capacity to disturb membrane bilayer integrity, either by creation of defects, disruption, or through pore formation, leading to an interaction between EDEMs and BDMS. Examples of such peptides can be derived from proteins such as Tat and Rev as well as peptides derived from toxins such as crotamine or melittin. A preferred class of cell-penetrating peptides suitable for use within the present invention include hydrophobic domains that are “inert” at physiological pH, but are active in the low pH environment. Upon pH-induced unfolding and exposure of the hydrophobic domain, the moiety binds to lipid bilayers and effects the interaction between EDEMs and BDMs or hybridosomes and endosomal compartments.

In this regard, BDMs are able to deliver an active agent to target cells and tissues, while retaining the biological activity of endogenous cargo as well as the active agents. In particular, BDMs show evolutionarily optimized serum half-life and interaction with target tissues and/or cells. The advantageous delivery capability of one or more BDMs is transferred to the hybridosome of the invention after uniting BDMs with one or more EDEMs. Furthermore, BDMs are able to transfer endogenous bioactive components to the hybridosome. In one specific embodiment, one or more BDMs are collected and used to promote the release of endogenous miRNA, polynucleotides and polypeptides produced in vivo by donor cells, into the volume enclosed by the hybridosome of the invention. In another embodiment, one or more BDMs are collected and used to promote the transfer of bioactive molecules and/or polypeptides embedded in the BDM membrane as constituents of the membrane of the hybridosome.</div>

Furthermore, components of the BDMs used in the invention can interact with specific cells and facilitate endocytosis, thereby enabling targeted delivery of encapsulated material to a specific cell, cell type, or tissue. Without being bound by any particular theory, the target cell specificity of BDMs used in the invention depends on the cell type from which the BDM is derived. For instance, BDMs derived from B-cells or Glioblastoma cells may be used to produce the hybridosomes of the invention. Such BDMs may transfer one or more endogenous B-cell or Glioblastoma targeting moieties produced in vivo to the hybridosome, thereby rendering the hybridosome B-cell or glioblastoma specific. Also, it is expected that hybridosome reintroduced into the subject from whom the BDM used to produce the hybridosome is derived, the BDM components transferred to the hybridosome render it compatible with the immune system of said subject.</div>

The term “disease-associated antigens” can relate to proteins produced in disease associated cells that have an abnormal structure and/or an abnormal expression pattern compared to non-disease associated cells. Abnormal proteins are also produced by cells infected with oncoviruses, e.g. EBV and HPV. For example, in some embodiments, the BDMs are well-suited for presenting antigens that can stimulate desirable immune responses in subjects. This advantage may arise because BDMs are produced by cells, rather than artificially-synthesized, and therefore provide antigens that are “natural”. That is, the antigens produced by the cells and found in the BDMs can be full-length peptides that are processed (e.g., glycosylated, etc.) and folded by the cell to a similar extent as antigens experienced by immune cells in a subject. In addition to proteins, other substances like cell surface glycolipids and glycoproteins may also have an abnormal structure in disease associated cells and could thus be targets of the immune system. As such, the BDM antigens may be utilized in vaccines or treatments against, for example cancers. In some embodiments, therefore, the one or more antigens can each comprise a cancer cell antigen. As non-limiting examples, the cancer cell antigen can be placental type alkaline phosphatase, p53, p63, p73, mdm-2, procathepsin-D, B23, C23, PLAP, CA125, MUC-1, cerB/HER2, NY-ESO-1.SCP1, SSX-1, SSX-2, SSX-4, HSP27, HSP60, HSP90, GRP78, TAG72, HoxA7, HoxB7, EpCAM, ras, mesothelin, survivin, EGFK, MUC-1, and c-myc.</div>

The methods of the present invention have numerous advantages over the methods of the prior art. Methods for treating patients using active agents have been used for a long time. However, in most of the prior art methods, the active agent was usually delivered to the whole human or animal body, without being targeted to a particular site affected by a disease. Thus, in the prior art methods, the active agent is distributed uniformly in the whole organism. One drawback of the prior art methods is that unaffected regions of the human or animal body can also be affected by the active agent.

For example, when a EDEM (e.g., a iLNP) comprises or is otherwise enriched with one or more of the ionizable lipids, the phase transition in the lipid bilayer of the one or more target cells may facilitate the delivery of the encapsulated materials (e.g., one or more active agents encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle) into the target cells. Similarly, in certain embodiments the compounds disclosed herein may be used to prepare hybridosomes that are characterized by their reduced toxicity in vivo. In certain embodiments, the reduced toxicity is a function of the high transfection efficiencies associated with the compositions disclosed herein, such that a reduced quantity of such composition may administered to the subject to achieve a desired therapeutic response or outcome.</div>

Such enhanced release may be achieved by a proton-sponge mediated disruption mechanism, in which the ability of a compound within the EDEM, can buffer the acidification of the endosome, which in turn promotes osmotic swelling and the disruption of the endosomal or lysosomal lipid membrane and facilitate intracellular release of encapsulated cargo therein into the target cell.</div>

As discussed above, in certain embodiments, the hybridosome of the present invention allows for the delivery of an active agent preferentially to a diseased site. Such a targeted delivery may also allow one to avoid high doses of an active agent. Such a targeted delivery may enhance the efficacy of the active agent. This may in turn help prevent toxic side effects that are associated with the administration of high doses of various active agents or effects associated with the carrier itself (e.g. lipids, exogenous targeting moieties).

Where purification of the hybridosomes is desired, purification may be accomplished by centrifugation through a sucrose density gradient or other media which is suitable to form a density gradient. However, it is understood that other methods of purification such as chromatography, filtration, phase partition, precipitation or absorption may also be utilized. Purification methods include, for example, purification via centrifugation through a sucrose density gradient, or purification through a size exclusion column. The sucrose gradient may range from about 0% sucrose to about 60% sucrose, preferably from about 5% sucrose to about 30% sucrose. The buffer in which the sucrose gradient is made can be any aqueous buffer suitable for storage of the fraction containing the complexes and preferably, a buffer suitable for administration of the hybridosomes to cells and tissues. Alternate separation techniques may include, but are not limited to, isoelectric focusing and/or immunoaffinity chromatography. For example, EDEMs comprising ionizable lipids display a net cationic surface charge and can be separated via electrophoresis. In one embodiment of the present invention, purification of hybridosomes may be achieved by sequential purification techniques. For example, a first immunoaffinity chromatography relating to affinity to BDM surface molecules followed by a second immunoaffinity chromatography relating to affinity of PEG molecules can sequentially separate hybridosomes from excess BDMs and EDEMs. A further separation technique could encompass asymmetric flow field flow fractionation coupled with multi angle light scattering to fractionate the reactant and product vesicles.</div>

As the ensemble nature of DLS measurements makes it difficult to positively deduce the presence of interactions between the two subunits, the focus was next turned to the interaction between the lipid membranes of both exosomes and iLNPs.</div>

During a fusion process, the lipids from two membranes disperse within the newly formed membrane. Lipid mixing was monitored by the increase in fluorescence resulting from dilution of lipophilic self-quenching rhodamine dye (R18). Exosomes (20 μg of protein) were labeled with 1 μl of an ethanolic solution of octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) (Biotium) (1 mM) in MES buffer (10 mM MES, pH 5.5, 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl). This solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The unincorporated R18 was removed by using a Zebaspin© desalting column (40 kDa cut off), equilibrated with a MES fusion buffer (10 mM MES, pH 5.5, 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl). R18-labeled exosomes (5 μg of total protein) were suspended in the appropiate buffer in a stirred quartz-cuvette and sample fluorescence was measured via a LS55 spectrofluorometer (Perkin Elmer) at 560-nm excitation and 590-nm emission wavelengths. Following an equilibration time of 3 min, unlabeled iLNPs (30 μg total lipid) were added to the exosomes, and fluorescence was monitored for a further 30 min. Maximal R18 dilution was obtained by adding Triton X-100 to disrupt the membranes. The extent of lipid mixing was measured as the difference of equilibrated fluorescence from exosomes alone and expressed as % of maximal fluorescence de-quenching following detergent disruption. Analogous to exosomes, microvesicle samples (0.25 μg PLT-MVs and 1.2 μg PMN-MVs total protein) were labeled with ethanolic solution of R18, followed by free dye removal and monitoring of increase in fluorescence as mentioned above.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0230]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0228" num="0230">Upon fusion between unlabeled iLNPs and R18 labeled exosomes, the rhodamine incorporated into the membrane of the exosome disperses into the unlabeled liposomal membrane portions, resulting in reduced close-quarter self-quenching and subsequently the fluorescence increases proportionally to the degree of membrane fusion. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, rapid increase in fluoresence occurred at pH of 5.5, slower and continuous increase in fluoresence at a pH of 6.6, while lipid mixing was hampered at pH 7.6. To verify that the cationic nature of iLNPs was the driving force behind lipid mixing and not a change of pH, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that the addition of 0% DLinDMA liposomes (DSPC/Chol/PEG) resulted in no de-quenching. In order to rule out a fusogenic property specific to the ionizable lipid DLinDMA to potentially be the driving force behind lipid mixing, iLNPs were manufactured in which the DLinDMA was substituted by the ionizable lipid DODAP. Lipid mixing was observed upon adding these DODAP-iLNPs to R18 labeled exosomes (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Additionally, similar experiments were conducted when increasing the PEG-lipid content of iLNPs from 2.5 mol % to 10 mol % (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and varying the temperature (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</div>

The temporal emergence of particles that comprised a mixture of exosomal protein and liposomal membranes was quantified in a fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) setup. In preparation for FCCS measurements, iLNPs membranes were labeled with lipophilic Bodipy™ (630/650) while exosomal surface proteins were labeled by conjugation with Bodipy™ NHS Ester (493/502). Both exosomes and iLNPs were then mixed in fusion buffer at comparable particle numbers and the emergence of correlated intensity fluctuations in both channels was recorded. Synchronized signals on both detectors represent either aggregated or fused exosomes and iLNPs, while individual particles generate temporally independent signals. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the increase in the degree of cross-correlation (0) when exosomes-Bodipy™ (493) and iLNP-Bodipy™ (630) were mixed, is shown over time. No correlation between the green and red channel was observed just after mixing of the two particles. Over the time course of 8 min the degree of cross correlation of the individual particles increased from 0% to approximately 70%, implying that nearly 70% of the total fluorescent bursts of probed particles exhibited exosomal surface proteins and liposomal membrane.</div>

The same experimental conditions were used to monitor the z-average mean size for a period of 10 h. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, within the first hour of mixing, the mean particle size rapidly increases and remains virtually unaffected over the next nine hours. In the case of aggregation, oppositely charged vesicles have the ability to continuously aggregate into electrostatically structured formations, yet this is not the case. A further indicator ruling out aggregation is the extent of diameter increase. The volume of two fused spheres scales with the radius in a V ∝r<sup>3 </sup>fashion, whereby the fusion of a 85 nm and a 130 nm sphere would give rise to a 141 nm particle. In aggregation on the other hand, the radius scales linearly with every further sphere joining an aggregate. This would be evident by a large diameter increase in the range of multiples of the subunit diameter. This is further supported as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a mixture of siRNA-iLNPs and MCL-exos in fusion buffer (stored at room temperature) showed no significant increase in mean diameter over the period of 9 days.</div>

Prior to analysis, iLNPs and exosomes were diluted in fusion buffer (20′000-fold for iLNPs and 0.01 mg exosomal protein per ml).

Cells (50′000 cells seeded the prior day) were transfected with iLNPs (500 ng GFP-pDNA per well) and loaded hybridosomes (5 μg total protein/500ng GFP-pDNA per well). Hybridosomes were manufactured prior to transfection by mixing exosomes with pDNA-iLNPs in fusion buffer for 30 min. In order to rule out that transfection is a result of fortuitous internalization of iLNPs due to exosome-induced endocytosis, cells were also co-transfected with unfused iLNPs (500ng GFP-pDNA per well) and exosomes (5 μg total protein per well). After transfection times of 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h or 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, fresh medium was added and cells were cultured for 72 h.
