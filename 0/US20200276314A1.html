<div class="abstract">An inhalable dry powder formulation containing SAE-CD and an active agent is provided. The formulation is adapted for administration by DPI. The SAE-CD serves as a carrier rather than as an absorption enhancer. The average particle size of the SAE-CD is large enough to preclude (for the most part) pulmonary deposition thereof. Following release from the DPI device, the SAE-CD-containing particles dissociate from the active agent-containing particles in the buccal cavity or throat, after which the active agent-containing particles continue deeper into the respiratory tract. The physicochemical and morphological properties of the SAE-CD are easily modified to permit optimization of active agent and carrier interactions. Drugs having a positive, neutral or negative electrostatic charge can be delivered by DPI when SAE-CD is used as a carrier.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of administering, and a dry powder formulation for administering an inhalable active agent by inhalation with a dry powder inhaler (DPI) using sulfoalkyl ether cyclodextrin as a carrier therefor. The invention also relates to methods of treating diseases and disorders of the lung by administration of a dry powder comprising therapeutic agent and SAE-CD as a carrier.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">The delivery of a drug by inhalation allows deposition of the drug in different sections of the respiratory tract, e.g., throat, trachea, bronchi and alveoli. Generally, the smaller the particle size, the longer the particle will remain suspended in air and the farther down the respiratory tract the drug can be delivered. Drugs are delivered by inhalation using a nebulizer, metered dose inhaler (MDI), or dry powder inhaler (DPI).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Dry powder inhalers provide powder pharmaceuticals in aerosol form to patients. In order to generate an aerosol, the powder in its static state must be fluidized and entrained into the patient's inspiratory airflow. The powder is subject to numerous cohesive and adhesive forces that must be overcome if it is to be dispersed. Fluidization and entrainment requires the input of energy to the static powder bed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">DPIs can be divided into two classes: passive and active devices. Passive devices rely solely upon the patients inspiratory flow through the DPI to provide the energy needed for dispersion. This method has the advantage that drug release is automatically coordinated with the patient's inhalation. The disadvantage is that dispersion is typically highly dependent on the patient's ability to inhale at an optimum flow rate for aerosol generation. Depending on the inhaler design, this requirement may be difficult for some patients if the device resistance to airflow is high. Active dispersion devices have been under development for the past ten years but none has yet been approved. Like propellant driven metered dose inhalers, active devices use a source external to the patient to provide the energy needed for powder dispersion. This has the advantage of potentially reducing the dependence of uniform dosing on the patient's capabilities. However, without a feedback mechanism for the energy source, it is still possible that different patients will receive different doses. In addition, the complexity of these devices has contributed to their inability to achieve regulatory approval and may increase the cost of the device.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Passive devices have progressed in their complexity and performance since the introduction of the Allen &amp; Hanbury's Rotahaler and the Fison's Spinhaler in the 1970's. Passive dispersion relies on the airflow generated by the user to aerosolize the powdered drug. All passive devices disperse the drug by passing the airflow through the powder bed. Early devices dispersed very small quantities of respirable sized particles, often on the order of 10% of the nominal dose. In general, this poor performance can be attributed to the incomplete deaggregation of smaller drug particles from larger carrier particles used as a diluent and an aid to powder flow during dispersion. Modern devices utilize significant turbulence to aid in the deaggregation process. Turbulence can be provided by tortuous flow paths for the particle laden airflow as in the AstraZeneca Turbuhaler, the Schering-Plough Twisthaler and U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,843; changing dimensions of the airflow path (U.S. Pat. No. 5,437,271); or by impactor plates that also reduce the emission of large particles (U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,959). A device developed by Innovative Devices (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,209,538 and 5,988,163) addresses the desirability of dispersing powder at optimal flow rates via channels whose operation is flow dependent. Initially, flow is diverted around the drug and is allowed to pass through the drug only when the optimal flow rate has been obtained. This device bridges the gap between passive and active devices by adding active features to a passive device.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Active devices use mechanisms such as springs or a battery to store energy that can be released to aid in powder dispersion. The best known active devices are the Inhale (Nektar) Deep Lung delivery system and the Dura Spiros. The Inhale device uses compressed air generated by the user through a spring loaded pump mechanism to disperse powder drug. There are a few other patents identified that utilize compressed air (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,875,776 and 6,003,512) or a vacuum (U.S. Pat. No. 6,138,673) to provide energy for dispersion. The Dura Spiros DPI uses a battery driven impeller to disperse drug powder. The impeller operates only when the patient inhales through the DPI to ensure that dosing does not occur when not in use. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,469,843 and 5,482,032 describe another mechanism of dispersion (use of a hammer or other means of impaction to dislodge drug from a powder bed typically contained on a blister strip). Little published data is available for the active devices since most of their development has occurred in a proprietary atmosphere. Some of the patented technology, both for active and passive devices, is only conceptual.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">For lung deposition, drug particles are generally required to be smaller than 10 μm (microns) in aerodynamic diameter. They may be prepared by either size reduction methods, such as milling, or particle construction methods, such as condensation, evaporation or precipitation. Historically, respirable particles are produced by jet-milling, where there is little control over the particle size, shape or morphology. The resulting fractured particles are highly electrostatic, cohesive, and subjective to changes in crystallinity. Alternative methods of particle generation include spray-drying, solvent evaporation or extraction or supercritical fluid condensation. All of these methods produce structurally more uniform particles.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Particles smaller than 10 μm generally exhibit poor flow properties due to their high interparticle forces. Formulation strategies to improve the flowability of respirable particles include the controlled agglomeration of drug particles or adhesion onto excipient carrier particles in the form of interactive mixtures. The agglomerates or interactive mixtures are required to be strong enough to withstand processing, storage or transport processes, but weak enough to allow drug deaggregation and dispersion during actuation. Controlled agglomeration may be achieved by feeding micronized powders through a screw feeder, followed by spheronization in a rotating pan or drum. This method may be used for formulations containing drug alone or drug/lactose blends. Factors affecting the aerosol dispersion of carrier-based formulations include drug and carrier properties, such as size, shape, surface roughness (rugosity), chemical composition and crystalline state, the drug-carrier ratio and the presence of ternary components.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">The drug particle size effects aerosol dispersion. Different sized spray-dried mannitol (2.7 to 7.3 μm) and disodium cromoglycate (2.3 to 5.2 μm) particles were examined. Higher aerosol dispersion, due to less cohesion, was observed in larger particles; however, lower fine particle fraction (FPF) was produced due to greater impaction on the throat and upper stages of the impinger and smaller proportion of fine particles. Conditioning or surface modification of drug particles may reduce aggregation and improve aerosol dispersion. The amorphous content of particles may be reduced by treatment with water vapor in controlled temperature and relative humidity conditions or treatment in a vacuum oven. Surface modification by adhesion of nanoparticles onto the drug particles may increase aerosol dispersion. Hydrophilic silicic acid and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP) nanoparticles increased device emission and respirable fractions of pranlukast hydrate in both drug alone and carrier-based formulations.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Conflicting reports exist on the influence of drug concentration in carrier-based DPI formulations. Increasing drug concentration may increase the respirable fraction or reduce the respirable fraction.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">The particle size, shape, surface morphology and chemical composition of carrier particles can influence aerosol dispersion. Increased drug dispersion and deposition is generally observed with smaller carrier size and increased proportion of fine particles. However, the carrier size did not affect the FPF in some formulations. Higher FPF was produced with larger carrier sizes (within 63-90 μm). Poor dispersion of nedocromil was obtained using coarse carrier systems, whereas the use of fine carrier particles and high shear mixing techniques physically disrupted the drug-drug contacts and promoted deaggregation. Elongated carriers increased aerosol dispersibility and drug FPF, possibly due to increased duration in the airstream drag forces. Carriers with smooth surfaces produced higher respirable fractions. Low respirable fractions were obtained from carriers with macroscopic surface roughness or smooth surfaces, whereas high respirable fractions were obtained from carriers with microscopic surface roughness, where smaller contact area and reduced drug adhesion occurred at the tiny surface protrusions. A modification of carrier formulation involves the use of soft friable lactose pellets containing micronized lactose particles, which break down into primary particles during inhalation has also been described. The lactose pellet may be coated with drug. In another study, carrier particles with good powder flow characteristics exhibited reduced adhesion to a defined solid surface and produced higher drug deposition in an animal model. The influence of carrier particle size on the performance of a formulation in a DPI device is summarized in the following table.</div>

Specifically, inter-particulate forces should be such that the drug particles adhere to the carrier (to aid in blending, uniformity, and allow the entrainment of drug into the inspiratory air-stream), yet also allow detachment of the fine drug particles from the surface of the coarser carrier particles so that delivery to the lung can be facilitated.</div>

The higher FPF of salbutamol (albuterol) sulphate obtained from anhydrous and medium lactose was attributed to a higher proportion of fine particles and smooth surface roughness. The higher FPF of nacystelyn obtained from anhydrous β-lactose was attributed to its intermediate surface roughness. Other sugars were investigated as fine and coarse carriers. Higher FPF was obtained using mannitol coarse carrier, possibly due to a higher fine particle content and more elongated shape. Mixtures with added fine particle carrier produced higher FPF with little difference observed between the fine carrier type.</div>

Improved aerosol dispersion of particles may be achieved by the co-spray-drying with excipients, such as sodium chloride, or human serum albumin (HSA). Respirable-sized particles composed of hydrophobic drug and hydrophilic excipients were produced by simultaneous spray-drying of separate solutions through a co-axial nozzle. Therapeutically active peptide particles have been produced by spray-drying with good flow and dispersibility properties, including insulin, α-1-antitrypsin and β-interferon. The addition of stabilizing excipients, such as mannitol and human serum albumin (HSA) is generally required. Spray-dried microspheres composed of cellulose lower alkyl ethers, such as hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, may be used for sustained drug release. These particles are adhesive following water adsorption from the lung mucosa. Stable dry powder formulations of polynucleotide complexes were produced by lyophilization with a cryoprotectant, such as mannitol, followed by sieving or milling.</div>

These large particles are less cohesive, due, to reduced van der Waals forces, and have improved flow and aerosol dispersion properties. Increased rough surface texture may further minimize particle aggregation and improve flow. Particles deposited in the alveolar regions may avoid phagocytic engulfment by size exclusion. Controlled rate of drug release is achieved using biodegradable polymers, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(glycolic acid) (PGA).

Excipients act as diluents and stablility enhancers and improve flowability and aerosol dispersibility. Since lactose is the only US-approved excipient for DPI formulations, there is a need for alternative safe excipients. Suggestions have included carbohydrates, such as fructose, glucose, galactose, sucrose, trehalose, raffinose, melezitose; alditols, such as mannitol and xylitol; maltodextrins, dextrans, cyclodextrins, amino acids, such as glycine, arginine, lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and polypeptides, such as human serum albumin and gelatin. To mask the unpleasant taste of some inhaled drug compounds, flavoring particles containing maltodextrin and peppermint oil may be incorporated into dry powder formulations.

New formulations contain multiple drug components, such as fluticasone and salmeterol. This brings about further complications in the particle interactions involved with powder systems. There has been much speculation on the potential delivery of locally and systemically acting drugs such as analgesics (fentanyl and morphine), antibiotics, peptides (insulin, vasopressin, growth hormone, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone), RNA/DNA fragments for gene therapy and vaccines. However, the only new therapy provided using DPI formulations is zanamivir (Relenza), which is mainly targeted at the upper respiratory tract for the treatment of influenza.</div>

The nature of these absorption promoters is based on a variety of mechanisms, not all of which are fully elucidated. The best known are the classical absorption enhancers such as bile salts and surfactants which are known to disrupt cell membranes and open tight junctions rendering epithelia more permeable. This has been followed by the use of small particulates containing drug, which may find their way across epithelia intact. Many of these particulate approaches have yet to be published with respect to lung delivery but some of the companies with relevant technology include Nanosystems, PDC and BioSante. An alternative approach involves the close association of a carrier molecule with peptides and proteins for transport across the epithelium. The mechanism of improved uptake is not fully characterized for these molecules with respect to the lung epithelium. The maximum doses that can be delivered to the lungs limit the systemic delivery of drugs. However, the potential advantage of all of the particulate or molecular transport promoters is that they may improve bioavailability of the drug, maximizing the proportion of the dose that reaches the site of action. This is particularly important for macromolecules which may not be delivered effectively by any other route of administration. The safety implications of using any agent that modifies the physiology of the lung must be fully considered if it is to be adopted for any commercially viable product.</div>

In multidose inhalers, said effects hamper the loading of the doses of powder from the reservoir system to the aerosolization chamber, since the cohesion forces reduce free flowing of the particles and promote their agglomeration and/or their adhesion to the walls.

Due to the weak interactions between the two components of the mixture, breathing-in through the inhaler causes separation of the micronized drug particles from the coarse carrier particles and therefore inhalation of the smaller particles and deposition of the coarser particles in the oropharyngeal cavity.

Although no results regarding actual utility in an inhaled formulation were disclosed, they suggest that BMP rather than BDP would be a better alternative for development of a nebulizer solution.</div>

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of pulmonary delivery on the systemic absorption of FK224 in comparison with other administration routes, and to determine the bioavailability (BA) of FK224 following pulmonary administration in rats using various dosage forms. After administration of an aqueous suspension, the bioavailability was reduced to 2.7% compared with 16.8% for the solution. However, β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) was found to be an effective additive as far as improving the solubility of FK224 was concerned. The bioavailability of the aqueous suspension containing β-CD was increased to 19.2%. It was observed that both the C(max) and AUC of FK224 were increased as the amount of β-CD increased.

For example, a particular lactose-containing formulation might be suitable for use in a high pressure drop device, but that formulation would not be suitable in a low pressure drop device. A study was conducted to determine the suitability of the present formulations for DPI range of devices having different pressure drops. Formulations containing lactose or SAE-CD, each containing sodium cromolyn, were made according to specific processes. The performance of the formulations was evaluated in low resistance (0.065 cmH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>0.5</sup>/L/min) and high resistance (0.18 cmH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>0.5</sup>/L/min) devices. The formulations described herein are suitable for use in any of such devices. The SAE-CD containing formulations were found to be suitable for delivery at low (15.2 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 60 L/min) and high (54.4 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 60 L/min) pressure drops which are equivalent to the Diskhaler and Inhalator (Handihaler) devices by delivering 25% fine particle fraction with an emitted dose in the 80-90% range. In contrast, lactose containing formulation was pressure drop dependent being substantially equivalent to the SAE-CD at high pressure drop but only delivering 15% FPF and 70% emitted dose at low pressure. The formulations of the invention are therefore capable of use in DPI devices in a substantially pressure drop independent manner.</div>

As noted in the dispersion study below, the fine particle fraction (stage 2 deposition in a twin stage impinger) from the smaller carrier particles was higher than for larger particles. The difference in particle size was determined according to the surface area of the SAE-CD batch used: the larger the surface area, the smaller the particle size. Increased fluidization (Stage 1+2 deposition) with larger carrier sizes was observed when using SAE-CD spray agglomerated powders: 175 to 270 μm median diameter), but this did not improve the fine particle fraction. In contrast, decreases in carrier particle size negatively influenced flow characteristics.</div>

Intermediate sized carrier particles might be expected to prevent or reduce the direct interactions of drug and carrier particles. Therefore, monodisperse powders generally exhibit lower saturation of the carrier surface binding sites than polydisperse powders. However, polydisperse powders may also influence flow and dispersion properties of carrier systems negatively. Intercalation of smaller particles within larger particles will increase the effective contact area and inter-particulate interactions within the powder. Thus, carrier powder polydispersity is balanced between these competing influences.</div>

If it is desired that the particles reach the lower regions of the respiratory tract, i.e., the alveoli and terminal bronchi, the preferred median particle diameter size range is between about 0.5 and about 2.5 microns.

The relatively large diameter of the carrier particle improves the opportunity for active particles to become attached to carrier particles which is controlled by the above technique to provide good flow and entrainment characteristics and improved release of the active particles in the airways to increase deposition of the active particles in the lower lung.</div>

In other words, the table should be read such that an active agent having a particular electrostatic charge is preferably formulated with an SAE-CD carrier having a particular electrostatic charge. For example, a highly negative or moderately negative drug is preferably formulated in a dry powder DPI device with SAE-CD carrier having a neutral to low negative electrostatic charge. In view of the above and other aspects discussed herein, it should be understood that an SAE-CD can serve as a suitable dry powder carrier for a full range of drugs differing in their electrostatic charges.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0178]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0169" num="0178">Dispersion studies according to the example below of albuterol from Captisol® and lactose blends indicate significant influence of electrostatic charge on the carrier systems. Dynamic electrostatic charge measurements showed that micronized albuterol carries a significant positive charge. Comparison between Captisol® and lactose as carrier particles showed that lactose systems (neutral charge) more efficiently delivered micronized drug to stage 2 (fine particles) than Captisol® systems (moderate to strong negative charge). Thus, without being held bound to a particular mechanism, it is postulated that SAE-CD carrier particles exhibit greater drug attachment than lactose when albuterol is used as the model drug system. The SAE-CD powder (derived from foam) with the smallest negative charge exhibited the most stage 2 deposition of albuterol.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0179]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0170" num="0179">The charge of the carrier particles was compared to dispersion performances from the entrainment tubes for albuterol and cromolyn. Charge neutral carrier particles resulted in significantly greater retention of drug (albuterol or cromolyn) in the entrainment tube. A similar correlation was obtained for Throat deposition. In addition, stage 1 deposition showed an inverse correlation where increasing the negative charge of the carrier resulted in a greater percentage of drug delivered to this stage. Correlations between drug dispersion to stage 2 and electrostatic charge were smaller. Albuterol stage 2 deposition was also related to the electrostatic charge of the carrier. However, the cromolyn (small negative charge) stage 2 deposition appeared to be less dependent on electrostatics.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0180]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0171" num="0180">Accordingly, the polarity and magnitude of charge of the carrier particles and model drugs significantly influences performance of the dry powder formulations. Albuterol (high positive charge), sodium cromolyn (electroneutral), and fluorescein (moderate negative charge) were dispersed more readily using either Lactose (electro-neutral, small size), or SAE-CD derived from foam (moderate negative charge, small size) as compared to spray dried or spray agglomerated SAE-CD carrier.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0181]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0172" num="0181">Electrostatic and morphological characteristics are factors involved in the good dispersion properties observed with SAE-CD carrier derived from foam. Those powder particles had smooth, angular surfaces and were generally minimally aggregated with a slight elongation of the particles. Together with a relatively lower electrostatic charge and small size, dispersion to Stage 2 of the liquid impinger was significantly higher than other SAE-CD based carrier systems.</div>

The high inter-particulate forces between carrier and albuterol can be overcome using the Inhalator. This indicates that the fluidization of the SAE-CD powder (due to size and morphology) can be maximized by appropriate selection of device for lung delivery.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0183]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0174" num="0183">Mixing of carrier and micronized drug particles can influence the electrostatics of the system. Mixing may induce triboelectrification and increase electrostatic charge. Drug particle adhesion to carrier particle surface may result in charge shielding and reduce the electrostatics of the system. The electrostatics of the powder blends described above were determined and attempts were made to correlate these results with the dispersion performance observed in the liquid impinger studies. Increasing electrostatic charge of the blend has a beneficial effect on dispersion of the powder formulation from the entrainment tubes. Increasing the charge of the blend correlated with decreased device and throat deposition, while stage 1 deposition was increased. The differences in electrostatic charge of the blends may result from differences in adhesion between drug and carrier particles. Positively charged blends may result from more loosely bound micronized drug particles detaching from the carrier particles during electrostatic charge measurements (i.e. during powder flow). In addition, the positive charge of the blends may represent free micronized drug particles in the blend. This may result from saturation of binding sites on the SAE-CD carrier. In this case, the net electrostatic charge measured will be dominated by micronized drug particle charge (i.e. albuterol carries a positive charge). Conversely, blends with negative electrostatic charge may represent systems in which carrier-drug adhesion is dominant. Thus, in these cases the charge of the blend is a useful predictor of powder dispersion characteristics.</div>

The Inhalator™ device was used to provide maximum turbulence. The results indicate that, in this system, the dispersion properties of Lactose and SAE-CD were equivalent at high-pressure drop. However, the performance of SAE-CD derived from foam appears to be pressure drop independent (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Its performance is consistent for different devices (FPF means are not statistically different). In contrast, lactose dispersion performance appears to be significantly influenced by device characteristics (P=0.005).). Variability of the FPF also appears to be higher in the lactose formulation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) (P=0.027 for low pressure device variances, no significant difference for high pressure device variances).

Intermediately dispersed powders can have optimal flow and dispersion properties. Some degree of dispersity helps reduce inter-particulate interactions similarly to ternary blend mixtures. Intermediate sized carrier particles can prevent or reduce the direct interactions of drug and carrier particles. Therefore, monodisperse powders exhibit lower saturation of the carrier surface binding sites than polydisperse powders. However, polydisperse powders can influence flow and dispersion properties of carrier systems negatively. Intercalation of smaller particles within larger particles will increase the effective contact area and inter-particulate interactions within the powder. Thus, carrier powder polydispersity is balanced between these competing influences. Generally, particle size distributions for carrier particles, for optimal dispersion, should have moderate dispersity, i.e. particle size span should be between 1.5 and 2.9.</div>

In the art, spheres or particles with a high degree of rotational symmetry are preferred over irregular shapes for good flow and dispersion characteristics. However, SAE-CD spherical particles may have increased inter-particulate forces that restrict flow when polydisperse powders are used. In the art and according to the invention, smooth particles are generally preferred over rough particles due to particle-particle interlocking and increases in frictional forces. However, if surface asperities are in the appropriate dimensions, increases in separation distances between particles can lead to decreased inter-particulate forces and improved flow. This was accomplished by using spray agglomerated Captisol® rather than foam derived Captisol®. If asperities are much larger than drug particle size entrapment may occur that reduces dispersion. Therefore, the smooth and irregular (i.e. not planar or geometric) morphology of the SAE-CD derived from foam is desirable for carrier particles with micronized drug particles, when compared to SAE-CD prepared by other processes.</div>

SAE-CD derived from foam has relatively lower electrostatic charge than SAE-CD prepared by other methods, so that one can achieve significantly higher drug dispersion performance with albuterol using that particular form of SAE-CD. Electrostatic charge is known to be a function of moisture content (increasing moisture content decreases electrostatic charge), particle size (decreasing particle size generally increases electrostatic charge), surface area (increased charge obtained with increased surface area), and other physico-chemical properties (such as crystallinity and energy input) of the carrier and drug system.

However, further advantage was gained by using the SAE-CD derived from foam formulation is also better than lactose, which is relatively neutral. By matching the slightly negatively-charged drug particles with low negatively-charged SAE-CD carrier particles, a dry powder system that is flow independent was obtained, i.e. fine particle dose was independent of the pressure drop used to disperse the dry powder formulation.

An aqueous solution containing SAE-CD, and optionally one or more other materials, is processed in a drum dryer (such as from BUFLOVAK LLC, Buffalo, N.Y.) having at least one heated drum. As the solution is poured onto the drum under vacuum, the solution turns into foam from which water evaporates leaving behind a brittle foam (or flake) having a low moisture content (less than 10% wt). The foam is then removed from the surface of the drum by scraping. The dried foam is then attritted as detailed herein to the desired particle size range. The vacuum drum dryer can be a single or double drum dryer. It must have at least one internally heated drum. Depending upon the construction of the dryer used, it can be operated in a batch, semi-continuous or continuous mode. The weight percentage of SAE-CD in the feed solution can be modified as desired to provide the desired solution viscosity, process performance or product qualities. Changing the viscosity of the feed solution can vary the thickness of the foam layer. A water soluble organic solvent, such as alcohol or ether, is optionally added to the feed solution. A water insoluble material is optionally included in the feed solution. Prior to evaporation of the water, the SAE-CD solution is optionally degassed by exposure to vacuum and/or treatment with an inert gas. By “degassed” is meant the concentration of air or gas present in the solution is reduced.</div>

Powder flowed from the vibrating spatula (Mettler LV3, MettlerToledo, Columbus Ohio) onto a powder collection surface, causing deflection and a change in resistance in semiconductor strain gauges (Micron Instruments, Simi Valley Calif.) mounted above and below the collection surface. After amplification (BP-3629, Burr Brown, Tucson Ariz.) of the differential voltage, the mass data was sampled by a PC data acquisition module (DI-170, Dataq Instruments, Akron Ohio). The data collection rate was user selectable in the range of 1-400 Hz.

The routine stepped iteratively through the flow profile calculating the length of the curve using stride lengths ranging from one data point at a time up to half the number of data points in the curve. The fractal dimension was determined by a linear least-squares regression method from the slope of the linear part of the Richardson plot, where the logarithm of the curve length was graphed as a function of the logarithm of stride length. The fractal dimension was calculated using three replicates of powder flow series for each powder sample. The fractal dimension was taken as the average of three different fractal dimension determinations. The three determinations were taken using the beginning and end points of flow, the beginning to middle and middle to end. This approach was used in order to reduce the effect of any particularly irregular portions of the data series.</div>
