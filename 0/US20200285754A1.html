<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/294,688 entitled “INQUIRY RESPONSE MAPPING FOR DETERMINING A CYBERSECURITY RISK LEVEL OF AN ENTITY,” filed Mar. 6, 2019, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application is generally related to the technical field of cybersecurity technology, and more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to techniques for information exchange between entities to determine a cybersecurity risk level.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Security risks to an entity, such as a corporation, have become increasingly complex. Many threats to corporate information security, including those attributable to terrorism, organized crime, and/or individual hackers can be asymmetric, distributed, and/or networked, making cybersecurity risks more difficult to manage. Further, a corporation typically has one or more relationships (e.g., a customer/vendor relationship, a vendor/vendor relationship, a parent/subsidiary relationship, etc.) with other entities to provide and support services (e.g., software-as-a-service applications, etc.) for the corporation. Each of these relationships can impact a cybersecurity risk of the corporation (e.g., because the risk may be dependent upon not only the level of cybersecurity that the corporation has, but also on the level of cybersecurity that its relationship partners have). To manage and evaluate an impact of or vulnerability from a relationship, questionnaires (e.g., requests or inquires) are often exchanged between two entities. For example, a questionnaire may be used to determine another entity's compliance with an industry standard, evaluate the other entity's cybersecurity risk level, and determine an impact of the relationship on cybersecurity risk levels for each of the entities.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The exchange of questionnaires (e.g., inquires and/or requests) between two entities is often a time-consuming process. For example, questionnaires, such as a risk management questionnaire, generated and sent from a first entity (e.g., a sender) to a second entity (e.g., a responder) typically are in the form of a spreadsheet or the like. Such questionnaires are conventionally sent between entities via email. From the perspective of the responder, such questionnaires require a manual process of reviewing each question and inputting a response. The responder may receive multiple questionnaires from different entities that may have different file formats, different layouts, and different (yet overlapping) questions. As a result, the responder must give its undivided attention to an often repetitive process of responding to each questionnaire.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, providing supporting documents and/or evidence is cumbersome when the documents and/or evidence are sent as attachments to the questionnaire in an email. In some situations, communications involving the questionnaire and/or additional documents/evidence are unsecure. Further, providing comments or asking questions of the sender often occurs via email or phone such that feedback is not recorded in a responsive document itself.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">From the perspective of the sender, it is difficult to track the questionnaires in different formats, some of which are returned with separate supporting documents and/or evidence, exacerbating the difficultly of also providing feedback and/or resolving discrepancies. Also, due to the time consuming nature of responding to and evaluating a questionnaire, responses to a completed/accepted questionnaire may become irrelevant and/or no longer accurate. In view of the foregoing, use of questionnaires to obtain information from another entity, such as a relationship partner, is a challenging endeavor for receiving reliable and timely information. Further, analysis of the information is also time consuming and tedious. Thus, it is often difficult to determine how a cybersecurity risk level of an entity and/or its relationship partner may be impacted or understood in view of the information.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media that provide inquiry response mapping for determining a cybersecurity risk level of an entity. For example, a cybersecurity assessment server (e.g., a cybersecurity assessment application) described herein is configured to manage and/or evaluate a questionnaire (e.g., a request or an inquires) for the entity and to determine a cybersecurity risk level based on the questionnaire. To illustrate, the questionnaire may be provided to the entity from a partner entity having a partner relationship with the entity. Based on responses to the questionnaire, a risk level of the entity is determined. Additionally, or alternatively, the determined risk level can be used to how the entity impacts the cybersecurity risk levels of the partner entity. From the perspective of the partner entity, the questionnaire can be provided to multiple entities to determine the partner entity's overall risk level, i.e., to the extent it is influenced by the cybersecurity risk levels of the responding business partners.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">In some implementations, the server is configured to parse a questionnaire into a common format to standardize one or more forms and enable auto-filled responses using a set of response propagation rules. In addition, the server maintains data coherence and consistence among multiple questionnaires by generating a mapping of questions between multiple questionnaires and identifying potential conflicts. The sever also includes machine learning that prompts a user for feedback when a data conflict is detected and learns from the user's response to modify and improve the mapping and reduce future data conflicts. The server/application is further configured to model an impact of one questionnaire with respect to one or more other questionnaires and to determining a cybersecurity risk level of the entity based on the mapped responses. Thus, the server/application described herein enable reliable and timely information to be acquired from a cybersecurity questionnaire Additionally, the information from the questionnaire can be validated against cybersecurity data for the entity and can be utilized to determine a cybersecurity risk level of an entity.</div>

For example, embodiments of the present provide systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media may provide inquiry response mapping independent of and/or without determining a cybersecurity risk level of an entity. To illustrate, the inquiry response mapping may be used in a variety of settings and/or circumstances in which multiple questionnaires received by an individual or entity may have overlapping questions. As an example, an individual seeking insurance may receive multiple applications (e.g., forms/questionnaires) from an insurance broker and/or from multiple insurance providers. As another example, a college applicant may receive applications for admission from multiple colleges. As a further example, an individual may receive questionnaires from medical professions that include questions regarding insurance, medical background, residence/address history information, employment history, etc. In other examples, a company may receive requests for proposals (RFPs) related to a service provided by the company. In such situations, systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media of the present disclosure enable the same or similar questions to be identified and/or responses of the same or similar questions to be auto-populate. Machine learning may also be used to improve response mapping and/or maintain response consistency as additional questionnaires are received, populated, and submitted.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0033]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0034" num="0033">Inventive concepts utilize a system to determine a cybersecurity risk level of an entity by mapping responses to a plurality of inquiry sets directed to the entity. Once the risk level of the entity is determined, the determined risk level can be used to evaluate how it influences the cybersecurity risk levels of the entity's business partners. From another point of view, an entity can map responses provided in response to a plurality of inquiry sets directed to the entity's own partners to assess its overall risk level, i.e., to the extent it is influenced by the cybersecurity risk levels of the responding business partners. Based on an identified cybersecurity risk level of an entity, a business partner of the entity can modify one or more aspects of the business partner's relationship with the entity to reduce or eliminate a negative impact of the entity on the business partner. For example, when the cybersecurity risk level of an entity is particularly bad and exposes a business partner to cybersecurity threats, the business partner may cease the relationship with the entity. To illustrate, if the entity is a vendor of a service used by the business partner, the business partner may choose to no longer receive the service from the entity and may use a different entity for the service.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the system is configured to match questions of multiple forms and generate a mapping (e.g., a many-to-many mapping) of the matched questions. The mapping enables auto-population of responses between the multiple forms with a benefit of time savings based on the automation and an increase in response consistency across the multiple forms. Accordingly, the system enables one or more previously completed questions and/or completed forms to be leveraged to complete additional forms. In some implementations, the completed forms can be used to determine a cybersecurity risk level of an entity. That is, a meaningful cybersecurity risk assessment can be performed and meaningful information can be derived from a timely and accurately completed form.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0035]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0036" num="0035">Embodiments also provide a set of parsing rules that can be applied when a new form is received to create the form in a common/standardized format. In addition, the system implements a set of response propagation rules for auto-population to maintain data coherence and consistence among multiple forms. In some implementations, an impact of mapping a completed form to one or more other forms is determined to enable a user to assess whether use of the completed form would be beneficial to advancing the one or more other forms or would result in one or more data conflict issues. The integrity of the data provided in responses to the forms enables efficient evaluation of a submitted form. In the event of identification of a conflict between responses of matched questions, a prompt is generated to request user feedback of how the user would like the issue resolved.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0036]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0037" num="0036">Embodiments also provide a cybersecurity category for each question and a mapping of questions based on a matched cybersecurity category. Accordingly, when a security issue is identified with respect to one or more questions, other questions may quickly and easily be identified that are also impacted by the security issue. The system can also provide ongoing insight into the objective nature of the questions even after completion of a form by comparing real-time cybersecurity data to responses of a completed form.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0037]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0037">A machine learning model is utilized to identify corrections to data discrepancies and data conflicts. Additionally, or alternatively, the machine learning model is utilized to create and/or update a mapping of matched questions across multiple forms to improve response propagation between the forms. According to an embodiment, a machine learning model is trained over a time period where, during the training period, the system prompts the user for input and/or feedback to address identified conflict issues between questionnaires, responses of different questionnaires, and data propagation issues. In some implementations, the system may use fuzzy matching to match questions that have a determined similarity value greater than or equal to a threshold. As an illustrative, non-limiting example of the machine learning model, feedback regarding one or more identified matches may be used to adjust the threshold and improve identification of matched questions.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0038]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0039" num="0038">Embodiments also provide information and insight regarding a company's cybersecurity risk. For example, the system can generate and achieve reliable and timely questionnaires that can be used to evaluate cybersecurity risk levels of one or more companies, such as companies that have a relationship. The cybersecurity risk levels of a company can be used to classify a risk level of the company, provide a recommendation of one or more corrective actions to lower the cybersecurity risk level, calculate an overall cybersecurity risk score for the company, and/or generate an alert when the overall cybersecurity risk score exceeds a cybersecurity threshold. Additionally, the risk level of a company can be used to determine an industry cybersecurity percentile ranking for the company. Further still, the risk levels from multiple companies can be utilized to determine an aggregated calculated risk level for vendors for the company. A cybersecurity risk level can then be assigned to the company based on the aggregated calculated risk level for vendors for the company.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0039]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0040" num="0039">The foregoing features provide a system for inquiry response mapping for determining a cybersecurity risk level of an entity. This can be advantageous in a number of scenarios. For example, the inventive concepts and be utilized by a company to perform a cybersecurity risk assessment of one or more vendors of the company. The cybersecurity risk assessment may reveal and/or identify vendors that are having a negative impact on a company's overall cybersecurity score. Accordingly, the company and/or the vendors can take corrective actions to remedy identified issues and reduce cybersecurity risk levels.</div>

A module is “[a] self-contained hardware or software component that interacts with a larger system.” Alan Freedman, “The Computer Glossary” 268 (8th ed. 1998). A module may comprise a machine- or machines-executable instructions. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices or the like.</div>

An identified module of executable code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions that may be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations that, when joined logically together, comprise the module, and when executed by the processor, achieve the stated data transformation. A module of executable code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and/or across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure.
