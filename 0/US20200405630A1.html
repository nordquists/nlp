<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) is an 84 amino acid protein that is secreted by the parathyroid gland; PTH is involved in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and the control of bone growth and density. Two forms of recombinant hPTH have been evaluated in clinical trials, hPTH(1-34) and the full length 84-amino acid, hPTH(1-84). hPTH (1-34) is an N-terminal fragment of PTH, which, along with fragment 1-38, retains the full biological activity of the intact protein.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">A recombinant, rDNA-derived, injectable form of hPTH(1-34) (teriparatide) was approved in the United States in 2002 for the treatment of severe osteoporosis and is sold under the tradename FORTEO® (Eli Lilly), referred to hereafter as subcutaneously injected teriparatide. The subcutaneously injected teriparatide is typically prescribed for women with a history of osteoporotic fracture, those having multiple risk factors for fracture, or who have failed or are intolerant of other osteoporosis therapies. In postmenopausal women, subcutaneously injected teriparatide has been found to increase bone mineral density and reduce the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. Subcutaneously injected teriparatide has also been described to increase bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis who are at a high risk for fracture. In men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis, subcutaneously injected teriparatide has similarly been reported to increase bone mineral density. In 2009, subcutaneously injected teriparatide was also approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men and women associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy at high risk for fracture.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Bone degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis occur in a substantial portion of the senior adult population. Osteoporosis encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders that represent a major risk for bone fractures, and a substantial burden on the health care system. Billions of dollars are spent annually on medical care for the treatment of osteoporosis. Clinically, osteoporosis is characterized by diminished bone mass, decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC), and loss of bone architecture resulting in decreased bone strength and increased risk of bone fracture.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">While a number of antiresorptive agents including calcitonin, bisphosphonates, estrogen, and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) prevent further bone loss, they do not rebuild bone once it has been lost. This is in contrast to subcutaneously injected teriparatide, which represents the first-FDA approved anabolic bone building agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. PTH or PTH(1-34) is thought to exert its effects through receptor-mediated activation of two intracellular signaling pathways via (1) adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A, and (2) phospholipase C and protein kinase C. PTH(1-34) builds bone mass, restores bone architecture, and reduces the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral bone fractures in osteoporotic patients who are at high risk of fracture (R. Neer, <i>NEJM, </i>344:1434, 2001).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">As a peptide product, PTH(1-34) requires daily subcutaneous injections—an administration regime that is less than ideal. Indeed, most patients have an aversion to self-injection of drugs, and the need to visit a clinic or doctor's office for administration is inconvenient and burdensome. Moreover, severely osteoporotic patients may be unable to self-administer such injections, such that each of the foregoing factors can contribute to poor patient compliance.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">While other forms of administration have been suggested, such as oral delivery to the stomach, transdermal delivery, and nasopharyngeal absorption, none of these delivery routes has been proven to be particularly effective and each suffers from certain drawbacks. Oral delivery results in very low bioavailability of polypeptide drugs, usually below 1%, due to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract is impermeable to most polypeptides. Nasopharyngeal and passive transdermal delivery avoid the problems of enzyme degradation, but usually require penetration enhancers in order to effect systemic absorption. Even with such penetration enhancers, bioavailability will usually be very low, and the penetration enhancers can often cause undesirable irritation. In the case of nasopharyngeal administration, penetration enhancers can often damage the nasal epithelium and chronic use has been associated with hyperplasia of the nasal lining.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">It is presently believed that PTH is most effectively delivered to a patient in a pulsatile fashion to achieve active bone formation. That is to say, plasma concentrations of PTH should ideally rise rapidly after administration (rapid onset) and fall rapidly after a peak has been reached (rapid decline), generally resulting in a spike in the plasma concentration profile. Thus, a particularly desirable method of administration of PTH is one that achieves such a plasma concentration profile.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">For at least these reasons, it would be desirable to provide an alternative delivery method for parathyroid hormone which is patient acceptable. Any such method should avoid subcutaneous injection, limit irritation to the skin and body mucosa, and provide a desired pulsatile delivery profile as described above, among having other advantageous features. Such method should ideally provide for high levels of PTH bioavailability, be amenable to self-administration by the patient, be minimally invasive, and ideally provide a pharmacokinetic profile that is similar to, or preferably improved over, that achieved upon subcutaneous administration.</div>

The delivery system was designed to deliver a systemic dose of hPTH (1-34) across the stratum corneum barrier layer of the skin upon activation of the applicator to deploy an array of microstructures causing the array of microstructures to penetrate the stratum corneum.

Subjects received these doses by applying the transdermal microneedle delivery system MicroCor® device containing the indicated amount of hPTH in the distal tips of the microneedles in the array to an abdominal site, and leaving the device in place for five (5) minutes. The comparator treatment (the commercial hPTH product known as Forteo®) was subcutaneously administered via injection into the abdominal wall at a dose of 20 μg.

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the plasma concentration value at each time point was normalized by the maximum concentration value achieved by each of the three treatment regimens: 32 microgram and 64 microgram doses of PTH delivered by the microprotrusion array and the 20 microgram dose delivered via subcutaneous injection. The Cmax normalized plasma concentration data is plotted against time, in hours. The time to achieve Cmax of well under 30 minutes when PTH is delivered transdermally from the microneedle array compared to the time to reach Cmax of greater than 30 minutes when administered subcutaneously is evident. The faster elimination of the drug after reaching Cmax when delivered transdermally from the microneedle array is also readily seen when the data is presented as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, by comparing the slopes of the lines during the elimination phase—i.e., at a time after Cmax.</div>

Such properties (relative to subcutaneous injection) include a shorter Tmax, a higher Cmax, and a shorter elimination half life, T<sub>1/2</sub>. Ideally, administration using a microprojection array-based PTH product is effective to achieve a Tmax value that is at least about 2 times less, or at least about 3 times less, or at least about 4, or 5, or 6, or 7 times or more less than that achieved by SC administration of the same PTH moiety, preferably based upon normalized Cmax values. Absorption of hPTH (1-34) occurs more rapidly when delivered with the microprojection array-based delivery system when compared to delivery via subcutaneous injection (i.e., hPTH product Forteo®), as illustrated by the higher dose-normalized C<sub>max </sub>values and the faster T<sub>max </sub>values for both the high and low dose microprojection array-based treatments. The elimination half-life based upon microprojection array-based PTH treatment was also less than with subcutaneously administered PTH (Forteo®). Moreover, microprojection array-based treatment is more effective in achieving the desired pulsatile delivery profile of PTH (i.e., rapid on set and rapid offset after reaching Cmax), as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 8</figref>.</div>

Analysis for residual PTH in the arrays following application to a subject for delivery of the drug, revealed that, on average, about 85% of drug was delivered from the microprojection array device (i.e., 85% drug delivery efficiency, data not shown). Accordingly, in one embodiment, the method includes providing for use in the method a microprojection array capable of delivery at least about 55%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 65%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 85% of the total PTH dose in the array when applied to the skin of the patient for the desired amount of time. In the studies conducted above, the microarray was in contact with the skin for 5 minutes, however it will be appreciated that the microprojection array-delivery system can be applied to a skin site for times other than the 5 minutes utilized in the present study. In one embodiment, the system is maintained on the skin for no more than 15 minutes, or for no more than 10 minutes, or even for no more than 5 minutes. That is to say, the microprojection array is maintained on the skin for no more than about 15 minutes, or 14 minutes, or 13 minutes, or 12 minutes, or 11 minutes, or 10 minutes, or 9 minutes, or 8 minutes, or 7 minutes, or 6 minutes or even 5 minutes.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0117]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0119" num="0117">A skilled artisan will also appreciate that delivery efficiency based on residual analysis of the microprojection array post-use is but one measure to characterize the device. The microprojection array can also be characterized by the percentage of total dose delivered by the microprojection array, determined for example based on pharmacokinetic parameters and the total amount of drug loaded into the microprojection array. This value may differ from a residual analysis since some of the drug delivered may be degraded by enzymes in the skin or not reach systemic circulation for other reasons. In one embodiment, the method for administering PTH to a human subject comprises contacting the skin of the subject with a microprotrusion array containing a dose of PTH and causing all or a portion, preferably a majority, of the microprotrusions to penetrate the stratum corneum. The microprotrusions in the array are left in contact with the skin for a period of time. Application of the device to the skin in accord with the method delivers at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55% or 60% of the total PTH dose in the microprotrusion array into systemic circulation of the subject. In another approach, the delivery efficiency of the microprojection array is determined based on comparing the pharmacokinetic parameters, and in particular AUC, to pharmacokinetic parameters achieved from a subcutaneously injected dose of PTH.</div>

An exemplary wet formulation contains, for example, 15% human parathyroid hormone 1-34 fragment (hPTH1-34), 65% dextran 70 and 20% sorbitol, in a histidine buffer solvent with a total solids content of 30% as applied to the mold. The loaded mold (i.e., containing drug formulation) is placed in a pressure vessel under about 50 psi for about 30 seconds. Pressure is then removed. The excess formulation is wiped with a silicone or metal wiper with the interference between wiper edge and surface of mold about 1-10 mils.

Approximately 150 μL of “backing” or upper layer/base solution containing poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with an L/G ratio of 75/25 in acetonitrile is placed on the mold (atop the first drug-containing formulation).

After step 1) above, a small amount of formulation, for example, 25 μL, is placed as a droplet on the mold, and a cover slip is placed on top of the droplet to spread the liquid onto the entire surface of the mold. For example, an illustrative wet formulation contains 70% Dextran 70, and 30% sorbitol, in histidine buffer solvent, such that the formulation contains, for example, 30% solids content as applied. The drug-polymer matrix loaded mold is placed in a pressure vessel under ca. 50 psi for about 30 seconds. Pressure is then released. Excess formulation is wiped with a silicone or metal wiper with the interference between wiper edge and the surface of the mold about 1-8 mils.

The mold is then placed into a pressure vessel under 10-30 psi with controlled venting for about 5 min. The mold is further dried at room temperature for about 30 min.

About 200 μL of liquid formulation was placed in an Eppendorf tube. The formulation was spread into a thin film in the inside wall of the tube, then dried at 32° C. for 30 min, and then further dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight. The dry films inside the Eppendorf tube were packaged in a polyfoil bag and stored at different temperatures for different durations.

Upon contact with the skin, the microstructures penetrate past the stratum corneum, and the hPTH dissolves into the skin rapidly.
