<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Naturally occurring autoantibodies exist in humans that can bind to proteins e.g. to host immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments e.g. Rheumatoid factor (which bind epitopes in the Fc region of antibodies), anti-idiotype autoantibodies (which bind antibody variable/CDR regions) and anti-hinge autoantibodies (which bind the hinge region of the Ig constant domain in Fab fragments).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">These autoantibodies may be part of a polyclonal repertoire of anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) autoantibodies with specificity to epitopes throughout the Ig molecule that are present in both humans and non-human primates. In addition to the anti-IgG autoantibodies that bind epitopes within the intact Fc domain (i.e. the rheumatoid factors (RF)), the presence of anti-idiotypic autoantibodies that bind to variable CDR regions of IgG, and anti-hinge antibodies that react with cryptic epitopes in the C terminal hinge regions of Fab or F(‘Ab’)<sub>2 </sub>fragments has also been observed. The functional role of these different anti-IgG autoantibodies remains uncertain. Rheumatoid factor and anti-hinge autoantibodies have been linked with certain pathological conditions, such as autoimmunity and certain infections while anti-idiotypic antibodies may confer protection from autoantibodies in certain autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, an immunoregulatory role for anti-IgG autoantibodies, has been proposed wherein these autoantibodies control the stimulation of autoreactive B cells and regulate immune responses to foreign antigens. Anti-hinge antibodies are anti-IgG autoantibodies that react with cleaved but not intact IgG. Their high prevalence in the normal human population implicates previous exposure to IgG fragments, possibly as a result of cleavage of IgG by bacterial or endogenous proteases.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">As well as binding to endogenous proteins (present in naïve subjects) autoantibodies can also bind to proteins or peptides which are administered to a subject for treatment. Pre-existing antibodies which bind to molecules such as therapeutic proteins and peptides, administered to a subject can affect their efficacy and could result in administration reactions, hypersensitivity, altered clinical response in treated patients as well as altered bioavailability by sustaining, eliminating or neutralizing the molecule. However in some instances existence of these antibodies may be less significant during drug treatment than in other instances.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Therapeutic protein-binding autoantibodies and antibodies that are newly formed in response to drug treatment (such as administration of a therapeutic protein or peptide) are collectively termed anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). When ADAs are described throughout this document we are referring to pre-existing ADAs unless specifically stated otherwise.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">We have demonstrated as described herein that in sera from some healthy naïve human subjects, pre-existing anti-VH autoantibodies are present that can bind both VH domain antibodies and VHH molecules, as well as anti-VL (e.g. V kappa (VK)) autoantibodies that can bind VL molecules. The pre-existing ADAs that bind VH dAbs are similar to anti-hinge antibodies in that they bind IgG fragments but not those same sequences found in situ on intact IgG.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">A specific immunoassay was developed as described herein and validated to detect anti-drug antibodies to the VH dAb DOM1H-131-206 (amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1) in humans. A panel of 60 healthy human donor serum samples was screened for background reactivity in the assay. It was determined that approximately 45% of serum samples from these subjects had detectable antibodies, which were able to bind to DOM1H-131-206. This reactivity appears specific to a neo epitope, or epitopes, within the VH dAb framework sequence, since the response was cross-reactive with the VH frameworks of dAbs binding various target antigens, but not with full human IgG. Pre-existing ADA to VL dAbs was also observed in serum samples from healthy human donors but to a lower extent than VH.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Taking a mutagenesis approach, we determined whether modifications to the VH framework could reduce the binding of these pre-existing ADAs. Using this approach we mapped an epitope to the C-terminus of the VH dAb framework, and we exemplify a number of approaches which can be used to reduce or eliminate the binding of the pre-existing antibodies to VL, VH and VHH molecules. In particular, we have shown that modifications which alter the three dimensional conformation of the dAb C-terminus, in particular the C-terminal serine residue (i.e. at Kabat position 113) in VH and VHH dAbs are important. In addition the three dimensional conformation of the dAb C-terminus can be altered by the addition of further amino acid residues (C-terminal extension) and/or by substituting the amino acid residues present at one or more of positions 14, 41, 108, 110 and 112 in VH dAbs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention thus provides modified molecules that have reduced ability to bind to (pre-existing) ADAs as compared to the unmodified molecule and are suitable for administration to a subject e.g. a human subject for therapy or prophylaxis. By reduced ability to bind is meant that the molecule binds with a reduced affinity or reduced avidity to a pre-existing ADA. Such molecules comprise proteins, or peptides, for example antigen binding proteins, e.g. antibodies, antibody fragments, and single variable domains e.g. human immunoglobulin (antibody) single variable domains (VH or VL), and also single variable domains derived from non-human sources such as llama or Camelid, e.g. a Camelid VHH including a Nanobody™ (described for example in WO 94/04678 and WO 95/04079 inter alia). Said molecules comprise one or more modifications selected from: (a) a C-terminal addition, extension, deletion or tag, and/or (b) one or more amino acid framework substitutions.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">Additionally, the modified molecules described herein and pharmaceutical compositions comprising these modified molecules can have an enhanced safety profile and fewer side effects than the unmodified molecules e.g. unmodified dAbs, which do not comprise a C terminal extension, addition, deletion or tag and/or other framework modification, to reduce pre-existing ADA binding. Similarly, administration of the modified molecules described herein or of pharmaceutical compositions comprising these modified molecules (which have reduced ability to bind to pre-existing ADA) can lead to modified immunogenicity and can also result in improved efficacy and an improved safety profile and e.g. can be advantageously used for repeat dosing to patients who could develop autoantibodies to the unmodified molecules e.g. dAbs.</div>

The tool mAb was generated using standard mouse monoclonal antibody technology i.e. mice were immunised with DOM 1H-131-206 (SEQ ID NO1), spleens were collected and hybridoma cell lines were generated, the hybridomas expressing antibody were then cloned and the resulting antibody isolated and sequenced using standard techniques. The tool mAb is one which binds to the VH dAb framework and thereby reduces binding of the VH dAbs to ADAs. Thus the tool mAb appears to bind to a similar epitope on the VH framework to the human anti-VH ADA. Thus the tool mAb can be useful for example it can be used to test modified dAbs (VH, VHH,) and to determine which modifications to the dAb prevent or reduce binding of the dAb to the tool mAb. Modifications to the VH dAbs which prevent binding to the tool mAb will also prevent or reduce binding of VH dAbs to the ADAs. Thus the invention provides any dAbs which are modified (e.g. by any of the modifications described herein) to prevent or reduce binding to the tool mAb.

Standard techniques are used for molecular, genetic and biochemical methods (see generally, Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed. (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (1999) 4<sup>th </sup>Ed, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. which are incorporated herein by reference) and chemical methods.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0076]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0072" num="0076">Affinity is the strength of binding of one molecule, e.g. an antigen binding protein of the invention, to another, e.g. its target antigen, at a single binding site. The binding affinity of an antigen binding protein to its target may be determined by standard equilibrium methods (e.g. enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) or radioimmunoassay (RIA)), or kinetics (e.g. BIACORE™ analysis).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0077]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0073" num="0077">The term “epitope” as used herein refers to that portion of the antigen that makes contact with a particular binding domain of the antigen binding protein e.g. dAb. An epitope may be linear or conformational/discontinuous. A conformational or discontinuous epitope comprises amino acid residues that are separated by other sequences, i.e. not in a continuous sequence in the antigen's primary sequence. Although the residues may be from different regions of the peptide chain, they are in close proximity in the three dimensional structure of the antigen. In the case of multimeric antigens, a conformational or discontinuous epitope may include residues from different peptide chains. Particular residues comprised within an epitope can be determined through computer modelling programs or via three-dimensional structures obtained through methods known in the art, such as X-ray crystallography.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0078]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0074" num="0078">A dAb conjugate refers to a composition comprising a dAb to which a further molecule is chemically conjugated by means of a covalent or noncovalent linkage, preferably a covalent linkage. Such covalent linkage could be through a peptide bond or other means such as via a modified side chain.

Additionally, the dAb molecules described herein and pharmaceutical compositions comprising these molecules may be useful in the prevention or reduction of side effects. The binding of anti-drug antibodies by a dAb may lead to two dAbs being brought together. In some circumstances, this may lead to safety concerns. For example, if the target of a dAb is a receptor or a polymeric target, the bringing together of two dAbs may bring two targets together. This may lead to unexpected pharmacological impacts, for example agonism rather than antagonism e.g. via dimerisation of the receptor. Thus the present invention provides the use of the molecules of the invention in a method of preventing side effects. By prevention is meant that the use of the molecules of the invention abrogates to a complete or partial level binding of pre-existing anti drug antibodies as compared to the equivalent molecule which has not been modified. The reduction in binding of ADAs leads to a reduction in the level of unwanted pharmacological effects. Thus the molecules of the invention can have an enhanced safety profile and fewer side effects than the unmodified molecules e.g. unmodified dAbs, which do not comprise a C terminal extension, addition, deletion or tag and/or other framework modification, to reduce pre-existing ADA binding. Similarly, administration of the modified molecules described herein or of pharmaceutical compositions comprising these modified molecules (which have reduced ability to bind to pre-existing ADA) can lead to modified immunogenicity, this is because when the unmodified molecules bind to ADAs they form immune complexes and such immune complexes could then generate an immune response. In addition administration of the modified molecules described herein or of pharmaceutical compositions comprising these modified molecules can also result in improved efficacy and an improved safety profile and e.g. can be advantageously used for repeat dosing to patients who could develop autoantibodies to the unmodified molecules.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0120]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0120" num="0120">The invention also provides nucleic acids encoding the molecules described herein for example nucleic acids encoding the anti-TNFR1 dAbs described above. Also provided are host cells e.g. non-embryonic host cells e.g. prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts cells such as <i>E. coli </i>or or yeast host cells or mammalian cells that comprise these nucleic acids.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0121]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0121" num="0121">The invention additionally provides a dAb which has reduced binding to ADA in human sera (e.g. does not bind to pre-existing ADA in human sera) and wherein the epitope on the dAb to which the ADA binds is masked (i.e. the epitope is no longer available to bind to ADA as e.g. it has been covered or masked by another molecule so preventing binding or its steric conformation has been changed so preventing binding). The epitope on the dAb can be masked by any of the modifications described herein to reduce ADA binding, for example adding a chemical entity to the C terminus of the dAb or by framework substitutions, or deletions as described herein. The chemical entity added to the C terminus of the dAb can be an extension (e.g. an amino acid extension) or a tag or it can be a chemical modification such as pegylation or amidation. The modification to the C terminus can be one which either directly or indirectly changes the conformation of the epitope on the dAb which binds to ADAs thereby reducing the ability of the dAb to bind to ADAs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0122]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0122" num="0122">The skilled person will appreciate that, upon production of a molecule as described herein e.g. a dAb, in particular depending on the cell line used and particular amino acid sequence of the molecule e.g. dAb, post-translational modifications may occur. For example, this may include the cleavage of certain leader sequences, the addition of various sugar moieties in various glycosylation and phosphorylation patterns, deamidation, oxidation, disulfide bond scrambling, isomerisation, C-terminal lysine clipping, and N-terminal glutamine cyclisation. The present invention encompasses the use of such molecules, e.g. dAbs, which have been subjected to, or have undergone, one or more post-translational modifications. Thus an dAb of the invention includes an a dAb which has undergone a post-translational modification such as described as follows: Glycosylation of antibodies at conserved positions in their constant regions is known to have a profound effect on antibody function, particularly effector functioning, see for example, Boyd et al. (1996) Mol. Immunol. 32: 1311-1318. Glycosylation variants of the antigen binding proteins of the invention wherein one or more carbohydrate moiety is added, substituted, deleted or modified are contemplated. Introduction of an asparagine-X-serine or asparagine-X-threonine motif creates a potential site for enzymatic attachment of carbohydrate moieties and may therefore be used to manipulate the glycosylation of an antibody. In Raju et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40: 8868-8876 the terminal sialyation of a TNFR-IgG immunoadhesin was increased through a process of regalactosylation and/or resialylation using beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferace and/or alpha, 2,3 sialyltransferase. Increasing the terminal sialylation is believed to increase the half-life of the immunoglobulin. Antibodies, in common with most glycoproteins, are typically produced as a mixture of glycoforms. This mixture is particularly apparent when antibodies are produced in eukaryotic, particularly mammalian cells. A variety of methods have been developed to manufacture defined glycoforms, see Zhang et al. (2004) Science 303: 371: Sears et al. (2001) Science 291: 2344; Wacker et al. (2002) Science 298: 1790; Davis et al. (2002) Chem. Rev. 102: 579; Hang et al. (2001) Acc. Chem. Res 34: 727. The antibodies (for example of the IgG isotype, e.g. IgG1) as herein described may comprise a defined number (e.g. 7 or less, for example 5 or less, such as two or a single) of glycoform(s); Deamidation is an enzymatic reaction primarily converting asparagine (N) to iso-aspartic acid and aspartic acid (D) at approximately 3:1 ratio. To a much lesser degree, deamidation can occur with glutamine residues in a similar manner. Deamidation in a CDR results in a change in charge of the molecule, but typically does not result in a change in antigen binding, nor does it impact on PK/PD; Oxidation can occur during production and storage (i.e. in the presence of oxidizing conditions) and results in a covalent modification of a protein, induced either directly by reactive oxygen species or indirectly by reaction with secondary by-products of oxidative stress. Oxidation happens primarily with methionine residues, but occasionally can occur at tryptophan and free cysteine residues; disulfide bond scrambling can occur during production and basic storage conditions. Under certain circumstances, disulfide bonds can break or form incorrectly, resulting in unpaired cysteine residues (—SH). These free (unpaired) sulfhydryls (—SH) can promote shuffling; Isomerization typically occurs during production, purification, and storage (at acidic pH) and usually occurs when aspartic acid is converted to isoaspartic acid through a chemical process; N-terminal glutamine in the heavy chain and/or light chain is likely to form pyroglutamate (pGlu). Most pGlu formation happens in the production bioreactor, but it can be formed non-enzymatically, depending on pH and temperature of processing and storage conditions. pGlu formation is considered as one of the principal degradation pathways for recombinant mAbs; C-terminal lysine clipping is an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by carboxypeptidases, and is commonly observed in recombinant mAbs. Variants of this process include removal of lysine from one or both heavy chains. Lysine clipping does not appear to impact bioactivity and has no effect on mAb effector function.</div>

See e.g., Krajacic, 6 (5) Supplement 6, Biotechnology Healthcare, December 2009 and National Psoriasis Foundation, About Psoriasis: Statistics. As a point of reference, a human patient's palm would be considered approximately 1% of the patient's body surface area. The severity of psoriasis can also be determined, as an alternative, according to the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index through the use of the grading system described by Fredrikson which is based on four criteria: redness, thickness, scaliness and the amount of surface area involvement. See e.g., Fredrickson, 157 Dermatologica 238 (1978). The psoriatic plaques to be treated may have a comparable infiltrate thickness of at least 200 μm, as assessed by sonographic measurements, when the domain antibody is first administered. The human patients may be male or female subjects having chronic plaque type psoriasis with stable plaque(s) on the upper extremities, thighs or trunk.

The MSD™ technology (available from Meso scale Discovery, Md., USA) utilizes a ruthenium metal chelate as the ECL label in conjunction with carbon electrodes placed within the wells of a microtiter plate that are coated with streptavidin. The bound Sulfo-Tag™ used in the assay produces a chemiluminescence signal that is triggered when voltage is applied by the instrument (Meso Scale Discovery Sector™ Imager 6000). The resulting luminescence signal is measured in ECL™ units. The intensity of the signal is directly proportional to the quantity of detected antibodies in the sample. Negative (normal human serum; NHS) and positive (PC; mouse anti-DOM1H-131-206 idiotypic antibody spiked in normal human serum) control samples (QCs) are run on each assay plate.</div>

Conclusions from this experiment were as follows:
<br/>
1) DOM1H-131-206+A, DOM1H-131-206+ASTKG and wild type mutants exhibited very good dAb expression.
<br/>
The highest titre was about 3000 mg/L.
<br/>
2) DOM1H-131-206 P14+A, and DOM1H-131-206 p14+ASTKG mutants couldn't express dAb in the process.
<br/>
3) In general, DOM1H-131-206+A and DOM1H-131-206+ASTKG were comparable with wild type in terms of dAb expression level

This is due to the fact that the detection antibody M2.3G10.1G06 binds strongly to DOM 1H-131-206 but poorly to DOM 1H-131-206+A.

<li> <para-num num="[0308]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0208" num="0308">TNFα signals through the NFκB pathway and results in the secretion of various cytokines including IL-8. In unstimulated cells, IL-8 mRNA is rapidly degraded. However, in the presence of TNFα, activation of the NFκB pathway leads to the stabilisation of IL-8 mRNA. This stabilisation results in an increase in mRNA and contributes to induction of IL-8 secretion. Hence, in this assay induction of secreted IL-8 is to determine whether the addition of a C-terminal extension affects the ability of DOM1H-131-206 or DOM1H-131-206+A (i.e. a C terminal alanine extension) to inhibit TNFR1 signal transduction. These studies were carried out in human and Cynomolgus monkey cell lines, and also in human and Cynomolgus monkey whole blood. Comparison of IC<sub>50 </sub>values indicates that extension of the C-terminus of DOM1H-131-206 which reduced pre-existing ADA binding did not negatively impact the ability of DOM1H-131-206 to inhibit signal transduction via TNFR1 in either human or Cynomolgus monkey cells (Table 6b).</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0319]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0220" num="0319">In these studies, the DOM1h-131-206 domain antibody (having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1) was utilized as well as rodent orthologs of this domain antibody. Data obtained with these molecules was used to select the doses and treatment protocols described herein to be used for treatment of psoriasis, and psoriatic plaques, in human patients to be administered either DOM1h-131-206 (having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1), or the DOM1h-131-206 ADA fix molecule with a terminal alanine (having the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO: 16), or a DOM1h131206 ADA fixed molecule comprising any ADA fix (i.e. any modification to decrease binding of a dAb to ADAs) as is disclosed herein.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0320]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0221" num="0320">For example, pharmacokinetics derived from in vivo studies with Cynomolgus monkeys showed the DOM1h-131-206 domain antibody (with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1) to have a plasma clearance of 2.4 mL/min/kg, which approximates to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in monkeys and gives an elimination half-life of approximately 3 hours. The volume of distribution for this domain antibody was 0.26 L/kg which equates approximately to the extravascular volume and suggested distribution outside of the central/plasma compartment. When the DOM1h-131-206 domain antibody was administered to an extravascular compartment (for example when inhaled into lungs) there is only a small change in the observed elimination half-life which reflects absorption rate limiting kinetics.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0321]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0222" num="0321">Furthermore, following intradermal dosing of a rodent orthologue anti-TNFR1 dAb (“Dom1m-15-12”) to mice, an even longer absorption lag was observed. This may have been due to a larger difference between the GFR and absorption rate clearance following dosing via the intradermal route. The observed terminal elimination rate in mouse plasma was approx 40 minutes which was longer than that following intravenous delivery (approx 20 minutes). The slower elimination rate (Ke) seen in plasma following intradermal delivery was corroborated by the dermal tissue PK that showed a terminal elimination rate of 5-7 hours (Ke 0.1-0.14 h<sup>−1</sup>), although the fraction of the dose driving the apparently prolonged elimination rate was estimated to be small (0.5%). Dermal absorption rate (Ka) into plasma was defined from a rat study with intradermal dosing of a rodent ortholog dAb and was relatively rapid (Ka=4.1 h<sup>−1</sup>) resulting in an observed T<sub>max </sub>at approximately 1 hour post dose. It was estimated that 10% of the domain antibody was retained within the dermal compartment in rat with an assumed elimination rate from the skin similar to mouse. Thus, it appears that following intradermal injection, the DOM1h-131-206 domain antibody distributes to vascularized tissues in the skin (e.g., the dermis) where it is rapidly extracted into plasma and is eliminated via renal filtration. The initial distribution and absorption phase through the tissues of the skin is reflected in the absorption lag time before plasma exposures become measurable. Given the anatomical differences between rodent and human skin, the absorption rate in humans was expected to be longer, which in turn would lead to lower/unmeasurable plasma exposure of the DOM1h-131-206 domain antibody. This means that human plasma exposure predictions are based on observations from rodent studies and therefore serve as a conservative estimate of plasma exposure in humans.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0322]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0223" num="0322">The DOM1h-131-206 domain antibody (having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1) was also dosed to healthy volunteers via intravenous infusion (up to 3 hours duration) up to 2 mg/kg and in an ongoing trial via inhalation in healthy volunteers. Derived pharmacokinetic parameters were generally in very good agreement with pre-clinical data in cynomolgus monkeys. Following intravenous administration clearance was between 0.6-1.5 mL/min/kg (GFR in human approx 1.8 mL/min/kg) with a resulting elimination half-life of 5 hours. Volume of distribution, approx 0.3 L/kg, was similar to extravascular volume. Rapid distribution of the DOM1h-131-206 domain antibody into the extravascular compartment was confirmed via a bronchioalveolar lavage measurement (lung epithelial lining fluid) following IV administration. Levels in the lung extravascular fluid were approximately 4-14% of plasma levels measured at 5 hours from start of dosing following a 3 hour infusion.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0323]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0224" num="0323">Predictions of efficacy in humans have been estimated based on the observed and predicted exposure estimates within the dermal compartment and human in vitro cell line data. IC<sub>50 </sub>ranges (8-40 ng/mL) in these in vitro systems (varying complexity and cell type) have been used as target trough levels within the dermal compartment and facilitated selection of the domain antibody doses and treatment protocols for the treatment of psoriasis, and psoriatic plaques, in human patients described here. For example, the starting dose of 0.5 mg was chosen to achieve a plasma exposure, assuming a worst case systemic exposure, lower than those achieved in the FTIH intravenous study were agonism was observed in ADA positive subjects. At this initial starting dose it is expected that TNFR1 mediated signaling is inhibited within a discreet zone around the injection site (&lt;2 cm<sup>2 </sup>surface area) to a level of &gt;90% immediately after dosing. TNFR1 inhibition over time is dependent on the amount of drug delivered, retained and then eliminated from the dermal compartment. Assuming a minimum (10% dermal retention and Ke 0.1-0.14 h<sup>−1 </sup>as in rat) it was expected that levels will be maintained ≥IC<sub>50 </sub>(within an injection/test zone) for a minimum of 3 days following an intradermal injection of 0.5 mg of the DOM1h-131-206 domain antibody.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0324]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0225" num="0324">For selection of domain antibody doses and treatment protocols predictions of human plasma exposure following intradermal dosing of the DOM1h-131-206 domain antibody were made. These predictions assumed the maximum possible exposure that could be achieved for an intradermal injection. Actual human plasma concentration-time data from intravenously administered DOM1h-131-206 domain antibody was used in a human dermal PK model with a fixed absorption rate (scaled from rodent dermal absorption) and a bioavailability of 100%. The human plasma concentration-time profile for the maximum domain dose(s) and treatment protocols described here (2 mg weekly+0.5 mg biweekly) was then examined. This revealed predicted peak plasma concentrations reach T<sub>max </sub>rapidly within 30 min post dose, and levels drop rapidly to levels below the current plasma assay lower limit of quantification (0.1 ng/mL) within 24 hours. No accumulation on repeat dosing was expected in plasma even using this maximum possible exposure prediction. However, this prediction represents the highest possible plasma exposure and it is possible exposures could be significantly lower than predicted and even so low that plasma exposure may not be measurable. Using target levels of inhibition (based on in vitro cell based assays) it was predicted that at IC<sub>90 </sub>(immediately post dose) or IC<sub>50 </sub>(trough) levels in the skin in the treatment protocols described here will be in the range of 30-80 ng/mL or 8-40 n/mL respectively.</div>

Protein A was immobilised on a C1 chip by primary amine coupling and this surface was then used to capture the anti-VEGF constructs. Human recombinant VEGF165 (sourced ‘in house’ from transient transfection of HEK293 cells) was used as the analyte at 32 nM to 0.03125 nM in a 4 fold dilution series. All binding curves were double referenced with a buffer injection (i.e. 0 nM) and the data was fitted to 1:1 model inherent to the T100. Regeneration was carried out using 50 mM NaOH. The run was carried out at 37° C., using HBS-EP as the running buffer. The data obtained is shown in Tables 10A, 10B &amp; 10C. From the data in Table 10A, the behaviour of DMS30037 and several variants modified at the C-terminus: DMS30037+A (DMS30048), DMS30037+AAA (DMS30049), and DMS30037+T (DMS30050) (see Example 12a for further details of these molecules) seems comparable on Biacore and the C-terminal modifications do not appear to reduce potency over parental.</div>

In this data set again the behaviour of all the molecules seems comparable on Biacore and the C-terminal modifications do not appear to reduce potency over parental. Meaningful data could not be captured other than to view the curve for Avastin. A further data set is displayed in Table 10C where the molecules DMS30037 and DMS30038 were compared with variants modified at the C-terminus: DMS30037−R, (DMS30047), DMS30037+T (DMS30050), DMS30038−R, (DMS30051) and DMS30038+T (DMS30054) and Bevacizumab (Avastin). Again the behaviour of all the dAb-Fc-dAb molecules seem comparable on Biacore and the C-terminal modifications do not appear to reduce potency over parental. In this data set, see Table 10C, the Bevacizumab (Avastin) data could not be properly measured due to the off-rate being too tight.</div>

This assay measures the binding of VEGF165 to either VEGF R1 or VEGF R2 and the ability of the test molecules to block this interaction. A MSD standard bind 96 well plate (L11XA-3) was coated with 0.25 μg/ml VEGF R1 (R&amp;D Systems 321-FL) or VEGF R2 (R&amp;D 357-KD) in bicarbonate buffer (50 μl/well), covered with a plate sealer and incubated overnight at 4° C. The next day the MSD plate was washed 3×300 μl/well with Tris wash buffer and blotted over a pad of tissue to remove excess wash buffer from the wells. The MSD plate was then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS (250 μl/well) and incubated shaking (750 RPM) at room temperature for 1 hour. The MSD plate was washed again before the addition of a 2× concentration of anti-VEGF molecule (25 μl/well) and incubated with shaking (750 RPM) at room temperature for 10 minutes before the addition of a 2× concentration of rhVEGF, 25 μl/well, R&amp;D Systems (293-VE/CF, made in insect cells using Baculovirus) or a GSK ‘in house’ source of VEGF (made from HEK293 mammalian cells, latter data not shown except Table 3A). The anti-VEGF molecules and the VEGF were prepared using 0.1% BSA in PBS. The initial assay was performed with a step in which the anti-VEGF molecule was pre-incubated with VEGF. The pre-incubations were prepared by adding an equal volume of a 2× concentration of anti-VEGF molecule to an equal volume of a 2× concentration of VEGF (R&amp;D, 293-VE/CF) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The final VEGF concentration used was 10 ng/ml. No VEGF and VEGF alone controls were also included. The MSD plate was incubated with shaking (750 RPM) at room temperature for 2 hours after which it was washed again before the addition of the detection reagent (504/well, goat anti-human VEGF biotinylated antibody—R&amp;D Systems BAF293) at 0.25 μg/ml in 1% BSA in PBS and incubated with shaking (750 RPM) at room temperature for 1 hour. The MSD plate was washed again before the addition of the streptavidin sulfo-TAG (50 μl/well, MSD R32AD-1) at 2 μg/ml in 1% BSA in PBS and incubated with shaking (750 RPM) at room temperature for 30 minutes. Prior to measurement of the electrochemiluminescence in a MSD Sector Imager 6000, the MSD plate was washed and 150 μl/well of 2× Read Buffer T (MSD R92TC-1) was added. Curve fitting and EC50 calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism.

The test compounds were independently assessed on individual plates against the comparator molecule, Bevacizumab (Avastin); the assay was carried out on at least three separate occasions, with a total data set per molecule of Bevacizumab (Avastin): 15; DMS30037: 7; DMS30038: 8; DMS30037−R (DMS30047): 3; DMS30037+T (DMS30050): 4; DMS30038−R (DMS30051): 4 &amp; DMS30038+T (DMS30054): 4, (data not shown).

Individual curve fits were fitted for each molecule and at each day. Due to some poor fitting, it was decided to introduce constraints for the curve where a plateau was not observed at the lower concentration. One plate was excluded from the analysis due to poor curve fitting despite constraints. This constraint would be equal to the mean of the points at the lowest concentration. Data was manually selected as to whether the minimum was constrained or not, and the curve fit and parameters were automatically updated based upon this criteria selection. Estimates of the curve maxima and the standard error were analysed using a weighted mixed model analysis of variance, using 1/(standard error)<sup>2</sup>, [SE]<sup>2</sup>, as a weighting. The analysis adjusted for variability between plates and days using random effects terms. From this analysis, the predicted means were estimated and comparisons were made back to Avastin (control) (See Table 12A). The same analysis was then performed on the log 10 scale for the IC50, and the results back transformed. From this, estimates of the geometric means were generated and comparisons were made back to Avastin in the form of a ratio to Avastin (control) i.e. a ratio of 0.5 would indicate a 50% drop from Avastin (See Table 12B).</div>

This assay measures the extent of endothelial cell proliferation induced by a defined concentration of VEGF<sub>165 </sub>and the ability of VEGF antagonists to block this effect. HUVECs were seeded at 5000 cells per well in 96-well gelatine-coated plates, leaving outer wells free of cells, and incubated for several hours to permit adherence. Test molecules were assayed at equimolar concentrations (max 3.33×10<sup>−08</sup>M) with a 2-fold serial dilution, each in triplicate. The VEGF165 was prepared in basal medium to achieve 75 ng/ml final concentration. Medium was removed manually from the cell monolayers and 50 μl basal media was added to prevent the cells from drying out. 25 μl VEGF165-containing medium and 25 μl basal medium or test antibody-containing medium was added as appropriate. Cells were incubated for 72 hrs, after which time the total number of cells was determined using Cell Titre Glo. Treatment of HUVECs with VEGF165 resulted in the expected increase in the total number of cells after 72 hrs, when compared with VEGF165-untreated cells (data not shown). This VEGF-mediated increase is interpreted as representing the cumulative effects of VEGF on both HUVEC proliferation and prevention of HUVEC cell death. The test compounds were independently assessed on individual plates against the comparator molecule, Bevacizumab (Avastin).</div>
