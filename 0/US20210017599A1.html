Among these treatments, immunotherapy in particular has drawn attention in recent years because it is a treatment more selective and specific against cancer with least side effects. Inter alia, attempts have been extensively made to treat cancer and leukemia by targeting WT1 protein, which is abundantly present in many types of cancer cells and leukemia cells. In order to study the mechanism of the WT1-targeted anti-cancer therapy and to further increase the effect of the therapy, it is necessary to identify the nucleotide sequences of the T-cell receptor (TCR) genes of WT1-specific cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) and the amino acid sequences of the receptor peptides encoded by the nucleotide sequences. However, up to the present date, little is known about the sequences of those receptor genes and the receptor peptides, let alone that no effective use of them has been described, although a number of researches have been conducted (see, e.g., non-patent documents 1-5).</div>

These sequences have been determined for the first time in the present invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0039]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0039">Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a polynucleotide having the nucleotide sequence encoding CDR3 of the Vβ chain of T-cell receptors (TCRs) of WT1-specific cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) obtained from healthy individuals and HLA-A*2402-positive patients, wherein the polynucleotide is DNA having any of the CDR3 nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ ID Nos.: 1-1696, RNA complementary to the DNA, or a polynucleotide having a complementary sequence thereof. As used herein, these DNA and RNA molecules and the complementary polynucleotides thereof are collectively referred to as “CDR3 polynucleotides.” For example, the CDR3 polynucleotides include, in addition to the DNAs comprising the nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ ID Nos.: 1-1696, DNAs comprising these sequences. Also, for example, the CDR3 polynucleotides include, in addition to the RNAs complementary to the DNAs comprising the nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ ID Nos.: 1-1696, RNAs comprising these sequences. Further, for example, the CDR3 polynucleotides include polynucleotides having the sequences of the DNAs or RNAs, and polynucleotides complementary to the RNAs.

In addition, a peptide consisting or comprising the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID Nos.: 1697-3392 in which one or a few, preferably one to three, one or two, or one amino acid is substituted, added, or deleted is included in the “CDR3 peptides.” However, these peptides are required to have equivalent functions to the original peptide.

Thus, the sequences of the CDR3 polynucleotides and CDR3 peptides of the present invention are considered peculiar to WT1-specific CTL in HLA-A*2402-positive patients. Therefore, provided that the polynucleotide encoding the CDR3 region of the gene for the TCR Vβ chain of a certain T-cell or the peptide corresponding to the CDR3 region have the sequence of the polynucleotide or peptide of the present invention, the T-cell is considered as specific for WT1. Accordingly, the CDR3 polynucleotides and CDR3 peptides of the present invention may find use as markers for a wide variety of cancers, use in applications such as diagnosis of cancer, diagnosis of the susceptibility of patients to WT1 peptide immunotherapy, and tests for the responsiveness in the patients to WT1 peptide immunotherapy.</div>

Also, for example, a CDR3 polynucleotide (optionally amplified to an appropriate level using a known method) may be integrated into a suitable vector and introduced into suitable cells, or may be introduced into suitable cells by biolistic bombardment or electroporation. Then the cells into which the CDR3 polynucleotide is introduced are cultured for expression, thereby obtaining the CDR3 polynucleotide or peptide.

Chemical synthesis may be used to produce CDR3 polynucleotides or CDR3 peptides.

As used herein, the term “clonality” refers to the frequency of detection of cells having an identical nucleotide or amino acid sequence. To examine clonality, it is general to use a cell sorter that allows identification of individual cells.

The number of the clonality is larger and the types of such cells are more abundant than those of the healthy individuals. The increases in clonality and in types of cells having a multiplicity of clonality in patients before therapy indicate a possibility that defense and attack against cancer cells has already been launched in the patients.</div>

Also, in the determination method, it is possible to determine that the higher the possibility of developing cancer in the patient before therapy is when the clonality of WT1-specific CTL having any of the CDR3 polynucleotides or CDR3 peptides and having the clonality of 3 or more is larger, or the types of WT1-specific CTL having the clonality of 3 or more are more abundant.</div>

In this process, the clones that already have a multiplicity of clonality before the therapy tend to further increase the clonality or maintain their clonality by WT1 peptide immunotherapy. It is also considered that WT1 immunotherapy is more likely to be successful when there are clones of as many types as possible, which gives increased number and types of effective WT1-specific CTL clones as a whole. More strictly speaking, the sensitivity of a patient to WT1 peptide immunotherapy may be determined as being high when the types of WT1-specific CTL clones with a multiplicity of clonality are more abundant in the patient than in non-responsive subjects.</div>

The exemplary clones exhibiting such behavior include Clones #02.28, #05.034, #05.135, #05.219, #09.65, #12.04, #13.13, #27.016, and #28.83 from AML (Pt1), and Clones #02.27, #05.035, #05.141, #05.219, #06.009, #12.04, #12.20, #15.44, #20.068, and #27.032 from AML (Pt2). The presence of clones that increases their clonality due to WT1 peptide immunotherapy indicates the responsiveness to the WT1 peptide immunotherapy. In other words, increases in the clonality suggests that the WT1 peptide immunotherapy showed its effect for a certain period of time. These increases in clonality may be transient or sustained. If the clonality of certain clones may increase only temporarily and then decrease, the clonality of other WT1-specific CTLs would increase to complement the effect. Considering the effect on cancer cells, a larger increase in the clonality is more desired. Therefore, the larger becomes the increase in the clonality or the more abundant become the types of clones with increased clonality after the WT1 peptide immunotherapy, the patient may be determined to have higher responsiveness to the WT1 peptide immunotherapy. The number and properties of cancer cells may be examined using an appropriate method depending on the type and site of the cancer.</div>

One μl of each PCR product was placed in separate 8 tubes and 24 μl of a reaction mixture was added to each of the tubes. The reaction mixture contained 1× PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.0 U of Platinum Tag DNA polymerase, one set of forward primers selected from the 8 screening sets S1 to S8, shown in Table 1, and 5′-Cβ reverse primer (5′-GGAACACGTTTTTCAGGTCCT-3′ (SEQ ID No.: 3421)) (150 nM each). The procedure of PCR was as follows: a pre-PCR heating step at 95° C. for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of a denaturing step at 94° C. for 45 seconds, an annealing step at 57° C. for 45 seconds, and an extension step at 72° C. for 40 seconds.</div>

The positive reaction was verified by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Even if the clonality of certain clones may increase temporarily and then decrease, the clonality of other WT1-specific CTLs would increase to complement the effect. Considering the effect on cancer cells, a larger increase in the clonality is more desired. Therefore, the larger becomes the increase in the clonality or the more abundant become the types of clones with increased clonality after the WT1 peptide immunotherapy, the responsiveness to the WT1 peptide immunotherapy is considered to have been high.</div>
