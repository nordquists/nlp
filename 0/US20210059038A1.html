<div class="abstract">An ignition circuit and a method of operating an igniter (preferably a traveling spark igniter) in an internal combustion engine, including a high pressure engine. A high voltage is applied to electrodes of the igniter, sufficient to cause breakdown to occur between the electrodes, resulting in a high current electrical discharge in the igniter, over a surface of an isolator between the electrodes, and formation of a plasma kernel in a fuel-air mixture adjacent said surface. Following breakdown, a sequence of one or more lower voltage and lower current pulses is applied to said electrodes, with a low “simmer” current being sustained through the plasma between pulses, preventing total plasma recombination and allowing the plasma kernel to move toward a free end of the electrodes with each pulse.</div>

<heading id="h-0003">Field</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the fields of plasma generation, ignitions, and internal combustion (IC) engines. In particular, it relates, but is not limited, to ignition methods and ignition apparatus for use therein; and, specifically, to ignition methods and apparatus for various applications, including but not limited to, high pressure engines. More particularly, some aspects relate to the delivery of discharge current to traveling spark igniters in order to maximize their performance and longevity, especially in internal combustion engines operating at high pressures.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0004">Discussion of Related Art</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">For a variety of reasons, there is interest today in increasing the pressures in internal combustion engines and similar combustion environments, with a concomitant need for ignition sources capable of operating in these environments. For example, automobile companies and manufacturers of internal combustion engines would like to be able to provide vehicles which have IC engines which operate at much higher pressures than conventional internal combustion engines. To date, however, there has not been an effective and practical ignition system for such engines. Among other concerns are longevity of igniters (spark plugs) and reliability of igniter firing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The traveling spark igniter (TSI) is a device that has been discussed as a promising spark plug replacement for internal combustion engines, but previously not for high pressure engines. TSIs have, for example, been shown in a number of prior patents including, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,321,733 and 6,474,321, both assigned to the same assignee as this invention and incorporated by reference in their entireties for their explanations of TSI devices and ignition systems.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Briefly, a TSI-based ignition system provides a large plasma kernel which is propagated along the igniter's electrodes by Lorentz force (along with thermal forces, to lesser degrees) and propelled into a combustion chamber. The Lorentz force acting on the ignition kernel (i.e., plasma) is created by way of the discharge current in the plasma interacting with a magnetic field caused by that same current in the electrodes of the igniter. The magnitude of the Lorentz force is proportional to the square of that current. In engines operating at normal pressures (i.e., a maximum of about 120 psi), traveling spark igniters provide significant advantages over conventional spark plugs due to the large plasma volume they generate, typically some 100-200 times larger than in a conventional spark plug, for comparable discharge energy. Increased efficiency and reduced emissions are attainable.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">For higher engine operating pressures, however, the breakdown voltage required for initiating the discharge between the electrodes of the igniter is significantly higher than in engines operating at conventional pressures. This creates problems for TSIs, as for any spark plug. The electrodes in a TSI, as in a conventional spark plug, are maintained in a spaced apart relationship by a member called an isolator, which is formed of an insulating material such as a ceramic. The higher breakdown voltage causes problems for both the isolator and the electrodes.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Along the surface of the isolator running between the electrodes, the breakdown voltage is lower than it is further along the electrodes in a TSI, or in any conventional spark plug with a similar gap between the electrodes. Indeed, this difference in breakdown voltages varies directly with increasing pressure in the combustion chamber. Consequently, although the breakdown voltage along the isolator surface increases with pressure, that increase is less than the increase in the breakdown voltage between the exposed part of the electrodes away from the isolator surface. When breakdown occurs (as a result of which the resistance through the plasma rapidly drops), the current rises rapidly and a very large current is conducted in the forming plasma along the isolator surface, thus giving rise to the Lorentz force acting on the plasma. Such rapidly rising current, though, creates not only a very high temperature plasma, but also a powerful shock wave in the vicinity of the surface of the isolator. The larger the current, the more rapid the plasma expansion and the resulting shock wave. These combined effects can cause deformation and/or breakage of the isolator.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, the high current produces very rapid erosion of the electrodes in the vicinity of the isolator surface, where they are attacked by the high current, thermal heating and thermionic emission that results therefrom.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Similar problems have been manifest with igniters based on the University of Texas “railplug” design which generates a Lorentz force in a plasma traveling along a high aspect ratio discharge gap (as contrasted with a TSI, which has a low aspect ratio discharge gap).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Although both the railplug and the TSI generate significant plasma motion at relatively low pressures, when the combustion chamber pressure is increased to a high pressure, the plasma behaves differently and it is this difference in behavior that leads to unsatisfactory results. In a low pressure environment, the force exerted on the plasma by the pressure is relatively small. The plasma moves easily along the electrodes in response to the Lorentz force. As the ignition chamber pressure is increased, however, that pressure provides a force of significant magnitude that resists the Lorentz force and, thus, plasma motion. Consequently, the plasma tends to become more concentrated, and to collapse on itself; instead of having a diffused plasma cloud, a very localized plasma—an arc—is formed between the electrodes below a certain current threshold. This arc, though occupying a much smaller volume than the plasma cloud of the low-pressure case, receives similar energy. As a result, the current density is higher and at the electrodes, where the arc exists, there is a higher localized temperature and more power density at the arc-electrode interfaces. That is, the current density is quite high at those interfaces, producing more localized heating of the electrodes than in the low pressure environment. The localized heating of the electrodes, in turn, produces thermionic emission of electrons and ions. The observed effect is that the arc appears to “attach” itself at relatively fixed locations on the electrodes, producing erosion of the electrodes as the entire discharge energy is deposited at the “attachment point;” this is to be contrasted with the low pressure environment where a lower density, diffused area of plasma contact moves along the electrodes without significantly damaging them.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Concurrently, the plasma, affected by the Lorentz and thermal forces, bows out from the arc attachment points. This causes the magnetic field lines to no longer be orthogonal to the current flow between the electrodes, reducing the magnitude of the Lorentz force produced by a given current. So, in addition to the other problems, there is a loss in motive force applied to the plasma.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">Overall, there is a reduction in plasma motion as compared with the lower pressure environments, and dramatically increased electrode wear at the arc attachment points. Accordingly, a variety of needs exist, including needs for plasma generators, in general, needs for improved ignition systems, needs for ignition systems for use in internal combustion engines and needs for an ignition system and method which generates a large ignition kernel and which is usable with high pressure engines, and is commercially practical.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">If a traveling spark igniter is to be used in a high pressure combustion environment, a need further exists to overcome the above negative effects on the isolator material and electrodes of the igniter. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,704,321, 6,131,542, 6,321,733, 6,474,321, 6,662,793, and 6,553,981, for example, incorporated by reference herein. That is, a need exists for an igniter and ignition system for use in high pressure combustion engines, wherein the isolator and electrodes exhibit substantial lifetimes (preferably comparable to that of conventional spark plugs in low pressure engines) without being destroyed by the discharge process. Desirably, such a traveling spark igniter and ignition system will be usable and useful in internal combustion engines operating not only at high and very high pressures (i.e., several hundred psi), but also at lower, conventional pressures.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">The above and other needs are addressed, and advantages provided, with a new method, and corresponding apparatus, for generating and sustaining a plasma, operating a traveling spark igniter and providing an ignition for internal combustion and other engines, particularly high pressure internal combustion engines. Typically, a high initial breakdown voltage is applied to the igniter to initiate a plasma kernel in a plasma initiation region of the igniter, but preferably at a current lower than that previously employed with TSI ignitions, as the breakdown current need not produce a large Lorentz force. After the breakdown current pulse, various mechanisms may be employed to prolong the plasma while recombination is occurring and to allow the plasma to become easily detached (or detachable) from the initiation region (typically, on or adjacent the surface of an isolator between the igniter electrodes. Before the plasma has a chance to recombine completely, the current is turned on again to provide a short follow-on pulse of energy (preferably at a current substantially less than that of the breakdown pulse). The follow-on current pulse generates a corresponding pulse of Lorentz force to move the plasma away from its previous location, further along the electrodes of the igniter. A number of such follow-on pulses may be provided, with an “off” interval between successive pulses, during which interval one or more mechanisms prolong the plasma and allow only partial recombination of the plasma. This is called “simmering.” Prior to total recombination of the plasma, the next follow-on pulse of current “kicks” the plasma even further along the electrodes; and the final follow-on pulse ejects the plasma from the electrodes. One mechanism for producing simmering is to reduce the current through the igniter to a relatively low (but non-zero) level, called a “simmer current.” Alternatively, if a summer current is not applied, similar effects may be obtained by using any of a number of other techniques for prolonging recombination and preventing “total” recombination of the plasma kernel by the time the next follow-on pulse arrives. For example, the follow-on pulses may be timed and possibly even waveform-shaped to more closely follow each other so that only partial recombination occurs between pulses; or each follow-on pulse may be preceded by a high sub-breakdown voltage; or the plasma may be excited by RF or laser energy. That is, numerous ways are contemplated of preventing total plasma recombination. By “total” in reference to recombination is meant that the plasma effectively has been extinguished and high energy is needed to reignite it.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0040]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0041" num="0040">Herein are explained in greater detail numerous aspects of the invention; the problems addressed by the invention, in greater detail than above; and a single embodiment of an example of an ignition circuit for practicing aspects of the invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0041]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0042" num="0041">According to a first aspect, there will be shown a method of operating an igniter in an internal combustion engine, comprising: applying a high voltage to electrodes of the igniter, said high voltage being of amplitude sufficient to cause electrical discharge breakdown to occur between the electrodes, in an initiation region (e.g., over a surface of an isolator) between the electrodes, resulting in a high current electrical discharge in the igniter, and formation of a plasma kernel in an air or fuel-air mixture adjacent said surface; and following breakdown, applying to said electrodes (preferably a simmer current) and a sequence of one or more lower voltage and lower current pulses, whereby the plasma kernel is forced to move toward a free end of said electrodes by said lower voltage, lower current pulses.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0042]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0043" num="0042">Between breakdown and a first pulse of the sequence, and between pulses of the sequence, a current desirably is maintained through the plasma kernel sufficient to prevent total recombination of the plasma. Alternatively, such a current need not be maintained, if the intervals between breakdown and the first pulse of the sequence, and between additional follow-on pulses of the sequence, are sufficiently short, such that total recombination does not occur prior to the start of such pulses. (If total recombination occurs, then a high breakdown voltage is needed to restart the plasma formation process.) If total recombination is avoided (no matter how) before the start of a follow-on pulse, the follow-on pulse can be a relatively low current pulse (compared to a number of previous approaches, but still appreciable) and it will still provide a suitable Lorentz force to advance the plasma, and it will, itself, create a current arc that can move along the electrodes. As another alternative, recombination can be slowed by imposing a relatively high (but less than breakdown) voltage across the electrodes prior to the start of a follow-on pulse. All three mechanisms facilitate the establishment of a moving plasma kernel without requiring re-generation of a high energy breakdown condition, reducing the tendency of the current path to “re-attach” to the electrodes at fixed locations.

As the discharge current passes through the plasma, the temperature and volume of the plasma increase, leading to a further decrease in plasma resistivity and resistance. This increases the current in the plasma, which is limited primarily by the impedance of the electrical discharge circuit that produces the current supplied to the igniter.</div>

The front portion of the hot plasma that is in contact with a relatively cold combustion mixture cools rapidly. The plasma recombination rate at high pressure is a function of plasma temperature, T, that varies as 1/T<sup>3/2</sup>. Hence, at low temperature, plasma recombination occurs very fast at its propagation front where it interacts with the cold gaseous mixture. At high pressures, such recombination rate could be as fast as the plasma propagation velocity, meaning that the Lorentz force—induced movement would be entirely negated by the speed of recombination, effectively causing the plasma to stand still. In such a situation, the net plasma velocity along the electrodes is substantially zero and the plasma will seem to stay near the surface of the isolator during the entire discharge. The plasma, of course, recombines near the surface of the isolator, as well, though at a much slower rate because the gas there is much hotter than at the plasma's front edge. Consequently, plasma resistivity near the isolator surface is lower than at the front edge of the plasma and most of the discharge current will be concentrated in that region, preventing further plasma recombination near the isolator.</div>

There are thermal stresses imposed on the isolator and shock waves are generated that can damage the isolator. There are also large thermal effects on the portions of the electrodes near the isolator. Assuming the ignition circuit supplies sufficient energy to create a net force that will effectively move the plasma, then the higher the pressure in the combustion chamber, the worse the negative effects on the isolator and electrodes.

Increase in breakdown voltage has a negative impact on the lifetimes of the isolator and electrodes. Such negative effects can be avoided or significantly reduced by limiting the breakdown current. For example, introducing a resistor into the high voltage circuit, as described below, limits breakdown current without wasting significantly energy when the breakdown discharge is of short duration in comparison with the total interval of follow-on discharge pulses. Limiting the current causes the mode of operation to differ substantially from that of prior TSI systems. In prior TSI systems, such as those shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,321,733 and 6,474,321, it was desired that a high breakdown current be followed immediately by high current from capacitors to create maximum acceleration and plasma speed. The goal was to get the plasma to reach the end of the electrodes and move into the combustion chamber in a single discharge pulse. In contrast, in a high pressure environment, plasma motion is small following breakdown. Thus, it is acceptable to limit the breakdown current since the breakdown current is only used to create the plasma near the isolator surface, rather than to actually produce significant plasma motion.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0105]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0106" num="0105">It is possible to improve the efficiency of the circuit and to reduce the heat dissipation by making the switch element <b>166</b> a controlled current drainage path. Then, instead of using resistance <b>174</b> to limit the current drain off of capacitor <b>156</b>, the switch transistor (or like element) takes care of that need, providing controlled discharge. More specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an active switching element (here indicated as a MOSFET <b>166</b>′), is connected from node <b>168</b> to ground through a resistor <b>192</b>. The voltage across that resistor is sensed as a proxy for measuring the actual current through transistor <b>166</b>′. Gate drive logic <b>194</b> interposed between the pulse generator and the gate of transistor <b>166</b>′, responsive to the voltage on resistor <b>192</b>, operates the transistor as a switching regulator, with variable duty cycle and a resulting lower power dissipation than that arising from the use of resistor <b>174</b>. Drive logic <b>194</b> may be implemented in various ways and may include fixed logic or it may include programmable logic, possibly including a microcontroller to operate the logic. An advantage of using a microcontroller is that the logic can then be configured to operate the circuit to perform in the various modes discussed herein—e.g., with or without simmer current.</div>
