<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Axonal regeneration after injury or after inflammatory attacks or after neurodegenerative diseases within the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is almost always impossible; the outcome depends on the balance between the intrinsic ability of the nerve fibers in the CNS to re-grow, and the inhibitory factors within the CNS, localized in the microenvironment of the lesion or damage site, which actively prevent the re-growth, and thus the regeneration of the injured fiber tracts.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been established that CNS myelin, generated by oligodendrocytes, and the lesional scar are the most relevant non-permissive structures for axonal growth in the early phase of an injury, by causing growth cone collapse and neurite growth inhibition in vitro as well as in vivo, thereby resulting in direct inhibition of axon regrowth. RGM proteins, major inhibitory factors on CNS myelin and scar tissue have been identified (Monnier et ai., Nature 419: 392-395, 2002; Schwab et al., Arch. Neurol.62: 1561-8, 2005a; Schwab et al. Eur. J. Neurosci. 21:1569-76, 2005 b; Hata et al. J. Cell Biol.173:47-58, 2006; for reviews see: Mueller et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Land. B Bioi. Sci. 361: 1513-29, 2006; Yamashita et al. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 17: 29-34, 2007). RGM proteins are up-regulated at damage or lesion sites in humans dying from brain trauma or ischemic insult, (Schwab et al., Arch. Neural. 62: 1561-8, 2005a) and are up-regulated at lesion sites in rats with spinal cord injury (Schwab et al. Eur. J. Neurosci. 21:1569-76, 2005 b; Hata et al. J. Cell Biol. 173:47-58, 2006 for review see: Mueller et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Land. B Bioi. Sci. 361: 1513-29, 2006; Yamashita et al. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 17: 29-34, 2007). In addition first data using clinical samples from Multiple sclerosis patients and healthy persons suggested that human RGM A is up-regulated in cerebrospinal fluid of patients suffering from MS (data not shown).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">To evaluate the regeneration-promoting potential of a RGM A-specific polyclonal antibody, the antibodies were administered in a moderate-to-severe model of spinal cord injury, where approximately 60% of the spinal cord at thoracal level 9/10 was transected. The histological examination revealed that such a lesion severed all dorsal and lateral fibers of the corticospinal tract. The RGM A-specific polyclonal antibody given locally via pump for two weeks induced long-distance regeneration of injured nerve fibers (Hata et al., J. Cell Bioi. 173:47-58, 2006).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Hundreds of nerve fibers extended past the lesion site and the longest fibers regenerated for more than 10 mm beyond the lesion, whereas no regenerating fibers were found distal to the lesion in control antibody-treated animals. The functional recovery of the anti-RGM A treated rats was significantly improved in comparison with control-antibody treated, spinally injured rats, thereby proving that RGM A is a potent neuroregeneration inhibitor and a valuable target for stimulating recovery in indications characterized by axon damage or nerve fiber injury (Hata et al., J. Cell Biol. 173:47-58, 2006; Kyoto et al. Brain Res. 1186: 74-86, 2007). In addition neutralising the RGM A protein with a function-blocking polyclonal antibody stimulated not only regrowth of damaged nerve fibers in the spinally injured rats but enhanced their synapse formation thereby enabling the reformation or restoration damaged neuronal circuits (Kyoto et al. Brain Res. 1186: 74-86, 2007).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">The rgm gene family encompasses three different genes, two of them, rgm a and b, are expressed in the mammalian CNS originating RGM A and RGM B proteins, whereas the third member, rgm c, is expressed in the periphery (Mueller et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Bioi. Sci. 361: 1513-29, 2006), where RGM C plays an important role in iron metabolism. In vitro, RGM A inhibits neurite outgrowth by binding to Neogenin, which has been identified as an RGM receptor (Rajagopalan et al. Nat Cell Biol.: 6(8), 756-62, 2004). Neogenin had first been described as a netrin-binding protein (Keino-Masu et al. Cell, 87(2):175-85, 1996). This is an important finding because binding of Netrin-1 to Neogenin or to its closely related receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) has been reported to stimulate rather than to inhibit neurite growth (Braisted et al. J. Neurosci. 20: 5792-801, 2000). Blocking RGM A therefore releases the RGM-mediated growth inhibition by enabling Neogenin to bind its neurite growth-stimulating ligand Netrin. Based on these observations, neutralizing RGM A can be assumed to be superior to neutralizing neogenin in models of human spinal cord injury. Besides binding of RGM A to Neogenin and inducing neurite growth inhibition, the binding of RGM A or B to the bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-2 and BMP-4 could represent another obstacle to successful neuroregeneration and functional recovery (Mueller et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 361: 1513-29, 2006).</div>

The neutralizing monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are expected to stimulate regrowth of injured or damaged nerve fibers and formation of functional synapses of regenerating nerve fibers since one of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies of the present invention appears to transform the inhibitory nature of RGM A in a condition in which neuronal cells prefer to migrate and grow on an RGM A substrate, and not on a permissive substrate like Collagen I. In addition this antibody is able to induce long-distance regeneration in an in vivo rat model of optic nerve injury and it also enhances remyelination of lesioned and regenerating nerve fibers.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0198]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0178" num="0198">The term “human RGM A” (abbreviated herein as hRGM A), as used herein refers to a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (gpi)-anchored glycoprotein with 450 amino acids, was first described as a neurite growth repellent or neurite growth inhibitor during development of topographic projections (Stahl et al. Neuron 5: 735-43, 1990; Mueller, in Molecular Basis of Axon Growth and Nerve Pattern Formation, Edited by H. Fujisawa, Japan Scientific Societies Press, 215-229, 1997). The rgm gene family encompasses three different genes, two of them, rgm a and b, are expressed in the mammalian CNS, whereas the third member, rgm c, is expressed in the periphery (Mueller et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Bioi. Sci. 361: 1513-29, 2006), where it plays an important role in iron metabolism. Human RGM proteins have a sequence identity of 43%-50%; the amino acid homology of human and rat RGM A is 89%. Human RGM proteins share no significant sequence homology with any other known protein. They are proline-rich proteins containing an RGDregion and have structural homology to the Von-Willebrand Factor domain and are cleaved at the N-terminal amino acid 168 by an unknown protease to yield the functionally active protein (Mueller et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Bioi. Sci. 361: 1513-29, 2006).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0199]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0179" num="0199">In vitro, RGM A inhibits neurite outgrowth at picomolar concentrations by binding to Neogenin, which has been identified as an RGM receptor (Rajagopalan et al. Nat Cell Bioi.: 6(8), 756-62, 2004). Neogenin had first been described as a netrin-binding protein (Keino-Masu et al. Cell, 87(2):175-85, 1996), but its affinity for Netrin (K<sub>d </sub>2 nM) is an order of magnitude lower than that for RGM (K<sub>d </sub>0.2 nM) (Rajagopalan et al. Nat Cell Biol.: 6(8), 756-62, 2004). This is an important finding because binding of Netrin-1 to Neogenin or to its closely related receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) has been reported to stimulate rather than to inhibit neurite growth (Braisted et al. J. Neurosci. 20: 5792-801, 2000).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0200]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0180" num="0200">Besides binding of RGM A to Neogenin and inducing neurite growth inhibition, the binding of RGM A or B to the bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-2 and BMP-4 could represent another obstacle to successful neuroregeneration and functional recovery (Mueller et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Land. B Biol. Sci. 361: 1513-29, 2006). Both classes of proteins (Neogenin and the BMPs) have been reported to transduce the neurite growth inhibitory signal of RGM A via two completely different and independent signal transduction pathways. Usually, expression of these BMP proteins is relatively low in most regions of the adult CNS, but rapid increases in expression and accumulation of some BMPs (e.g. BMP-2, BMP-6, BMP-7) have been reported in response to injury and insult (Lai et al., Neuroreport 8: 2691-94, 1997; Martinez et al. Brain Res. 894: 1-11, 2001; Hall and Miller, J. Neurosci. Res. 76: 1-8, 2004; Setoguchi et al., Exp. Neural. 189: 33-44, 2004). In addition, in a model of multiple sclerosis, the experimental autoimmune encephalomyeltis (EAE) model, BMP-4, BMP-6 and BMP-7 were upregulated in mouse spinal cord (Ara et al., J. Neurosci. Res. 86: 125-35, 2008). BMP-2 has been reported to inhibit neurite growth by binding to cell surface RGM A, BMP-receptors I and II and by directly activating LIM-kinase (Matsuura et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun., 360: 868-73, 2007) and it is therefore expected that blocking the RGM A-BMP-2 interaction will further increase functional recovery after CNS injury.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0201]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0181" num="0201">As mentioned above, spinally injured rats and humans with brain injury, show massive accumulations of cellular RGM at the injury site and the staining pattern of RGM A in rats at the spinal lesion site is very similar to the pan RGM antibody staining in humans, suggesting that most of the pan RGM staining in humans is related to RGM A localization but not to RGM B localization (Schwab et al., Arch. Neurol. 62: 1561-8, 2005a; Schwab et al. Eur. J. Neurosci. 21:1569-76, 2005 b; Hata et al. J. Cell Biol.173:47-58, 2006). In healthy human brain, pan RGM staining (RGM A &amp; B immunoreactivity) was detected on white matter fibers, oligodendrocytes, perikarya of few neurons, some vascular smooth muscle and few endothelial cells. No staining of astrocytes was observed. The RGM staining pattern in adult healthy human brain is very similar to the staining pattern observed in adult rat spinal cords (Schwab et al. Eur. J. Neurosci. 21:1569-76, 2005 b; Hata et al. J. Cell Biol. 173:47-58, 2006).</div>

Monoclonal antibodies can be generated by several novel technologies like phage, bacteria, yeast or ribosomal display, as well as classical methods exemplified by hybridoma-derived antibodies (e.g., an antibody secreted by a hybridoma prepared by hybridoma technology, such as the standard Kohler and Milstein hybridoma methodology ((1975) Nature 256:495-497).</div>

The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.

It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Such antibody embodiments may also be bispecific, dual specific, or multi-specific formats; specifically binding to two or more different antigens. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term “antigen-binding portion” of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab′)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al, (1989) <i>Nature </i>341:544-546, Winter et al., PCT publication WO 90/05144 A1 herein incorporated by reference), which comprises a single variable domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) <i>Science </i>242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term “antigen-binding portion” of an antibody. Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al.

In some embodiments, the term “acceptor” refers to the antibody amino acid or nucleic acid sequence providing or encoding the constant region(s). In yet another embodiment, the term “acceptor” refers to the antibody amino acid or nucleic acid sequence providing or encoding one or more of the framework regions and the constant region(s).

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0219]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0201" num="0219">As used herein, the term “CDR” refers to the complementarity determining region within antibody variable sequences. There are three CDRs in each of the variable regions of the heavy chain and the light chain, which are designated CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, for each of the variable regions. The term “CDR set” as used herein refers to a group of three CDRs that occur in a single variable region capable of binding the antigen. The exact boundaries of these CDRs have been defined differently according to different systems. The system described by Kabat (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987) and (1991)) not only provides an unambiguous residue numbering system applicable to any variable region of an antibody, but also provides precise residue boundaries defining the three CDRs. These CDRs may be referred to as Kabat CDRs. Chothia and coworkers (Chothia &amp;Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987) and Chothia et al., Nature 342:877-883 (1989)) found that certain subportions within Kabat CDRs adopt nearly identical peptide backbone conformations, despite having great diversity at the level of amino acid sequence. These subportions were designated as L 1, L2 and L3 or H 1, H2 and H3 where the “L” and the “H” designates the light chain and the heavy chains regions, respectively. These regions may be referred to as Chothia CDRs, which have boundaries that overlap with Kabat CDRs. Other boundaries defining CDRs overlapping with the Kabat CDRs have been described by Padlan (FASEB J. 9:133-139 (1995)) and MacCallum (J Mol Biol 262(5):732-45 (1996)). Still other CDR boundary definitions may not strictly follow one of the above systems, but will nonetheless overlap with the Kabat CDRs, although they may be shortened or lengthened in light of prediction or experimental findings that particular residues or groups of residues or even entire CDRs do not significantly impact antigen binding. The methods used herein may utilize CDRs defined according to any of these systems, although preferred embodiments use Kabat or Chothia defined CDRs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0220]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0202" num="0220">As used herein, the term “canonical” residue refers to a residue in a CDR or framework that defines a particular canonical CDR structure as defined by Chothia et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-907 (1987); Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 227:799 (1992), both are incorporated herein by reference). According to Chothia et al., critical portions of the CDRs of many antibodies have nearly identical peptide backbone confirmations despite great diversity at the level of amino acid sequence. Each canonical structure specifies primarily a set of peptide backbone torsion angles for a contiguous segment of amino acid residues forming a loop.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0221]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0203" num="0221">As used herein, the terms “donor” and “donor antibody” refer to an antibody providing one or more CDRs. In a preferred embodiment, the donor antibody is an antibody from a species different from the antibody from which the framework regions are obtained or derived. In the context of a humanized antibody, the term “donor antibody” refers to a non-human antibody providing one or more CDRs. As used herein, the term “framework” or “framework sequence” refers to the remaining sequences of a variable region minus the CDRs. Because the exact definition of a CDR sequence can be determined by different systems, the meaning of a framework sequence is subject to correspondingly different interpretations. The six CDRs (CDR-L 1, -L2, and -L3 of light chain and CDR-H1, -H2, and -H3 of heavy chain) also divide the framework regions on the light chain and the heavy chain into four sub-regions (FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4) on each chain, in which CDR1 is positioned between FR1 and FR2, CDR2 between FR2 and FR3, and CDR3 between FR3 and FR4. Without specifying the particular sub-regions as FR1, FR2, FR3 or FR4, a framework region, as referred by others, represents the combined FR's within the variable region of a single, naturally occurring immunoglobulin chain. As used herein, a FR represents one of the four sub-regions, and FRs represents two or more of the four sub-regions constituting a framework region.</div>

(See, e.g., Shapiro et al., Grit. Rev. Immunol. 22(3): 183-200 (2002); Marchalonis et al., Adv Exp Med Bioi. 484:13-30 10 (2001)). One of the advantages provided by various embodiments of the present invention stems from the recognition that germline antibody genes are more likely than mature antibody genes to conserve essential amino acid sequence structures characteristic of individuals in the species, hence less likely to be recognized as from a foreign source when used therapeutically in that species.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0224]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0208" num="0224">As used herein, the term “key” residues refer to certain residues within the variable region that have more impact on the binding specificity and/or affinity of an antibody, in particular a humanized antibody. A key residue includes, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: a residue that is adjacent to a CDR, a potential glycosylation site (can be either N- or O-glycosylation site), a rare residue, a residue capable of interacting with the antigen, a residue capable of interacting with a CDR, a canonical residue, a contact residue between heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region, a residue within the Vernier zone, and a residue in the region that overlaps between the Chothia definition of a variable heavy chain CDR1 and the Kabat definition of the first heavy chain framework.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0225]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0209" num="0225">The term “humanized antibody” generally refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from a non-human species (e.g., a mouse) but in which at least a portion of the VH and/or VL sequence has been altered to be more “human-like”, i.e., more similar to human germline variable sequences. One type of humanized antibody is a CDR-grafted antibody, in which human CDR sequences are introduced into non-human VH and VL sequences to replace the corresponding nonhuman CDR sequences.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0226]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0210" num="0226">In particular, the term “humanized antibody” as used herein, is an antibody or a variant, derivative, analog or fragment thereof which immunospecifically binds to an antigen of interest and which comprises a framework (FR) region having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human antibody and a complementary determining region (CDR) having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human antibody. As used herein, the term “substantially” in the context of a CDR refers to a CDR having an amino acid sequence at least 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 or 80%, preferably at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of a non-human antibody CDR. A humanized antibody comprises substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains (Fab, Fab′, F(ab′) 2, FabC, Fv) in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin (i.e., donor antibody) and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. Preferably, a humanized antibody also comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fe), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody contains both the light chain as well as at least the variable domain of a heavy chain. The antibody also may include the CH1, hinge, CH2, CH3, and CH4 regions of the heavy chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized light chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized heavy chain. In specific embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized variable domain of a light chain and/or humanized heavy chain.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0227]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0211" num="0227">The humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgY, IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE, and any isotype, including without limitation IgA 1, IgA2, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype, and particular constant domains may be selected to optimize desired effector functions using techniques well-known in the art.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0228]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0212" num="0228">The framework and CDR regions of a humanized antibody need not correspond precisely to the parental sequences, e.g., the donor antibody CDR or the consensus framework may be mutagenized by substitution, insertion and/or deletion of at least one amino acid residue so that the CDR or framework residue at that site does not correspond to either the donor antibody or the consensus framework. In a preferred embodiment, such mutations, however, will not be extensive. Usually, at least 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 or 80%, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental FR and CDR sequences. As used herein, the term “consensus framework” refers to the framework region in the consensus immunoglobulin sequence. As used herein, the term “consensus immunoglobulin sequence” refers to the sequence formed from the most frequently occurring amino acids (or nucleotides) in a family of related immunoglobulin sequences (See e.g., Winnaker, From Genes to Clones (Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany 1987). In a family of immunoglobulins, each position in the consensus sequence is occupied by the amino acid occurring most frequently at that position in the family. If two amino acids occur equally frequently, either can be included in the consensus sequence.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0229]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0213" num="0229">As used herein, “Vernier” zone refers to a subset of framework residues that may adjust CDR structure and fine-tune the fit to antigen as described by Foote and Winter (1992, J. Mol. Biol. 224:487-499, which is incorporated herein by reference). Vernier zone residues form a layer underlying the CDRs and may impact on the structure of CDRs and the affinity of the antibody.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0230]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0214" num="0230">The term “inhibition of binding” of RGM to one of his receptors as used herein encompasses partial (as for example by about 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or more) or complete reduction of said receptor binding activity. Said “inhibition of binding” may be determined by any suitable method available in the art, preferably by any method as exemplified herein, as for example ELISA based binding assays.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0231]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0215" num="0231">As used herein, the term “neutralizing” refers to neutralization of biological activity of a target protein when a binding protein specifically binds the target protein. Neutralizing may be the result of different ways of binding of said binding protein to the target. For example, neutralizing may be caused by binding of the binding protein in a region of the target which does not affect receptor binding to the target molecule. Alternatively binding of a binding protein may result in a blockade of the receptor binding to the target, which blockade finally neutralizes the target protein activity. Each of said different mechanism may occur according to the invention. Preferably a neutralizing binding protein is a neutralizing antibody whose binding to hRGM A results in neutralization of a biological activity of hRGM A. Preferably the neutralizing binding protein binds hRGM A and decreases a biologically activity of hRGM A by at least about 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 85% or more. Neutralization of a biological activity of hRGM A by a neutralizing binding protein can be assessed by measuring one or more indicators of hRGM A biological activity well known in the art. For example neutralization of hRGM A reverses the inhibition in a Ntera neuronal outgrowth assay (see Example 3, below). The Ntera neurite growth assay addresses inhibition of neurite outgrowth. In the absence of an inhibitory RGM A protein or fragment and in the presence of the outgrowth-stimulating substrate laminin, neuronal NTera aggregates show an extensive and dense network of outgrowing neurites. RGM A or RGM A fragments inhibit neurite outgrowth, resulting in reduced length and numbers of neurites. Function-blocking RGM A antagonists or MABs like mAb 5F9 neutralized the neurite outgrowth inhibitory activity of the potent fc-conjugated hRGM A light chain fragment (amino acids 47-168) of the human RGM A protein in neurite growth assays with aggregates of differentiated human NTera neurons, resulting in a strong increase in neurite length and numbers.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0232]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0216" num="0232">A “neutralizing monoclonal antibody” as used herein is intended to refer to a preparation of antibody molecules, which upon binding to the specific antigen are able to compete and inhibit the binding of the natural ligand for said antigen. In a particular embodiment of the present application, the neutralizing antibodies of the present invention are capable of competing with RGM A for binding to Neogenin and/or to BMP-2 and/or BMP-4, and to prevent RGM A biological activity or function. In particular, the neutralizing antibodies of the present invention are capable of binding with RGM A and to prevent binding to Neogenin and/or to BMP-2 and/or BMP-4, and to prevent RGM A biological activity or function. The term “activity” includes activities such as the binding specificity/affinity of an antibody for an antigen, for example, an anti-hRGM A antibody that binds to an RGM A antigen and/or the neutralizing potency of an antibody, for example, an anti-hRGM A antibody whose binding to hRGM A inhibits the biological activity of hRGM A, e.g. as determined in a hRGM A-Neogenin binding assay, hRGM A-BMP-2 binding assay or hRGM A-BMP-4 binding assay as described below in the experimental section. The biologic activity of RGM A can be described as regulating cellular migration. A special example of cellular migration is neurite growth, which is impeded or inhibited by RGM A proteins. In addition RGM proteins have been shown to modulate activity of BMP-proteins. Herein published examples describe a synergizing, potentiating activity of RGM proteins on the BMP-pathway on one side and an inhibitory activity of RGM proteins on the BMP-pathway, which is important for regulation of iron metabolism, bone and cartilage regeneration and in the CNS for remyelination and regeneration.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0233]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0217" num="0233">The term “epitope” or “antigenic determinant” includes any polypeptide determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. In certain embodiments, epitope determinants include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl, or sulfonyl, and, in certain embodiments, may have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics.

In this method, single cells secreting antibodies of interest, e.g., lymphocytes derived from any one of the immunized animals described above, are screened using an antigen-specific hemolytic plaque assay, wherein the antigen RGM A, a subunit of RGM A, or a fragment thereof, is coupled to sheep red blood cells using a linker, such as biotin, and used to identify single cells that secrete antibodies with specificity for RGM A. Following identification of antibody-secreting cells of interest, heavy- and light-chain variable region cDNAs are rescued from the cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR and these variable regions can then be expressed, in the context of appropriate immunoglobulin constant regions (e.g., human constant regions), in mammalian host cells, such as COS or CHO cells. The host cells transfected with the amplified immunoglobulin sequences, derived from in vivo selected lymphocytes, can then undergo further analysis and selection in vitro, for example by panning the transfected cells to isolate cells expressing antibodies to RGM A. The amplified immunoglobulin sequences further can be manipulated in vitro, such as by in vitro affinity maturation methods such as those described in PCT Publication WO 97/29131 and PCT Publication WO 00/56772.</div>

Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead.

One type of alternative expression system is one in which the recombinant antibody library is expressed as RNA-protein fusions, as described in PCT Publication No. WO 98/31700 by Szostak and Roberts, and in Roberts, R. W. and Szostak, J. W. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:12297-12302. In this system, a covalent fusion is created between an mRNA and the peptide or protein that it encodes by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs that carry puromycin, a peptidyl acceptor antibiotic, at their 3′ end. Thus, a specific mRNA can be enriched from a complex mixture of mRNAs (e.g., a combinatorial library) based on the properties of the encoded peptide or protein, e.g., antibody, or portion thereof, such as binding of the antibody, or portion thereof, to the dual specificity antigen. Nucleic acid sequences encoding antibodies, or portions thereof, recovered from screening of such libraries can be expressed by recombinant means as described above (e.g., in mammalian host cells) and, moreover, can be subjected to further affinity maturation by either additional rounds of screening of mRNA-peptide fusions in which mutations have been introduced into the originally selected sequence(s), or by other methods for affinity maturation in vitro of recombinant antibodies, as described above.</div>

For example, expression from host cells, wherein expression vector(s) encoding the heavy and light chains is (are) transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various forms of the term “transfection” are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques commonly used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, e.g., electroporation, calcium-phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection and the like. Although it is possible to express the antibodies of the invention in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells, expression of antibodies in eukaryotic cells is preferable, and most preferable in mammalian host cells, because such eukaryotic cells (and in particular mammalian cells) are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active antibody.</div>

Biol. 159:601-621), NSO myeloma cells, COS cells and SP2 cells. When recombinant expression vectors encoding antibody genes are introduced into mammalian host cells, the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or, more preferably, secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown. Antibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein purification methods.</div>

It will be understood that variations on the above procedure are within the scope of the present invention. For example, it may be desirable to transfect a host cell with DNA encoding functional fragments of either the light chain and/or the heavy chain of an antibody of this invention. Recombinant DNA technology may also be used to remove some, or all, of the DNA encoding either or both of the light and heavy chains that is not necessary for binding to the antigens of interest. The molecules expressed from such truncated DNA molecules are also encompassed by the antibodies of the invention. In addition, bifunctional antibodies may be produced in which one heavy and one light chain are an antibody of the invention and the other heavy and light chain are specific for an antigen other than the antigens of interest by crosslinking an antibody of the invention to a second antibody by standard chemical crosslinking methods.</div>

Within the recombinant expression vector, the antibody heavy and light chain genes are each operatively linked to CMV enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory elements to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector, transfect the host cells, select for transformants, culture the host cells and recover the antibody from the culture medium. Still further the invention provides a method of synthesizing a recombinant antibody of the invention by culturing a host cell of the invention in a suitable culture medium until a recombinant antibody of the invention is synthesized.

<li> <para-num num="[0290]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0276" num="0290">A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., (1989) J. Immunol. Methods 125:191-202; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In addition, techniques developed for the production of “chimeric antibodies” (Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81:851-855; Neuberger et al., 1984, Nature 312:604-608; Takeda et al., 1985, Nature 314:452-454 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties) by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0291]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0277" num="0291">In one embodiment, the chimeric antibodies of the invention are produced by replacing the heavy chain constant region of the murine monoclonal anti human RGM A antibodies described herein with a human IgG1 constant region.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0026">4.3 Anti RGM A CDR Grafted Antibodies</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0292]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0278" num="0292">CDR-grafted antibodies of the invention comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from a human antibody wherein one or more of the CDR regions of VH and/or VL are replaced with CDR sequences of non-human, as for example murine antibodies of the invention. A framework sequence from any human antibody may serve as the template for CDR grafting. However, straight chain replacement onto such a framework often leads to some loss of binding affinity to the antigen. The more homologous a human antibody is to the original murine antibody, the less likely the possibility that combining the murine CDRs with the human framework will introduce distortions in the CDRs that could reduce affinity. Therefore, it is preferable that the human variable framework that is chosen to replace the murine variable framework apart from the CDRs have at least a 65% sequence identity with the murine antibody variable region framework. It is more preferable that the human and murine variable regions apart from the CDRs have at least 70% sequence identify. It is even more preferable that the human and murine variable regions apart from the CDRs have at least 75% sequence identity. It is most preferable that the human and murine variable regions apart from the CDRs have at least 80% sequence identity. Methods for producing CDR-grafted antibodies are known in the art (Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539). In a specific embodiment the invention provides CDR grafted antibodies with V<sub>H </sub>and/or V<sub>L </sub>chains as described in Table 6.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0293]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0280" num="0293">Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Known human Ig sequences are disclosed, e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Dept. Health (1983), each entirely incorporated herein by reference. Such imported sequences can be used to reduce immunogenicity or reduce, enhance or modify binding, affinity, on-rate, off-rate, avidity, specificity, half-life, or any other suitable characteristic, as known in the art.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0294]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0281" num="0294">Framework residues in the human framework regions may be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.) Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art, such as but not limited to those described in Jones et al., Nature 321:522 (1986); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534 (1988)), Sims et al., J.

<heading id="h-0029">5.1 Fusion Antibodies and Immunoadhesins</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0295]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0282" num="0295">The present application also describes a fusion antibody or immunoadhesin that may be made which comprises all or a portion of a RGM A antibody of the present application linked to another polypeptide. In some embodiments, only the variable region of the RGM A antibody is linked to the polypeptide. In other embodiments, the VH domain of a RGM A antibody of this application is linked to a first polypeptide, while the VL domain of the antibody is linked to a second polypeptide that associates with the first polypeptide in a manner that permits the VH and VL domains to interact with one another to form an antibody binding site. In other embodiments, the VH domain is separated from the VL domain by a linker that permits the VH and VL domains to interact with one another (see below under Single Chain Antibodies). The VH-linker-VL antibody is then linked to a polypeptide of interest. The fusion antibody is useful to directing a polypeptide to a cell or tissue that expresses a RGM A. The polypeptide of interest may be a therapeutic agent, such as a toxin, or may be a diagnostic agent, such as an enzyme; that may be easily visualized, such as horseradish peroxidase. In addition, fusion antibodies can be created in which two (or more) single-chain antibodies are linked to one another. This is useful if one wants to create a divalent or polyvalent antibody on a single polypeptide chain, or if one wants to create a bispecific antibody.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0296]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0283" num="0296">One embodiment provides a labelled binding protein wherein an antibody or antibody portion of the present application is derivatized or linked to another functional molecule (e.g., another peptide or protein). For example, a labelled binding protein of the present application can be derived by functionally linking an antibody or antibody portion of the present application (by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as a nucleic acid, another antibody (e.g., a bispecific antibody or a diabody), a detectable agent, a cytotoxic agent, a pharmaceutical agent, and/or a protein or peptide that can mediate association of the antibody or antibody portion with another molecule (such as a streptavidin core region or a polyhistidine tag).</div>

Exemplary fluorescent detectable agents include fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, 5-dimethylamine-1-napthalenesulfonyl chloride, phycoerythrin and the like. An antibody may also be derivatized with detectable enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase and the like. When an antibody is derivatized with a detectable enzyme, it is detected by adding additional reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a detectable reaction product. For example, when the detectable agent horseradish peroxidase is present, the addition of hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine leads to a colored reaction product, which is detectable. An antibody may also be derivatized with a nucleic acid, biotin, and detected through indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin binding.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0298]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0285" num="0298">The present application includes a single chain antibody (scFv) that binds an immunogenic RGM A of the invention. To produce the scFv, VH- and V-encoding DNA is operatively linked to DNA encoding a flexible linker, e.g., encoding the amino acid sequence (Gly4-Ser), such that the VH and VL sequences can be expressed as a contiguous single-chain protein, with the VL and VH regions joined by the flexible linker (see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-42 6; Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 5879-5883; McCafferty et al., 30 Nature (1990) 34 8: 552-554). The single chain antibody may be monovalent, if only a single VH and VL are used, bivalent, if two VH and VL are used, or polyvalent, if more than two VH and VL are used. Two of said scFv fragments coupled via a linker are called “diabody” which form is also encompassed by the invention.</div>

For example, a bispecific antibody can be generated that specifically binds to an immunogenic RGM A polypeptide of the invention through one binding domain and to a second molecule through a second binding domain. In addition, a single chain antibody containing more than one VH and VL may be generated that binds specifically to an immunogenic polypeptide of the invention and to another molecule that is associated with attenuating myelin mediated growth cone collapse and inhibition of neurite outgrowth and sprouting. Such bispecific antibodies can be generated using techniques that are well known for example, Fanger et al. Immunol Methods 4: 72-81 (1994) and Wright and Harris, 20 (supra).</div>

Still further, an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof may be part of a larger immunoadhesion molecule, formed by covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody or antibody portion with one or more other or different proteins or peptides. Examples of such immunoadhesion molecules include use of the streptavidin core region to make a tetrameric scFv molecule (Kipriyanov et al. (1995) Human Antibodies and Hybridomas 6:93-101) and use of a cysteine residue, a marker peptide and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag to make bivalent and biotinylated scFv molecules (Kipriyanov et al. (1994) Molecular Immunology 31:1047-1058). Antibody portions, such as Fab and F(ab′)2 fragments, can be prepared from whole antibodies using conventional techniques, such as papain or pepsin digestion, respectively, of whole antibodies. Moreover, antibodies, antibody portions and immunoadhesion molecules can be obtained using standard recombinant DNA techniques.</div>

An antibody also may be labeled with enzymes that are useful for detection, such as horseradish peroxidase, galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, glucoseoxidase and the like. In embodiments that are labeled with a detectable enzyme, the antibody is detected by adding additional reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a detectable reaction product. For example, horseradish peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine. An antibody also may be labeled with biotin, and detected through indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin binding. An antibody may also be labeled with a predetermined polypeptide epitope recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope: tags). An RGM A antibody or an antigen fragment thereof also may be labeled with a radio-labeled amino acid. The radiolabel may be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The radio-labeled RGM A antibody may be used diagnostically, for example, for determining RGM A receptor levels in a subject.

<li> <para-num num="[0307]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0294" num="0307">Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins or immunoglobulins as used herein, are binding proteins that comprise two or more antigen binding sites and are multivalent binding proteins, as for example divalent and tetravalent. The term “multivalent binding protein” is used in this specification to denote a binding protein comprising two or more antigen binding sites. The multivalent binding protein is preferably engineered to have the two or more antigen binding sites, and is generally not a naturally occurring antibody. The term “multispecific binding protein” refers to a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Such DVDs may be monospecific, i.e. capable of binding one antigen or multispecific, i.e. capable of binding two or more antigens. DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to a DVD Ig. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, and a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. DVD binding proteins and methods of making DVD binding proteins are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/507,050 and incorporated herein by reference. It is intended that the present invention comprises a DVD binding protein comprising binding proteins capable of binding RGM A. Preferably the DVD binding protein is capable of binding RGM A and a second target. The second target is selected from the group consisting of anti inflammatory MAB activities (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, IL-23, TNF alpha/beta, IFN-beta, gamma, LIF, OSM, CNTF, PF-4, Platelet basic protein (PBP), NAP-2, beta-TG, MIP-1, MCP2/3, RANTES, lymphotactin), of transport-mediating proteins (insulin receptor, transferrin receptor, thrombin receptor, leptin receptor, LDL receptor), of other neuroregenerative MABs (NgR, Lingo, p75, CSPG (e.g. NG-2, neurocan, brevican, versican, aggrecan) hyaluronic acid, mAG, tenascin, NI-35, NI-250, IMP, perlecan, neurocan, phosphacan, nogo-A, OMGP, Sema4D, Sema 3A, ephrin 83, ephrin A2, ephrin A5, MAG, EphA4, plexin 81, TROY, wnts, ryk rec., BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7), of neuroprotective MA8 activities (EGF, EGFR, Sema 3), of anti-amyloid beta MA8s (e.g. m266, 306 (bapineuzumab), anti-globulomer MABs 7C6), of CNS located receptors and transporters (serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, OAT, Asc-1, GlyT1).</div>

The term “crystallized” as used herein, refer to an antibody, or antigen binding portion thereof, that exists in the form of a crystal. Crystals are one form of the solid state of matter, which is distinct from other forms such as the amorphous solid state or the liquid crystalline state. Crystals are composed of regular, repeating, three-dimensional arrays of atoms, ions, molecules (e.g., proteins such as antibodies), or molecular assemblies (e.g., antigen/antibody complexes). These three-dimensional arrays are arranged according to specific mathematical relationships that are well understood in the field. The fundamental unit, or building block, that is repeated in a crystal is called the asymmetric unit. Repetition of the asymmetric unit in an arrangement that conforms to a given, well-defined crystallographic symmetry provides the “unit cell” of the crystal. Repetition of the unit cell by regular translations in all three dimensions provides the crystal. See Giege, R. and Ducruix, A.

<li> <para-num num="[0312]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0299" num="0312">Another embodiment of the invention provides a glycosylated binding protein wherein the antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof comprises one or more carbohydrate residues. Nascent in vivo protein production may undergo further processing, known as post-translational modification. In particular, sugar (glycosyl) residues may be added enzymatically, a process known as glycosylation. The resulting proteins bearing covalently linked oligosaccharide side chains are known as glycosylated proteins or glycoproteins. Antibodies are glycoproteins with one or more carbohydrate residues in the Fe domain, as well as the variable domain. Carbohydrate residues in the Fe domain have important effect on the effector function of the Fe domain, with minimal effect on antigen binding or half-life of the antibody (R. Jefferis, <i>Biotechnol. Prog. </i>21 (2005), pp. 11-16). In contrast, glycosylation of the variable domain may have an effect on the antigen binding activity of the antibody. Glycosylation in the variable domain may have a negative effect on antibody binding affinity, likely due to steric hindrance (Co, M. S., et al., Mol. Immunol. (1993) 30:1361-1367), or result in increased affinity for the antigen (Wallick, S. C., et al., Exp. Med. (1988) 168:1099-11 09; Wright, A., et al., EMBO J. (1991) 10:2717 2723).</div>

One skilled in the art can generate such mutants using standard well-known technologies. Glycosylation site mutants that retain the biological activity but have increased or decreased binding activity are another object of the present invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0314]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0301" num="0314">In still another embodiment, the glycosylation of the antibody or antigens binding portion of the invention is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in PCT Publication W02003016466A2, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>

Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0316]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0303" num="0316">Protein glycosylation depends on the amino acid sequence of the protein of interest, as well as the host cell in which the protein is expressed. Different organisms may produce different glycosylation enzymes (e.g., glycosyltransferases and glycosidases), and have different substrates (nucleotide sugars) available. Due to such factors, protein glycosylation pattern, and composition of glycosyl residues, may differ depending on the host system in which the particular protein is expressed. Glycosyl residues useful in the invention may include, but are not limited to, glucose, galactose, mannose, fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. Preferably the glycosylated binding protein comprises glycosyl residues such that the glycosylation pattern is human.</div>

For instance, the efficacy of a therapeutic protein produced in a microorganism host, such as yeast, and glycosylated utilizing the yeast endogenous pathway may be reduced compared to that of the same protein expressed in a mammalian cell, such as a CHO cell line. Such glycoproteins may also be immunogenic in humans and show reduced half-life in vivo after administration. Specific receptors in humans and other animals may recognize specific glycosyl residues and promote the rapid clearance of the protein from the bloodstream. Other adverse effects may include changes in protein folding, solubility, susceptibility to proteases, trafficking, transport, compartmentalization, secretion, recognition by other proteins or factors, antigenicity, or allergenicity. Accordingly, a practitioner may prefer a therapeutic protein with a specific composition and pattern of glycosylation, for example glycosylation composition and pattern identical, or at least similar, to that produced in human cells or in the species-specific cells of the intended subject animal.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0318]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0305" num="0318">Expressing glycosylated proteins different from that of a host cell may be achieved by genetically modifying the host cell to express heterologous glycosylation enzymes.

For example, yeast strains have been genetically modified to express non-naturally occurring glycosylation enzymes such that glycosylated proteins (glycoproteins) produced in these yeast strains exhibit protein glycosylation identical to that of animal cells, especially human cells (U.S patent applications 20040018590 and 20020137134 and PCT publication WO2005100584 A2).</div>

An anti-Id antibody is an antibody, which recognizes unique determinants generally associated with the antigen-binding region of another antibody. The anti-Id can be prepared by immunizing an animal with the binding protein or a CDR containing region thereof. The immunized animal will recognize, and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing antibody and produce an anti-Id antibody. The anti-Id antibody may also be used as an “immunogen” to induce an immune response in yet another animal, producing a so-called anti-anti-Id antibody.</div>

Stabilizers can be used in both liquid and lyophilized dosage forms, principally 1-50 mM L-Methionine (optimally 5-10 mM). Other suitable bulking agents include glycine, arginine, can be included as 0-0.05% polysorbate-SO (optimally 0.005-0.01%). Additional surfactants include but are not limited to polysorbate 20 and BRIJ surfactants. The pharmaceutical composition comprising the antibodies and antibody-portions of the invention prepared as an injectable solution for parenteral administration, can further comprise an agent useful as an adjuvant, such as those used to increase the absorption, or dispersion of a therapeutic protein (e.g., antibody). A particularly useful adjuvant is hyaluronidase, such as Hylenex® (recombinant human hyaluronidase). Addition of hyaluronidase in the injectable solution improves human bioavailability following parenteral administration, particularly subcutaneous administration. It also allows for greater injection site volumes (i.e. greater than 1 ml) with less pain and discomfort, and minimum incidence of injection site reactions.

These include, for example, liquid, semi-solid and solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, liposomes and suppositories. The preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typical preferred compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions, such as compositions similar to those used for passive immunization of humans with other antibodies. The preferred mode of administration is parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular).

The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (i.e., antibody or antibody portion) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile, lyophilized powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and spray-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including, in the composition, an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.</div>

RGM A and RGM proteins have been described to be up-regulated at lesion sites in humans suffering from traumatic brain injury (Schwab et al., Arch. Neurol. 62: 1561-8, 2005a) in infarcted penumbra and core areas of the stroke-damaged human brain (Schwab et al., Arch. Neurol. 62: 1561-8, 2005a), in the substantia nigra of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (Bossers et al. Brain Pathology vol. 19: 91-107, 2008). Therefore RGM A antibodies are suitable agents for combinatorial therapy of cerebral stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders of the human nervous system. In stroke patients current treatment within the first three hours consists of delivery of tissue plasminogen activator for lysis of blood clots (Liang et al. Arch. Neural. 65: 1429-33, 2008) and such a treatment could in principle be combined with an RGM A antibody delivery which offers a different treatment approach and a far more extended therapeutic window. In Alzheimer's disease, drug combination with RGMA antibodies is possible with the approved cognition enhancers, Donepezil, Memantine and such an approach might significantly slow down the progressive neuropathology. Intranasal delivery of insulin has positive effects on attention and memory (Hanson and Frey, BMC Neurosci. 9: S5, 2008) and is a possible administration route for RGM A antibodies thereby bypassing the blood-brain-barrier. In Parkinson disease (PD) patients, current treatment is based mainly on dopaminergic agents like levodopa, a dopamine prodrug (Khor and Hsu, Curr. Clin. Pharmacal. 2: 234-43, 2007), ropinirole, a nonergolinic dopamine agonist (Jost et al. J. Neural. 255 Suppl. 5: 60-63, 2008), the monoamine oxidase B inhibitors Rasagiline and Selegiline (Elmer and Bertoni, Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 9: 2759-72, 2008). Despite their beneficial effects in early and mild PD none of these drugs is able to prevent the progressive degeneration of the substantia nigra and associated subcortical and cortical brain areas and a combination therapy with regeneration-stimulating RGM A antibodies could therefore slow down the disease process.</div>

The matrix carrying the coverslip was carefully turned upside down with the coverslip facing the bottom of the petri dish. Fc-conjugated full length inhibitory RGM A or fc-fragments or recombinant human RGM A (R&amp;D Systems Cat. #2459 RM) of it were mixed with 10 μl of an FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Fab-specific goat anti-mouse IgG, Sigma-Aldrich Cat. #F-4018) to visualize the RGM A stripes. Using a Hamilton syringe, 50 μl of the RGM A-FITC antibody solution is carefully injected through the inlet channel. Excess fluid left the matrix through the outlet channel and is removed with a Kleenex cloth. After incubation of the matrix-coverslip at 37° C. for 2 hours, the first coating solution (containing RGM A) was washed away with 100 μl of PBS. In the next step, the coverslip with the RGM A stripes was transferred to a 24 well plate, coated with 500 μl Collagen I (rat tail Collagen I, Becton Dickinson Biosciences Cat. #354236) to fill the empty spaces between the RGM A stripes and was incubated at 37° C. for 2 hours.

In the absence of the 5F9 MAB (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), neuronal SH-SY5Y cells show a clear preference for the Collagen I stripe with more than 90% of the cells preferring Collagen I stripes over hRGM A stripes. With increasing concentrations of MAB 5F9 neuronal SH-SY5Y cells prefer hRGM A stripes over Collagen I stripes (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B-8E</figref>). At the highest MAB concentration used (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>)), SH-SY5Y neurons show a strong preference for hRGM A stripes in comparison with the Collagen I stripes (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A, 8B, 8C, 8D and 8E</figref>). This can be interpreted as a unique characteristic of the 5F9 MAB since it transformed the inhibitory nature of RGM A in an attractive activity. In the presence of increasing concentrations of 5F9, neuronal cells prefer to migrate and grow on an RGM A substrate, and not on a permissive substrate like Collagen I.

After washing with Wash Buffer, a mixture of a biotinylated chimeric 5F9 (0.1 IJg/ml final concentration) and unlabeled competitor test antibody starting at 50 IJg/ml final concentration and serially diluted 5-fold) in 50 μl/well of ELISA buffer was added in duplicate. After incubating the plates for 1 hr at room temperature, and washing with Wash Buffer, bound antibodies were detected using 100 μl/well of 1:10,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Fitzgerald) in ELISA buffer. After incubating for 1 hr at room temperature, and washing with Wash Buffer, color development was performed by adding 100 μl/well of TMB Buffer (Zymed). After incubating for 15 min at room temperature, color development was stopped by adding 50 μl/well of 1 N hydrochloric acid. Absorbance was read at 490 nm.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0427]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0409" num="0427">The BIACORE assay (Biacore, Inc, Piscataway, N.J.) determines the affinity of antibodies with kinetic measurements of on-, off-rate constants. Binding of antibodies to recombinant purified human RGMA was determined by surface plasmon resonance-based measurements with a Biacore® 3000 instrument (Biacore® AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using running HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) at 25° C. All chemicals were obtained from Biacore® AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Approximately 5000 RU of goat anti-human IgG, (Fey), fragment specific polyclonal antibody (Pierce Biotechnology Inc, Rockford, Ill.) diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) was directly immobilized across a CM5 research grade biosensor chip using a standard amine coupling kit according to manufacturer's instructions and procedures at 25 μg/ml. Unreacted moieties on the biosensor surface were blocked with ethanolamine. Modified carboxymethyl dextran surface in flowcell 2 and 4 was used as a reaction surface. Unmodified carboxymethyl dextran without goat anti-human IgG in flow cell 1 and 3 was used as the reference surface. Purified antibodies were diluted in HEPES-buffered saline for capture across goat anti-humanIgG specific reaction surfaces. Human antibodies to be captured as a ligand (25 μg/ml) were injected over reaction matrices at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The association and dissociation rate constants, k<sub>on </sub>(unit M<sup>−1 </sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) and k<sub>off </sub>(unit s<sup>−1</sup>) were determined under a continuous flow rate of 25 μl/min. Rate constants were derived by making kinetic binding measurements at ten different antigen concentrations ranging from 0.39-50 nM. For kinetic analysis, rate equations derived from the 1:1 Langmuir binding model were fitted simultaneously to association and dissociation phases of all eight injections (using global fit analysis) with the use of Biaevaluation 4.0.1 software. The equilibrium dissociation constant (unit M) of the reaction between humanized antibodies and recombinant purified human RGMA was then calculated from the kinetic rate constants by the following formula: K<sub>D</sub>=k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>.</div>

</li> <heading id="h-0053">Example 10: The Humanised 5F9 Antibodies Neutralise Chemorepulsive Activity of Human RGM A in a Neuronal SH-SY5Y Chemotaxis Assay</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0428]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0411" num="0428">The chemotaxis assay measures chemotactic behaviour of cells in response to diffusible factors which can exert chemoattracticve or chemorepulsive activities. RGM A has been described as a protein acting in both membrane-bound (contact-dependent repulsion) and in soluble, diffusible form (chemorepulsive) and has therefore been evaluated in an hRGM A chemotaxis assay. To this aim RGM A-sensitive human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y, carrying the RGM receptor Neogenin were used (Schaffar et al. J. Neurochemistry: 107:_418-431, 2008). SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution/F12 (EBSS/F12) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% non-essential amino acids (MEM-NEAA). For induction of neurite outgrowth cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10 μM retinoic acid (RA). 5-6 hours later, cells were trypsinized and counted for plating in 24-well Boyden Chambers (BD Falcon 351185, HTS Multiwell System). 500 μl of the cell suspension (corresponding to 1×10<sup>5 </sup>cells) was added to the inner circle of each well. This inner circle is separated from the larger outer circle of each well by a PET membrane with 8 μm pore diameter. 600 μl of medium +/−RGM A +/−antibodies were pipetted into the outer circle and cells were cultivated in the Multiwell Boyden Chambers overnight at 37° C. After incubation medium was aspirated and replaced by the fixative (2% paraformaledhyde. Fixation was continued for 2 hours at room temperature and after several wash steps with PBS permeabilization was performed using PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X-1 00 (15 min, RT). Staining of cells was done by incubating them for 1 hour in the dark in a solution of Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin 1:100 (Invitrogen A12379) and Bisbenzimide (H332456) 1:100. After 2 wash steps with PBS, cultures were filled by PBS, sealed by parafilm and stored in the dark for the analysis with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0429]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0412" num="0429">In the absence of hRGM A cells migrate through the membrane pores and can be counted after fixation and staining. Only those cells are counted which attached to the bottom of the membrane, because these cells had migrated through the PET membrane. Cells on the upper side of the membrane were carefully removed before the fixation procedure. This chemotaxis assay proved that presence of hRGM A significantly reduced the number of SH-SY5Y cells migrating through the membrane by more than 80%. The rat monoclonal 5F9, the chimeric human-rat 5F9 and the humanised 5F9 but not an isotype control rat monoclonal antibody (p21) partially or completely neutralised chemorepulsive activity of hRGM A at 10 μg/ml, manifested as larger numbers of cells found at the bottom of the membrane (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>).</div>

The animals are kept in single cages on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. The optic nerve crush is performed always only at the left eye by minimal anterior surgery. This is a minimally invasive method of optic nerve injury and was developed by us, according to human anterior visual surgical methods. Before and during the operation procedure animals are anesthetized by inhalation anesthesia using Sevoflurane (Abbott GmbH Co. &amp; KG, Delkenheim, Germany) and are fixed on the operation table by using jawclamp and adhesive tape for the limbs. A drop in body temperature is prevented by mounting animals on a heating pad. For anterior crush surgery of the rat optic nerve, the left eye is carefully freed of ligament and connective tissue. As a first step, a microsurgical cut (2-3 mm) of the adjacent tissue in the outer corner of the eye is performed. Then the optic nerve is exposed by using a pair of forceps to move to the side the eye muscles and lacrimal gland, thus sparing it. At the next step, the meninges were longitudinally opened by using microscissors to expose the optic nerve.</div>

For local antibody application, small gelfoam pieces (length: 2.5 mm, width: 2.5 mm, height: 2.5 mm) were soaked with 20 μl of a 10 mg/ml antibody solution or with 20 μl of PBS and were placed directly adjacent to the optic nerve lesion site. After minimal invasive surgery and antibody application, animals were placed on paper towels in the clean cage mounted on the warmer to control the body temperature until they started to move. An ointment which contains antibiotic (Gentamytrex, Dr. Mann Pharma) was applied onto the eye to avoid bacterial infection and drying-out of the sclera. Carprofen (Rimadyl, 5 mg/kg, Pfizer GmbH, Karlsruhe) was applied i.p. for postoperative pain therapy directly after surgery and then twice per day for a 3 days period. The animals were observed and controlled regularly several hours directly after surgery and in the next days to make sure that all the animals survived and recovered from anesthesia and surgery. 5 weeks after surgery and antibody/vehicle application, animals were anesthesized with an overdose of Narcoren (40-60 mg/kg) and were perfused by injection of 4% paraformaledyde solution into the heart. Optic nerves were isolated and were transferred into a 4% paraformaldeyde solution for 1 h at room temperature to ensure proper fixation of the tissue. Following postfixation, rat optic nerves were stored over night in a 30% sucrose solution (4° C.).
