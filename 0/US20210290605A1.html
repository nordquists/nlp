<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions for administration to the urinary tract during urological diagnostic, interventional, surgical and other medical procedures and for therapeutic treatment of urologic structures.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Many urological procedures are now performed using minimally invasive endoscopic (e.g., cystoscopic or uteroscopic) techniques. These include examination of the urethra, bladder and ureters, therapeutic treatments for benign prostatic hypertrophy, removal or fragmentation of kidney and bladder stones, the placement of urethral or ureteral stents to facilitate the passage of stones, the performance of biopsies and the excision of tumors. While less invasive than open surgery, these techniques involve procedural irritation and trauma to the urinary tract leading to pain, inflammation and smooth muscle spasm. Postoperative lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) following urological procedures often include pain, hyperreflexia (unstable bladder contractions), urinary frequency, nocturia and urgency, and in some cases urinary retention requiring prolonged catheterization.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">For some surgical procedures, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), frequent urination and other symptoms resulting from the procedural irritation and inflammation may continue for a prolonged period, gradually resolving during the first six postoperative weeks. For urologic procedures employing a laser, postoperative complications such as inflammation and muscle spasm may continue for several weeks. Patients are frequently prescribed oral anticholinergic medication to inhibit postoperative spasm and reduce the severity of unstable contractions. However, not all patients respond adequately to these drugs, and side effects may lead to discontinuation of these medications.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Urological procedures are often performed with concurrent irrigation of the urinary tract, to remove blood and tissue debris so that a clear endoscopic field of view is maintained. Conventional irrigation solutions include saline, lactated Ringer's, glycine, sorbitol, manitol and sorbitol/manitol. These conventional irrigation solutions do not contain active pharmaceutical agents.</div>

</li> <heading id="h-0007">Pathophysiologic Effects of Urological Procedures</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0053]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0054" num="0053">The trauma of urological procedures results in an acute, localized inflammatory response in the associated urological structures. Inflammation is associated with a complex pattern of biochemical and cellular processes occurring at the local site, involving positive-feedback interactions between the peripheral nervous system, immune cells, the local vasculature and the central nervous system. The inflammatory response to procedural trauma in the urinary tract includes cytokine release, inflammatory cell migration, edema, pain and hyperalgesia.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0054]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0055" num="0054">In response to tissue injury, numerous local mediators are rapidly released, which result in nociceptive stimulation of sensory C-fibers. The inflammatory response triggered by peripheral injury shows that, in addition to cytokines, small G-protein receptor-linked inflammatory mediators also modulate the rapid pathophysiological response of the bladder and urethra. In models of urinary bladder inflammation, bradykinin, histamine, substance P (SP), leukotrienes and prostaglandins have been found to be released from the bladder. Lecci, A., et al., <i>Pharmacological Analysis of the Local and Reflex Responses to Bradykinin on Rat Urinary Bladder Motility in Vivo</i>, Br. J. Pharmacol., 114:708-14 (1995); Lecci, A., et al., <i>Capsaicin Pretreatment Does Not Alter Rat Urinary Bladder Motor Responses Induced by a Kinin B</i>1 <i>Receptor Agonist After Endotoxin Treatment</i>, Neurosci. Lett. 262:73-76 (1999); Vasko, M., et al., <i>Prostaglandin E</i>2 <i>Enhances Bradykinin</i>-<i>Stimulated Release of Neuropeptides from Rat Sensory Neurons in Culture</i>, J Neurosci. 14:4987-97 (1994). Certain inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and kinins, activate and sensitize C-fibers through interaction with specific receptors on nerve terminals. Other inflammatory mediators that have been described in the lower urinary tract include tachykinins and ATP (from C-fibers) (Maggi, C., et al., <i>Tachkykinin Antagonists and Capsaicin</i>-<i>Induced Contraction of the Rat Isolated Urinay Bladder: Evidence for Tachykinin Mediated Cotransmission</i>, Br. J. Pharmacol. 103:1535-41 (1991), CGRP (from C-fibers), serotonin (from mast cells and platelets), and endothelin. Maggi, C., et al., <i>Contractile Responses of the Human Urinary Bladder, Renal Pelvis and Renal Artery to Endothelins and Sarafotoxin S</i>6<i>b</i>, Gen. Pharmacol. 21:247-49 (1990). These mediators operate together in a synergistic manner to increase postsurgical hyperalgesia, inflammation and muscle spasm. The number of mediators involved in the response underscores the multifactorial origin of the pain and inflammation process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0055]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0056" num="0055">The immediate activation of the sensory nerves (primary hyperalgesia) triggers a cascade of processes that involves alterations in the local vasculature, and influences muscle contractility. Capsaicin-sensitive afferent fiber stimulation elicits a local efferent response, which is characterized by release of neuropeptides (tachykinins and CGRP) from nerve endings. This release produces a number of local responses, which are part of the pathophysiological effects in the lower urinary tract. These include: (1) direct effects of released neurotransmitters on smooth muscle contraction; (2) changes in microvascular permeability resulting in plasma extravasation and edema of the bladder, urethra and prostate; (3) infiltration of immune cells; and (4) sensitization of nociceptors (secondary hyperalgesia) resulting in increased pain. The consequences of these processes can affect normal bladder capacity and frequency of micturition, and often result in hypersensitivity, pain and smooth muscle spasm.</div>

Human bladder mucosa has been found to contain several types of prostaglandins, which have been shown to contract the human detrusor. Prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) is a potent mediator of pain and edema, and the exogenous administration of PGE<sub>2 </sub>induces contractile responses in inflamed bladders. Intravesical PGE<sub>2 </sub>produces both urgency and involuntary bladder contractions. Lepor, H., <i>The Pathophysiology of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in the Ageing Male Population</i>, Br. J Urol., 81 Suppl 1:29-33 (1998); Maggi, C., et al., <i>Prostanoids Modulate Reflex Micturition by Acting Through Capsaicin</i>-<i>Sensitive Afferents</i>, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 145: 105-12 (1988). PGE2 given intravesically may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and/or immediately below the urothelium. Ishizuka, O, et al., <i>Prostaglandin E</i>2-<i>Induced Bladder Hyperactivity in Normal, Conscious Rats: Involvement of Tachykinins?</i>, J Urol. 153:2034-38 (1995). Prostanoids may, via release of tachykinins, contribute to both urge and bladder hyperactivity seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract. While not wishing to be limited by theory, these actions are most likely mediated through activation of specific prostanoid receptor subtypes (EP1R) located on C-fibers and on bladder smooth muscle (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0058]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0059" num="0058">In the inflamed bladder, the basal production of PGE2 is significantly higher than in control conditions. A number of inflammatory mediators acting through GPCR pathways that are linked to the production of arachidonic acid may up-regulate prostaglandin levels in the mucosa and vascular endothelium. Bradykinin is a well-established mediator of inflammation, and bradykinin receptor agonists stimulate greater PGE<sub>2 </sub>production in inflamed bladders than in control bladders. Topical application of bradykinin activates bladder sensory nerves. Lecci, A., et al., <i>Kinin B</i>1 <i>Receptor</i>-<i>Mediated Motor Responses in Normal or Inflamed Rat Urinary Bladder in Vivo</i>, Regul. Pept. 80:41-47 (1999); Maggi, C., et al., <i>Multiple Mechanisms in the Motor Responses of the Guinea</i>-<i>Pig Isolated Urinary Bladder to Bradykinin</i>, Br. J. Pharmacol. 98:619-29 (1989). Contractile responses elicited by the selective B1 and B2 receptor agonists tested in isolated rat urinary bladder strips showed that the contractile responses to a selective B1 agonist were also potentiated in inflamed bladders. The role of bradykinin in reflex voiding has also been investigated in normal rats using continuous infusion cystometry. Infusion of bradykinin produced a significant decrease in the intercontraction interval (ICI) between voiding events and an increase in bladder contraction amplitude that is completely blocked by a B2 receptor antagonist.</div>

In normal bladders, activation of B2 receptors evokes bladder contraction mediated by COX-1 activity, whereas COX-2 activity is involved in production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>driven through stimulation of B1 receptors only. COX-2 is the major isoform that is rapidly expressed and dramatically up-regulated during bladder inflammation. It is believed to be responsible for the high levels of prostanoids released during acute and chronic inflammation of the bladder. COX-2 is up-regulated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and bladder treatment with either endotoxin or cyclophosphamide.

The tone of the urinary bladder smooth muscle is regulated by numerous contraction-promoting receptor systems. They include well established systems such as muscarinic, purinergic and tachykinin receptors [Anderson, K., et al., <i>Pharmacolgy of the Lower Urinary Tract: Basis for Current and Future Treatments for Urinary Incontenance </i>Pharmacol Rev. 56:581-631 (2004)], and also include endothelin receptors [Afiatpour, P., et al., <i>Development Changes in the Functional, Biochemical and Molecular Properties of Rat Bladder Endothelin Receptors</i>, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 367:462-72 (2003)], protease-activated receptors and bradykinin receptors [Kubota, Y., et al., <i>Role of Mitochondria in the Generation of Spontaneous Activity in Detrusor Smooth Muscles of the Guinea Pig Bladder</i>, J.

Because many of these receptors are prototypically coupled via G<sub>q </sub>proteins to the activation of a phospholipase C (PLC), it is likely that bladder contraction elicited by such receptors is partly mediated by PLC-linked mobilization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores [Ouslander, J. G., <i>Management of Overactive Bladder</i>, N. Engl. J. Med., 350:786-99 (2004)].</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0075]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0076" num="0075">Neurally mediated contractions of the bladder and urethral smooth muscle require mobilization of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>as well as an influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Ca<sup>2+ </sup>entry through L-type calcium channels can contribute to muscle contractions by triggering the intracellular release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which opens ryanodine-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Opening of L-type calcium channels in bladder muscle also serves to replace intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores after contraction. Recent studies conclude that muscarinic receptor subtype signaling mediated via carbachol-induced contraction of rat bladders largely depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type calcium channels and, perhaps, PLD, PLA<sub>2 </sub>and store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.

Thus, blockade of L-type Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels has the potential to depress neural, urothelial and smooth muscle evoked contractions of bladder strips mediated by a multiplicity of endogenous GPCR agonists.

Bradykinin was chosen as the activating agonist for testing in this system because its actions on the rat bladder tissue system have been well characterized and because its role as a proinglammatory agent in acute pathophysiology has been studied. Bradykinin is also known to stimulate contraction of smooth muschle of the bladder when delivered intravesically by activation of B1 and B2 receptor subtypes.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0112]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0114" num="0112">Acute, localized inflammatory responses in the lower urinary tract, including spasm, are triggered by surgical trauma. In response to tissue injury, multiple inflammatory mediators, including bradykinin and Substance P (SP) are released into the bladder. Exogenous application of these pro-inflammatory peptides or activation of bladder nerves can trigger the production of prostaglandins (PGs) in the bladder. The aim of this study was to characterize the time course of production of PGs in response to an inflammatory mediator and evaluate the effects of COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors on bladder tissue contractility in vitro and in vivo. The rat bladder tissue strip system represents a well established system for characterization of the pharmacological actions on numerous agents on smooth muscle bladder contractility [Edwards, G., et al., <i>Comparison of the Effects of Several Potassium</i>-<i>Channel Openers on Rat Bladder and Rat Portal Vein In Vitro</i>, Br.

Each strip was connected to an isometric transducer (Harvard, #50-7293) and two-pen recorder and allowed to equilibrate for 60 minutes. Before starting the experiment, mounted tissues were validated for acceptance by challenge with 100 μM of methoxamine to obtain a minimum of 1 g tension, which was considered as 100%. Qualified tissues were washed repeatedly every 15 minutes for 60 minutes. A cumulative contraction-response curve to bradykinin was then generated through application of 3 concentrations of bradykinin (0.01 μM, 0.1 μM and 1 μM) at 1 minute intervals for a total of 3 minutes. The tissue was subsequently washed periodically until tension returned to baseline value. Two hours later, the ability to inhibit the bradykinin cumulative dose response (0.01 μM, 0.1 μM and 1 μM) after a 10 minute pretreatment with ketoprofen was determined. Each concentration of test substance was tested in four separate preparations.</div>

At the lowest concentration of nifedipine and ketoprofen tested, 0.1 μM and 0.3 μM respectively, 38% reduction of the maximal control tension was observed (Table 4). Increasing concentrations of ketoprofen (1.0 and 3.0 μM) in the presence of the same concentration of nifedipine further decreased the maximal contractile tension such that only 30 and 23.4% of the control tension remained, respectively. All concentration-response curves for bradykinin shifted to the right in the presence of nifedipine and ketoprofen (0.3-3.0 μM), with the greatest effect seen at the highest ketoprofen concentration. This combination was accompanied by a 1.0 log unit shift in the pEC<sub>50 </sub>versus control. The changes in the EC<sub>50 </sub>parameter did not appear correlated with changes in maximal tension. The results are presented graphically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which compares the control group and the group having a constant concentration of 0.1 μM nifedipine with a range of concentrations of ketoprofen. The percent of contraction for each drug combination is expressed as the percent of the maximal response for the bradykinin control. The overall pattern of inhibition predominantly reflects a substantial decrease in maximal tension, demonstrating that the combination of nifedipine and ketoprofen act together in combination mechanistically in a non-competitive antagonist manner towards bradykinin-induced contractions.</div>

Combinations utilizing the higher concentration of nifedipine (0.3 μM) resulted in a greater reduction in the maximal tension relative to the corresponding concentrations of ketoprofen in the presence of 0.1 μM nifedipine. The maximal tension levels for 0.3 μM nifedipine combinations were determined for three combinations, in concentration ratios of nifedipine: ketoprofen of 1:1, 1:3.3 and 1:10.

The greatest change was evident at the lowest ketoprofen concentration, 0.3 μM, which decreased from 62.11 to 36.41%. The higher concentrations of ketoprofen resulted in an even greater reduction in tension, such that only 16% remained at 3.0 μM. Associated with these changes in tension, a similar shift in the EC<sub>50 </sub>relative to the control of 0.5 log units was evident for all ketoprofen concentrations at this nifedipine concentration, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As in the case of 0.1 μM nifedipine, no apparent differences between the EC<sub>50 </sub>values for this concentration of nifedipine were evident. Small differences in the Hill slopes for bradykinin agonist responses over the range of inhibitor concentrations were not significant. The effect of increasing ketoprofen concentrations in the combination treatment on the concentration-response curves is similar to the graph of the data at 0.1 μM nifedipine and various ketoprofen concentrations. These graphical data also show the non-competitive nature of the antagonism of the BK-response, which is seen for the combination at this higher concentration of nifedipine.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0138]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0145" num="0138">The concentrations of the two agents (nifedipine and ketoprofen) used in this combination experiment represent independent variables. The maximal tension is an effect that results from the combination and is the response variable of primary interest for the response surface analysis. The relationship between the drug combinations and the response variable can be represented in a three-dimensional plot in which the concentrations are plotted as Cartesian coordinates in the x-y-plane, and the response variable (e.g., maximal tension) is plotted as the vertical distance above the planar point. The collection of spatial points plotted in this way provides a view that represents the combined concentration-response relationship. The advantages of this experimental design method include the fact that the biological response measured is not limited to a specific response (effect) level of the system. In this way, a number of fixed-ratio concentration combinations can be tested over a wide range of concentrations to define the interaction efficacy of the two drugs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0139]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0146" num="0139">As in the case of single drug concentration-biological effect relationships in which a smooth curve (or line) may be best fit to the data according to a specific model, a smooth surface may be fit to the data in a three-dimensional plot of a two-drug combination concentration-response relationship. This surface represents the additivity or interaction of the combination. The graph of this response surface becomes the reference surface for viewing actual combination effects and allows the visualization and prediction of effects in regions of the curve for which no data could be generated.</div>

The combination response curve drops steeply with increasing concentrations of both ketoprofen and nifedipine. The surface becomes fairly flat as the maximal response is obtained as concentrations approach 1 μM nifedipine +3 μM ketoprofen. The concentration combination that results in 90% maximal inhibition of the effect of bradykinin is 3 μM of ketoprofen +1 μM of nifedipine.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0042">4. Discussion</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0141]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0148" num="0141">The study of this Example III evaluated the effects of nifedipine in combination with ketoprofen using bradykinin as an agonist to stimulate smooth muscle contraction. Bradykinin was used in the rat bladder tissue strip assay system (Examples I-III) to serve as an endogenous mediator of contraction. The overall pattern of inhibition seen with all combinations of nifedipine and ketoprofen concentrations was characteristic of non-competitive antagonism. Nifedipine, which prevents the influx of calcium ions through the cell membrane by acting on L-type voltage-dependent channels, attenuates the bradykinin receptor activated contraction of smooth muscle without directly inhibiting the receptor. As a single agent, nifedipine inhibition was shown above (Example II) to cause a reduction in the maximum bradykinin responses that were not accompanied by statistically significant changes in the agonist potency of the remaining response.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0142]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0149" num="0142">This study revealed the surprising finding that the magnitude of the inhibition is greatly enhanced by the addition of ketoprofen at the lowest nifedipine concentration tested and is evident at all concentrations of the combinations tested. At low concentrations of nifedipine, this inhibition is more than additive, i.e., synergistic in nature. In contrast, ketoprofen treatment alone at the same concentrations was observed to not decrease maximal contractile tension, with no significant effect on the EC<sub>50 </sub>values for the nine combinations and no concentration dependence upon ketoprofen. Thus, this synergistic interaction on maximal tension and lack of strong effect upon the EC<sub>50 </sub>was an unexpected result based on the study of ketoprofen action when tested as a single agent in this test system.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0143]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0150" num="0143">Taken together, these data indicate that the effects of the proinflammatory agonist, bradykinin, can be in part mediated by the simultaneous activation of L-type calcium channels and the induction of arachidonic metabolites that together augment smooth muscle contraction. While not wishing to be limited by theory, this effect may be due to a positive feedback loop that operates at a cellular and tissue level. Prostaglandins generated intracellularly as a result of bradykinin receptor activation may move to the extracellular environment, where they may interact and in turn activate prostanoid receptors subtypes. There are at least four known prostanoid receptor subtypes, termed EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4. Of these subtypes, EP1 receptors are believed to be coupled through G proteins to stimulation of phophoinositide hydrolysis and/or PLC-independent influx of calcium. EP1 receptors have been previously identified in smooth muscle, where they can function to mediate contractile activity. Hence, the discovery of the combined synergistic actions of ketoprofen and nifedipine on contractile activity may be a result of simultaneous blockade of calcium mobilization and the concurrent inhibition of a positive-feedback loop involving PGE<sub>2 </sub>driven activation of prostanoid receptors.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0144]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0151" num="0144">In conclusion, each combination of nifedipine and ketoprofen showed a greater inhibition of maximal bradykinin-induced contraction compared to either drug alone in the rat bladder tissue strip assay. Furthermore, the multiple combinations of nifedipine and ketoprofen tested allowed a response surface analysis to define optimal concentrations. A fixed ratio combination containing 3.0 μM ketoprofen and 1.0 μM nifedipine was identified that produced ˜90% inhibition.</div>

<heading id="h-0044">Inhibition by Nifedipine and Ketoprofen of Multiple Agonist-Induced Contractile Tension and Release of PGE<sub>2 </sub>in Rat Bladder Tissue</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0145]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0152" num="0145">The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ketoprofen and nifedipine on rat bladder contractility and agonist-stimulated PGE<sub>2 </sub>production using multiple agonists. Bradykinin, substance P, histamine and ATP are endogenous mediators that can be released as part of the acute inflammatory response and activate bradykinin receptors (B1 and B2 subtypes), tachykinin receptors (NK<sub>1-3</sub>) and histamine receptors (all subtypes) and purinergic P2X and P2Y receptors, respectively. Carbamylcholine is an agonist that may activate muscle and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine subtypes or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors subtypes (M<sub>1-5</sub>) present in the bladder, while methoxamine is specific for α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors. The first objective was to evaluate the effect of ketoprofen (10 μM) and nifedipine (1 μM) individually, each at a fixed concentration, on contractile tension induced by each of the six agonists (bradykinin, substance P, carbamylcholine, methoxamine, histamine and ATP) in the rat bladder tissue strip model. The second objective was to determine the amount of PGE<sub>2 </sub>released from the bladder tissue in response to stimulation by each agonist in the presence of either ketoprofen or nifedipine during the same test conditions employed to measure contractile smooth muscle tension.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0146]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0153" num="0146">Bladder tissue strips from Wistar derived rats were prepared, transduced and equilibrated using the bladder strip contractility method described in Example I above. Either 10 μM ketoprofen or 1.0 μM nifedipine was pre-incubated individually with the tissue for a period of 10 minutes prior to stimulation with the following agonists at a concentration equivalent to its respective ED<sub>75 </sub>for stimulation of tension: 0.03 μM bradykinin; 0.03 μM substance P; 3.0 μM carbochol; 30 μM methoxamine; 25 μM histamine; and 20 μM ATP. Antagonist activity for a given concentration of an antagonist (nifedipine or ketoprofen) was determined as the ability of that concentration of the antagonist to reduce the noted agonist-induced (e.g., 0.03 M bradykinin-induced) response by 50 percent or more (≥50%). Each concentration of antagonist was tested in four separate tissue preparations.</div>

PGE<sub>2 </sub>produced after 30 minutes of treatment with each agonist (e.g., 0.03 μM bradykinin) in the absence and presence of the test compounds was determined. An initial 1.0 ml sample was taken from the tissue bath after a 30 minute incubation with the agonist. Subsequently, the tissue was washed using 10 ml of Krebs solution every 15 minutes for a 2 hour period. The test compound was added and pre-incubated for a period of 10 minutes prior to re-challenge with the same agonist. After an additional 30 minute period in the presence of the test antagonist and agonist, 1.0 ml was removed from the bath for analysis. The release of PGE<sub>2 </sub>from urinary bladder strips was measured using a specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Samples were frozen immediately and stored at −4° C. until assay. The bladder strips were dried gently by blotting, and then weighed. Results are expressed as picograms of PGE<sub>2 </sub>released per milligram tissue.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0148]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0155" num="0148">All of the agonists investigated stimulated contraction of the bladder tissue strips, independent of their mechanism of action, demonstrating that multiple mediators can increase bladder smooth muscle contractile tension. Nifedipine (1 μM) produced a significant inhibition (&gt;67%) of each agonist-induced increase in contractile tension (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The contractile response to bradykinin was affected by both nifedipine and ketoprofen (81% inhibition and 67% inhibition, respectively). In contrast, the increase in contractile tension induced by substance P, carbamylcholine and ATP was not affected by ketoprofen. Ketoprofen also only slightly reduced the tension for methoxamine and histamine (&lt;25%).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0149]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0156" num="0149">Bradykinin evoked the largest increase in PGE<sub>2 </sub>relative to the other agonists tested. This evoked release was effectively inhibited by ketoprofen (81%) but minimally affected by pre-treatment with nifedipine (12%) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). Thus, the extent of inhibition of smooth muscle tension by nifedipine was not linked to agonist-induced PGE<sub>2 </sub>responses and was distinct from the effect of ketoprofen. The absolute bladder levels of PGE<sub>2 </sub>produced in response to stimulation by other GPCR agonists were about 10-fold less than those seen with bradykinin.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0150]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0157" num="0150">In summary, the current study indicated that an increase in smooth muscle contractile tension can be induced by a variety of GPCR agonists in bladder tissue. Moreover, a common signaling mechanism for these agents is mediated in part through activation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the rat urinary bladder. Nifedipine's inhibition of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels suggests an effective mechanism for inhibition of numerous pathophysiological mediators that can lead to increased smooth muscle bladder tension associated with spasm or hyperactivity. Ketoprofen inhibited bradykinin-stimulated PGE<sub>2 </sub>production and release from the bladder while nifedipine did not exhibit an effect on this response. Thus, nifedipine and ketoprofen act through distinct mechanisms to inhibit smooth muscle contractile tension and release of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins in bladder tissue.</div>

In this model, acute inflammation of the bladder is produced by using 0.2% acetic acid in saline as the bladder perfusion fluid and cystometry under anesthesia is performed after a recovery period from the surgical procedure. A regular interval of voiding cycles can be seen for several hours after the initial stabilization period occurs. A bladder catheter connected to an infusion pump was used to deliver the drug solutions directly to the bladder at a constant, defined rate.</div>

The following cystometry parameters were monitored: intercontraction interval (ICI), trigger pressure (TP), micturition pressure (MP) and micturition volume (MV) using a Med Associates Cystometry Station and software program. Only rats that displayed normal and stable cystometry profiles during the preliminary saline-infusion stage (not less than 15 min of baseline stabilization followed by 7 regular representative ICI intervals) were included in the study. Following the saline period, the rat bladder was infused with test agent in saline containing 0.2% acetic acid for 20 min followed by the collection of 7 representative ICI intervals for analysis. Due to the fixed concentrations of the irrigation solutions employed in the study and the use of constant perfusion rates for fixed constant times, a fixed, uniform dose of each agent was delivered to all animals.</div>

Following the addition of the 0.2% acetic acid to the perfusion buffer, rapid contractions appeared, resulting in a significant decrease in the ICI. Increases in contractile pressure accompanied the shortening of time between the bladder contractions in many cases as well. These changes in functional bladder responses could be routinely measured following perfusion of the bladder with acidified saline, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.

At the 60 min time point, the perfusion with 10 μM ketoprofen was stopped and normal saline irrigation was continued for an additional 30 min period. For the group of four out of six rats which showed peak plasma levels of about 5 ng/ml, plasma levels decreased at 75 and 90 minutes following cessation of ketoprofen perfusion.

As in the case of the ketoprofen only group, the perfusion with the combination was stopped and normal saline irrigation was continued for an additional 30 minute period.

Although small differences are apparent in the earliest phase of the time-course, no significant differences were observed either in the peak levels or in the absorption kinetics for the ketoprofen plasma levels in the combination group versus the ketoprofen alone group after 30 minutes, or in the peak levels, indicating that no apparent ketoprofen-nifedipine drug interactions were present.</div>

</li> <heading id="h-0055">3. Discussion</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0169]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0176" num="0169">Using a method of intravesical perfusion for local drug delivery, the drugs tested in this study were directly in contact with the absorptive site within the bladder. The continuous perfusion maintained constant drug concentrations of either ketoprofen, nifedipine or the combination within the bladder during the period of drug delivery. Under these conditions, minimal systemic exposure to the drugs occurred in female rats during a 1 hour intravesical perfusion. Low levels of each drug were detectable within the first 15 min interval measured, and absorption progressed gradually as an approximately linear function over time of drug perfusion for each agent.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0170]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0177" num="0170">The locally delivered drugs and drug combination were exposed to the structures of the bladder, including the uroepithelium, C-fiber afferents, afferents and smooth muscle. The data obtained in the study show that this action is local and cannot be ascribed to systemic effect that could be mediated through central nervous system mechanisms because the initial levels in the plasma for both drugs tested are so low.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0171]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0178" num="0171">Comparison of the plasma levels for each agent tested to known human levels associated with normal oral dosing reveals the magnitude of the difference observed. In the combination treatment group, the maximal levels for ketoprofen were about 400-fold less than the peak plasma levels (C<sub>max</sub>) in humans that are associated with the acceptable therapeutic daily dose of ketoprofen (rat mean ketoprofen plasma level of 9.29+2.13 ng/ml at 60 min). For comparison, the accepted daily mean peak C<sub>max </sub>for a single 200 mg ketoprofen tablet (a single oral dose) is 3900 ng/ml. Similarly, peak levels observed for nifedipine were approximately 15 ng/ml to 25 ng/ml. The maximal levels (C<sub>max</sub>) typically occurred at the end of 60 min drug perfusion period or within the following 30 min sampling period. For comparison with known plasma levels from conventional oral dosing, the accepted daily C<sub>max </sub>for a single 10 mg immediate release nifedipine tablet is reported to be 79+44 ng/ml. Systemic exposure was comparable for ketoprofen plasma levels whether administered alone or with nifedipine. Similarly, nifedipine plasma levels were comparable whether administered alone or with ketoprofen.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0172]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0179" num="0172">This study also determined the PGE<sub>2 </sub>content of the bladder for each of the treatment conditions in the study. An additional finding of significance is the long-lasting effect of ketoprofen that was measured in the assay of whole bladder PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels. The low concentrations of the ketoprofen treatment alone or the combination treatment during bladder perfusion significantly inhibited PGE<sub>2 </sub>formed in bladder tissue relative to the nifedipine treatment group. The PGE<sub>2 </sub>bladder tissue levels in the presence of ketoprofen were not significantly different from those following treatment with the combination. Because delivery of the drug was stopped at 60 minutes in this study, and then saline was used to irrigate for an additional 30 minutes, this showed that PGE<sub>2 </sub>inhibition remained active in the post-drug delivery period. Thus, ketoprofen demonstrated an extended period of anti-inflammatory activity in this model of local, intravesical drug delivery.</div>
