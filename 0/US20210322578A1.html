<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the fields of oncology and virology. More particularly, it concerns poxviruses, specifically including oncolytic vaccinia viruses suitable for the treatment of cancer.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">III. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Normal tissue homeostasis is a highly regulated process of cell proliferation and cell death. An imbalance of either cell proliferation or cell death can develop into a cancerous state (Solyanik et al., 1995; Stokke et al., 1997; Mumby and Walter, 1991; Natoli et al., 1998; Magi-Galluzzi et al., 1998). For example, cervical, kidney, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, and brain cancer are just a few examples of the many cancers that can result (Erlandsson, 1998; Kolmel, 1998; Mangray and King, 1998; Mougin et al., 1998). In fact, the occurrence of cancer is so high that over 500,000 deaths per year are attributed to cancer in the United States alone.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The maintenance of cell proliferation and cell death is at least partially regulated by proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. A proto-oncogene or tumor suppressor can encode proteins that induce cellular proliferation (e.g., sis, erbB, src, ras and myc), proteins that inhibit cellular proliferation (e.g., Rb, p16, p19, p21, p53, NF1 and WT1) or proteins that regulate programmed cell death (e.g., bcl-2) (Ochi et al., 1998; Johnson and Hamdy, 1998; Liebermann el al., 1998). However, genetic rearrangements or mutations of these proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors result in the conversion of a proto-oncogene into a potent cancer-causing oncogene or of a tumor suppressor into an inactive polypeptide. Often, a single point mutation is enough to achieve the transformation. For example, a point mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor protein results in the complete loss of wild-type p53 function (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 1992).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, there are few effective options for the treatment of many common cancer types. The course of treatment for a given individual depends on the diagnosis, the stage to which the disease has developed and factors such as age, sex, and general health of the patient. The most conventional options of cancer treatment are surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Surgery plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Typically, a surgical approach is required for biopsy and to remove cancerous growth. However, if the cancer has metastasized and is widespread, surgery is unlikely to result in a cure and an alternate approach must be taken.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are the most common alternatives to surgical treatment of cancer (Mayer, 1998; Ohara, 1998; Ho et al., 1998). Radiation therapy involves a precise aiming of high energy radiation to destroy cancer cells and much like surgery, is mainly effective in the treatment of non-metastasized, localized cancer cells. Side effects of radiation therapy include skin irritation, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, hair loss, and loss of energy (Curran, 1998; Brizel, 1998). Chemotherapy, the treatment of cancer with anti-cancer drugs, is another mode of cancer therapy, and most chemotherapy approaches include the combination of more than one anti-cancer drug, which has proven to increase the response rate of a wide variety of cancers (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,824,348; 5,633,016 and 5,798,339, incorporated herein by reference). However, a major side effect of chemotherapy drugs is that they also affect normal tissue cells, with the cells most likely to be affected being those that divide rapidly in some cases (e.g., bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, reproductive system and hair follicles). Other toxic side effects of chemotherapy drugs can include sores in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, bleeding, hair loss, and infection.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Immunotherapy, a rapidly evolving area in cancer research, is yet another option for the treatment of certain types of cancers. Theoretically, the immune system may be stimulated to identify tumor cells as being foreign and targets them for destruction. Unfortunately, the response typically is not sufficient to prevent most tumor growth. However, recently there has been a focus in the area of immunotherapy to develop methods that augment or supplement the natural defense mechanism of the immune system. Examples of immunotherapies currently under investigation or in use are immune adjuvants (e.g., <i>Mycobacterium bovis, Plasmodium falciparum</i>, dinitrochlorobenzene and aromatic compounds) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,801,005 and 5,739,169; Hui and Hashimoto, 1998; Christodoulides et al., 1998), cytokine therapy (e.g., interferons (IL-1, GM-CSF and TNF) (Bukowski et al., 1998; Davidson et al., 1998; Hellstrand et al., 1998), and gene therapy (e.g., TNF, IL-1, IL-2, p53) (Qin et al., 1998; Austin-Ward and Villaseca, 1998; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,830,880 and 5,846,945) and monoclonal antibodies (e.g., anti-ganglioside GM2, anti-HER-2, anti-p185) (Pietras et al., 1998; Hanibuchi et al., 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,311). Such methods, while showing some promise, have demonstrated limited success.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Replication-selective oncolytic viruses hold promise for the treatment of cancer (Kim et al., 2001). These viruses can cause tumor cell death through direct replication-dependent and/or viral gene expression-dependent oncolytic effects (Kim et al., 2001). In addition, viruses are able to enhance the induction of cell-mediated antitumor immunity within the host (Todo et al., 2001; Sinkovics et al, 2000). These viruses also can be engineered to expressed therapeutic transgenes within the tumor to enhance antitumoral efficacy (Hermiston, 2000).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">However, major limitations exist to this therapeutic approach. Although a degree of natural tumor-selectivity can be demonstrated for some virus species, new approaches are still needed to engineer and/or enhance tumor-selectivity for oncolytic viruses in order to maximize safety. This selectivity will become particularly important when intravenous administration is used, and when potentially toxic therapeutic genes are added to these viruses to enhance antitumoral potency; gene expression will need to be tightly limited in normal tissues. In addition, increased antitumoral potency through additional mechanisms such as induction of antitumoral immunity or targeting of the tumor-associated vasculature is highly desirable</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, more effective and less toxic therapies for the treatment of cancer are needed. The use of oncolytic viruses presents a potential area for development, however, the limitations discussed above need to be overcome. The present invention addresses these limitations.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the invention are directed to methods that include administration of a thymidine kinase deficient vaccinia virus. The methods include administering the vaccinia virus at increased viral concentrations. In certain aspects, the methods include inducing oncolysis or collapse of tumor vasculature in a subject having a tumor comprising administering to said subject at least 1×10<sup>8 </sup>infective viral particles of a TK-deficient, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-expressing, replication-competent vaccinia virus vector sufficient to induce oncolysis of cells in the tumor. Preferably, the virus vector has an expression region with a promoter directing expression of a nucleic acid encoding human GM-CSF. In a further aspect of the invention, the methods can exclude pre-treatment of a subject with a vaccinia vaccine, e.g., a subject need not be vaccinated 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more days, weeks, months, or years before administering the therapy described herein. In some aspects, non-injected tumors or cancer will be infected with the therapeutic virus, thus treating a patient by both local administration and systemic dissemination. In some aspects, the virus vector is administered intravascularly, i.e. intravenously or intraarterially.</div>

It is contemplated that a single dose of virus refers to the amount administered to a subject or a tumor over a 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 24 hour period. The dose may be spread over time or by separate injection. Typically, multiple doses are administered to the same general target region, such as in the proximity of a tumor or in the case of intravenous administration a particular entry point in the blood stream or lymphatic system of a subject. In certain aspects, the viral dose is delivered by injection apparatus comprising a needle providing multiple ports in a single needle or multiple prongs coupled to a syringe, or a combination thereof. In a further aspect, multiple doses (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more doses) of the vaccinia virus are administered to the subject, for example, wherein a second treatment occurs within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days or weeks of a first treatment, or wherein the second treatment occurs within 2 weeks of the first treatment. In a related aspect, multiple doses of the vaccinia virus are administered to the subject over a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more days or weeks.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0070]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0071" num="0070">The present invention concerns the use of oncolytic poxviruses for the treatment of cancer. In particular, the use of a vaccinia virus expressing GM-CSF to achieve a particular degree of oncolysis is described. In another embodiment, a GM-CSF-expressing poxvirus can be engineered to be more effective or more efficient at killing cancer cells and/or be less toxic or damaging to non-cancer cells, by mutation or modification of gene products such that the alterations render the viruses better able to infect the host, less toxic to host cells, and/or better able to infect cancer cells. A particular modification is to render the virus deficient in thymidine kinase (TK) function.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0071]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0072" num="0071">The present invention also concerns the intravenous administration of GM-CSF-expressing poxviruses to treat both primary tumors and distant metastases. The inventors have demonstrated that two different GM-CSF-expressing poxviruses were well-tolerated intravenously and highly effective against disseminated tumors and metastases. In addition, a GM-CSF-expressing poxvirus had significantly better efficacy against both primary tumors and lung metastases than its non-GM-CSF-expressing control after intravenous administration. Also, this virus had significantly better efficacy against both primary tumors and lung metastases than a comparable virus (Wyeth vaccine strain) despite an additional deletion in the vgf gene not present in the other virus. Therefore, intravenous administration with a vaccinia expressing human GM-CSF resulted in significantly better efficacy over the same vaccinia without GM-CSF, and intravascular administration of a WR strain deletion mutant expressing human GM-CSF was significantly better than a standard vaccine strain expressing GM-CSF. These viruses were well-tolerated after intravenous administration to both tumor-bearing (rats and rabbits) and normal animals (rabbits). Treated animals did not lose weigh while tumor-bearing animals that did not receive treatment lost weight. Survival was increased following intravenous treatment. No significant organ toxicity was noted by blood testing or histopathology. The only reproducible histopathological findings were multiple sites of lymphoid hyperplasia that were noted following treatment (consistent with systemic immunostimulation). No significant toxicities were noted on histopathology. Therefore, these GM-CSF expressing poxviruses are well-tolerated at doses that were highly effective against systemic cancer.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0007">I. Poxviruses</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0072]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0073" num="0072">Poxviruses have been known for centuries, with the characteristic pock marks produced by variola virus (smallpox) giving this family its name. It appears that smallpox first emerged in China and the Far East over 2000 years ago. Fortunately, this often fatal virus has now been eradicated, with the last natural outbreak occurring in 1977 in Somalia.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0073]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0074" num="0073">The poxvirus viral particle is oval or brick-shaped, measuring some 200-400 nm long. The external surface is ridged in parallel rows, sometimes arranged helically. The particles are extremely complex, containing over 100 distinct proteins. The extracellular forms contain two membranes (EEV—extracellular enveloped virions), whereas intracellular particles only have an inner membrane (IMV—intracellular mature virions). The outer surface is composed of lipid and protein that surrounds the core, which is composed of a tightly compressed nucleoprotein. Antigenically, poxviruses are also very complex, inducing both specific and cross-reacting antibodies. There are at least ten enzymes present in the particle, mostly concerned with nucleic acid metabolism/genome replication.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0074]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0075" num="0074">The genome of the poxvirus is linear double-stranded DNA of 130-300 Kbp. The ends of the genome have a terminal hairpin loop with several tandem repeat sequences. Several poxvirus genomes have been sequenced, with most of the essential genes being located in the central part of the genome, while non-essential genes are located at the ends. There are about 250 genes in the poxvirus genome.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0075]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0076" num="0075">Replication takes place in the cytoplasm, as the virus is sufficiently complex to have acquired all the functions necessary for genome replication. There is some contribution by the cell, but the nature of this contribution is not clear. However, even though poxvirus gene expression and genome replication occur in enucleated cells, maturation is blocked, indicating some role by the cell.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0076]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0077" num="0076">The receptors for poxviruses are not generally known, but probably are multiple in number and on different cell types. For vaccinia, one of the likely receptors is EGF receptor (McFadden, 2005). Penetration may also involve more than one mechanism. Uncoating occurs in two stages: (a) removal of the outer membrane as the particle enters the cell and in the cytoplasm, and (b) the particle is further uncoated and the core passes into the cytoplasm.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0077]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0078" num="0077">Once into the cell cytoplasm, gene expression is carried out by viral enzymes associated with the core. Expression is divided into 2 phases: early genes: which represent about of 50% genome, and are expressed before genome replication, and late genes, which are expressed after genome replication. The temporal control of expression is provided by the late promoters, which are dependent on DNA replication for activity. Genome replication is believed to involve self-priming, leading to the formation of high molecular weight concatemers, which are subsequently cleaved and repaired to make virus genomes. Viral assembly occurs in the cytoskeleton and probably involves interactions with the cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., actin-binding proteins). Inclusions form in the cytoplasm that mature into virus particles. Cell to cell spread may provide an alternative mechanism for spread of infection. Overall, replication of this large, complex virus is rather quick, taking just 12 hours on average.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0078]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0079" num="0078">At least nine different poxviruses cause disease in humans, but variola virus and vaccinia are the best known. Variola strains are divided into variola major (25-30% fatalities) and variola minor (same symptoms but less than 1% death rate). Infection with both viruses occurs naturally by the respiratory route and is systemic, producing a variety of symptoms, but most notably with variola characteristic pustules and scarring of the skin.</div>

Vaccinia is well-known for its role as a vaccine that eradicated smallpox. Post-eradication of smallpox, scientists have been exploring the use of vaccinia as a tool for delivering genes into biological tissues (gene therapy and genetic engineering). Vaccinia virus is unique among DNA viruses as it replicates only in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Therefore, the large genome is required to code for various enzymes and proteins needed for viral DNA replication. During replication, vaccinia produces several infectious forms which differ in their outer membranes: the intracellular mature virion (IMV), the intracellular enveloped virion (IEV), the cell-associated enveloped virion (CEV) and the extracellular enveloped virion (EEV). IMV is the most abundant infectious form and is thought to be responsible for spread between hosts. On the other hand, the CEV is believed to play a role in cell-to-cell spread and the EEV is thought to be important for long range dissemination within the host organism.</div>

K3L is a protein having homology with eIF-2α. K3L protein inhibits the action of PKR, an activator of interferons. E3L is another vaccinia protein that also inhibits PKR activation and is also able to bind double-stranded RNA.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0082]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0083" num="0082">Vaccinia virus is closely related to the virus that causes cowpox. The precise origin of vaccinia is unknown, but the most common view is that vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, and variola virus (the causative agent for smallpox) were all derived from a common ancestral virus. There is also speculation that vaccinia virus was originally isolated from horses. A vaccinia virus infection is mild and typically asymptomatic in healthy individuals, but it may cause a mild rash and fever, with an extremely low rate of fatality. An immune response generated against a vaccinia virus infection protects that person against a lethal smallpox infection. For this reason, vaccinia virus was used as a live-virus vaccine against smallpox. The vaccinia virus vaccine is safe because it does not contain the smallpox virus, but occasionally certain complications and/or vaccine adverse effects may arise, especially if the vaccine is immunocompromised.</div>

One such protein is granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, or GM-CSF. GM-CSF is a protein secreted by macrophages that stimulates stem cells to produce granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) and macrophages. Human GM-CSF is glycosylated at amino acid residues 23 (leucine), 27 (asparagine), and 39 (glutamic acid) (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,627, incorporated by reference). GM-CSF is also known as molgramostim or, when the protein is expressed in yeast cells, sargramostim (trademarked Leukine®), which is used as a medication to stimulate the production of white blood cells, especially granulocytes and macrophages, following chemotherapy. A vaccinia virus expressing GM-CSF has previously been reported. However, it was delivered not as an oncolytic agent, but merely as a delivery vector for GM-CSF. As such, it has been administered to patients at dosage below that which can achieve significant oncolysis. Herein is described the use of a GM-CSF expressing vaccinia virus that, in some embodiments, is administered at concentrations greater than 1×10W pfu or particles.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0085]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0086" num="0085">Viruses are frequently inactivated, inhibited, or cleared by immunomodulatory molecules such as interferons (-α, -β, -γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) (Moss, 1996). Host tissues and inflammatory/immune cells frequently secrete these molecules in response to viral infection. These molecules can have direct antiviral effects and/or indirect effects through recruitment and/or activation of inflammatory cells and lymphocytes. Given the importance of these immunologic clearance mechanisms, viruses have evolved to express gene products that inhibit the induction and/or function of these cytokines/chemokines and interferons. For example, vaccinia virus (VV, and some other poxviruses) encodes the secreted protein vCKBP (B29R) that binds and inhibits the CC chemokines (e.g., RANTES, eotaxin, MIP-1-alpha) (Alcami et al., 1998). Some VV strains also express a secreted viral protein that binds and inactivates TNF (e.g., Lister A53R) (Alcami et al., 1999). Most poxvirus strains have genes encoding secreted proteins that bind and inhibit the function of interferons-α/β (e.g., B18R) or interferon (B8R). vC12L is an IL-18-binding protein that prevents IL-18 from inducing IFN-γ and NK cell/cytotoxic T-cell activation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0086]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0087" num="0086">Most poxvirus virulence research has been performed in mice. Many, but not all, of these proteins are active in mice (B18R, for example, is not). In situations in which these proteins are active against the mouse versions of the target cytokine, deletion of these genes leads to reduced virulence and increased safety with VV mutants with deletions of or functional mutations in these genes. In addition, the inflammatory/immune response to and viral clearance of these mutants is often increased compared to the parental virus strain that expresses the inhibitory protein. For example, deletion of the T1/35 kDa family of poxvirus-secreted proteins (chemokine-binding/-inhibitory proteins) can lead to a marked increase in leukocyte infiltration into virus-infected tissues (Graham et al., 1997). Deletion of the vC12L gene in VV leads to reduced viral titers/toxicity following intranasal administration in mice; in addition. NK cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity is increased together with IFN-γ induction (Smith et al., 2000). Deletion of the Myxoma virus T7 gene (able to bind IFN-γ and a broad range of chemokines) results in reduced virulence and significantly increased tissue inflammation/infiltration in a toxicity model (Upton et al., 1992; Mossman et al., 1996). Deletion of the M-T2 gene from myxoma virus also resulted in reduced virulence in a rabbit model (Upton el al. 1991). Deletion of the B18R anti-interferon-α/β gene product also leads to enhanced viral sensitivity to IFN-mediated clearance, reduced titers in normal tissues and reduced virulence (Symons et al, 1995; Colamonici et al., 1995; Alcami et al., 2000). In summary, these viral gene products function to decrease the antiviral immune response and inflammatory cell infiltration into virus-infected tissues. Loss of protein function through deletion/mutation leads to decreased virulence and/or increased proinflammatory properties of the virus within host tissues.</div>

These effects can be on tumor cells themselves directly (e.g., TNF) or they can be indirect through effects on non-cancerous cells. An example of the latter is TNF, which can have antitumoral effects by causing toxicity to tumor-associated blood vessels; this leads to a loss of blood flow to the tumor followed by tumor necrosis. In addition, chemokines can act to recruit (and in some cases activate) immune effector cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages and/or lymphocytes. These immune effector cells can cause tumor destruction by a number of mechanisms. These mechanisms include the expression of antitumoral cytokines (e.g., TNF), expression of fas-ligand, expression of perforin and granzyme, recruitment of natural killer cells, etc. The inflammatory response can eventually lead to the induction of systemic tumor-specific immunity. Finally, many of these cytokines (e.g., TNF) or chemokines can act synergistically with chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy tumors.</div>

Approaches are needed to achieve high local concentrations of these molecules within tumor masses while minimizing levels in the systemic circulation. Viruses can be engineered to express cytokine or chemokine genes in an attempt to enhance their efficacy. Expression of these genes from replication-selective vectors has potential advantages over expression from non-replicating vectors. Expression from replicating viruses can result in higher local concentrations within tumor masses; in addition, replicating viruses can help to induce antitumoral immunity through tumor cell destruction/oncolysis and release of tumor antigens in a proinflammatory environment. However, there are several limitations to this approach. Serious safety concerns arise from the potential for release into the environment of a replication-competent virus (albeit tumor-selective) with a gene that can be toxic if expressed in high local concentrations. Viruses that express potent pro-inflammatory genes from their genome may therefore pose safety risks to the treated patient and to the general public. Even with tumor-targeting, replication-selective viruses expressing these genes, gene expression can occur in normal tissues resulting in toxicity. In addition, size limitations prevent expression of multiple and/or large genes from viruses such as adenovirus; these molecules will definitely act more efficaciously in combination. Finally, many of the oncolytic viruses in use express anti-inflammatory proteins and therefore these viruses will counteract the induction of a proinflammatory milieu within the infected tumor mass. The result will be to inhibit induction of antitumoral immunity, antivascular effects and chemotherapy-/radiotherapy-sensitization.</div>

Interferon-γ has weaker direct viral inhibitory effects but is a potent inducer of cell-mediated immunity through several mechanisms. Viruses have evolved to express secreted gene products that are able to counteract the antiviral effects of interferons. For example, vaccinia virus (and other poxviruses) encodes the secreted proteins B8R and B18R which bind interferon-γ and -α/-β, respectively (Smith et al., 1997; Symons et al., 1995; Alcami et al., 2000). An additional example of a vaccinia gene product that reduces interferon induction is the caspase-1 inhibitor B13R which inhibits activation of the interferon-γ-inducing factor IL-18. Interferon modulating polypeptides include, but are not limited to, B18R, which may be termed B19R in other viral strains, such as the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus, B8R; B13R, vC12L; A53R; E3L and other viral polypeptides with similar activities or properties. IFN modulating polypeptides may be divided into the non-exclusive categories of those that preferentially modulate IFNα and/or β pathways (such as B18R, B8R, B13R, or vC12L) and those that modulate IFNγ pathways (for example B8R, B13R, or vC12L).</div>

A number of mechanisms are involved. These include the fact that ras signal transduction pathway activation (e.g., by ras mutation, upstream growth factor receptor overexpression/mutation, etc.), a common feature of cancer cells, leads to PKR inhibition. In addition, lymphocytes are often inhibited in tumor masses by a variety of mechanisms including IL-10 production and fas-L expression by tumor cells. Since lymphocytes are a major source of interferon-γ production, lymphocyte inhibition leads to a decrease in interferon-γ production in tumors. Therefore, tumor masses tend to be sanctuaries from the effects of interferons. In addition, interferons themselves can have antitumoral effects. For example, IFN-γ can increase MHC class-I-associated antigen presentation; this will allow more efficient CTL-mediated killing of tumor cells. IFN-α/β, for example, can block angiogenesis within tumor masses and thereby block tumor growth.</div>

As the infected cell dies it is unable to continue to produce infectious virus. In addition, during apoptosis intracellular enzymes are released which degrade DNA. These enzymes can lead to viral DNA degradation and virus inactivation. Apoptosis can be induced by numerous mechanisms including the binding of activated complement and the complement membrane attack complex. Poxviruses such as vaccinia have evolved to express gene products that are able to counteract the complement-mediated clearance of virus and/or virus-infected cells. These genes thereby prevent apoptosis and inhibit viral clearance by complement-dependent mechanisms, thus allowing the viral infection to proceed and viral virulence to be increased. For example, vaccinia virus complement control proteins (VCP; e.g., C21L) have roles in the prevention of complement-mediated cell killing and/or virus inactivation (Isaacs et al., 1992). VCP also has anti-inflammatory effects since its expression decreases leukocyte infiltration into virally-infected tissues.

In addition to these immune-mediated mechanisms, the biodistribution of these viruses results in the vast majority of intravenous virus depositing within normal tissues rather than in tumor masses. Intravenous adenovirus, for example, primarily ends up within the liver and spleen; less than 0.1% of the input virus depositing within tumors, even in immunodeficient mice (Heise et al., 1999).

IMV represents approximately 99% of virus yield following replication by wild-type vaccinia virus strains. This virus form is relatively stable in the environment, and therefore it is primarily responsible for spread between individuals; in contrast, this virus does not spread efficiently within the infected host due to inefficient release from cells and sensitivity to complement and/or antibody neutralization. In contrast, EEV is released into the extracellular milieu and typically represents only approximately 1% of the viral yield (Smith et al., 1998). EEV is responsible for viral spread within the infected host and is relatively easily degraded outside of the host. Importantly, EEV has developed several mechanisms to inhibit its neutralization within the bloodstream. First, EEV is relatively resistant to complement (Vanderplasschen et al., 1998); this feature is due to the incorporation of host cell inhibitors of complement into its outer membrane coat plus secretion of Vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) into local extracellular environment. Second, EEV is relatively resistant to neutralizing antibody effects compared to IMV (Smith et al., 1997). EEV is also released at earlier time points following infection (e.g., 4-6 hours) than is IMV (which is only released during/after cell death), and therefore spread of the EEV form is faster (Blasco et al., 1993).</div>

Standard vaccinia virus (VV) manufacturing and purification procedures lead to EEV inactivation (Smith et al., 1998), and non-human cell lines are frequently used to manufacture the virus; EEV from non-human cells will not be protected from complement-mediated clearance (complement inhibitory proteins acquired from the cell by EEV have species restricted effects). Vaccinia virus efficacy has therefore been limited by the relative sensitivity of the IMV form to neutralization and by its inefficient spread within solid tumor masses; this spread is typically from cell to adjacent cell. IMV spread to distant tumor masses, either through the bloodstream or lymphatics, is also inefficient.</div>

Since EEV is relatively resistant to complement effects, when it is grown in a cell type from the same species, this virus form will have enhanced stability and retain activity longer in the blood following intravascular administration than standard preparations of vaccinia virus (which contain exclusively IMV) (Smith et al., 1998). Since EEV is resistant to antibody-mediated neutralization, this virus form will retain activity longer in the blood following intravascular administration than standard preparations of vaccinia virus (which contain almost exclusively IMV) (Vanderplasschen et al., 1998). This feature will be particularly important for repeat administration once neutralizing antibody levels have increased, all approved anti-cancer therapies require repeat administration. Therefore, the EEV form of vaccinia, and other poxviruses, will result in superior delivery of therapeutic viruses and their genetic payload to tumors through the bloodstream. This will lead to enhanced systemic efficacy compared with standard poxvirus preparations. Finally, the risk of transmission to individuals in the general public should be reduced significantly since EEV is extremely unstable outside of the body. Polypeptides involved in the modulation of the EEV form of a virus include, but are not limited to, A34R. B5R. and various other proteins that influence the production of the EEV form of the poxviruses. A mutation at codon 151 of A34R from a lysine to a aspartic acid (K151D mutation) renders the A34R protein less able to tether the EEV form to the cell membrane. B5R is an EEV-membrane bound polypeptide that may bind complement. The total deletion of A43R may lead to increased EEV release, but markedly reduced infectivity of the viruses, while the K151D mutation increases EEV release while maintaining infectivity of the released viruses. B5R has sequence homology to VCP (anti-complement), but complement inhibition has not yet been proven.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0114]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0115" num="0114">Briefly, one method for identifying a fortified EEV form is as follows. EEV are diluted in ice-cold MEM and mixed (1:1 volume) with active or heat-inactivated (56° C., 30 min, control) serum diluted in ice-cold MEM (final dilution of serum 1/10, 1/20, or 1/30). After incubation or 75 min at 7° C., samples are cooled on ice and mAb 5B4/2F2 is added to fresh EEV samples to neutralize any contaminates (IMV and ruptured EEV). Virions are then bound to RK13 cells for one hour on ice, complement and unbound virions are washed away, and the number of plaques are counted two days later. The higher the plaque number the greater the resistance to complement (Vanderplasschen et al., 1998, herein incorporated by reference). Exemplary methods describing the isolation of EEV forms of vaccinia virus can be found in Blasco el al., 1992 (incorporated herein by reference).</div>

Other vaccinia virus proteins such as the vaccinia virus growth factor (e.g., C11L), which is a viral EGF-like growth factor, may also be the target for alteration in some embodiments of the invention. Other polypeptides that may be classified as viral immunomodulatory factors include, but are not limited to B7R, N1L, or other polypeptides that whose activities or properties increase the virulence of a poxvirus.</div>

Vaccinia virus-induced cell fusion will typically increase antitumoral efficacy of VV due to intratumoral viral spread. Intratumoral viral spreading by cell fusion will typically allow the virus to avoid neutralizing antibodies and immune responses. Killing and infection of adjacent uninfected cells (i.e., a “bystander effect) may be more efficient in VV with mutations in one or both of these genes, which may result in improved local antitumoral effects.</div>

For example, certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids in a protein structure without appreciable loss of interactive binding capacity with structures such as, for example, antigen-binding regions of antibodies or binding sites on substrate molecules. Since it is the interactive capacity and nature of a protein that defines that protein's biological functional activity, certain amino acid substitutions can be made in a protein sequence, and in its underlying DNA coding sequence, and nevertheless produce a protein with like properties. It is thus contemplated by the inventors that various changes may be made in the DNA sequences of genes without appreciable loss of their biological utility or activity, as discussed below. Table 1 shows the codons that encode particular amino acids.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0140]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0142" num="0140">In making such changes, the hydropathic index of amino acids may be considered. The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biologic function on a protein is generally understood in the art byte and Kyte and Doolittle, 1982). It is accepted that the relative hydropathic character of the amino acid contributes to the secondary structure of the resultant protein, which in turn defines the interaction of the protein with other molecules, for example, enzymes, substrates, receptors, DNA, antibodies, antigens, and the like.</div>

U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101, incorporated herein by reference, states that the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with a biological property of the protein.

Common tumor markers include carcinoembryonic antigen, prostate specific antigen, urinary tumor associated antigen, fetal antigen, tyrosinase (p97), gp68, TAG-72, HMFG, Sialyl Lewis Antigen, MucA, MucB, PLAP, estrogen receptor, laminin receptor, erb B and p155. An alternative aspect of immunotherapy is to anticancer effects with immune stimulatory effects. Immune stimulating molecules also exist including: cytokines such as IL-2, IL4, IL-12, GM-CSF, IFN.gamma., chemokines such as MIP-1, MCP-1, IL-8 and growth factors such as FLT3 ligand. Combining immune stimulating molecules, either as proteins or using gene delivery in combination with a tumor suppressor such as mda-7 has been shown to enhance anti-tumor effects (Ju et al., 2000).</div>

Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a chimeric (mouse-human) monoclonal antibody that blocks the HER2-neu receptor. It possesses anti-tumor activity and has been approved for use in the treatment of malignant tumors (Dillman, 1999). Combination therapy of cancer with herceptin and chemotherapy has been shown to be more effective than the individual therapies.

To achieve this, one would administer to an animal, or human patient, an immunologically effective amount of activated lymphocytes in combination with an adjuvant-incorporated antigenic peptide composition as described herein. The activated lymphocytes will most preferably be the patient's own cells that were earlier isolated from a blood or tumor sample and activated (or “expanded”) in vitro.

The major transitions of the eukaryotic cell cycle are triggered by cyclin-dependent kinases, or CDK's. One CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), regulates progression through the Gi. The activity of this enzyme may be to phosphorylate Rb at late Gi. The activity of CDK4 is controlled by an activating subunit, D-type cyclin, and by an inhibitory subunit, the p16<sup>INK4 </sup>has been biochemically characterized as a protein that specifically binds to and inhibits CDK4, and thus may regulate Rb phosphorylation (Serrano et al., 1993; Serrano et al., 1995). Since the p16<sup>INK4 </sup>protein is a CDK4 inhibitor (Serrano, 1993), deletion of this gene may increase the activity of CDK4, resulting in hyperphosphorylation of the Rb protein. p16 also is known to regulate the function of CDK6.</div>

This interpretation has been challenged, however, by the observation that the frequency of the p16<sup>INK4 </sup>gene alterations is much lower in primary uncultured tumors than in cultured cell lines (Caldas el al., 1994; Cheng et al., 1994; Hussussian et al., 1994; Kamb et al., 1994; Kamb et al., 1994; Mori et al., 1994; Okamoto et al., 1994; Nobori et al., 1994; Orlow et al., 1994; Arap el al., 1995). Restoration of wild-type p16<sup>INK4 </sup>function by transfection with a plasmid expression vector reduced colony formation by some human cancer cell lines (Okamoto, 1994; Arap, 1995).</div>

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an essential process for normal embryonic development, maintaining homeostasis in adult tissues, and suppressing carcinogenesis (Kerr el al., 1972). The Bcl-2 family of proteins and ICE-like proteases have been demonstrated to be important regulators and effectors of apoptosis in other systems. The Bcl-2 protein, discovered in association with follicular lymphoma, plays a prominent role in controlling apoptosis and enhancing cell survival in response to diverse apoptotic stimuli (Bakhshi et al., 1985; Cleary and Sklar, 1985; Cleary et al., 1986; Tsujimoto et al., 1985; Tsujimoto and Croce, 1986). The evolutionarily conserved Bcl-2 protein now is recognized to be a member of a family of related proteins, which can be categorized as death agonists or death antagonists.</div>

Also, it now is apparent that there is a family of Bcl-2 cell death regulatory proteins which share in common structural and sequence homologies. These different family members have been shown to either possess similar functions to Bcl-2 (e.g., BCl<sub>XL</sub>, Bcl<sub>w</sub>, Bcl<sub>s</sub>, Mcl-1, A1, Bfl-1) or counteract Bcl-2 function and promote cell death (e.g. Bax, Bak, Bik, Bim, Bid, Bad, Haraliri).</div>

TRAIL activates rapid apoptosis in many types of cancer cells, yet is not toxic to normal cells. TRAIL mRNA occurs in a wide variety of tissues. Most normal cells appear to be resistant to TRAIL's cytotoxic action, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that can protect against apoptosis induction by TRAIL. The first receptor described for TRAIL, called death receptor 4 (DR4), contains a cytoplasmic “death domain”; DR4 transmits the apoptosis signal carried by TRAIL. Additional receptors have been identified that bind to TRAIL. One receptor, called DR5, contains a cytoplasmic death domain and signals apoptosis much like DR4. The DR4 and DR5 mRNAs are expressed in many normal tissues and tumor cell lines. Recently, decoy receptors such as DcR1 and DcR2 have been identified that prevent TRAIL from inducing apoptosis through DR4 and DR5. These decoy receptors thus represent a novel mechanism for regulating sensitivity to a pro-apoptotic cytoline directly at the cell's surface. The preferential expression of these inhibitory receptors in normal tissues suggests that TRAIL may be useful as an anticancer agent that induces apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing normal cells. (Marsters et al., 1999).</div>

However, one of the consequences of chemotherapy is the development/acquisition of drug-resistant phenotypes and the development of multiple drug resistance. The development of drug resistance remains a major obstacle in the treatment of such tumors and therefore, there is an obvious need for alternative approaches such as gene therapy.</div>

Local hyperthermia involves the application of heat to a small area, such as a tumor. Heat may be generated externally with high-frequency waves targeting a tumor from a device outside the body.

The panel of wild type poxvirus strains (Wyeth, Western Reserve (WR), USSR, Tian Tan, Tash Kent, Patwadangar, Lister, King, IHD-W, IHD-J and Evans) was kindly provided by Dr Geoff Smith, Imperial College, London. Human Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) was obtained from ATCC. The Viral growth factor (VGF) deleted strain of WR (vSC20) was kindly provided by Dr Bernie Moss, NIH. The thymidine kinase deleted strain of WR (vJS6) and the TK-, VGF-double deleted strain of WR (vvDD) are described in Puhlmann et al. (2000) and McCart et al. (2001). WR strain expressing firefly luciferase was kindly provided by Dr Gary Luker, (Uni Michigan).</div>

Oncolytic viruses are viruses that have their replication restricted to malignant cell types, either inherently or through genetic engineering (Thorne et al., 2005)<sup>1</sup>. Selective intratumoral replication leads to virus multiplication, killing of the infected cancer cell by unique and apoptosis-independent mechanisms (oncolysis) and spread of the virus to other tumor cells. Virotherapeutics therefore have the potential to effectively treat refractory cancers and clinical proof-of-concept has been achieved with local or regional administration for several oncolytic viruses (Parato et al., 2005)<sup>2</sup>. However, for oncolytic viruses to have a major impact on patient survival, systemic efficacy and intravenous delivery will be needed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0297]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0299" num="0297">The inventor has therefore undertaken a stepwise design and development strategy to create a more effective systemic agent. First, the inventor identified poxviruses such as vaccinia as a virus species that has evolved for systemic dissemination and resistance to clearance by complement and antibodies (Smith et al., 1997; Buller and Palumbo, 1991). Vaccinia has well-defined mechanisms to allow for transport in the blood without inactivation and can spread rapidly within tissues, it also has a long history of human use during the smallpox eradication campaign. A panel of vaccinia viruses used during the vaccination program, and some related strains were screened for their ability to replicate in normal (NHBE) and tumor (A2780) cells. All vaccinia strains replicated to higher levels in the tumor cell line than in the normal cells (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>), but the therapeutic index (tumor to normal cell replication ratio) varied between strains. Strains used extensively in the laboratory (such as Western Reserve (WR)) tended to display greater inherent tumor selectivity in vitro than their parental vaccine strains (Wyeth). This is the first time that wild type vaccinia strains have been shown to display inherent superior replication in tumor cell lines relative to normal cells. This is not true for all viruses however, as Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) (the backbone for the majority of oncolytic viruses in the clinic) did not display such selectivity (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0298]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0300" num="0298">Another desirable attribute for an oncolytic agent is rapid intratumoral spread (Wein et al, 2003). This can be achieved through a short replication cycle and early release of virus from infected cells. The ability of the WR strain of vaccinia to destroy tumor cells was therefore examined at early time points (72h) after infection and compared to Ad5 and the oncolytic adenovirus strain d11520 (ONYX-015) (Heise et al., 1997) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). WR displayed up to 5-logs of increased killing potential in tumor cells at this time relative to both Ad5 and dl1520, as well as greater tumor selectivity than either adenoviral strain.</div>

Little or no replicating virus was evident in tumors (as detected by immunohistochemical staining for viral coat proteins 48 and 72 h after viral delivery). Vaccinia strain WR however could effectively traffic to and infect the tumors in these same models, with up to 50% of the tumor cells staining positive within 48 h of treatment. Furthermore, vaccinia was able to persist in the tumor for at least 10 days (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>), despite the fact an immune response would have been initiated by this time.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0300]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0302" num="0300">In order to maximize safety, particularly for intravenous administration in immunodeficient cancer patients, attenuating and tumor-targeting genetic deletions were introduced into the virus. The inventor has previously described preferential tumor-expression of viral genes with insertions into the vaccinia thymidine kinase (TK) gene and of TK and viral growth factor (VGF) double deletions (Puhlmann et al., 1999; McCart et al., 2001). Although the targeting mechanisms of these deletions were not previously demonstrated, the rationale was to restrict virus replication and oncolysis to cancer cells with elevated E2F levels (as E2F drives production of the cellular thymidine kinase gene product (Hengstschlager et al. 1994)) and activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor pathway (as activation of this pathway by VGF is necessary for efficient viral replication (Andrade et al., 2004)). Here it is shown that the TK and VGF double deleted virus (vvDD) displayed an impressive ability to destroy a wide range of tumor cells of different origins (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). It was also found that single deletions in either the vaccinia TK or the VGF genes attenuated the ability of vaccinia to replicate in non-proliferating, non-transformed human cell lines, while the double deleted virus (vvDD) was further attenuated (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).

It was found that H-ras activation led to increased replication of even WR (p=0.0094), and that VGF deletion did not inhibit viral replication in H-ras activated cells, whereas the TK deletion did (p=0.016). This indicates that the tumor selectivity introduced by the gene deletions in vvDD is more than a simple preference for proliferating cells, since slowly proliferating or even non-proliferating cells could be targeted if they contained mutations in the EGF-R/Ras/MAP Kinase signaling pathway.</div>

Bioluminescence imaging following IV delivery of 1×10<sup>7 </sup>PFU of WR or vvDD expressing luciferase showed that both viruses displayed similar initial infection and viral gene expression patterns (including spleen, lung, liver and tumor) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>). However, the bioluminescent signal from vvDD was rapidly cleared from most organs other than the tumor, even in immunodeficient mice, while WR continued to replicate in the target organs and spread to other tissues, including bone marrow, skin and brain (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8C</figref>). Although vvDD did produce some points of infection outside of the tumor, these appeared transiently and late, indicating secondary spread without replication (data not shown). Recovery of infectious viral units from tissues of mice treated IV with 1×10<sup>9 </sup>PFU of vvDD (a lethal dose for WR) revealed that by day 8 after treatment the tumor displayed increasing viral titer, with over 1,000-fold more viral copies per mg tissue than any other organ, while all normal tissues were below the limits of detection or showed falling viral titers (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</div>

Because human GM-CSF is not active in rodents but is active in rabbits (Cody et al., 2005), and in order to assess the activity against much larger primary tumors that reproducibly metastasize, JX-963 was used in a rabbit model with primary (VX2) liver tumors and lung metastases (Kim et al., 2006). As in the mouse models, 1×10<sup>9 </sup>PFU of intravenous vvDD had significant anti-tumor effects (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). The vvDD virus was also capable of inhibiting the outgrowth of microscopic lung metastases. In order to assess additional efficacy due to concomitant GM-CSF expression, JX-963 was compared directly to vvDD. JX-963 produced greater efficacy against the primary tumor, and completely blocked outgrowth of lung metastases. GM-CSF was detected in the plasma of JX-963 treated mice by ELISA (data not shown). In addition to direct oncolytic effects, JX-963 was also found to cross-protect the animal against the tumor by raising a CTL response against the VX2 tumor cells (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>).</div>

A strong anti-viral antibody response was raised within 3 weeks of initial infection in the rabbits tested (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). To study the feasibility of repeat dosing after neutralizing antibody formation, four rabbits that had initially responded to treatment but had tumor progression after four weeks off of therapy were re-treated. <b>1</b>×<b>10</b> <sup>9 </sup>PFU of JX-963 delivered intravenously at 6 weeks after the initial treatment resulted in a decrease in primary tumor size in 3 of 4 animals treated (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>).</div>

In order to improve the safety of this virus several deletions capable of increasing its therapeutic index were introduced, their mechanism of action described and their biodistribution examined in vivo. Dramatic therapeutic effects against large primary tumors following systemic delivery were demonstrated. Finally, because it is unlikely all tumor cells will be infected, even following systemic viral delivery. GM-CSF was expressed from this viral backbone. The addition of GM-CSF was found to increase the effectiveness of this virus against primary tumors, prevent the outgrowth of micrometastases, and produced an anti-tumor CTL response. This indicates that this virus, JX-963, is capable of systemic delivery to tumors, where it rapidly and efficiently destroys tumor tissue, while sparing normal organs, and at the same time induces an immune response within the tumor that is capable of recognizing tumor antigens produced in situ. Repeat dosing was further shown to produce additional anti-tumor effects, either by direct oncolysis or by boosting the anti-tumor immune response. JX-963 therefore has the potential to effectively treat a variety of tumors.</div>

This dose is lower than the top weekly dose of 1.6×10<sup>8 </sup>pfu, which was safely administered in the first Phase I study of JX-594 for the treatment of surgically incurable cutaneous melanoma (Mastrangelo et al., 1998). Furthermore, 1×10<sup>8 </sup>pfu is ten times lower than the top dose that has been safely administered to date (n=2 patients) in the ongoing Phase I intratumoral (IT) trial with JX-594 and three times lower than the top dose level cleared to date. In that trial, treatments by IT injection into 1-3 liver tumors are administered every three weeks. Preliminary results from this study reveal that flu-like symptoms and hematology parameters recover to baseline levels typically within 4 days (i.e., Day 5) after treatment with JX-594.</div>

Antibody titers were found to reach a plateau at 4-6 weeks following exposure despite continuing treatments. Therefore, this protocol investigates weekly IT administration for six weeks in order to confer maximum possible delivery and JX-594 anti-tumoral effects prior to the development of high titer antibodies and T cells.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0424]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0429" num="0424">Melanoma may be the optimal target for JX-594 immunotherapy because of the relatively high rate of accessible disease for injection, the positive response of melanoma seen with IL-2 immunotherapy, and the lack of effective, tolerable therapy for patient with metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, it is contemplated that JX-594 replication targets the EGFR pathway, which is highly expressed in melanocytes.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0425]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0430" num="0425">Results from an initial Phase I/II study suggest that intratumoral injection of JX-594 is safe and effective in treating both injected and distant disease in patients with surgically incurable metastatic melanoma. Response of both injected tumors (in 5 of 7 patients) and response of at least one non-injected tumor (in 4 of 7 patients) was demonstrated, including two patients who achieved a partial response (6+ months) and a complete response (4+ months) to JX-594 treatment. Particularly noteworthy is that efficacy and gene expression occurred despite pre-treatment vaccination (and, therefore, pre-existing anti-vaccinia immunity) in all patients.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0426]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0431" num="0426">This study design was selected in order to expand on the initial Phase I/II study described above and evaluate injected tumor response in up to 15 evaluable patients with Stage 3 or Stage 4 unresectable metastatic melanoma. In addition, JX-594 safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immune response to JX-594, and expression of the GM-CSF transgene in the blood and tumor tissues will be evaluated. The investigators will also evaluate whether JX-594 is able to spread intravenously and infect non-injected regional and distant disease, suggesting that it may be able to confer similar anti-tumor effects as those experienced at the site of direct intratumoral injection. This finding, in addition to adding to the overall clinical experience of JX-594 administered IT, would strongly support treatment of JX-594 by IV administration for treatment of advanced/metastatic disease, particularly in the treatment of advanced malignant melanoma.</div>

No maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was reported; tumor responses were reported. The objectives of the current trial were to define the following: safety and MTD at significantly higher doses (100-fold), without pre-immunization (as was done in the pilot study), specifically following treatment within a solid organ; pharmacokinetics, including replication-dependent shedding into the blood over three weeks; efficacy against a broad spectrum of cancer types. In this Phase I trial the inventors therefore treated patients with liver tumors (primary or metastatic) by intratumoral injection. For the first time, the inventors report an MTD, plus high-level JX-594 replication and systemic GM-CSF expression, efficacy and distant tumor targeting at well-tolerated doses.
