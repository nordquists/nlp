No. 13/973,627 filed Aug. 22, 2013 which is a U.S. non-provisional patent application now U.S. Pat. No. 9,230,904, and claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2012-0091920, filed on Aug. 22, 2012, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Exemplary embodiments relate to a semiconductor device, and in particular, to methods of forming a stack of electrodes and three-dimensional semiconductor devices fabricated thereby.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Higher integration of semiconductor devices is required to satisfy consumer demands for superior performance and lower prices. In the case of semiconductor memory devices, integration is an important factor in determining product prices and thus, increased integration is important. In the case of typical two-dimensional or planar semiconductor memory devices, their integration is mainly determined by the area occupied by a unit memory cell, and thus, integration is greatly influenced by the level of a fine pattern forming technology. However, the extremely expensive process equipment needed to increase pattern fineness sets a practical limitation on increasing integration for two-dimensional or planar semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">To overcome such a limitation, three-dimensional semiconductor memory devices having three-dimensionally arranged memory cells have been proposed. The three-dimensional semiconductor memory device may also include three-dimensionally arranged conductive lines (for example, word lines) serving as electrical paths for accessing the memory cells.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view exemplarily illustrating a semiconductor device according to exemplary embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an electrode structure may be provided on a substrate <b>10</b> with a connection region and an array region RA. For example, the connection region may include a first region R<b>1</b> and a second region R<b>2</b> positioned at both sides of the array region RA, but exemplary embodiments may not be limited thereto. The electrode structure may include a plurality of electrodes EL stacked in a sequential manner. The electrodes EL may be formed of a conductive material (for example, a doped semiconductor layer or a metal layer). In certain exemplary embodiments, the electrodes EL may be formed of the same material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Lengths of the electrodes EL may decrease, i.e., become shorter, with increasing distance from the substrate <b>10</b>. Furthermore, in plan view, one of the electrodes EL may be disposed within a region occupied by other electrode disposed thereunder. For example, the electrodes EL may be disposed to form a multi-layered structure having a stepwise portion(s), and one of the electrodes EL may include at least one endportion (hereinafter, referred as to a “connection portion CP”, i.e., connecting portion), which is not covered by other electrode disposed thereon. If the connection portion CP has a sufficiently large area, the connection portion CP may serve as an electrical path (hereinafter, referred as to a “contact region”), allowing the corresponding electrode to be electrically connected to other wires.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">According to some aspects of the inventive concept, at least one of the electrodes EL may include an endportion (hereinafter, referred as to an “aligned portion AP”) having a side surface aligned to that of other electrode disposed thereon. For example, a pair of the electrodes EL adjacent to each other in a vertical direction may have sidewalls aligned to a specific vertical plane VS, whose normal direction is substantially perpendicular to a top surface of the substrate <b>10</b>, or coplanar with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In example embodiments, both endportions of each of the electrodes EL may be configured to have the technical features of the connection portion CP and the aligned portion AP described above. For example, one endportion of each electrode EL (for example, the connection portion CP) may protrude horizontally from other electrode disposed thereon, while opposite endportion thereof (for example, the aligned portion AP) may have a sidewall coplanar with or aligned with that of other electrode disposed thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">In some example embodiments, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the connection portion CP and the aligned portion AP may be formed on the first and second regions R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, respectively, for even-numbered ones of the electrodes EL and on the second and first regions R<b>2</b> and R<b>1</b>, respectively, for odd-numbered ones of the electrodes EL.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">According to exemplary embodiments, a formation of a semiconductor device may include a process of forming a stack of electrodes, and the formation of the electrode stack may include a process of forming a stepwise connection structure (e.g., shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Hereinafter, a process of forming the stepwise connection structure according to exemplary embodiments will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, horizontal layers may be sequentially stacked on a substrate to form a stack (in S<b>1</b>). A plurality of electrode layers and insulating layers may be alternatingly stacked to form a stack, the stack having a first region and a second region, and the stack having a vertical pitch of a distance between a top surface of one electrode layer and a top surface of another electrode layer adjacent to the one electrode layer. In certain embodiments, the electrodes EL of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be a resulting structure obtained by etching the horizontal layers using a patterning method described below. For example, the horizontal layers may be used as the electrodes EL. In other example embodiments, the electrodes EL of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be formed by etching the horizontal layers using a patterning method described below, selectively removing the horizontal layers to form empty spaces, and then, filling the empty spaces with a conductive layer. For example, the horizontal layers may serve as sacrificial layers for forming the empty spaces, in which the electrodes EL will be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">The stack may be patterned to form a stepwise connection structure on the connection region of the substrate (in S<b>2</b>). During the patterning of the stack, a selective etching step SE and a common etching step CE may be performed at least once. Here, the selective etching step SE may be performed to locally etch a specific portion of the connection region. By contrast, the common etching step CE may be performed to simultaneously etch several portions of the connection region. In certain embodiments, the specific portion associated with the selective etching step SE may be included in the several portions that will be etched during the common etching step CE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">During the formation of the stepwise connection structure, the selective etching step SE and the common etching step CE may be performed at least once, and each of them may be performed in a single- or multi-layer etching manner. In the case of the single-layer etching manner, the selective or common etching step SE or CE may be performed in such a way that an etched portion thereby has a second depth equivalent to a vertical pitch of each horizontal layer, and in the case of the multi-layer etching manner, the selective or common etching step SE or CE may be performed to a first depth in such a way that at least two layers of the horizontal layers can be continuously etched. The stepwise connection structure, e.g., stepped profile shape, may be realized through various combinations of the selective and common etching steps SE and CE, and some examples of such combinations will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 52</figref>. Therefore, a shape of a first profile of the first region is offset from a shape of a second profile of the second region, the offset being an amount equal to at least the vertical pitch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a table illustrating methods of fabricating a semiconductor device according to exemplary embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">According to exemplary embodiments, the formation of the connection structure (in S<b>2</b>) may include first and second patterning processes S<b>21</b> and S<b>22</b>, which differ from each other in terms of both of an etch depth and an etching region. For example, one of the first and second patterning processes S<b>21</b> and S<b>22</b> may be performed in such a way that an etch depth thereof is at least twice a vertical pitch of the horizontal layer, and the other may be performed in such a way that an etch depth thereof is about the vertical pitch of the horizontal layer. Here, the vertical pitch of the horizontal layer may refer to a difference in height between top surfaces of one of the horizontal layers and other located thereon or thereunder. In other words, one of the first and second patterning processes S<b>21</b> and S<b>22</b> may be performed in a multi-layer etching manner, while the other may be performed in a single-layer etching manner. For example, the first and second patterning processes S<b>21</b> and S<b>22</b> may be performed in the multi- and single-layer etching manners, respectively, for first and fourth examples enumerated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and may be performed in the single- and multi-layer etching manners, respectively, for second and third examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">With regard to the etching region, one of the first and second patterning processes S<b>21</b> and S<b>22</b> may be performed on every portion of the connection region, and the other may be performed on a specific portion of the connection region. For example, one of the first and second patterning processes S<b>21</b> and S<b>22</b> may be performed to etch several portions of the horizontal layers positioned on all the first and second regions R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> or in a common etching manner, and the other may be performed to etch a specific portion of the horizontal layers positioned on the second region R<b>2</b> or in a selective etching manner. Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the first and third examples, the first patterning process may be performed in the common etching manner, and the second patterning process may be performed in the selective etching manner. Further, in the second and fourth examples, the first patterning process may be performed in the selective etching manner, and the second patterning process may be performed in the common etching manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In certain embodiments, the patterning process based on the common etching manner may include two or more steps of etching the horizontal layers on both the first and second regions R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, and the patterning process based on the selective etching manner may include a single step of etching the horizontal layers on the second region. For example, in the first and third examples in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first patterning process S<b>21</b> may include several steps of etching the horizontal layers in the common etching manner, and the second patterning process S<b>22</b> may include a single step of etching the horizontal layers in the selective etching manner.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of fabricating a semiconductor device according to the first example exemplified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 8</figref> are sectional views exemplarily illustrating a method of fabricating a semiconductor device according to the first example exemplified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>, horizontal layers <b>100</b> and interlayered insulating layers <b>200</b> may be alternatingly stacked on a substrate <b>10</b> to form a stack ST (in S<b>1</b>). The substrate <b>10</b> may include a first region R<b>1</b>, a second region R<b>2</b> and an array region RA therebetween. The horizontal layers <b>100</b> may be formed of a material having etch selectivity with respect to the interlayered insulating layers <b>200</b>. For example, the interlayered insulating layers <b>200</b> may be formed of a silicon oxide layer, while the horizontal layers <b>100</b> may include at least one of a silicon nitride layer, a silicon oxynitride layer, a poly silicon layer, or metal layer. In example embodiments, the horizontal layers <b>100</b> may be formed of the same material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4 and 6</figref>, the first patterning process S<b>21</b> may be performed on the stack ST. In the present example, the first patterning process S<b>21</b> may include a plurality of etching steps performed in the common multi-layer etching manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">For example, the first patterning process S<b>21</b> may include at least two etching steps, each of which is performed to etch portions of the stack ST positioned on the first and second regions R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> to the same etch depth. To realize the etching steps in the common etching manner, the etching steps may be performed using their respective etch mask exposing both the first and second regions R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in certain embodiments, an etch depth in each etching step may be about twice the vertical pitch of the horizontal layers <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">Meanwhile, in the case where the first patterning process S<b>21</b> includes a plurality of etching steps performed in the common etching manner, a single etch mask may be used in common for at least successive two of the etching steps. For example, a following one of the etching step may include a step of reducing or shrinking a horizontal size or width of a first etch mask <b>201</b> that has been used in a preceding one of the etching steps. The reduced first etch mask <b>201</b> may be re-used as an etch mask in the following etching step. The re-use of the etch mask may relieve technical difficulties caused by a misalignment in a subsequent process and reduce the number of an expensive photolithography process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">In the case where, like the present embodiment, the first patterning process S<b>21</b> includes the step of shrinking an etch mask, the number of the etching steps to be applied may be greater at outer portions of the stack ST than at inner portions thereof. Accordingly, a portion(s) of the stack ST to be etched during the first patterning process S<b>21</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a first etched portion E<b>1</b>) may have an etch depth increasing with increasing distance from the array region RA. As a result, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the stack ST and the first etched portion E<b>1</b> may be formed to have stepwise structures, e.g., stepped profiles, on the first and second regions R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">As described above, since the first patterning process S<b>21</b> is performed in the common etching manner, two portions or the first etched portions E<b>1</b> of the stack ST positioned on the first region R<b>1</b> and the second region R<b>2</b> may be formed to have mirror symmetry with respect to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4 and 7</figref>, the second patterning process S<b>22</b> may be performed on the stack ST. According to the present example, the second patterning process S<b>22</b> may include an etching step performed in the selective singe-layer etching manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">For example, the second patterning process S<b>22</b> may include a step of etching a portion of the stack ST positioned on the second region R<b>2</b> to the vertical pitch P of the horizontal layer <b>100</b>. The second patterning process S<b>22</b> may be performed using a second etch mask <b>202</b>, which may be formed to cover the first region R<b>1</b> and expose the second region R<b>2</b>. The second etch mask <b>202</b> may be formed to expose the first etched portion E<b>1</b> on the second region R<b>2</b> and a neighboring region thereof, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Hereinafter, for the sake of brevity, the portion of the stack ST that is newly etched through the second patterning process S<b>22</b> will be referred to as a “second etched portion E<b>2</b>”. According to the present embodiment, since the second patterning process S<b>22</b> is performed in the selective etching manner, the second etched portion E<b>2</b> may be locally formed on, for example, only the second region R<b>2</b>. Accordingly, two portions of the stack ST positioned on the first region R<b>1</b> and the second region R<b>2</b> may no longer have the mirror symmetry with respect to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">Further, since the second patterning process S<b>22</b> is performed in the single-layer etching manner, two portions of the stack ST positioned on the first region R<b>1</b> and the second region R<b>2</b> may be formed to have a height difference corresponding to the vertical pitch P of the horizontal layer <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the horizontal layers <b>100</b> constituting the stack ST can be formed to have the stepwise connection structure described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In addition, according to the above described embodiments, each of the horizontal layers <b>100</b> may be formed to have the connection portion CP and the aligned portion AP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4 and 8</figref>, an interconnection structure <b>300</b> may be formed on the structure, to which the second patterning process S<b>22</b> has performed (in S<b>3</b>). In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the interconnection structure <b>300</b> may include plugs <b>301</b> coupled to the connection portions CP of the horizontal layers <b>100</b>, respectively, and pads <b>302</b>, via plugs <b>303</b>, and metal line <b>304</b>, which may be electrically connected to the plugs <b>301</b>, respectively, but exemplary embodiments may not be limited thereto. Furthermore, before the formation of the interconnection structure <b>300</b>, an etch stop layer <b>99</b> may be further formed to cover the resulting structure, to which the second patterning process S<b>22</b> has performed. In other embodiments, an insulating spacer (not shown) may be further formed on exposed sidewalls of the horizontal layers <b>100</b>. Due to the presence of the insulating spacer and/or the etch stop layer <b>99</b>, it is possible to prevent an unintended electric path from being formed between the horizontal layer <b>100</b> and the plug <b>301</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">According to the above described examples, an etch depth in each etching step of the first patterning process S<b>21</b> may be twice the vertical pitch of the horizontal layer <b>100</b> (i.e., <b>2</b>P), while an etch depth in the second patterning process S<b>22</b> may be the vertical pitch of the horizontal layer <b>100</b> (i.e., P).

During the common single-layer etching steps S<b>21</b>, the above described mask shrinking steps may be performed to the third etch mask <b>243</b>. Accordingly, as the common single-layer etching S<b>21</b> progresses, an etched portion of the stack ST may become wider and wide, thereby forming third etched portions E<b>3</b>, which are provided on the first to third regions D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, and D<b>3</b>, respectively, and each of which has a downward tapered vertical section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 43</figref>, a first interlayered insulating layer <b>251</b> may be formed to fill the first to third etched portions E<b>3</b>.

In the case where the second side surface SS<b>2</b> of the dummy pattern DP has the slant side surface, it is possible to prevent a thinning of the second or third etch mask <b>242</b> or <b>243</b> and process failures caused by the thinning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Due to the presence of the dummy patterns DP, it is possible to prevent a height of the stack ST to being abruptly changed near an edge of the stack ST.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, as the result of the common single-layer etching S<b>21</b>, each of the first etched portions E<b>1</b> may be formed to have a width smaller than that of portions STR of the stack ST located therebetween.

A semiconductor device according to the comparative embodiment may be formed by a patterning process, in which a selective etching manner and/or a multi-layer etching manner are not adopted. For example, in the comparative embodiment, the semiconductor device may be fabricated through a plurality of etching steps performed in a common single-layer etching. In this case, the semiconductor device according to exemplary embodiments may be formed to have a first stepwise structure ST<b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, while the semiconductor device according to the comparative embodiment may be formed to have a second stepwise structure ST<b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54 and 55</figref>, in the case of exemplary embodiments, at least one of steps in the first stepwise structure ST<b>1</b> may have a thickness that is equivalent to or greater than twice the vertical pitch P of the horizontal layer <b>100</b>, as the result of the use of the patterning process based on the above described multi-layer etching manner.
