<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The following account of the prior art relates to one of the areas of application of the present application, hearing aids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The human ability to spatially localize a sound source is to a large extent dependent on perception of the sound at both ears. Due to different physical distances between the sound source and the left and right ears, a difference in time of arrival of a given wavefront of the sound at the left and right ears is experienced (the Interaural Time Difference, ITD). Consequently, a difference in phase of the sound signal (at a given point in time) will likewise be experienced and in particular perceivable at relatively low frequencies (e.g. below 1500 Hz). Due to the shadowing effect of the head (diffraction), a difference in level of the received sound signal at the left and right ears is likewise experienced (the Interaural Level Difference, ILD). The attenuation by the head (and body) is larger at relatively higher frequencies (e.g. above 1500 Hz). The detection of the cues provided by the ITD and ILD largely determine our ability to localize a sound source in a horizontal plane (i.e. perpendicular to a longitudinal direction of a standing person). The diffraction of sound by the head (and body) is described by the Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTF). The HRTF for the left and right ears ideally describe respective transfer functions from a sound source (from a given direction) to the ear drums of the left and right ears. If correctly determined, the HRTFs provide the relevant ITD and ILD between the left and right ears for a given direction of sound relative to the user's ears. Such HRTF<sub>left </sub>and HRTF<sub>right </sub>are preferably applied to a sound signal received by a left and right hearing assistance device in order to improve a user's sound localization ability (cf. e.g. Chapter 14 of [Dillon; 2001]).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Several methods of generating HRTFs are known. Standard HRTFs from a dummy head can e.g. be provided, as e.g. derived from Gardner and Martin's KEMAR HRTF database [Gardner and Martin, 1994] and applied to sound signals received by left and right hearing assistance devices of a specific user. Alternatively, a direct measurement of the user's HRTF, e.g. during a fitting session can—in principle—be performed, and the results thereof be stored in a memory of the respective (left and right) hearing assistance devices. During use, e.g. in case the hearing assistance device is of the Behind The Ear (BTE) type, where the microphone(s) that pick up the sound typically are located near the top of (and often, a little behind) pinna, a direction of impingement of the sound source is determined by each device, and the respective relative HRTFs are applied to the (raw) microphone signal to (re)establish the relevant localization cues in the signal presented to the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">WO2010115227A1 describes a method and system for allowing a recipient of a bilateral hearing aid system, to locate the source of a sound signal about the recipient using localization cues (e.g. interaural level difference (ILD)) in the sound signal, which are modified (e.g. transposed to a lower frequency) to provide useable localization cues to generate a stimulating signal for application to the recipient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">US2004218771A1 describes a method for producing an approximated partial transfer function for use in an electroacoustic appliance for producing an environment correction transfer function that matches an appliance transfer function for the electroacoustic appliance to an acoustic environment. An environment correction transfer function to standard HRTFs is determined, the correction determining the partial transfer function due to the specific environmental conditions and the particular hearing aid used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">WO2009001277A1 describes a binaural object-oriented audio decoder for providing an enhanced binaural object-oriented audio decoder by modifying the received head-related transfer function parameters according to a received desired distance, which allows an arbitrary virtual positioning of objects in a space.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In the present disclosure, a binaural fitting is intended to mean a hearing assistance device-pair adapted to be able to exchange data between them, ‘data’ being audio signals, control signals, and/or other parameters. According to the present disclosure—with a binaural fitting—it is possible to learn the individual Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTF's) from the sources over a given time, which will allow the device to modify the position of nearby sound sources or position virtual sources. With this approach it is possible to skip the measurement (or estimate) of the individual HRTF during hearing instrument fitting. A bilateral fitting, on the other hand, is intended to mean a hearing assistance device-pair adapted for being worn at both ears of a user, but lacking the capability of exchanging data between them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">EP 2 563 045 A1 states that with a binaural fit, it is possible to learn the HRTF's from the sources over a given time. When the HRTF's have been learned it is possible to switch to the bilateral BEE estimation to minimize the inter-instrument communication. With this approach it is possible to skip the measurement of the HRTF during hearing instrument fitting, and minimize the power consumption from inter-instrument communication. Whenever the set of hearing instruments have found that the difference in chosen frequency bands is sufficiently small between the binaural and bilateral estimation for a given spatial location, the instrument can rely on the bilateral estimation method for that spatial location.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the present application is to provide an adaptive and improved binaural hearing assistance system.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0034">In an embodiment, the system is configured so that whenever the set of hearing instruments (hearing assistance devices) have found that the difference (A<sub>s</sub>[k], Θ<sub>s</sub>[k]) in chosen frequency bands (k) is greater than the learning threshold τ<sub>A </sub>or τ<sub>Θ </sub>between stored and the estimated values for the given location (θ<sub>s</sub>,φ<sub>s</sub>,d<sub>s</sub>), the instrument (hearing assistance device) can update the HRTF database according to a learning rule.</div>

In an embodiment, the source separation unit is configured to provide a time-frequency representation X<sub>s</sub>(n,k) of said separated sound source signals X<sub>s </sub>(and/or said electric input signals)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0040">In an embodiment, each hearing assistance device, e.g. the input unit, comprise(s) a TF-conversion unit for providing a time-frequency representation of an input signal. In an embodiment, the time-frequency representation comprises an array or map of corresponding complex or real values of the signal in question in a particular time and frequency range. In an embodiment, the TF conversion unit comprises a filter bank for filtering a (time varying) input signal and providing a number of (time varying) output signals each comprising a distinct frequency range of the input signal. In an embodiment, the TF conversion unit comprises a Fourier transformation unit (e.g. based on an FFT-, e.g. a DFT-algorithm) for converting a time variant input signal to a (time variant) signal in the frequency domain. In an embodiment, the frequency range considered by the hearing assistance device from a minimum frequency f<sub>min </sub>to a maximum frequency f<sub>max </sub>comprises a part of the typical human audible frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, e.g. a part of the range from 20 Hz to 12 kHz.

In an embodiment, the hearing assistance device is/are adapted to process a signal of the forward and/or analysis path in a number NP of different frequency channels (NP≦NI). The frequency channels may be uniform or non-uniform in width (e.g. increasing in width with frequency), overlapping or non-overlapping.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0042">In an embodiment, the input unit of a hearing assistance device comprises a number of input transducers, e.g. two or more input transducers. In an embodiment, an input transducer comprises a microphone. In an embodiment, an input transducer comprises a wireless receiver. In an embodiment, an input transducer is adapted for converting an input sound to an electric input signal. In an embodiment, an input transducer comprises a microphone, e.g. a directional or an omni-directional microphone. In an embodiment, the hearing assistance system (e.g. each hearing assistance device, e.g. embodied in the input unit and/or the source separation unit) comprises a directional microphone system adapted to enhance a target acoustic source among a multitude of acoustic sources in the local environment of the user wearing the hearing assistance system. In an embodiment, the directional system is adapted to detect (such as adaptively detect) from which direction (and/or e.g. from which distance) a particular part of the microphone signal (e.g. a particular sound source) originates. This can be achieved in various different ways as e.g. described in the prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0043">In an embodiment, the input unit comprises an antenna and transceiver circuitry for wirelessly receiving a direct electric input signal from another device, e.g. a communication device or another hearing assistance device. In an embodiment, the direct electric input signal represents or comprises an audio signal and/or a control signal and/or an information signal. In an embodiment, the transceiver circuitry comprises demodulation circuitry for demodulating the received direct electric input to provide the direct electric input signal representing an audio signal and/or a control signal. In general, the wireless link established by the antenna and transceiver circuitry of the hearing assistance device can be of any type. In an embodiment, the wireless link is used under power constraints, e.g. in that the hearing assistance device is or comprises a portable (typically battery driven) device. In an embodiment, the wireless link is a link based on near-field communication, e.g. an inductive link based on an inductive coupling between antenna coils of transmitter and receiver parts. In another embodiment, the wireless link is based on far-field, electromagnetic radiation (radiated fields (RF)). In an embodiment, the wireless link is based on a standardized or proprietary technology. In an embodiment, the wireless link is based on Bluetooth technology (e.g. Bluetooth Low-Energy technology).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0044">In an embodiment, the localization parameters (e.g. absolute or relative spatial coordinates) of the sound source S<sub>s </sub>(s=1, 2, . . . , Ns) in the left and right hearing assistance devices are referred to a coordinate system having its center midway between the left and right hearing assistance devices, when operationally mounted on (or implanted in) the user (i.e. typically midway between the ears of the user, cf. e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). In an embodiment, the separated sound source signals X<sub>s</sub> <sup>l</sup>, X<sub>s</sub> <sup>r </sup>and the corresponding localization parameters LP<sub>s</sub> <sup>l</sup>, LP<sub>s</sub> <sup>r </sup>of the left and right hearing assistance devices are exchanged between the left and right hearing assistance devices. During learning of HRTF's, similarities (or differences) in the localization parameters determined in each of the hearing assistance devices for a given sound source (as seen from the midpoint between the ears) reveals how much the devices agree (or disagree). For sources in front of the listener, the degree to which the location of such sources coincide (e.g. an absolute or relative deviation between the localization parameters of the left and right hearing assistance devices) represent an estimation of an accuracy measure, which can be used to decide how much an observation should be allowed to update the HRTF database (e.g. determine a weight of the new value in an update algorithm, cf. e.g. parameter a in the learning rule exemplified above).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0045">In an embodiment, some or all of the electric input signals, some or all of the separated sound source signals X<sub>s</sub> <sup>l</sup>, X<sub>s</sub> <sup>r </sup>and some or all of the localization parameters are exchanged between the left and right hearing assistance devices (i.e. the localization parameters are not exchanged).</div>

During use of the learned HRTF, exchange of the localization parameters requires less bandwidth than exchange of separated audio signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0048">In an embodiment (e.g. in a specific third mode of operation), the separated sound source signals as well as the corresponding localization parameters are exchanged between the left and right hearing assistance devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0049">In an embodiment (e.g. in a specific fourth mode of operation), sound source signals for selected sources and/or localization parameters of the same and/or other sound sources are exchanged between the left and right hearing assistance devices.</div>

This allows e.g. the hearing assistance devices to probe each other about currently dominant sound sources and/or their spatial directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0051">Exchanging the localization parameters, and including both entries (of the left and right devise) in the HRTF tables of each hearing assistance device has the potential advantage of improving the HRTF-accuracy.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0057">In other words, the relative HRTF accounts for the difference between the sound from a given source S<sub>e </sub>at the right and left ears. This ‘difference’ can then be applied to a signal without directional cues (X<sub>e </sub>e.g. a directly received electric signal, e.g. a streamed signal). Thereby the time and level differences normally accounted for by the different locations of the ears relative to the sound source and to the shadowing effect of the human head (etc.) can be applied to a signal (X<sub>e</sub>) without directional cues (to thereby e.g. virtually ‘placing’ a directly received electric signal in the environment around the user).</div>

In an embodiment, the sound represented by the direct electric input is a single channel sound (mono), or alternatively a multichannel sound where each channel has its own position. In an embodiment, the binaural hearing assistance system is configured to estimate the position of the sound source from the direction to the origin of the sound source (or direct electric signal). In an embodiment, the binaural hearing assistance system is configured to exchange localization data of (e.g. the position of and/or direction to) the sound source between the two hearing assistance devices.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">Manipulating the Position of a Signal</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0063">In an embodiment, the binaural hearing assistance system comprises a user interface (e.g. a remote control, e.g. implemented as an APP of a SmartPhone) from which a user can select a suitable position, e.g. by ‘placing’ a sound source in the current acoustic environment (e.g. via a graphical interface illustrating currently active (real or virtual, e.g. directly received sound signals) sound source(s) relative to the user).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0064">The HRTF database also allows for manipulation of the perceived position of sounds that have been affected by the wearer's HRTF. Modifying the perceived location of a signal is a two step procedure where the resulting signals Y<sub>e</sub> <sup>lr </sup>undergo a compensation for the HRTF corresponding to the signal's physical position and application of the HRTF corresponding to the chosen perceived position. For instance, this allows device-pairs to increase the perceived distance between concurrent sounds.</div>

<heading id="h-0014">DEFINITIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0092">In the present context, a ‘hearing assistance device’ refers to a device, such as e.g. a hearing instrument or an active ear-protection device or other audio processing device, which is adapted to improve, augment and/or protect the hearing capability of a user by receiving acoustic signals from the user's surroundings, generating corresponding audio signals, possibly modifying the audio signals and providing the possibly modified audio signals as audible signals to at least one of the user's ears. A ‘hearing assistance device’ further refers to a device such as an earphone or a headset adapted to receive audio signals electronically, possibly modifying the audio signals and providing the possibly modified audio signals as audible signals to at least one of the user's ears. Such audible signals may e.g. be provided in the form of acoustic signals radiated into the user's outer ears, acoustic signals transferred as mechanical vibrations to the user's inner ears through the bone structure of the user's head and/or through parts of the middle ear as well as electric signals transferred directly or indirectly to the cochlear nerve of the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0093">The hearing assistance device may be configured to be worn in any known way, e.g. as a unit arranged behind the ear with a tube leading radiated acoustic signals into the ear canal or with a loudspeaker arranged close to or in the ear canal, as a unit entirely or partly arranged in the pinna and/or in the ear canal, as a unit attached to a fixture implanted into the skull bone, as an entirely or partly implanted unit, etc. The hearing assistance device may comprise a single unit or several units communicating electronically with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0094">More generally, a hearing assistance device comprises an input transducer for receiving an acoustic signal from a user's surroundings and providing a corresponding input audio signal and/or a receiver for electronically (i.e. wired or wirelessly) receiving an input audio signal, a signal processing circuit for processing the input audio signal and an output means for providing an audible signal to the user in dependence on the processed audio signal. In some hearing assistance devices, an amplifier may constitute the signal processing circuit. In some hearing assistance devices, the output means may comprise an output transducer, such as e.g. a loudspeaker for providing an air-borne acoustic signal or a vibrator for providing a structure-borne or liquid-borne acoustic signal. In some hearing assistance devices, the output means may comprise one or more output electrodes for providing electric signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0095">In some hearing assistance devices, the vibrator may be adapted to provide a structure-borne acoustic signal transcutaneously or percutaneously to the skull bone. In some hearing assistance devices, the vibrator may be implanted in the middle ear and/or in the inner ear. In some hearing assistance devices, the vibrator may be adapted to provide a structure-borne acoustic signal to a middle-ear bone and/or to the cochlea. In some hearing assistance devices, the vibrator may be adapted to provide a liquid-borne acoustic signal to the cochlear liquid, e.g. through the oval window. In some hearing assistance devices, the output electrodes may be implanted in the cochlea or on the inside of the skull bone and may be adapted to provide the electric signals to the hair cells of the cochlea, to one or more hearing nerves, to the auditory cortex and/or to other parts of the cerebral cortex.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0096">A ‘listening system’ refers to a system comprising one or two hearing assistance devices, and a ‘binaural listening system’ refers to a system comprising one or two hearing assistance devices and being adapted to cooperatively provide audible signals to both of the user's ears. Listening systems or binaural listening systems may further comprise ‘auxiliary devices’, which communicate with the hearing assistance devices and affect and/or benefit from the function of the hearing assistance devices. Auxiliary devices may be e.g. remote controls, audio gateway devices, mobile phones, public-address systems, car audio systems or music players.

Left and right microphones mic<sub>l</sub>, mic<sub>r </sub>of the left and right hearing assistance devices HAD<sub>l</sub>, HAD<sub>r </sub>received time variant sound signals sound source S<sub>s</sub>. The sound signals are received by the respective microphones and converted electric input signals and provided in a time frequency representation in the form of (complex) digital signals X<sub>sl</sub>[n,k] and X<sub>sr</sub>[n,k] in the left and right hearing assistance devices HAD<sub>l</sub>, HAD<sub>r </sub>(see also <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), n being a time index and k being a frequency index.

The different distances, d<sub>sl </sub>and d<sub>sr</sub>, from the sound source S<sub>s </sub>to the left and right hearing assistance devices HAD<sub>l</sub>, HAD<sub>r</sub>, respectively, account for different times of arrival of a given sound wave-front at the two microphones mic<sub>l</sub>, mic<sub>r</sub>, hence resulting in an ITD(d<sub>s</sub>, θ<sub>s</sub>, φ<sub>s</sub>). Likewise the different constitution of the propagation paths (the path to the right hearing assistance device HAD<sub>r </sub>is influenced by the users' head (as indicated by the dotted line segment of the vector d<sub>sr</sub>), the path to the left hearing assistance device HAD<sub>l </sub>is NOT) gives rise to different levels of the received signals at the two microphones mic<sub>l</sub>, mic<sub>r</sub>. In other words an ILD(d<sub>s</sub>, θ<sub>s</sub>, φ<sub>s</sub>) is observed. These differences (that are perceived by a normally hearing person as localization cues) are to a certain extent (depending on the actual location of the microphones on the hearing assistance device) reflected in the signals X<sub>sl</sub>[n,k] and X<sub>sr</sub>[n,k] and can be used to extract the head related transfer functions for the given geometrical scenario point source located at (d<sub>s</sub>, θ<sub>s</sub>, φ<sub>s</sub>).</div>

The audio sources and the audio gateway device may be paired using the button BT-pair on the auxiliary device. Once paired, the BT-address of the audio source may be stored in a memory of the audio gateway device for easy future pairing. The links to the audio sources may alternatively or additionally be implemented in any other convenient wireless and/or wired manner, and according to any appropriate modulation type or transmission standard, possibly different for different audio sources. The auxiliary device may function as a remote control of the binaural hearing assistance system.

The hearing assistance devices of the system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> each comprises a wireless transceiver, here indicated to be based on inductive communication (I-Rx). The transceiver (at least) comprises an inductive receiver (i.e. an inductive coil, which is inductively coupled to a corresponding coil in a transceiver (I-Tx) of the audio gateway device (AD)), which is adapted to receive the audio signal from the audio gateway device (either as a baseband signal or as a modulated (analogue or digital) signal, and in the latter case to extract the audio signal from the modulated signal). The inductive links WL-I between the auxiliary device AD and each of the hearing instruments are indicated to be one-way, but may alternatively be two-way (e.g. to be able to exchange control signals between transmitting (AD) and receiving (HAD<sub>l</sub>, HAD<sub>r</sub>) device, e.g. to agree on an appropriate transmission channel, or to exchange other signals or parameters, e.g. audio signals or localization parameters). Alternatively or additionally, the hearing assistance device(s) may be adapted to receive one or more audio signals directly transmitted to the hearing assistance device(s) from other sound sources in the environment. The left and right hearing assistance devices may e.g. be embodied in respective left and right hearing instruments, each comprising a BTE-part (adapted for being located Behind The Ear (BTE) of the user) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Each of the left and right hearing instrument may comprise one or more microphones (mic<sub>l </sub>and mic<sub>r</sub>, respectively). One or both of the hearing instruments may e.g. be adapted to compensate for a hearing impairment of the user.

The hearing assistance devices are adapted to exchange information via wireless link IA-WL and transceivers RxTx. The information that can be exchanged between the two hearing assistance devices comprises e.g. information (e.g. sound source localization information or HRTFs), control signals and/or audio signals (e.g. one or more (e.g. all) frequency bands of one or more audio signals).

In an embodiment, all of these components are located in the housing of the BTE-part. In such case the sound from the output transducer may be propagated to the ear canal of the user via a tube connected to a loudspeaker outlet of the BTE-part. The tube may be connected to an ear mould specifically adapted to the form of the users' ear canal and allowing sound signals from the loudspeaker to reach the ear drum of the ear in question. In an embodiment, the ear mould or other part located in or near the ear canal of the user comprises a microphone (e.g. located at the entrance to ear canal) which form part of the input unit of the corresponding hearing assistance device and thus may constitute one of the electric input signals that are used to separate the sound sources S<sub>s </sub>in the environment from each other. Alternatively, the output transducer may be located separately from the BTE-part, e.g. in the ear canal of the user, and electrically connected to the signal processing unit of the BTE-part (e.g. via electric conductors or a wireless link).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0119"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows an embodiment of a binaural or a bilateral hearing assistance system, e.g. a hearing aid system, comprising left and right hearing assistance devices (HAD<sub>l</sub>, HAD<sub>r</sub>), in the following termed hearing instruments. The left and right hearing instruments are adapted for being located at or in left and right ears of a user. The hearing instruments are adapted for exchanging information between them via a wireless communication link, here via a specific inter-aural (IA) wireless link (IA-WL) implemented by corresponding antenna and transceiver circuitry (IA-Rx/Tx-l and IA-Rx/Tx-r). of the left and right hearing instruments, respectively). The two hearing instruments (HAD<sub>l</sub>, HAD<sub>r</sub>) are adapted to allow the exchange of audio source signals X<sub>s </sub>and localization parameters LP<sub>s </sub>of the corresponding source signals S<sub>s </sub>between the two hearing instruments, cf. dotted arrows indicating a transfer of signals X<sub>s</sub> <sup>r</sup>, LP<sub>s</sub> <sup>r </sup>from the right to the left instrument and signals X<sub>s</sub> <sup>l</sup>, LP<sub>s</sub> <sup>l </sup>from the left to the right instruments. Each hearing instrument (HAD<sub>l</sub>, HAD<sub>r</sub>) comprise a forward signal path comprising an input unit (IU<sub>l</sub>, IU<sub>r</sub>) operatively connected to a signal processing unit (SPU) and an output unit (here loudspeaker (SPK)). Between the input unit IU and the signal processing unit SPU, and in operative connection with both, a source separation and localization unit (SEP-LOC) is located. The source separation and localization unit (SEP-LOC) is adapted to provide separated sound source signals (X<sub>s</sub> <sup>l</sup>, X<sub>s</sub> <sup>r</sup>, s=1, 2, . . . N<sub>s</sub>) and corresponding localization parameters (LP<sub>s</sub> <sup>l</sup>, LP<sub>s</sub> <sup>r</sup>, s=1, 2, . . . N<sub>s</sub>) based on a number of electric input signals (INm1, INm2, INw) from the input unit (IU), each electric input signal representing a sound or audio signal. In the present embodiment, the electric input signals (INm1, INm2) are signals from two microphones (mic<sub>l1</sub>, mic<sub>l2 </sub>and mic<sub>r1</sub>, mic<sub>r2 </sub>of the left and right hearing instruments, respectively) and (INw) from a wireless receiver comprising antenna (ANT) and transceiver circuitry (RF-Rx/Tx-l and RF-Rx/Tx-r of the left and right instruments, respectively). The forward path further comprises a selector and mixer unit (SEL-MIX-HRTF) for selecting a given source signal (X<sub>s</sub> <sup>l</sup>, X<sub>s</sub> <sup>r</sup>, s=1, 2, . . . N<sub>s</sub>) or mixing a number of source signals and providing a resulting input signal IN to the signal processing unit (SPU). The hearing instruments further comprises a memory (HRTF<sub>l</sub>, HRTF<sub>r</sub>) for storing a database of head related transfer functions HRTF and a calculation and comparator unit (COMP) for determining a HRTF of a current sound source S<sub>s </sub>(from the currently received separated sound source signals X<sub>s</sub> <sup>l </sup>and X<sub>s</sub> <sup>r</sup>, of the left and right hearing instruments, respectively) and comparing such current values with values stored in the database. The calculation and comparator unit (COMP) is configured to update the corresponding HRTF-value of the database according to a predefined learning rule (e.g. controlled via a control signal crit from the signal processing unit SPU). The selector and mixer unit (SEL-MIX-HRTF) is configured to access the memory (HRTF<sub>l</sub>, HRTF<sub>r</sub>) and to apply an appropriate HRTF to a currently received sound source signal (e.g. only to a signal selected for further processing), cf. signal hrtf<sub>l </sub>and hrtf<sub>r </sub>in the left and right hearing instruments, respectively. In the binaural hearing assistance system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, signals X<sub>s</sub> <sup>r</sup>, LP<sub>s</sub> <sup>r </sup>and signals X<sub>s</sub> <sup>l</sup>, LP<sub>s</sub> <sup>l </sup>are transmitted via bi-directional wireless link IA-WL from the right to the left and from the left to the right hearing instruments, respectively. These signals are received and extracted by the respective antenna (ANT) and transceiver circuitry (IA-Rx/Tx-l and IA-Rx/Tx-r) and forwarded to the respective signal processing units (SPU) of the opposite hearing instrument as signals DBS. The source signal and localization data (X<sub>s</sub> <sup>l</sup>, LP<sub>s</sub> <sup>l</sup>) received in the right hearing instrument (HAD<sub>r</sub>) from the left hearing instrument (HAD<sub>l</sub>) can be forwarded from the signal processing unit (SPU) to the HRTF-database (HRTF<sub>r</sub>) of the right hearing instrument (HAD<sub>r</sub>) via signal dbs. Likewise, source signal and localization data (X<sub>s</sub> <sup>r</sup>, LP<sub>s</sub> <sup>r</sup>) can be extracted from the HRTF-database (HRTF<sub>r</sub>) of the right hearing instrument (HAD<sub>r</sub>) and forwarded to the left hearing instrument (HAD<sub>l</sub>) via signal dbs, signal processing unit SPU, signal DBS, antenna and transceiver circuitry (IA-Rx/Tx-r) of the right hearing instrument and wireless link IA-WL. The source signal and/or localization parameters from the local and the opposite hearing instrument can be used together to update the respective HRTF-databases and to apply localization cues provided by the relevant HRFT-values for the selected resulting input signal(s) in the left and right hearing instruments. Each (or one of the) hearing instruments comprises a manually operable and/or a remotely operable user interface (UI) for generating a control signal UC, e.g. for providing a user input to one or more or the signal processing unit (SPU), the HRTF-database (HRTF<sub>l</sub>, HRTF<sub>r</sub>), the selector and mixer unit (SEL-MIX-HRTF) and the separation and localization unit (SEP-LOC) (e.g. for selecting a target signal among a number of signals in the sound field picked up by the input unit (IU)). In an embodiment, a given sound source can be ‘relocated’ via the user interface, so that it is perceived as originating at a location determined by the user, such location possibly being virtual (e.g. allocated to a directly received audio input signal) and/or deviating from the physical location of the sound source as determined by the separation and localization unit (SEP-LOC) (e.g. originating from a speaker in the environment of the user). Such user interface is discussed in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>

In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a new sound source S<sub>4 </sub>has been detected (e.g. a wirelessly received direct electric audio signal source), and the user interface UI is configured to allow the user to spatially place the new source in the current sound source arrangement according to wish (e.g. by dragging the source symbol to the left of text indication ‘S<sub>4</sub>’ and dropping it at an appropriate location relative to the user). The binaural hearing assistance system (including the auxiliary device) is configured to determine and transmit localization parameters LP<sub>4 </sub>corresponding to the location of S<sub>4 </sub>as proposed by the user via the user interface to the left and right hearing assistance devices (HAD<sub>l</sub>, HAD<sub>r</sub>) of the binaural hearing assistance system. The binaural hearing assistance system (including the left and right hearing assistance devices) is adapted to receive the localization parameters LP<sub>4 </sub>and to apply corresponding head related transfer functions HRTF (HRTF<sub>l</sub>(LP<sub>4</sub>), HRTF<sub>r</sub>(LP<sub>4</sub>)) to the sound source signal S<sub>4 </sub>in the left and right hearing assistance devices, respectively. Additionally, the user is allowed to manipulate the sound field by placing one or more sound sources at another position than its/their physical (or otherwise proposed) location.</div>
