<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an insulated gate transistor including an oxide semiconductor.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, techniques to form insulated gate transistors using a semiconductor thin film (with a thickness of approximately several nanometers to several hundreds of nanometers) which is formed over a substrate having an insulating surface have attracted attention. The insulated gate transistor is widely applied to electronic devices such as an IC and an electro-optical device and has been expected to be rapidly developed particularly as a switching element for an image display device. Various metal oxides exist and are used for a variety of applications. Indium oxide is a well-known material and is used as a transparent electrode material which is necessary for liquid crystal displays and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Some metal oxides have semiconductor characteristics. Examples of such metal oxides having semiconductor characteristics include tungsten oxide, tin oxide, indium oxide, and zinc oxide. Insulated gate transistors in each of which such metal oxide having semiconductor characteristics is used for a channel formation region have already been known (Patent Documents 1 and 2).</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">An element including an oxide semiconductor has relatively high field-effect mobility and thus can be applied not only to a switching element of a pixel of a display device but also to a driver circuit. Further, an element including an oxide semiconductor can also be applied to a device which conventionally includes a bulk transistor, such as a memory element or an image pickup device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">For any use, an element is desired to be reduced in size in terms of high precision or high integration, and the limit of size reduction needs to be determined in consideration of problems caused by factors combined with a structure, such as a short-channel effect, as well as properties of a material and a physical processing technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of an embodiment of the present invention is to provide an insulated gate transistor having favorable electric characteristics, in which a short-channel effect can be suppressed to the utmost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a highly-purified oxide semiconductor, which has been subjected to a step of dehydration or dehydrogenation and a step of adding oxygen, is used for an oxide semiconductor layer of an insulated gate transistor, in which a channel region is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">An oxide semiconductor according to an embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor which becomes intrinsic or substantially intrinsic by reducing impurities to be electron donors (donors) to a minimum, and has a larger energy gap than a silicon semiconductor. Specifically, the energy gap of an oxide semiconductor is 2 eV or more, preferably 2.5 eV or more, more preferably 3 eV or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">That is, an embodiment of the present invention is an insulated gate transistor where a channel region is formed using an oxide semiconductor. In the oxide semiconductor, hydrogen or an OH group contained in the oxide semiconductor is removed so that the concentration of hydrogen in the oxide semiconductor is 5×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, preferably 5×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, more preferably 5×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, still more preferably 1×10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less as the minimum measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and the carrier concentration is less than 1×10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably less than 1×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably less than or equal to 1.45×10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is an intrinsic carrier concentration of silicon. In silicon or gallium arsenide which is generally used, such an extremely low carrier concentration cannot be achieved even if the concentration of donors or acceptors is sufficiently reduced. That is because the energy gaps of silicon and gallium arsenide are each a little more than 1 eV, and with such a level of energy gap, careers are generated due to thermal excitation at around room temperature. Further, in wide band gap semiconductors such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, there are significantly few careers generated due to thermal excitation; however, a crystal defect, a local stoichiometric difference, or the like causes generation of carriers. Therefore, in such a semiconductor material, an extremely low carrier concentration cannot be achieved unless the semiconductor material has an ideal crystal with few defects. In other words, an oxide semiconductor used in an embodiment of the present invention can have its career concentration only by having a characteristic of having an energy gap of 2 eV or more, preferably 2.5 eV or more, more preferably 3 eV or more and a characteristic of having no carriers due to a crystal defect or the like, which are characteristics peculiar to an oxide semiconductor. According to findings of the present inventors, in many oxide semiconductors, particularly in an oxide semiconductor containing zinc, impurities do not become donors or acceptors, with a few exceptions such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and the ionization rate of hydrogen is considerably low. It is known that carriers are generated by oxygen vacancy (oxygen deficiency) in these oxide semiconductors, and oxygen vacancy can be eliminated by appropriate heat treatment. That is, according to an embodiment of the present invention, an intrinsic or substantially intrinsic semiconductor with such an extremely low carrier concentration described above can be obtained by setting the concentration of hydrogen in an oxide semiconductor to the level described above and then filling oxygen vacancy (oxygen deficiency) through heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">An oxide semiconductor which has been highly purified in the aforementioned manner is used for a channel formation region of an insulated gate transistor, whereby the insulated gate transistor has an electrical characteristic of normally off; therefore, when the drain voltage is a given voltage within the range of 1 V to 10 V, the off current (the current flowing between a source and a drain when a voltage between a gate and the source is 0 V or less) can be 1×10<sup>−13 </sup>A or less, or the off current density (the numeric value obtained by dividing the off current by the channel width of the insulated gate transistor) can be 100 aA/μm (aA: attoampere, a (atto) means 10<sup>−18 </sup>times) or less, preferably 10 aA/μm or less, more preferably 1 aA/μm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Although the significantly low off current characteristic can be obtained as described above, a depletion layer is likely to extend and thus a short-channel effect occurs easily because the channel formation region is formed using such an intrinsic or substantially intrinsic semiconductor with an extremely low carrier concentration. In particular, an oxide semiconductor dealt with in an embodiment of the present invention has a considerably low carrier concentration as pointed out above; thus, even in an insulated gate transistor having a sufficiently long channel length which has not been considered to cause a short-channel effect from general knowledge, a short-channel effect occurs. However, such a fact has not been researched well. The present inventors have found that it is effective to optimize the thicknesses of an oxide semiconductor layer and a gate insulating layer for suppression of such a short-channel effect, as a result of examination in view of the fact. According to an embodiment of the present invention, in an insulated gate transistor with a channel length of 0.2 μm to 3.0 μm inclusive, the maximum of the amount of change in threshold voltage (ΔVth) due to a short-channel effect can be suppressed to less than 0.5 V, preferably 0.25 V or less, more preferably 0.1 V or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">An embodiment of the invention disclosed in this specification is an insulated gate transistor including a gate electrode layer; a gate insulating layer overlapping with the gate electrode layer; an oxide semiconductor layer overlapping with the gate electrode layer with the gate insulating layer therebetween; source and drain electrode layers overlapping with part of the oxide semiconductor layer; and an oxide insulating layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer. The carrier concentration of the oxide semiconductor layer is less than 1×10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. The length of a channel formed in the oxide semiconductor layer is 0.2 μm to 3.0 μm inclusive. The thickness of the oxide semiconductor layer is 15 nm to 30 nm inclusive.

The maximum of the amount of change in threshold voltage (ΔVth) is less than 0.5 V, preferably 0.25 V or less, more preferably 0.1 V or less.

To suppress ΔVth to 0.1 V or less, it is preferable to set the thicknesses of the gate insulating layer and the oxide semiconductor layer to 10 nm to 20 nm inclusive and 15 nm or less, respectively.</div>

In the case of using aluminum, an aluminum material to which an element preventing generation of hillocks and whiskers in an aluminum film, such as silicon, titanium, tantalum, tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, neodymium, or yttrium, is added may be used instead of pure aluminum.</div>

<heading id="h-0009">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Embodiments and an example will be described with reference to drawings. Note that the present invention is not limited to the following description, and it will be easily understood by those skilled in the art that the modes and details of the present invention can be modified in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the following description of the embodiments and the example. Note that in structures of the present invention described below, the same portions or portions having similar functions are denoted by the same reference numerals in different drawings, and description thereof is omitted.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In this embodiment, described will be a structure of an insulated gate transistor according to an embodiment of the present invention and a manufacturing method of the insulated gate transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In this embodiment, an inverted-staggered insulated gate transistor is taken as an example and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a structure thereof. Note that the structure is not limited to an inverted-staggered structure, and any of the other bottom-contact structures, top-gate structures, and the like may be adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The insulated gate transistor illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes, over a substrate <b>400</b>, a gate electrode layer <b>421</b>, a gate insulating layer <b>402</b>, an oxide semiconductor layer <b>404</b>, a source electrode layer <b>445</b> <i>a</i>, a drain electrode layer <b>445</b> <i>b</i>, an oxide insulating layer <b>427</b>, and an insulating layer <b>428</b> serving as a protective film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, “L” in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> indicates the channel length of a channel region formed in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>404</b> and is defined by the distance between the source electrode layer <b>445</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode layer <b>445</b> <i>b</i>. In general, when the distance is short, the proportion of depletion layers of a source region and a drain region, which extend to the channel region, is likely to increase, so that control of a current with a gate voltage is difficult. In other words, a so-called short-channel effect is likely to occur. Particularly in the insulated gate transistor which is an embodiment of the present invention, since an oxide semiconductor layer that is an intrinsic or substantially intrinsic semiconductor with a significantly low carrier concentration is used for a channel formation region, a depletion layer is likely to extend and thus a short-channel effect is likely to be caused.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">When a short-channel effect occurs, for example, the threshold voltage changes and further, the subthreshold swing and the off current increase and the withstand voltage between a source and a drain decreases; thus, properties of a transistor get considerably worse. To suppress a short-channel effect, it is effective to reduce the thickness of an oxide semiconductor layer which is a channel formation layer so that extension of a depletion layer due to a drain electrical field can be suppressed and to reduce the thickness of a gate insulating layer to increase a gate electrical field so that the influence of the drain electrical field is relatively decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Therefore, in the case where the oxide semiconductor layer according to an embodiment of the present invention, which is an intrinsic or substantially intrinsic semiconductor with a significantly low carrier concentration, is used for a channel formation region, the oxide semiconductor layer and a gate insulating layer have preferred ranges of thicknesses with respect to channel lengths in a certain range, which allow a short-channel effect to be suppressed. When an insulated gate transistor with a channel length of 0.2 μm to 3.0 μm inclusive includes an oxide semiconductor layer and a gate insulating layer which have the following thicknesses, the maximum of the amount of change in threshold voltage can be suppressed to less than 0.5 V.</div>

It is preferable that the gate electrode layer be formed with the use of a low-resistance metal material such as aluminum or copper, which is effective; however, the low-resistance metal material is preferably used in combination with a high-melting-point metal material because it has disadvantages such as low heat resistance and a tendency to be corroded.

For example, heating may be performed using an electric furnace at 450° C. for an hour. With an RTA apparatus, dehydration or dehydrogenation can be performed in a short time; therefore, treatment can be performed even at a temperature higher than the strain point of a glass substrate.</div>

The thickness of the silicon oxide film is 100 nm. A practitioner may change these conditions appropriately. Note that instead of quartz (preferably, synthetic quartz), a silicon target may be used as a target used when the silicon oxide film is formed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In that case, the insulating layer is preferably formed removing moisture remaining in the treatment chamber. This is for preventing hydrogen, a hydroxyl group, and moisture from being contained in the insulating layer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">It is preferable to use a high-purity gas from which an impurity such as hydrogen, water, a hydroxyl group, or hydride is removed to a concentration of several ppm or several ppb, as a sputtering gas used when the insulating layer is formed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, there is also a multi-source sputtering apparatus in which a plurality of targets of different materials can be set.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In the case of forming the silicon nitride layer, a substrate may be heated in film formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In the case where the stack of the silicon nitride layer and the silicon oxide layer is thus provided as the insulating layer, the silicon nitride layer and the silicon oxide layer can be formed with the use of a common silicon target in the same treatment chamber. After an sputtering gas containing nitrogen is introduced first, a silicon nitride layer is formed using a silicon target mounted in the treatment chamber, and then, the sputtering gas is switched to an sputtering gas containing oxygen and the same silicon target is used to form a silicon oxide layer. Consequently, the silicon nitride layer and the silicon oxide layer can be formed successively without being exposed to the air; therefore, impurities such as hydrogen and moisture can be prevented from adsorbing onto a surface of the silicon nitride layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Next, a gate insulating layer <b>402</b> is formed over the gate electrode layer <b>421</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Here, an oxide semiconductor layer to be formed later is an oxide semiconductor that becomes intrinsic or substantially intrinsic by removal of impurities (a highly-purified oxide semiconductor) and is quite susceptible to the interface level and the interface electric charge; therefore, the interface with the gate insulating layer is important. For that reason, the gate insulating layer that is to be in contact with a highly-purified oxide semiconductor needs to have high quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, a high-density plasma CVD method using microwaves (2.45 GHz) is preferably employed because an insulating film which is dense and has high withstand voltage and high quality can be formed. When a highly-purified oxide semiconductor and a high-quality gate insulating layer are in close contact with each other, the interface level can be reduced and interface characteristics can be favorable. It is needless to say that another film formation method such as a sputtering method or a plasma CVD method can be employed as long as a high-quality insulating layer can be formed as a gate insulating layer. Moreover, it is possible to form an insulating layer whose quality and characteristics of an interface with an oxide semiconductor are improved through heat treatment performed after the formation of the insulating layer. In any case, an insulating layer that has favorable quality as the gate insulating layer and can reduce interface state density with an oxide semiconductor to form a favorable interface is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, in a gate bias-temperature stress test (BT test) at 85° C. with 2×10<sup>6 </sup>V/cm for 12 hours, if an impurity is added to an oxide semiconductor, a bond between the impurity and a main component of the oxide semiconductor is broken by a high electrical field (B: bias) and high temperature (T: temperature), and a dangling bond generated causes drift of the threshold voltage (Vth). In contrast, according to an embodiment of the present invention, impurities of an oxide semiconductor, particularly hydrogen, water, and the like, are reduced to a minimum and interface characteristics between the oxide semiconductor and the gate insulating layer are made favorable as described above, whereby an insulated gate transistor that is stable with respect to the BT test can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In this embodiment, the gate insulating layer <b>402</b> is formed using a high-density plasma CVD apparatus where microwaves (2.45 GHz) are used.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">A monosilane gas (SiH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and a rare gas are introduced into a chamber as a source gas to generate high-density plasma under a pressure of 10 Pa to 30 Pa, and the insulating layer is formed over the substrate. Subsequently, plasma treatment may be performed on a surface of the insulating layer by introducing nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and a rare gas without exposure to the air after the supply of a monosilane gas is stopped. At least after the formation of the insulating layer, the plasma treatment is performed on the surface of the insulating layer by introducing nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and a rare gas. The insulating layer formed through the above process procedure is an insulating layer whose reliability can be ensured even if it has a small thickness of less than 100 nm, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In forming the gate insulating layer <b>402</b>, the flow ratio of a monosilane gas (SiH<sub>4</sub>) to nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) which are introduced into the chamber is in the range of 1:10 to 1:200.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, the insulating layer formed using the high-density plasma CVD apparatus has excellent step coverage and excellent thickness controllability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">The quality of the insulating layer formed using the high-density plasma CVD apparatus is significantly different from that of an insulating layer obtained by the use of a conventional parallel plate plasma CVD apparatus. For example, the etching rate of the insulating layer formed using the high-density plasma CVD apparatus is lower than that of the insulating layer formed using the parallel plate plasma CVD apparatus by 10% or more or 20% or more when they are compared with each other using the same etchant. That is, the insulating layer formed using the high-density plasma CVD apparatus can be said to be dense.</div>

Note that the gate insulating layer <b>402</b> is preferably formed by a sputtering method so that it contains hydrogen as little as possible. In the case of forming a silicon oxide film by a sputtering method, a silicon target or a quartz target is used as a target and oxygen or a mixed gas of oxygen and argon is used as a sputtering gas.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">Still alternatively, the gate insulating layer <b>402</b> may have a structure in which a silicon oxide layer and a silicon nitride layer are stacked.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The oxide insulating layer <b>427</b>, which has a thickness of 1 nm or more, can be formed as appropriate using a method with which impurities such as water and hydrogen are not mixed into the oxide insulating layer <b>427</b>.

The substrate temperature in film formation may be from a room temperature to 300° C. and in this embodiment, is 100° C. In order to prevent entry of an impurity such as water or hydrogen in the film formation, it is preferable to perform pre-baking under reduced pressure at a temperature from 150° C. to 350° C. for from two to ten minutes so that moisture and the like attached to a surface is volatilized, before the film formation, to form an oxide insulating layer <b>427</b> without exposure to the air. The silicon oxide film can be formed with a sputtering method in a rare gas (typically argon) atmosphere, an oxygen atmosphere, or a mixed atmosphere containing a rare gas (typically argon) and oxygen. Further, a silicon oxide target or a silicon target can be used as a target. For example, with the use of a silicon target, a silicon oxide film can be formed with a sputtering method in an atmosphere of oxygen and a rare gas. The oxide insulating layer which is formed in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer is formed using an inorganic insulating film that does not contain impurities such as moisture, a hydrogen ion, and OH<sup>− </sup>and blocks entry of such impurities from the outside.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">In this embodiment, the second heat treatment is performed after formation of the silicon oxide film; however, the timing of the heat treatment is not limited to the timing immediately after formation of the silicon oxide film as long as it is after formation of the silicon oxide film. Note that the timing of the heat treatment is not limited to that timing and may be performed plural times, for example, before and after a photolithography process or a film formation step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Further, heat treatment may be performed at 100° C. to 200° C. inclusive for one hour to 30 hours inclusive in the air.

Alternatively, the following change in the heating temperature may be conducted plural times repeatedly: the heating temperature is increased from a room temperature to a temperature of 100° C. to 200° C. inclusive and then decreased to a room temperature. Further, this heat treatment may be performed under a reduced pressure before formation of the oxide insulating layer. Under a reduced pressure, the heating time can be shortened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">Next, the insulating layer <b>428</b> that is a protective insulating layer is formed over the oxide insulating layer <b>427</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">When the oxide semiconductor film is formed, residual moisture in an atmosphere is removed and moisture in the film is removed by heat treatment in the above-described manner; thus, the concentration of hydrogen and hydride in the oxide semiconductor film can be reduced.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">A method for manufacturing the insulated gate transistor used for the measurement will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">First, a silicon nitride layer was formed as a base film over a glass substrate by a CVD method, and a silicon oxynitride layer was formed over the silicon nitride layer. Over the silicon oxynitride layer, a tungsten layer was formed as a gate electrode layer by a sputtering method. Here, the tungsten layer was selectively etched to form the gate electrode layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Next, a silicon oxynitride layer having a thickness of 100 nm was formed as a gate insulating layer over the gate electrode layer by a CVD method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Then, an oxide semiconductor film having a thickness of 50 nm was formed over the gate insulating layer by a sputtering method with the use of an In—Ga—Zn—O-based metal oxide semiconductor target (in a molar ratio, In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=1:1:2). Here, the oxide semiconductor film was selectively etched to form an island-shaped oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">After that, first heat treatment was performed on the oxide semiconductor layer in a nitrogen atmosphere in a clean oven at 450° C. for one hour.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Next, a titanium layer (having a thickness of 150 nm) was formed as a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer over the oxide semiconductor layer by a sputtering method.

The insulated gate transistor having a channel length L of 3 μm and a channel width W of 10000 μm was obtained by connecting 200 insulated gate transistors each having a channel length L of 3 μm and a channel width W of 50 μM in parallel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Then, a silicon oxide layer was formed as a protective insulating layer to a thickness of 300 nm in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer by a reactive sputtering method.

After that, second heat treatment was performed at 250° C. for one hour in a nitrogen atmosphere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Then, heat treatment was performed at 150° C. for 10 hours before the measurement of VG-ID characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">Through the above process, a bottom-gate insulated gate transistor was manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">The reason why the off-current of the insulated gate transistor is approximately 1×10<sup>−13 </sup>A as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is that the concentration of hydrogen in the oxide semiconductor layer and oxygen vacancy in the oxide semiconductor layer could be sufficiently reduced in the above manufacturing process. The concentration of hydrogen in the oxide semiconductor layer is 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, preferably 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, more preferably 5×10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, still more preferably 1×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less. Note that the concentration of hydrogen in the oxide semiconductor layer was measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Although the example of using an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor is described above, an embodiment of the present invention is not particularly limited thereto. Another oxide semiconductor material, such as an In—Sn—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor, a Sn—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor, an Al—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor, a Sn—Al—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor, an In—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor, an In—Sn—O-based oxide semiconductor, a Sn—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor, an Al—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor, an In—O-based oxide semiconductor, a Sn—O-based oxide semiconductor, or a Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor, may be used. As another oxide semiconductor material, an In—Al—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor mixed with Al of 2.5 wt % to 10 wt % inclusive or an In—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor mixed with Si of 2.5 wt % to 10 wt % inclusive may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">The carrier concentration of the oxide semiconductor layer measured in C—V measurement is equivalent to that of silicon or less than or equal to that of silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">The insulated gate transistor may have a channel length L of 10 nm to 1000 nm inclusive. In that case, circuit operation speed can be increased, and power consumption can be further reduced since the off current is extremely small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">In addition, in circuit design, the oxide semiconductor layer can be regarded as an insulator when the insulated gate transistor is off.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">After that, the temperature characteristics of off current of the insulated gate transistor manufactured in this embodiment were evaluated. Temperature characteristics are important in considering the environmental resistance, maintenance of performance, or the like of an end product in which the insulated gate transistor is used. It is needless to say that a smaller amount of change is more preferable, which increases design flexibility of a product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">For the temperature characteristics, the VG-ID characteristics were obtained using a thermostat under the conditions where substrates provided with insulated gate transistors are kept at respective constant temperatures of −30° C., 0° C., 25° C., 40° C., 60° C., 80° C., 100° C., and 120° C., the drain voltage is 6 V, and the gate voltage varies between −20 V and +20V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows VG-ID characteristics measured at the above temperatures and superimposed on one another, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows an enlarged view of a range of off current enclosed by a dotted line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The rightmost curve indicated by an arrow in the diagram is a curve obtained at −30° C.; the leftmost curve is a curve obtained at 120° C.; and curves obtained at the other temperatures are located between the rightmost curve and the leftmost curve. The temperature dependence of on current can hardly be observed. On the other hand, as clearly shown also in the enlarged view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, off current is 1×10<sup>−12 </sup>A or less, which is near the resolution of the measurement device, at all temperatures except in the vicinity of a gate voltage of −20 V, and the temperature dependence of off current is not observed. In other words, even at a high temperature of 120° C., the off current is kept 1×10<sup>−12 </sup>A or less, and given that the channel width W is 10000 μm, it can be seen that the off current is significantly small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">Thus, an insulated gate transistor including an intrinsic or substantially intrinsic oxide semiconductor obtained by high purification (purified oxide semiconductor) shows almost no dependence of an off current on temperature. It can be said that an oxide semiconductor does not show dependence on temperature when purified because the conductivity type becomes extremely close to an intrinsic type and the Fermi level is located in the middle of the forbidden band, as illustrated in the band diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. That also results from the fact that the oxide semiconductor has an energy gap of 3 eV or more and includes very few thermally excited carriers. In addition, the source region and the drain region are in a degenerated state, which is also a factor for no dependence on temperature. The insulated gate transistor is operated mainly with carriers which are injected from the degenerated source region to the oxide semiconductor, and the above characteristics (independence of off current from temperature) can be explained by independence of carrier concentration from temperature. This extremely low off current will be described with reference to energy band diagrams below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">In contrast, an oxide semiconductor according to an embodiment of the present invention is an oxide semiconductor that is made to be intrinsic (i-type) or substantially intrinsic in the following manner: hydrogen, which is an n-type impurity, is removed from the oxide semiconductor for high purification, so that the oxide semiconductor includes an impurity other than the main component of the oxide semiconductor as little as possible. That is, a feature of an embodiment of the present invention is that an oxide semiconductor is made to be or be close to a highly-purified i-type (intrinsic) semiconductor not by addition of an impurity but by reduction of impurities such as hydrogen and water to a minimum. Thus, the Fermi level (E<sub>f</sub>) can be comparable with the intrinsic Fermi level (E<sub>i</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">It is said that in the case where the band gap (E<sub>g</sub>) of an oxide semiconductor is 3.15 eV, the electron affinity (χ) is 4.3 eV.

In this case, a Schottky barrier against an electron is not formed at the interface between metal and an oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">That is to say, in the case where the work function of metal (φ<sub>M</sub>) is equal to the electron affinity of an oxide semiconductor (χ), such an energy band diagram (schematic diagram) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is shown when the metal and the oxide semiconductor are in contact with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, a black dot (•) indicates an electron. When a positive potential is supplied to the drain, the electron crosses over a barrier (h) to be injected into the oxide semiconductor, and flows to the drain.

When a positive drain voltage is applied, the height of the barrier (h) is lower than the height of the barrier in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> where a voltage is not applied, that is, half the band gap (E<sub>g</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">At that time, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the electron injected into the oxide semiconductor flows through the oxide semiconductor. Further, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, when a negative potential is supplied to the gate electrode (G<b>1</b>), a hole which is a minority carrier does not exist substantially. Thus, the current value is as close to 0 as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">For example, even in an insulated gate transistor having a channel width W of 1×10<sup>4 </sup>μm and a channel length of 3 μm, an off current can be less than or equal to 10<sup>−13 </sup>A at room temperature and a subthreshold swing (S value) can be 0.1 V/dec.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">Note that the intrinsic carrier concentration of a silicon semiconductor is 1.45×10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>(300 K) and carriers exist even at room temperature.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Therefore, not by simply using an oxide semiconductor having a wide band gap for a transistor but by highly purifying the oxide semiconductor such that an impurity other than a main component can be prevented from being contained therein as much as possible so that the carrier concentration is less than 1×10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably less than 1×10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably less than or equal to 1.45×10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is an intrinsic carrier concentration of silicon, carriers to be thermally excited at a practical operation temperature can be mostly eliminated, and the transistor can operate only with electrons that are injected from the source side. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain a transistor whose off current is reduced to 1×10<sup>−13 </sup>A or less and is hardly changed due to temperature change, whereby the transistor can operate in an extremely stable manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">A technical idea of an embodiment of the present invention is that an impurity is not added to an oxide semiconductor and on the contrary the oxide semiconductor itself is highly purified by removing an impurity such as water or hydrogen which undesirably exists therein.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">In an oxide semiconductor, even shortly after the film formation, hydrogen is observed on the order of 10<sup>20</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">As a result, it is preferable that the oxide semiconductor contain as little hydrogen and carriers as little as possible. The oxide semiconductor is a purified i-type (intrinsic) semiconductor from which carriers have been eliminated and to which a meaning as a path of carriers (electrons) supplied from a source is given, rather than intentionally including carriers of current, when used for an insulated gate transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">As a result, carriers are completely eliminated or significantly reduced from the oxide semiconductor, whereby an off current of an insulated gate transistor can be decreased, which is a technical idea of an embodiment of the present invention. That is to say, as a criterion, the concentration of hydrogen should be 5×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, preferably 5×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, more preferably 5×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less, still more preferably 1×10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less.

According to a technical idea of an embodiment of the present invention, the ideal hydrogen concentration and carrier concentration are zero or close to zero.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">In addition, as a result, the oxide semiconductor functions as a path, and the oxide semiconductor itself is an i-type (intrinsic) semiconductor which is highly purified so as to supply no carriers or extremely few carriers, and carriers are supplied by an electrode on the source or drain side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">Therefore, it is preferable that an off current be as small as possible, and a feature of an embodiment of the present invention is that in characteristics of an insulated gate transistor to which a drain voltage of 1 V to 10 V is applied, the off current per micrometer in channel width is 100 aA/μm or less, preferably 10 aA/μm or less, more preferably 1 aA/μm or less.</div>

<heading id="h-0012">Embodiment 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">In an embodiment of the present invention, an oxide semiconductor which has been made to be intrinsic or substantially intrinsic is applied to an insulated gate transistor. It can be said that in an intrinsic or substantially intrinsic semiconductor, depletion layer is likely to extend and thus a short-channel effect occurs easily. In this embodiment, described will be the range of the channel lengths and the ranges of the thicknesses of an oxide semiconductor layer and a gate insulating layer of an n-channel insulated gate transistor, which allow a short-channel effect to be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">In general, when the channel length is short, depletion layers are likely to extend from a source region and a drain region to a channel region, so that control of on and off with a gate voltage is difficult. In other words, a so-called short-channel effect is likely to occur. The width of the depletion layer depends on the concentration of donors in the channel; as the concentration of donors is reduced, the width of the depletion layer is likely to increase. Particularly in the insulated gate transistor according to an embodiment of the present invention, a short-channel effect occurs easily because an oxide semiconductor layer that is an intrinsic or substantially intrinsic semiconductor with a significantly low carrier concentration is used for a channel formation region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">When a short-channel effect occurs, for example, the threshold voltage decreases, the subthreshold swing and the off current increase, and the withstand voltage between a source and a drain decreases; thus, properties of a transistor get considerably worse. Previously, in most cases, the concentration of donors or acceptors in a channel is increased in a silicon semiconductor so that a short-channel effect can be suppressed. That is because a source or a drain and a channel of an insulated gate transistor can be controlled by pn junction. However, in the oxide semiconductor used in an embodiment of the present invention, in general, it is difficult to raise the concentration of acceptors to increase holes and to form pn junction and it is not preferable to raise the concentration of donors in a channel because an off current is increased. According to an embodiment of the present invention, an intrinsic or substantially intrinsic oxide semiconductor layer is used for a channel formation layer. Therefore, instead of raising the concentration of donors or acceptors in a channel, it is effective to reduce the thickness of the oxide semiconductor layer so that extension of depletion layer due to a drain electrical field can be suppressed as much as possible and to reduce the thickness of a gate insulating layer to increase a gate electrical field so that the influence of the drain electrical field is relatively decreased, in suppressing a short-channel effect. In an embodiment of the present invention, results obtained by the following scientific calculation will be described focusing on the threshold voltage. The preferred ranges of thicknesses of an oxide semiconductor layer and a gate insulating layer with respect to the limited range of channel lengths, which allow a short-channel effect to be suppressed to the utmost, are calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a structural model of an insulated gate transistor used for the scientific calculation. The insulated gate transistor is an inverted-staggered type adopted in Embodiments 1 and 2 similarly and includes a gate electrode layer, a gate insulating layer, an oxide semiconductor layer, a source electrode layer, a drain electrode layer, an oxide insulating layer formed in contact with the source electrode layer, the drain electrode layer, and the oxide semiconductor layer. Note that a structural model of a bottom-contact type or a top-gate type may be used and in that case, an equivalent value is obtained as ΔVth described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">Here, for example, tungsten or molybdenum is used for the gate electrode layer, a silicon oxynitride film is used for the gate insulating layer, an In—Ga—Zn—O film is used for the oxide semiconductor layer, and titanium is used for the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer. Table 1 shows parameters used for the scientific calculation. Note that Nd, Eg, φm, and χ represent concentration of donors, a band gap, a work function, and electron affinity, respectively. The calculation is performed using numeric values of parameters, and any other materials may be used as long as they have equivalent numeric values.

The range of the thicknesses of the gate insulating layer (T<sub>ox</sub>) was 10 nm to 100 nm inclusive (10 nm, 20 nm, 50 nm, and 100 nm). The range of the thicknesses of the oxide semiconductor layer (T<sub>os</sub>) was 15 nm to 500 nm inclusive (15 nm, 30 nm, 50 nm, and 100 nm). Further, the concentration of donors in a channel Nd was assumed to be the intrinsic carrier concentration N<sub>i </sub>of an oxide semiconductor, that was, 1.7×10<sup>−8</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. The other items were also assumed to be the numeric values shown in Table 1 and a device simulator “Atlas” manufactured by Silvaco Data Systems Inc. was used for the calculation. As a mobility model, the “constant low field mobility model” was used, and the intrinsic electron mobility and the intrinsic hole mobility were assumed to be 15 cm<sup>2</sup>/V·sec and 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/V·sec, respectively. In addition, the effective density of states in the conduction band (at the time of 300 K) and the effective density of states in the valence band (at the time of 300 K) were each assumed to be 5×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, and the threshold voltage at the time when the drain voltage is 1V was calculated from the obtained current-voltage characteristics.</div>

<heading id="h-0014">Example</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">In this example, described will be results obtained by manufacturing an insulated gate transistor including a gate insulating layer and an oxide semiconductor layer having thicknesses which allow a short-channel effect to be suppressed and are calculated in Embodiment 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">In this example, results obtained by evaluating electric characteristics of an insulated gate transistor having a structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> will be described. The insulated gate transistor in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a top-gate top-contact type (called TGTC type) transistor and included, over a substrate <b>500</b>, a silicon oxide film as an insulating layer <b>501</b> serving as a base film; a 30-nm In—Ga—Zn—O film as an oxide semiconductor layer <b>504</b>; a 50-nm tungsten film as source and drain electrode layers <b>545</b> <i>a </i>and <b>545</b> <i>b</i>; a 15-nm silicon oxynitride film as a gate insulating layer <b>502</b>; a film containing 30-nm tantalum nitride film and 370-nm tungsten film stacked in this order from the gate insulating layer <b>502</b> side as a gate electrode layer <b>521</b>; and a 300-nm silicon oxide film as an interlayer insulating layer <b>527</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">Although not illustrated, as a wiring layer connected to the source electrode layer <b>545</b> <i>a</i>, the drain electrode layer <b>545</b> <i>b</i>, and the gate electrode layer <b>521</b> through contact holes formed in the interlayer insulating layer, a 50-nm titanium film, a 100-nm aluminum film, and a 5-nm titanium film were formed. Owing to them, electric characteristics of the insulated gate transistor can be easily achieved. Note that L in the drawing denotes channel length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">The method for manufacturing a bottom-gate insulated gate transistor is described in Embodiment 1. Note that a top-gate insulated gate transistor can be manufactured by changing the order of the manufacturing method. Thus, Embodiment 1 can be referred to for the details of the manufacturing method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">As described in Embodiment 3, in order to suppress a short-channel effect so that ΔVth can be less than 0.5 V, the thicknesses of the gate insulating layer and the oxide semiconductor layer are set to 10 nm to 20 nm inclusive and 15 nm to 100 nm inclusive, respectively, or 20 nm to 50 nm inclusive and 15 nm to 30 nm inclusive, respectively, according to the scientific calculation. In the insulated gate transistor evaluated in this example, the thicknesses of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>504</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>502</b> were set to 30 nm and 15 nm, respectively, and the channel length L and the channel width W were set to 0.8 μm and 10.1 μm, respectively, as an example from the above ranges of thicknesses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows VG-ID characteristics of 25 insulated gate transistors, which were measured under conditions where the gate voltage is −6 V to +6 V and the drain voltage is 0.1 V or 3 V and which are superimposed on one another. The solid lines show current and the dotted lines show field-effect mobility in the graph. The median and the average of the threshold voltages of these insulated gate transistors were about 0.25 V and about 0.27 V, respectively. By comparing the results with scientific calculation results shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> (the thickness of a gate insulating layer is 10 nm or 20 nm and the thickness of an oxide semiconductor layer is 30 nm), they are found to be approximate and it was confirmed that a short-channel effect can be suppressed.</div>
