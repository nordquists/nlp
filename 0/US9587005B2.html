<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/426,285, filed on Dec. 22, 2010, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/514,609, filed on Aug. 3, 2011, both applications of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety into the present application.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Incorporated by reference in its entirety is a computer-readable nucleotide/amino acid sequence listing submitted concurrently herewith and identified as follows: 193 kilobytes ACII (Text) file named “DOCS_223734_SeqListing.txt,” created on Dec. 27, 2012.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">According to the most recent data from the National Diabetes Fact Sheet of the American Diabetes Association, 23.6 million children and adults in the United States are afflicted with diabetes. Each year, 1.6 million new cases of diabetes are diagnosed in people aged 20 years or older. According to a study recently published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, over two-thirds of adults in the United States are either overweight or obese (Flegal et al., <i>JAMA </i>303(3): 235-241 (2010)) and over one third of this population is obese.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), are naturally-occurring peptide hormones. Both GLP-1 and GIP stimulate insulin synthesis and secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and do not produce hypoglycemia (see, e.g., Nauck et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 76:912-917 (1993) and Irwin et al., Regul. Pept. 153:70-76 (2009)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">GLP-1 has been shown to be effective as adjunctive therapy for diabetes and is associated with weight loss. What remains unclear about (HP-targeted therapy, however, is whether successful treatment of diabetes and obesity will be achieved through antagonizing the effects of this hormone (e.g., via GIP receptor antagonism) or through mimicking or enhancing the effects of GIP.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Provided herein are peptides that are GIP agonist peptides contemplated for use in treating subjects in need thereof, e.g. with diabetes and obesity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Native glucagon does not activate the GIP receptor, and normally has about 1% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. In some embodiments, the peptides are glucagon analogs comprising a structure based on the amino acid sequence of native human glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) but differing at one or more positions as compared to SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein the differences, or modifications, enhance the agonist activity of the analog at the GIP receptor. Such glucagon analogs will have agonist activity at the GIP receptor greater than that of native glucagon and, in some aspects, greater than that of native GIP. In some or any embodiments, the GIP agonist has a GIP percentage potency of at least 0.1%. In some or any aspects of the present disclosures, the glucagon analog additionally exhibits agonist activity at one or both of the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 receptor. Accordingly, GIP agonists, GIP-GLP-1 co-agonists, GIP-glucagon co-agonists, and GIP-GLP-1-glucagon triagonists are provided herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In exemplary embodiments, the selectivity of the GIP agonist peptide of the present disclosures for the human GLP-1 receptor versus the GIP receptor is less than 100-fold. In some or any embodiments, the GIP agonist peptide has GIP percentage potency within 20-fold or 10-fold different (higher or lower) of the glucagon percentage potency and/or GLP-1 percentage potency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments of the present disclosures, the glucagon analogs comprise (i) an amino acid comprising an imidazole side chain at position 1, (ii) a DPP-IV protective amino acid at position 2, (iii) an amino acid comprising a non-native acyl or alkyl group, optionally at any of positions 9, 10, 12, 16, 20, or 37-43, and optionally wherein the non-native acyl or alkyl group is linked to such amino acid via a spacer; (iv) an alpha helix stabilizing amino acid at one or more of positions 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or 21, and (v) up to ten (e.g., up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9) additional amino acid modifications relative to SEQ ID NO: 1. In exemplary embodiments, the glucagon analog comprising (i) an amino acid comprising an imidazole side chain at position 1, (ii) a DPP-IV protective amino acid at position 2, optionally, aminoisobutyric acid, (iii) an amino acid comprising a non-native acyl or alkyl group, optionally at any of positions 9, 10, 12, 16, 20, or 37-43, optionally wherein the non-native acyl or alkyl group is linked to such amino acid via a spacer; (iv) an alpha, alpha disubstituted amino acid at position 20, and (v) up to ten (e.g., up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9) additional amino acid modifications relative to SEQ ID NO: 1. In alternative exemplary embodiments, the glucagon analog comprising (i) an amino acid comprising an imidazole side chain at position 1, (ii) a DPP-IV protective amino acid at position 2, optionally, aminoisobutyric acid, (iii) an amino acid comprising a non-native acyl or alkyl group, optionally at any of positions 9, 10, 12, 16, 20, or 37-43, optionally wherein the non-native acyl or alkyl group is linked to such amino acid via a spacer; (iv) an alpha helix stability amino acid at one or more of positions 16-21, optionally, position 16, wherein the analog does not comprise an alpha helix stabilizing amino acid at position 20, and (v) up to ten (e.g., up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9) additional amino acid modifications relative to SEQ ID NO: 1. In exemplary embodiments, when the glucagon analog lacks a hydrophilic moiety, the glucagon analog exhibits a GIP percentage potency of at least 0.1% (e.g., at least 1%, at least 10%, at least 20%). In exemplary embodiments, the glucagon analog has less than 100-fold (e.g., less than 50-fold, less than 25-fold, less than 10-fold) selectivity for the human GLP-1 receptor versus the GIP receptor. In exemplary embodiments, the glucagon analog exhibits an EC50 at the GLP-1 receptor which is within 100-fold (e.g., within 50-fold, within 25-fold, within 10-fold) of its EC50 at the GIP receptor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Throughout the application, all references to a particular amino acid position by number (e.g., position 28) refer to the amino acid at that position in native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) or the corresponding amino acid position in any analog thereof. For example, a reference herein to “position 28” would mean the corresponding position 27 for a glucagon analog in which the first amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1 has been deleted. Similarly, a reference herein to “position 28” would mean the corresponding position 29 for a glucagon analog in which one amino acid has been added before the N-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the GIP agonist peptides comprise an amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 27-33, 35-41, 43-46, 76-80, 83-87, 89, and 90, or any of SEQ ID NOs: 48, 52, 53, and 74, or any of SEQ ID NOs: 50, 51, 54, 56, 58-60, 62-66, 68-70, 72, 73, 75, 81, 82, 88, and 92. In some embodiments, the GIP agonist peptides comprise a structure based on a parent sequence comprising any of SEQ ID NOs: 27-33, 35-41, 43-46, 76-80, 83-87, 89, and 90, or any of SEQ ID NOs: 48, 52, 53, and 74, or any of SEQ ID NOs: 50, 51, 54, 56, 58-60, 62-66, 68-70, 72, 73, 75, 81, 82, 88, and 92, but differs from the parent sequence at one or more positions, as further described herein.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0098">The present disclosures provide GIP agonist peptides (e.g., analogs of native human glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) (also referred to as “glucagon analogs”), analogs of any of SEQ ID NOs: 27-33, 35-41, 43-46, 76-80, 83-87, 89, and 90, or any of SEQ ID NOs: 48, 52, 53, and 74, or any of SEQ ID NOs: 50, 51, 54, 56, 58-60, 62-66, 68-70, 72, 73, 75, 81, 82, 88, and 92, analogs of any of SEQ ID NOs: 184-199) which exhibit agonist activity at the GIP receptor. As used herein, the term “peptide” encompasses a sequence of 2 or more amino acids and typically less than 100, or less than 50 amino acids. The amino acids can be naturally occurring or coded or non-naturally occurring or non-coded. Non-naturally occurring amino acids refer to amino acids that do not naturally occur in vivo but which, nevertheless, can be incorporated into the peptide structures described herein. “Non-coded” as used herein refer to an amino acid that is not an L-isomer of any of the following 20 amino acids: Ala, Cys, Asp, Glu, Phe, Gly, His, Ile, Lys, Leu, Met, Asn, Pro, Gln, Arg, Ser, Thr, Val, Trp, Tyr. The term “GIP agonist peptide” refers to a compound that binds to and activates downstream signaling of the GIP receptor. The GIP agonist peptide may have any of the levels of activity at the GIP receptor (e.g., absolute activity level or relative activity level), selectivity for the GIP receptor, or GIP percentage potency, described herein. See, for example, the section entitled GIP Receptor Activity. However, this term should not be construed as limiting the compound to having activity at only the GIP receptor. Rather, the GIP agonist peptides of the present disclosures may exhibit additional activities at other receptors, as further discussed herein. GIP agonist peptides, for example, may exhibit agonist activity at the GLP-1 receptor and/or glucagon receptor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0100">In some or any embodiments, the peptides of the present disclosures exhibit an EC50 for GIP receptor activation which is in the nanomolar range. In exemplary embodiments, the EC50 of the peptide at the GIP receptor is less than 1000 nM, less than 900 nM, less than 800 nM, less than 700 nM, less than 600 nM, less than 500 nM, less than 400 nM, less than 300 nM, less than 200 nM. In some embodiments, the EC50 of the peptide at the GIP receptor is about 100 nM or less, e.g., about 75 nM or less, about 50 nM or less, about 25 nM or less, about 10 nM or less, about 5 nM or less, or about 1 nM or less. In some or any embodiments, the peptide of the present disclosures exhibits an EC50 for GIP receptor activation which is in the picomolar range. In exemplary embodiments, the EC50 of the GIP agonist peptide at the GIP receptor is less than 1000 pM, less than 900 pM, less than 800 pM, less than 700 pM, less than 600 pM, less than 500 pM, less than 400 pM, less than 300 pM, less than 200 pM. In some embodiments, the EC50 of the peptide at the GIP receptor is about 100 pM or less, e.g., about 75 pM or less, about 50 pM or less, about 25 pM or less, about 10 pM or less, about 5 pM or less, or about 1 pM or less. The term “about” as used herein means greater or lesser than the value or range of values stated by 10 percent, but is not intended to designate any value or range of values to only this broader definition. Each value or range of values preceded by the term “about” is also intended to encompass the embodiment of the stated absolute value or range of values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0101">Suitable methods of determining the EC50 of a peptide for activation of a receptor, e.g., the GIP receptor, are known in the art. One exemplary in vitro assay, in which cAMP induction as represented by luciferase activity is measured in HEK293 cells over-expressing the GIP receptor, is described herein at Example 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0102">In some or any embodiments, the peptides (e.g., glucagon analogs, analogs of any of SEQ ID NOs: 27-33, 35-41, 43-46, 76-80, 83-87, 89, and 90, or any of SEQ ID NOs: 48, 52, 53, and 74, or any of SEQ ID NOs: 50, 51, 54, 56, 58-60, 62-66, 68-70, 72, 73, 75, 81, 82, 88, and 92) of the present disclosures exhibit enhanced activity at the GIP receptor, as compared to native human glucagon. Native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) does not activate the GIP receptor; native glucagon exhibits essentially 0% (e.g., less than 0.001%, less than 0.0001%) activity of native GIP at the GIP receptor. A peptide's relative activity at the GIP receptor relative to native glucagon is calculated as the inverse ratio of (EC50 of the peptide of the present disclosures/EC50 of native glucagon)×100%.</div>

In exemplary embodiments, the peptides exhibit at least or about 0.5%, at least or about 1%, at least or about 5%, at least or about 10%, at least or about 20%, at least or about 30%, at least or about 40%, at least or about 50%, at least or about 60%, at least or about 70%, at least or about 80%, at least or about 90%, or at least or about 100% of the activity of native GIP at the GIP receptor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0105">In some embodiments of the present disclosures, the peptides of the present disclosures exhibit activity at the GIP receptor which is greater than that of native GIP.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0109">GIP/GLP-1 Co-Agonists</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0110">By way of example, the peptide of the present disclosures in some aspects exhibits activity at both the GIP receptor and the GLP-1 receptor (“GLP-1/GIP receptor co-agonists”). In some aspects, the peptides exhibit activity at the GLP-1 and GIP receptors, but the glucagon activity has been significantly reduced or destroyed, e.g., by an amino acid modification at position 3. For example, substitution at this position with an acidic, basic, or a hydrophobic amino acid (glutamic acid, ornithine, norleucine) reduces glucagon activity. In some or any embodiments, the GIP agonist peptide is a peptide which exhibits about 10% or less (e.g., about 5% or less, or about 1% or less, or about 0.1% or less) of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0111">In some or any embodiments, the EC50 of the peptide of the present disclosures at the GIP receptor is within about 50-fold or less, about 40-fold or less, about 30-fold or less, about 20-fold or less, or about 10-fold or less, or about 5-fold or less different (higher or lower) from its EC50 at the GLP-1 receptor. For example, the EC50 at the GIP receptor can be 10-fold higher or 10-fold lower than the EC50 at the GLP-1 receptor. In some or any embodiments, the GIP percentage potency of the peptide of the present disclosures is less than or about 50-, 40-, 30-, 20-, 10-, or 5-fold different (higher or lower) from its GLP-1 percentage potency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0112">Accordingly, the peptide of the present disclosures has less than 100-fold selectivity for the human GLP-1 receptor versus the GIP receptor. As used herein, the term “selectivity” of a molecule for a first receptor relative to a second receptor refers to the following ratio: EC50 of the molecule at the second receptor divided by the EC50 of the molecule at the first receptor. For example, a molecule that has an EC50 of 1 nM at a first receptor and an EC50 of 100 nM at a second receptor has 100-fold selectivity for the first receptor relative to the second receptor. In exemplary embodiments, the selectivity of the peptide of the present disclosures for the human GLP-1 receptor versus the GIP receptor is less than 100-fold (e.g., less than or about 90-fold, less than or about 80-fold, less than or about 70-fold, less than or about 60-fold, less than or about 50-fold, less than or about 40-fold, less than or about 30-fold, less than or about 20-fold, less than or about 10-fold, less than or about 5-fold).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0113">In some or any embodiments, the peptides of the present disclosures exhibit enhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor, as compared to native human glucagon.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0118">By way of another example, the peptide of the present disclosures in some aspects exhibits activity at both the GIP receptor and the glucagon receptor (“glucagon/GIP receptor co-agonists”). In some embodiments, GLP-1 activity has been significantly reduced or destroyed, e.g., by an amino acid modification at position 7, e.g., substitution with Ile, a deletion of the amino acid(s) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28, yielding a 27- or 28-amino acid peptide, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the peptide of the present disclosures is a peptide which exhibits about 10% or less (e.g., about 5% or less, or about 1% or less, or about 0.1% or less) of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.</div>

Examples of amino acid pairings that may form an eight-atom linker include Lys-Glu (lactam); Homolys-Asp (lactam); Orn-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Asp (lactam); or Tyr-Asp (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form a nine-atom linker include Homolys-Glu (lactam); Lys-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Glu (lactam); or Tyr-Glu (lactone). Any of the side chains on these amino acids may additionally be substituted with additional chemical groups, so long as the three-dimensional structure of the alpha-helix is not disrupted. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision alternative pairings or alternative amino acid analogs, including chemically modified derivatives, that would create a stabilizing structure of similar size and desired effect. For example, a homocysteine-homocysteine disulfide bridge is 6 atoms in length and may be further modified to provide the desired effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0283">Even without covalent linkage, the amino acid pairings described above (or similar pairings that one of ordinary skill in the art can envision) may also provide added stability to the alpha-helix through non-covalent bonds, for example, through formation of salt bridges or hydrogen-bonding interactions. Accordingly, salt bridges may be formed between: Orn and Glu; Lys and Asp; Homo-serine and Homo-glutamate; Lys and Glu; Asp and Arg; Homo-Lys and Asp; Orn and Homo-Glutamate; 4-aminoPhe and Asp; Tyr and Asp; Homo-Lys and Glu; Lys and Homo-Glu; 4-aminoPhe and Glu; or Tyr and Glu. In some embodiments, the analog comprises a salt bridge between any of the following pairs of amino acids: Orn and Glu; Lys and Asp; Lys and Glu; Asp and Arg; Homo-Lys and Asp; Orn and Homo-Glutamate; Homo-Lys and Glu; and Lys and Homo-Glu. Salt bridges may be formed between other pairs of oppositely charged side chains.

For instance, i can be Tyr and i+4 can be either Val or Leu; i can be Phe and i+4 can be Met; or i can be Phe and i+4 can be Ile. It should be understood that, for purposes herein, the above amino acid pairings can be reversed, such that the indicated amino acid at position i could alternatively be located at i+4, while the i+4 amino acid can be located at the i position.

The size of the lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in one embodiment the lactam is formed by linking the side chains of an ornithine to a aspartic acid side chain. Lactam bridges and methods of making the same are known in the art. See, for example, Houston, Jr., et al., <i>J Peptide Sci </i>1: 274-282 (2004), and Example 1 herein. In some embodiments, the analog comprises a modified sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and a lactam bridge between i and i+4, wherein i is as defined herein above. In some embodiments, the GIP agonist peptide comprises two lactam bridges: one between the amino acids at positions 16 and 20 and another between the amino acids at positions 17 and 21. In some embodiments, the GIP agonist peptide comprises one lactam bridge and one salt bridge. Further exemplary embodiments, are described herein in the section entitled “EXAMPLES.” Further exemplary embodiments include the following pairings, optionally with a lactam bridge: Glu at position 12 with Lys at position 16; native Lys at position 12 with Glu at position 16; Glu at position 16 with Lys at position 20; Lys at position 16 with Glu at position 20; Glu at position 20 with Lys at position 24; Lys at position 20 with Glu at position 24; Glu at position 24 with Lys at position 28; Lys at position 24 with Glu at position 28.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0287">In some aspects, olefin metathesis is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the analog using an all-hydrocarbon cross-linking system. The GIP agonist peptide in this instance comprises α-methylated amino acids bearing olefinic side chains of varying length and configured with either R or S stereochemistry at the j and j+3 or i and i+4 positions. In some embodiments, the olefinic side comprises (CH<sub>2</sub>)n, wherein n is any integer between 1 to 6. In some embodiments, n is 3 for a cross-link length of 8 atoms. In some embodiments, n is 2 for a cross-link length of 6 atoms. An exemplary GIP agonist peptide comprising an olefinic cross-link is described herein as SEQ ID NO: 17. Suitable methods of forming such intramolecular bridges are described in the art. See, for example, Schafmeister et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>122: 5891-5892 (2000) and Walensky et al., <i>Science </i>305: 1466-1470 (2004). In alternative embodiments, the analog comprises O-allyl Ser residues located on adjacent helical turns, which are bridged together via ruthenium-catalyzed ring closing metathesis. Such procedures of cross-linking are described in, for example, Blackwell et al., <i>Angew, Chem., Int. Ed. </i>37: 3281-3284 (1998).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0288">In specific aspects, use of the unnatural thio-dialanine amino acid, lanthionine, which has been widely adopted as a peptidomimetic of cystine, is used to cross-link one turn of the alpha helix. Suitable methods of lanthionine-based cyclization are known in the art. See, for instance, Matteucci et al., <i>Tetrahedron Letters </i>45: 1399-1401 (2004); Mayer et al., <i>J.

Such tethers lead to the formation of a bridge 9-atoms or more in length, depending on the length of the diaminoalkane tether. Suitable methods of producing peptides cross-linked with such tethers are described in the art. See, for example, Phelan et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119: 455-460 (1997).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0290">In yet other embodiments, a disulfide bridge is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the analog. Alternatively, a modified disulfide bridge in which one or both sulfur atoms are replaced by a methylene group resulting in an isosteric macrocyclization is used to stabilize the alpha helix of the analog. Suitable methods of modifying peptides with disulfide bridges or sulfur-based cyclization are described in, for example, Jackson et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>113: 9391-9392 (1991) and Rudinger and Jost, <i>Experientia </i>20: 570-571 (1964).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0291">In yet other embodiments, the alpha helix of the analog is stabilized via the binding of metal atom by two His residues or a His and Cys pair positioned at j and j+3, or i and i+4. The metal atom can be, for example, Ru(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). Such methods of metal binding-based alpha helix stabilization are known in the art. See, for example, Andrews and Tabor, <i>Tetrahedron </i>55: 11711-11743 (1999); Ghadiri et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>112: 1630-1632 (1990); and Ghadiri et al., <i>J. Am. Chem.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0292">The alpha helix of the GIP agonist peptide can alternatively be stabilized through other means of peptide cyclizing, which means are reviewed in Davies, J. Peptide. Sci. 9: 471-501 (2003). The alpha helix can be stabilized via the formation of an amide bridge, thioether bridge, thioester bridge, urea bridge, carbamate bridge, sulfonamide bridge, and the like. For example, a thioester bridge can be formed between the C-terminus and the side chain of a Cys residue. Alternatively, a thioester can be formed via side chains of amino acids having a thiol (Cys) and a carboxylic acid (e.g., Asp, Glu). In another method, a cross-linking agent, such as a dicarboxylic acid, e.g., suberic acid (octanedioic acid), etc. can introduce a link between two functional groups of an amino acid side chain, such as a free amino, hydroxyl, thiol group, and combinations thereof.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0435" num="0577">In some embodiments, the glucagon analogs of the disclosure are isolated. The term “isolated” as used herein means having been removed from its natural environment. In exemplary embodiments, the analog is made through recombinant methods and the analog is isolated from the host cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0436" num="0578">In some embodiments, the glucagon analogs of the disclosure are purified. The term “purified,” as used herein relates to the isolation of a molecule or compound in a form that is substantially free of contaminants which in some aspects are normally associated with the molecule or compound in a native or natural environment and means having been increased in purity as a result of being separated from other components of the original composition. The purified peptide or compound include, for example, peptides substantially free of nucleic acid molecules, lipids, and carbohydrates, or other starting materials or intermediates which are used or formed during chemical synthesis of the peptides.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0437" num="0579">The invention further provides conjugates comprising one or more of the glucagon analogs described herein conjugated to a heterologous moiety. As used herein, the term “heterologous moiety” is synonymous with the term “conjugate moiety” and refers to any molecule (chemical or biochemical, naturally-occurring or non-coded) which is different from the glucagon analogs described herein.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0446" num="0588">In some embodiments, the heterologous moiety is a carbohydrate. In some embodiments, the carbohydrate is a monosaccharide (e.g., glucose, galactose, fructose), a disaccharide (e.g., sucrose, lactose, maltose), an oligosaccharide (e.g., raffinose, stachyose), or a polysaccharide (e.g., starch, amylase, amylopectin, cellulose, chitin, callose, laminarin, xylan, mannan, fucoidan, or galactomannan).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0447" num="0589">In some embodiments, the heterologous moiety is a lipid. The lipid, in some embodiments, is a fatty acid, eicosanoid, prostaglandin, leukotriene, thromboxane, N-acyl ethanolamine), glycerolipid (e.g., mono-, di-, tri-substituted glycerols), glycerophospholipid (e.g., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine), sphingolipid (e.g., sphingosine, ceramide), sterol lipid (e.g., steroid, cholesterol), prenol lipid, saccharolipid, or a polyketide, oil, wax, cholesterol, sterol, fat-soluble vitamin, monoglyceride, diglyceride, triglyceride, a phospholipid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0448" num="0590">In some embodiments, the heterologous moiety is attached via non-covalent or covalent bonding to the analog of the present disclosure. In exemplary aspects, the heterologous moiety is attached to the analog of the present disclosure via a linker. Linkage can be accomplished by covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such electrostatic, hydrogen, ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. A variety of non-covalent coupling systems may be used, including biotin-avidin, ligand/receptor, enzyme/substrate, nucleic acid/nucleic acid binding protein, lipid/lipid binding protein, cellular adhesion molecule partners; or any binding partners or fragments thereof which have affinity for each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0449" num="0591">The glucagon analog in some embodiments is linked to conjugate moieties via direct covalent linkage by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the analog with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of these targeted amino acids. Reactive groups on the analog or conjugate moiety include, e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group. Derivatizing agents include, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride or other agents known in the art. Alternatively, the conjugate moieties can be linked to the analog indirectly through intermediate carriers, such as polysaccharide or polypeptide carriers. Examples of polysaccharide carriers include aminodextran. Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0450" num="0592">Cysteinyl residues are most commonly reacted with α-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid, chloroacetamide to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, alpha-bromo-β-(5-imidozoyl)propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0451" num="0593">Histidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para-bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0452" num="0594">Lysinyl and amino-terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, chloroborohydride, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, O-methylisourea, 2,4-pentanedione, and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0453" num="0595">Arginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pKa of the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0454" num="0596">The specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0455" num="0597">Carboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R—N═C═N—R′), where R and R′ are different alkyl groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl) carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0456" num="0598">Other modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)), deamidation of asparagine or glutamine, acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and/or amidation or esterification of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0457" num="0599">Another type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the analog. Sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO87/05330 published 11 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0458" num="0600">In some embodiments, the glucagon analog is conjugated to a heterologous moiety via covalent linkage between a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon analog and the heterologous moiety. In some embodiments, the glucagon analog is conjugated to a heterologous moiety via the side chain of an amino acid at position 16, 17, 21, 24, or 29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid, or a combination of these positions. In some aspects, the amino acid covalently linked to a heterologous moiety (e.g., the amino acid comprising a heterologous moiety) is a Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the side chain of the amino acid is covalently bonded to a heterologous moiety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0459" num="0601">In some embodiments, the conjugate comprises a linker that joins the glucagon analog to the heterologous moiety. In some aspects, the linker comprises a chain of atoms from 1 to about 60, or 1 to 30 atoms or longer, 2 to 5 atoms, 2 to 10 atoms, 5 to 10 atoms, or 10 to 20 atoms long. In some embodiments, the chain atoms are all carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the chain atoms in the backbone of the linker are selected from the group consisting of C, O, N, and S. Chain atoms and linkers may be selected according to their expected solubility (hydrophilicity) so as to provide a more soluble conjugate. In some embodiments, the linker provides a functional group that is subject to cleavage by an enzyme or other catalyst or hydrolytic conditions found in the target tissue or organ or cell. In some embodiments, the length of the linker is long enough to reduce the potential for steric hindrance. If the linker is a covalent bond or a peptidyl bond and the conjugate is a polypeptide, the entire conjugate can be a fusion protein. Such peptidyl linkers may be any length. Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length. Such fusion proteins may alternatively be produced by recombinant genetic engineering methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0022" num="0000">Conjugates: Fc Fusions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0460" num="0602">As noted above, in some embodiments, the analogs are conjugated, e.g., fused to an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g., variable region, CDR, or Fc region). Known types of immunoglobulins (Ig) include IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM. The Fc region is a C-terminal region of an Ig heavy chain, which is responsible for binding to Fc receptors that carry out activities such as recycling (which results in prolonged half-life), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0461" num="0603">For example, according to some definitions the human IgG heavy chain Fc region stretches from Cys226 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. The “hinge region” generally extends from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by aligning the cysteines involved in cysteine bonding). The Fc region of an IgG includes two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, Md. In a related embodiments, the Fc region may comprise one or more native or modified constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than CH1, for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0462" num="0604">Suitable conjugate moieties include portions of immunoglobulin sequence that include the FcRn binding site. FcRn, a salvage receptor, is responsible for recycling immunoglobulins and returning them to circulation in blood. The region of the Fe portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0463" num="0605">Some conjugate moieties may or may not include FcγR binding site(s). FcγR are responsible for ADCC and CDC. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with FcγR are amino acids 234-239 (lower hinge region), amino acids 265-269 (B/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (C′/E loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F/G) loop (Sondermann et al., Nature 406: 267-273, 2000). The lower hinge region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcRI binding (Henry, et al., Biochemistry 36, 15568-15578, 1997). Residues involved in IgA receptor binding are described in Lewis et al., (J Immunol. 175:6694-701, 2005). Amino acid residues involved in IgE receptor binding are described in Sayers et al. (J Biol Chem. 279(34):35320-5, 2004).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0464" num="0606">Amino acid modifications may be made to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Such variant Fc regions comprise at least one amino acid modification in the CH3 domain of the Fc region (residues 342-447) and/or at least one amino acid modification in the CH2 domain of the Fc region (residues 231-341). Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Other mutations may reduce binding of the Fc region to FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and/or FcγRIIIA without significantly reducing affinity for FcRn. For example, substitution of the Asn at position 297 of the Fc region with Ala or another amino acid removes a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and may result in reduced immunogenicity with concomitant prolonged half-life of the Fc region, as well as reduced binding to FcγRs (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Amino acid modifications at positions 233-236 of IgG1 have been made that reduce binding to FcγRs (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 and Armour et al. 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613). Some exemplary amino acid substitutions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,355,008 and 7,381,408, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0023" num="0000">Conjugates: Hydrophilic Moieties</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0465" num="0607">The glucagon analogs described herein can be further modified to improve its solubility and stability in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, while retaining the high biological activity relative to native glucagon. Hydrophilic moieties such as PEG groups can be attached to the analogs under any suitable conditions used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Any means known in the art can be used, including via acylation, reductive alkylation, Michael addition, thiol alkylation or other chemoselective conjugation/ligation methods through a reactive group on the PEG moiety (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group) to a reactive group on the target compound (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group). Activating groups which can be used to link the water soluble polymer to one or more proteins include without limitation sulfone, maleimide, sulfhydryl, thiol, triflate, tresylate, azidirine, oxirane, 5-pyridyl, and alpha-halogenated acyl group (e.g., alpha-iodo acetic acid, alpha-bromoacetic acid, alpha-chloroacetic acid). If attached to the analog by reductive alkylation, the polymer selected should have a single reactive aldehyde so that the degree of polymerization is controlled. See, for example, Kinstler et al., <i>Adv. Drug. Delivery Rev. </i>54: 477-485 (2002); Roberts et al., <i>Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. </i>54: 459-476 (2002); and Zalipsky et al., <i>Adv.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0468" num="0610">In some embodiments, the thiol is modified with a haloacetyl-activated PEG in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to result in a PEGylated analog comprising a thioether linkage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0469" num="0611">Suitable hydrophilic moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., POG), polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose, polyoxyethylated glycerol (POG), polyoxyalkylenes, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, mono-(C1-C10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, polyacetals, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, poly (β-amino acids) (either homopolymers or random copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers (PPG) and other polyakylene oxides, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, colonic acids or other polysaccharide polymers, Ficoll or dextran and mixtures thereof. Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers of glucose subunits, predominantly linked by al-6 linkages. Dextran is available in many molecular weight ranges, e.g., about 1 kD to about 100 kD, or from about 5, 10, 15 or 20 kD to about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 kD. Linear or branched polymers are contemplated. Resulting preparations of conjugates may be essentially monodisperse or polydisperse, and may have about 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.2, 1.5 or 2 polymer moieties per analog.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0470" num="0612">In some or any embodiments, the glucagon analog is conjugated to a hydrophilic moiety via covalent linkage between a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon analog and the hydrophilic moiety. In some or any embodiments, the glucagon analog is conjugated to a hydrophilic moiety via the side chain of an amino acid at position 16, 17, 21, 24, or 29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid, or a combination of these positions. In some aspects, the amino acid covalently linked to a hydrophilic moiety (e.g., the amino acid comprising a hydrophilic moiety) is a Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the side chain of the amino acid is covalently bonded to a hydrophilic moiety (e.g., PEG).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0024" num="0000">Conjugates: rPEG</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0471" num="0613">In some or any embodiments, the conjugate of the present disclosure comprises the glucagon analog having GIP receptor agonist activity fused to an accessory analog which is capable of forming an extended conformation similar to chemical PEG (e.g., a recombinant PEG (rPEG) molecule), such as those described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO2009/023270 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US20080286808. The rPEG molecule in some aspects is a polypeptide comprising one or more of glycine, serine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, or proline. In some aspects, the rPEG is a homopolymer, e.g., poly-glycine, poly-serine, poly-glutamic acid, poly-aspartic acid, poly-alanine, or poly-proline. In other embodiments, the rPEG comprises two types of amino acids repeated, e.g., poly(Gly-Ser), poly(Gly-Glu), poly(Gly-Ala), poly(Gly-Asp), poly(Gly-Pro), poly(Ser-Glu), etc. In some aspects, the rPEG comprises three different types of amino acids, e.g., poly(Gly-Ser-Glu). In specific aspects, the rPEG increases the half-life of the Glucagon and/or GLP-1 agonist analog. In some aspects, the rPEG comprises a net positive or net negative charge. The rPEG in some aspects lacks secondary structure. In some embodiments, the rPEG is greater than or equal to 10 amino acids in length and in some embodiments is about 40 to about 50 amino acids in length. The accessory peptide in some aspects is fused to the N- or C-terminus of the analog of the present disclosure through a peptide bond or a proteinase cleavage site, or is inserted into the loops of the analog of the present disclosure. The rPEG in some aspects comprises an affinity tag or is linked to a PEG that is greater than 5 kDa. In some embodiments, the rPEG confers the analog of the present disclosure with an increased hydrodynamic radius, serum half-life, protease resistance, or solubility and in some aspects confers the analog with decreased immunogenicity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0025" num="0000">Conjugates: Multimers</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0472" num="0614">The invention further provides multimers or dimers of the analogs disclosed herein, including homo- or hetero-multimers or homo- or hetero-dimers. Two or more of the analogs can be linked together using standard linking agents and procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example, dimers can be formed between two peptides through the use of bifunctional thiol crosslinkers and bi-functional amine crosslinkers, particularly for the analogs that have been substituted with cysteine, lysine ornithine, homocysteine or acetyl phenylalanine residues. The dimer can be a homodimer or alternatively can be a heterodimer. In exemplary embodiments, the linker connecting the two (or more) analogs is PEG, e.g., a 5 kDa PEG, 20 kDa PEG. In some embodiments, the linker is a disulfide bond. For example, each monomer of the dimer may comprise a Cys residue (e.g., a terminal or internally positioned Cys) and the sulfur atom of each Cys residue participates in the formation of the disulfide bond. In exemplary aspects, each monomer of the dimer is linked via a thioether bond. In exemplary aspects, an epsilon amine of a Lys residue of one monomer is bonded to a Cys residue, which, in turn, is connected via a chemical moiety to the epsilon amine of a Lys residue of the other monomer. Methods of making such thioether bonded dimers are further described herein. In some aspects, the monomers are connected via terminal amino acids (e.g., N-terminal or C-terminal), via internal amino acids, or via a terminal amino acid of at least one monomer and an internal amino acid of at least one other monomer. In specific aspects, the monomers are not connected via an N-terminal amino acid. In some aspects, the monomers of the multimer are attached together in a “tail-to-tail” orientation in which the C-terminal amino acids of each monomer are attached together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0026" num="0000">Prodrugs</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0473" num="0615">Further provided by the invention are prodrugs of the peptides and analogs described herein. As used herein, the term “prodrug” is defined as any compound that undergoes chemical modification before exhibiting its full pharmacological effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0474" num="0616">In exemplary embodiments, the prodrug is an amide-based peptide prodrug, similar to those described in International Patent Application Publication No. WO/2010/071807, which published on Jun. 24, 2010. Such prodrugs are intended to delay onset of action and extend the half life of the drug. The delayed onset of action is advantageous in that it allows systemic distribution of the prodrug prior to its activation. Accordingly, the administration of prodrugs eliminates complications caused by peak activities upon administration and increases the therapeutic index of the parent drug.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0475" num="0617">In exemplary aspects, the prodrug comprises the structure: A-B-Q; wherein Q is a peptide or analog described herein; A is an amino acid or a hydroxy acid; B is an N-alkylated amino acid linked to Q through an amide bond between A-B and an amine of Q; wherein A, B, or the amino acid of Q to which A-B is linked is a non-coded amino acid, further wherein chemical cleavage half-life (t½) of A-B from Q is at least about 1 hour to about 1 week in PBS under physiological conditions. As used herein the term “hydroxy acid” refers to an amino acid that has been modified to replace the alpha carbon amino group with a hydroxyl group.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0684" num="0826">The analogs of the disclosure, alone or in combination with other suitable components, can be delivered via pulmonary administration and can be made into aerosol formulations to be administered via inhalation. These aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like. They also may be formulated as pharmaceuticals for non-pressured preparations, such as in a nebulizer or an atomizer. Such spray formulations also may be used to spray mucosa. In some embodiments, the analog is formulated into a powder blend or into microparticles or nanoparticles. Suitable pulmonary formulations are known in the art. See, e.g., Qian et al., Int J Pharm 366: 218-220 (2009); Adjei and Garren, Pharmaceutical Research, 7(6): 565-569 (1990); Kawashima et al., J Controlled Release 62(1-2): 279-287 (1999); Liu et al., Pharm Res 10(2): 228-232 (1993); International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 2007/133747 and WO 2007/141411.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0685" num="0827">Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The term, “parenteral” means not through the alimentary canal but by some other route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraspinal, or intravenous. The analog of the present disclosure can be administered with a physiologically acceptable diluent in a pharmaceutical carrier, such as a sterile liquid or mixture of liquids, including water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, an alcohol, such as ethanol or hexadecyl alcohol, a glycol, such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, dimethylsulfoxide, glycerol, ketals such as 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol, ethers, poly(ethyleneglycol) 400, oils, fatty acids, fatty acid esters or glycerides, or acetylated fatty acid glycerides with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, such as a soap or a detergent, suspending agent, such as pectin, carbomers, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or carboxymethylcellulose, or emulsifying agents and other pharmaceutical adjuvants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0686" num="0828">Oils, which can be used in parenteral formulations include petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic oils.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0688" num="0830">The parenteral formulations will typically contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the analog of the present disclosure in solution. Preservatives and buffers may be used. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain one or more nonionic surfactants having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulations will typically range from about 5% to about 15% by weight. Suitable surfactants include polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol. The parenteral formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient, for example, water, for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0689" num="0831">Injectable formulations are in accordance with the invention. The requirements for effective pharmaceutical carriers for injectable compositions are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., <i>Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice</i>, J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, Pa., Banker and Chalmers, eds., pages 238-250 (1982), and <i>ASHP Handbook on Injectable Drugs</i>, Toissel, 4th ed., pages 622-630 (1986)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0690" num="0832">Additionally, the analog of the present disclosures can be made into suppositories for rectal administration by mixing with a variety of bases, such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration can be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulas containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0691" num="0833">It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that, in addition to the above-described pharmaceutical compositions, the analog of the disclosure can be formulated as inclusion complexes, such as cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, or liposomes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0035" num="0000">Dose</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0692" num="0834">The analogs of the disclosure are believed to be useful in methods of treating a disease or medical condition in which GIP receptor agonism, GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonism, GIP/glucagon receptor co-agonism, or GIP/GLP-1/glucagon receptor triagonism plays a role. For purposes of the disclosure, the amount or dose of the analog of the present disclosure administered should be sufficient to effect, e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response, in the subject or animal over a reasonable time frame. For example, the dose of the analog of the present disclosure should be sufficient to stimulate cAMP secretion from cells as described herein or sufficient to decrease blood glucose levels, fat levels, food intake levels, or body weight of a mammal, in a period of from about 1 to 4 minutes, 1 to 4 hours or 1 to 4 weeks or longer, e.g., 5 to 20 or more weeks, from the time of administration. In exemplary embodiments, the time period could be even longer. The dose will be determined by the efficacy of the particular analog of the present disclosure and the condition of the animal (e.g., human), as well as the body weight of the animal (e.g., human) to be treated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0693" num="0835">Many assays for determining an administered dose are known in the art. For purposes herein, an assay, which comprises comparing the extent to which blood glucose levels are lowered upon administration of a given dose of the analog of the present disclosure to a mammal among a set of mammals of which is each given a different dose of the analog, could be used to determine a starting dose to be administered to a mammal. The extent to which blood glucose levels are lowered upon administration of a certain dose can be assayed by methods known in the art, including, for instance, the methods described herein as Example 11.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0036" num="0000">Targeted Forms</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0696" num="0838">One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the analogs of the disclosure can be modified in any number of ways, such that the therapeutic or prophylactic efficacy of the analog of the present disclosures is increased through the modification. For instance, the analog of the present disclosure can be conjugated either directly or indirectly through a linker to a targeting moiety. The practice of conjugating compounds, e.g., glucagon analogs described herein, to targeting moieties is known in the art. See, for instance, Wadhwa et al., <i>J Drug Targeting, </i>3, 111-127 (1995) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,616. The term “targeting moiety” as used herein, refers to any molecule or agent that specifically recognizes and binds to a cell-surface receptor, such that the targeting moiety directs the delivery of the analog of the present disclosures to a population of cells on which surface the receptor (the glucagon receptor, the GLP-1 receptor) is expressed. Targeting moieties include, but are not limited to, antibodies, or fragments thereof, peptides, hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and any other natural or non-natural ligands, which bind to cell surface receptors (e.g., Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), T-cell receptor (TCR), B-cell receptor (BCR), CD28, Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGF), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), etc.). As used herein a “linker” is a bond, molecule or group of molecules that binds two separate entities to one another. Linkers may provide for optimal spacing of the two entities or may further supply a labile linkage that allows the two entities to be separated from each other. Labile linkages include photocleavable groups, acid-labile moieties, base-labile moieties and enzyme-cleavable groups. The term “linker” in some embodiments refers to any agent or molecule that bridges the analog of the present disclosures to the targeting moiety. One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that sites on the analog of the present disclosures, which are not necessary for the function of the analog of the present disclosures, are ideal sites for attaching a linker and/or a targeting moiety, provided that the linker and/or targeting moiety, once attached to the analog of the present disclosures, do(es) not interfere with the function of the analog of the present disclosures, i.e., the ability to stimulate cAMP secretion from cells, to treat diabetes or obesity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0037" num="0000">Controlled Release Formulations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0697" num="0839">Alternatively, the glucagon analogs described herein can be modified into a depot form, such that the manner in which the analog of the present disclosures is released into the body to which it is administered is controlled with respect to time and location within the body (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,450,150). Depot forms of analog of the present disclosures can be, for example, an implantable composition comprising the analog of the present disclosures and a porous or non-porous material, such as a polymer, wherein the analog of the present disclosures is encapsulated by or diffused throughout the material and/or degradation of the non-porous material. The depot is then implanted into the desired location within the body and the analog of the present disclosures are released from the implant at a predetermined rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0698" num="0840">The pharmaceutical composition in exemplary aspects is modified to have any type of in vivo release profile. In some aspects, the pharmaceutical composition is an immediate release, controlled release, sustained release, extended release, delayed release, or bi-phasic release formulation.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0705" num="0847">Uses</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0706" num="0848">Based on the information provided for the first time herein, it is contemplated that the compositions (e.g., related pharmaceutical compositions) of the present disclosures are useful for treatment of a disease or medical condition, in which e.g., the lack of activity at the GIP receptor, the GLP-1 receptor, or at both receptors, is a factor in the onset and/or progression of the disease or medical condition. Accordingly, the present disclosures provides a method of treating or preventing a disease or medical condition in a patient, wherein the disease or medical condition is a disease of medical condition in which a lack of GIP receptor activation and/or GLP-1 receptor activation is associated with the onset and/or progression of the disease of medical condition. The method comprises providing to the patient a composition or conjugate in accordance with any of those described herein in an amount effective to treat or prevent the disease or medical condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0707" num="0849">In some embodiments, the disease or medical condition is metabolic syndrome. Metabolic Syndrome, also known as metabolic syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome or Reaven's syndrome, is a disorder that affects over 50 million Americans. Metabolic Syndrome is typically characterized by a clustering of at least three or more of the following risk factors: (1) abdominal obesity (excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen), (2) atherogenic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders including high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol that enhance the accumulation of plaque in the artery walls), (3) elevated blood pressure, (4) insulin resistance or glucose intolerance, (5) prothrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in blood), and (6) pro-inflammatory state (e.g., elevated C-reactive protein in blood). Other risk factors may include aging, hormonal imbalance and genetic predisposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0708" num="0850">Metabolic Syndrome is associated with an increased the risk of coronary heart disease and other disorders related to the accumulation of vascular plaque, such as stroke and peripheral vascular disease, referred to as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients with Metabolic Syndrome may progress from an insulin resistant state in its early stages to full blown type II diabetes with further increasing risk of ASCVD. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, the relationship between insulin resistance, Metabolic Syndrome and vascular disease may involve one or more concurrent pathogenic mechanisms including impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation, insulin resistance-associated reduction in NO availability due to enhanced oxidative stress, and abnormalities in adipocyte-derived hormones such as adiponectin (Lteif and Mather, Can. J. Cardiol. 20 (suppl. B):66B-76B (2004)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0709" num="0851">According to the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III), any three of the following traits in the same individual meet the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (a waist circumference over 102 cm in men and over 88 cm in women); (b) serum triglycerides (150 mg/dl or above); (c) HDL cholesterol (40 mg/dl or lower in men and 50 mg/dl or lower in women); (d) blood pressure (130/85 or more); and (e) fasting blood glucose (110 mg/dl or above). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an individual having high insulin levels (an elevated fasting blood glucose or an elevated post meal glucose alone) with at least two of the following criteria meets the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (waist to hip ratio of greater than 0.9, a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2, or a waist measurement over 37 inches); (b) cholesterol panel showing a triglyceride level of at least 150 mg/dl or an HDL cholesterol lower than 35 mg/dl; (c) blood pressure of 140/90 or more, or on treatment for high blood pressure).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0710" num="0852">For purposes herein, if an individual meets the criteria of either or both of the criteria set forth by the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel or the WHO, that individual is considered as afflicted with Metabolic Syndrome.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0711" num="0853">Without being bound to any particular theory, compositions and conjugates described herein are useful for treating Metabolic Syndrome. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Metabolic Syndrome, or reducing one, two, three or more risk factors thereof, in a subject, comprising providing to the subject a composition described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Metabolic Syndrome, or the risk factor thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0712" num="0854">In some embodiments, the method treats a hyperglycemic medical condition. In exemplary aspects, the hyperglycemic medical condition is diabetes, diabetes mellitus type I, diabetes mellitus type II, or gestational diabetes, either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent. In some aspects, the method treats the hyperglycemic medical condition by reducing one or more complications of diabetes including nephropathy, retinopathy and vascular disease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0713" num="0855">In some aspects, the disease or medical condition is obesity. In some aspects, the obesity is drug-induced obesity. In some aspects, the method treats obesity by preventing or reducing weight gain or increasing weight loss in the patient. In some aspects, the method treats obesity by reducing appetite, decreasing food intake, lowering the levels of fat in the patient, or decreasing the rate of movement of food through the gastrointestinal system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0714" num="0856">Because obesity is associated with the onset or progression of other diseases, the methods of treating obesity are further useful in methods of reducing complications associated with obesity including vascular disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, ischemia reperfusion, etc.), hypertension, onset of diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia and musculoskeletal diseases. The present disclosures accordingly provides methods of treating or preventing these obesity-associated complications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0715" num="0857">In some embodiments, the disease or medical condition is Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD refers to a wide spectrum of liver disease ranging from simple fatty liver (steatosis), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to cirrhosis (irreversible, advanced scarring of the liver). All of the stages of NAFLD have in common the accumulation of fat (fatty infiltration) in the liver cells (hepatocytes). Simple fatty liver is the abnormal accumulation of a certain type of fat, triglyceride, in the liver cells with no inflammation or scarring. In NASH, the fat accumulation is associated with varying degrees of inflammation (hepatitis) and scarring (fibrosis) of the liver. The inflammatory cells can destroy the liver cells (hepatocellular necrosis). In the terms “steatohepatitis” and “steatonecrosis”, steato refers to fatty infiltration, hepatitis refers to inflammation in the liver, and necrosis refers to destroyed liver cells. NASH can ultimately lead to scarring of the liver (fibrosis) and then irreversible, advanced scarring (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis that is caused by NASH is the last and most severe stage in the NAFLD spectrum. (Mendler, Michel, “Fatty Liver: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH),” ed. Schoenfield, Leslie J., MedicineNet.com, Aug. 29, 2005).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0716" num="0858">Alcoholic Liver Disease, or Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease, encompasses three pathologically distinct liver diseases related to or caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol: fatty liver (steatosis), chronic or acute hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Alcoholic hepatitis can range from a mild hepatitis, with abnormal laboratory tests being the only indication of disease, to severe liver dysfunction with complications such as jaundice (yellow skin caused by bilirubin retention), hepatic encephalopathy (neurological dysfunction caused by liver failure), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), bleeding esophageal varices (varicose veins in the esophagus), abnormal blood clotting and coma. Histologically, alcoholic hepatitis has a characteristic appearance with ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, inflammation with neutrophils and sometimes Mallory bodies (abnormal aggregations of cellular intermediate filament proteins). Cirrhosis is characterized anatomically by widespread nodules in the liver combined with fibrosis. (Worman, Howard J., “Alcoholic Liver Disease”, Columbia University Medical Center website).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0717" num="0859">Without being bound to any particular theory, the compositions and conjugates described herein are useful for the treatment of Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, including, for example, steatosis, steatohepatitis, hepatitis, hepatic inflammation, NASH, cirrhosis, or complications thereof. Accordingly, the present disclosures provides a method of preventing or treating Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, in a subject comprising providing to a subject a composition described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or the stage thereof. Such treatment methods include reduction in one, two, three or more of the following: liver fat content, incidence or progression of cirrhosis, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, signs of inflammation, e.g., abnormal hepatic enzyme levels (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase AST and/or alanine aminotransferase ALT, or LDH), elevated serum ferritin, elevated serum bilirubin, and/or signs of fibrosis, e.g., elevated TGF-beta levels. In exemplary embodiments, the compositions are used treat patients who have progressed beyond simple fatty liver (steatosis) and exhibit signs of inflammation or hepatitis. Such methods may result, for example, in reduction of AST and/or ALT levels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0718" num="0860">GLP-1 and exendin-4 have been shown to have some neuroprotective effect. The present disclosures also provides uses of the compositions described herein in treating neurodegenerative diseases, including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Amylotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, other demyelination related disorders, senile dementia, subcortical dementia, arteriosclerotic dementia, AIDS-associated dementia, or other dementias, a central nervous system cancer, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke or cerebral ischemia, cerebral vasculitis, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, Guillain Barre syndrome, Wilson disease, Pick's disease, neuroinflammatory disorders, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis or meningitis of viral, fungal or bacterial origin, or other central nervous system infections, prion diseases, cerebellar ataxias, cerebellar degeneration, spinocerebellar degeneration syndromes, Friedreichs ataxia, ataxia telangiectasia, spinal dysmyotrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, dystonia, muscle spasticity, tremor, retinitis pigmentosa, striatonigral degeneration, mitochondrial encephalo-myopathies, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, hepatic encephalopathies, renal encephalopathies, metabolic encephalopathies, toxin-induced encephalopathies, and radiation-induced brain damage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0719" num="0861">In some embodiments, the compositions are used in conjunction with parenteral administration of nutrients to non-diabetic patients in a hospital setting, e.g., to patients receiving parenteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition. Nonlimiting examples include surgery patients, patients in comas, patients with digestive tract illness, or a nonfunctional gastrointestinal tract (e.g. due to surgical removal, blockage or impaired absorptive capacity, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, gastrointestinal tract obstruction, gastrointestinal tract fistula, acute pancreatitis, ischemic bowel, major gastrointestinal surgery, certain congenital gastrointestinal tract anomalies, prolonged diarrhea, or short bowel syndrome due to surgery, patients in shock, and patients undergoing healing processes often receive parenteral administration of carbohydrates along with various combinations of lipids, electrolytes, minerals, vitamins and amino acids. The compositions comprising the GIP agonist peptide and glucagon antagonist peptide, as described herein, and the parenteral nutrition composition can be administered at the same time, at different times, before, or after each other, provided that the composition is exerting the desired biological effect at the time that the parenteral nutrition composition is being digested. For example, the parenteral nutrition may be administered, 1, 2 or 3 times per day, while the composition is administered once every other day, three times a week, two times a week, once a week, once every 2 weeks, once every 3 weeks, or once a month.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0720" num="0862">As used herein, the term “treating” includes prophylaxis of the specific disorder or condition, or alleviation of the symptoms associated with a specific disorder or condition and/or preventing or eliminating said symptoms. For example, as used herein the term “treating diabetes” will refer in general to altering glucose blood levels in the direction of normal levels and may include increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels depending on a given situation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0721" num="0863">As used herein an “effective” amount or a “therapeutically effective amount” of a glucagon peptide refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the peptide to provide the desired effect. For example one desired effect would be the prevention or treatment of hypoglycemia, as measured, for example, by an increase in blood glucose level. An alternative desired effect for the glucagon peptides of the present disclosure would include treating hyperglycemia, e.g., as measured by a change in blood glucose level closer to normal, or inducing weight loss/preventing weight gain, e.g., as measured by reduction in body weight, or preventing or reducing an increase in body weight, or normalizing body fat distribution. The amount that is “effective” will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, mode of administration, and the like. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact “effective amount.” However, an appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0732" num="0874">MBHA resin (4-methylbenzhydrylamine polystyrene resin was used during peptide synthesis. MBHA resin, 100-180 mesh, 1% DVB cross-linked polystyrene; loading of 0.7-1.0 mmol/g), Boc-protected and Fmoc protected amino acids were purchased from Midwest Biotech. The solid phase peptide syntheses using Boc-protected amino acids were performed on an Applied Biosystem 430A Peptide Synthesizer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0734" num="0876">Synthesis of these analogs was performed on the Applied Biosystem Model 430A Peptide Synthesizer. Synthetic peptides were constructed by sequential addition of amino acids to a cartridge containing 2 mmol of Boc protected amino acid. Specifically, the synthesis was carried out using Boc DEPBT-activated single couplings. At the end of the coupling step, the peptidyl-resin was treated with TFA to remove the N-terminal Boc protecting group. It was washed repeatedly with dimethylformamide (DMF) and this repetitive cycle was repeated for the desired number of coupling steps. After the assembly, the sidechain protection, Fmoc, was removed by 20% piperidine treatment and acylation was conducted using DIC. The peptidyl-resin at the end of the entire synthesis was dried by using dichloromethane (DCM), and the peptide was cleaved from the resin with anhydrous HF.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0737" num="0879">The peptidyl-resin was treated with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF), and this typically yielded approximately 350 mg (˜50% yield) of a crude deprotected-peptide. Specifically, the peptidyl-resin (30 mg to 200 mg) was placed in the HF reaction vessel for cleavage. 500 μL of p-cresol was added to the vessel as a carbonium ion scavenger. The vessel was attached to the HF system and submerged in the methanol/dry ice mixture. The vessel was evacuated with a vacuum pump and 10 ml of HF was distilled to the reaction vessel. This reaction mixture of the peptidyl-resin and the HF was stirred for one hour at 0° C., after which a vacuum was established and the HF was quickly evacuated (10-15 min). The vessel was removed carefully and filled with approximately 35 ml of ether to precipitate the peptide and to extract the p-cresol and small molecule organic protecting groups resulting from HF treatment. This mixture was filtered utilizing a teflon filter and repeated twice to remove all excess cresol. This filtrate was discarded. The precipitated peptide dissolves in approximately 20 ml of 10% acetic acid (aq). This filtrate, which contained the desired peptide, was collected and lyophilized.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0740" num="0882">Acylated peptides were prepared as follows. Peptides were synthesized on a solid support resin using either a CS Bio 4886 Peptide Synthesizer or Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer. In situ neutralization chemistry was used as described by Schnolzer et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 40: 180-193 (1992). For acylated peptides, the target amino acid residue to be acylated (e.g., position ten, relative to the amino acid position numbering of SEQ ID NO: 3) was substituted with an Nε-FMOC lysine residue. Treatment of the completed N-terminally BOC protected peptide with 20% piperidine in DMF for 30 minutes removed FMOC/formyl groups. Coupling to the free ε-amino Lys residue was achieved by coupling a ten-fold molar excess of either an FMOC-protected spacer amino acid (ex. FMOC-Glu-OtBu) or acyl chain (ex. CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>14</sub>—COOH) and PyBOP or DEPBT coupling reagent in DMF/N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA). Subsequent removal of the spacer amino acid's FMOC group is followed by repetition of coupling with an acyl chain. Final treatment with 100% TFA resulted in removal of any side chain protecting groups and the N-terminal BOC group. Peptide resins were neutralized with 5% DIEA/DMF, dried, and then cleaved from the support using HF/p-cresol, 95:5, at 0° C. for one hour. Following ether extraction, a 5% acetic acid (HOAc) solution was used to solvate the crude peptide. A sample of the solution was then verified to contain the correct molecular weight peptide by ESI-MS. Correct peptides were purified by RP-HPLC using a linear gradient of 10% acetonitrile (CH3CN)/0.1% TFA to 0.1% TFA in 100% CH3CN. A Vydac C18 22 mm×250 mm protein column was used for the purification. Acylated peptide analogs generally completed elution by a buffer ratio of 20:80.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0821" num="0963">Each of the peptide analogs of Table 4 demonstrated potent activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors. Notably, each of the peptide analogs exhibited an EC50 at the GIP receptor of &lt;0.5 nM, and most of the peptide analogs exhibited an EC50 at the GIP receptor of &lt;0.1 nM. These peptide analogs also exhibited potent activity at the GLP-1 receptor, each peptide analog exhibiting an EC50&lt;0.008 nM. The peptide analogs lacking a Glu at position 3 demonstrated potent activity at the glucagon receptor, each peptide analog of which exhibited an EC50&lt;0.03 nM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0822" num="0964">In general, peptide analogs comprising an AIB at position 20 or a combination of Glu at position 16 and a C-terminal extension exhibited highly potent activity at the GIP receptor. Also, peptide analogs comprising AIB at position 2 generally exhibited greater activity at the GIP receptor, as compared to a corresponding peptide analog comprising d-Ser at position 2 (e.g., compare EC50s at GIP receptor between SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 3 or SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6)</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0823" num="0965">Exemplary peptide analogs of the present disclosures were made as essentially described in Example 1. The peptide analogs were similar in structure, comprising an amino acid sequence based on native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) with the native His at position 1, a DPP-IV protective amino acid at position 2, and an alpha helix stabilizing amino acid at position 16, except that the position at which an acylated amino acid occurred varied among this set of peptide analogs. All peptides were amidated at the C-terminus. The peptides were then tested for activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors, as described in Example 2. A composite of the results from multiple different activity assays are shown in Table 5 for some of the peptides made and tested.</div>

Each test group of mice was made of nineteen mice and each mouse was subcutaneously injected with a 10 nmol/kg dose of peptide or a vehicle control. Body weight and food intake were measured on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 post administration, while fasting blood glucose levels were measured on days 0 and 7. The mice were fasted for 6 hours prior to the measurement of blood glucose on days 0 and 7. Ad lib blood glucose levels were additionally measured on day 5 post-administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0828" num="0970">All of the mice injected with a GIP receptor-active glucagon analog demonstrated a significant reduction (a reduction between about 11% and about 27%) in body weight seven days following administration, as compared to the mice administered a vehicle control. Additionally all of the mice injected with a GIP receptor-active glucagon analog exhibited a substantial reduction (a reduction between about 43% and about 65%) in blood glucose levels seven days post-administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0829" num="0971">Another study was carried out in male db/db mice to analyze the in vivo activities of GIP receptor-active glucagon analogs. In this study, a 20 nmol/kg dose of a GIP receptor-active glucagon analog having an amino acid sequence of one of SEQ ID NOs: 28, 31, 37, 135 and 136 was administered to the mice via subcutaneous injection. A vehicle control was administered to a control group of mice. Blood glucose levels were assayed prior to administration and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosing. Body weight was measured before dosing and 72 hours after dosing. Consistent with the results observed in the DIO mice study, all mice that were administered a GIP receptor-active glucagon analog demonstrated a substantial reduction in body weight (a reduction between about 2% and about 5%), as compared to the vehicle control group. Also, all mice that received a GIP receptor-active glucagon analog exhibited a reduction in blood glucose levels.</div>

The body weight and food intake of the mice were measured on Days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7, while blood glucose levels were measured on Days 0 and 7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0841" num="0983">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the body weight of mice that received injections of the acylated peptides demonstrated at least a 5% decrease in total body weight by Day 7.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0842" num="0984">Acylated peptides comprising the amino acid sequence of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) with a AIB at position 2, Glu at position 16 (except when position 16 is acylated), Ala at position 18, Leu at position 27, Asp at position 28, Gly at position 29, followed by the amino acid sequence GPSSGSPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 5), and a C-terminal amidation were made as essentially described in Example 1. The peptides differed by the type of acylation, type of acylation spacer, and/or position of acylated amino acid. The peptides were then tested for in vitro activity at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP-1 receptor, and the GIP receptor as essentially described in Example 2. Table 10 summarizes the structure and activities of each peptide.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0844" num="0986">Select peptides from Tables 10 (peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 145, 148, and 152) and peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 28 and 89 were tested for in vivo activities in DIO mice (having an original average body weight of 58.0 g) on a high fat, diabetogenic diet. The peptides at a dose of 10 nmol/kg (of the original average body weight) were subcutaneously injected on Days 0 and 3. The body weight and food intake of the mice were measured on Days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7, while blood glucose levels were measured on Days 0 and 7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0845" num="0987">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the mice that received an injection of one of these peptides demonstrated a decreased body weight over the course of 7 days, as compared to vehicle controls. The mice that received injections of the peptides demonstrated at least a 5% decrease in total body weight by Day 7 of which two demonstrated at least a 10% decrease in total body weight by Day 7.</div>
<heading id="h-0059">Example 18</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0846" num="0988">Acylated peptides comprising a “mini-PEG” spacer were made as essentially described in Example 1. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> represents a schematic of the structures of these acylated peptides. The peptides comprising a mini-PEG spacer were tested for in vitro activity at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP-1 receptor, and the GIP receptor as essentially described in Example 2, and compared to the activities of acylated peptides comprising no spacer or a E spacer. All peptides of this experiment comprised the amino acid sequence of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) with AIB at position 2, Glu at position 16, Ala at position 18, Leu at position 28, Asp at position 28, Gly at position 29, followed by the amino acid sequence GPSSGSPPPSK (SEQ ID NO: 9), wherein K was an acylated amino acid, and a C-terminal amidation. Table 11 summarizes the structure and activities of each peptide.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0854" num="0996">Peptides were S-alkylated in three different ways. In a first way, an S-palmityl akylated Cys residue was part of the peptide backbone. The akylated Cys residue was located at position 40. The structure is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (bottom) and is listed as SEQ ID NO: 164 in the sequence listing. In a second way, an S-palmityl akylated Cys residue was attached to a Lys residue, which Lys residue was located at position 40 of the peptide. The resulting structure is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (Cys-S—Palmitic) and is listed as SEQ ID NO: 165 in the sequence listing. In a third way, an S-palmityl akylated Cys residue was attached to a spacer residue (gamma-glutamic acid) which was in turn attached to a Lys residue located at position 40 of the peptide. The resulting structure is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (γE-Cys-S-palmitic) and is listed as SEQ ID NO: 166 in the sequence listing.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0866" num="1008">Body weight and food intake was measured on every other day, beginning with Day 0 (the day of first administration). Body composition was measured on Days 0 and 19, while ad lib blood glucose levels were measured on Days 0, 7, 14, and 20. ipGTT (1 g/kg) was measured on Day 20 at 0, 15, 20, 60, 120 minutes post-glucose injection). Necropsy (liver and pancreas) and a final bleed was measured on day 22 (after an overnight fast).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0867" num="1009">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, body weight decreased in all animals given a peptide of Table 15. Food intake as measured on Day 19 was decreased in all animals that were given a peptide of Table 15, as compared to mice given a vehicle control. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the insulin levels (as measured on Day 21) also decreased in animals that were given a peptide, as compared to a vehicle. Notably, the mice that had demonstrated the greatest amount of weight loss were also the mice that demonstrated the lowest insulin levels</div>
<heading id="h-0065">Example 24</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0868" num="1010">Peptides demonstrating body weight lowering capability as assessed in Example 21 were selected for additional mutation studies in which amino acids within the C-terminal half of the peptide were modified in one of several ways. In a first way, the peptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 89 was altered such that the amino acid at position 27, 28, or 29 was substituted with an alanine residue. In another way, the peptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 28 was modified to have a Glu at position 28 and an Arg at position 35. It was theorized that a salt bridge between these two amino acids would form a salt bridge to stabilize the Trp cage structure in the C-terminal portion of the peptide. Lastly, the peptide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 28 was modified to include a Gly as the C-terminal amino acid. The peptides, as well as other peptides that look similar to the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 89 or the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 28, were tested for in vitro activities at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP-1 receptor, and G11) receptor as essentially described in Example 2 and the results are provided in Table 16.</div>
