<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to a memory device including a refresh controller.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A memory cell of a memory device includes a transistor serving as a switch for controlling the flow of charges in and out of a capacitor which stores the charges. The charges of course represent data and, more specifically, according to the level of the voltage of the capacitor, data may be high logic (logic 1) or low logic (logic 0).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Retaining the data requires maintaining the charges in the capacitor. Because, charges may leak due to the PN junction of a MOS transistor, the data may be lost. Hence, to prevent data loss, the charges are read before the data is lost, and recharged periodically a process generally referred to as a refresh operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Typically, a refresh operation is performed whenever a refresh command is inputted to a memory from a memory controller. Considering the data retention time of the memory, the memory controller inputs the refresh command to the memory at each set time. The data retention time indicates a time during which data of a memory cell can be retained without a refresh operation. Since memory cells included in a memory device are designed to have a data retention time equal to or more than a reference retention time, the interval between refresh operations may be determined in consideration of the reference retention time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when the charge of a certain memory cell is influenced by an active-precharge operation of a word line adjacent to a word line to which the corresponding memory cell is coupled, the data of the memory cell may be deteriorated within a shorter time than the refresh interval. Such a phenomenon is referred to as a row hammering effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a part of a cell array included in a memory device, in order to describe the row hammer effect. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, BL represents a bit line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, WLK−1, WLK and WLK+1 represent three adjacent word lines which are arranged in parallel within the cell array. WLK with ATTACK_ACT represents a word line of which the active count or frequency is high or the active time is long, and WLK−1 and WLK+1 represent word lines adjacent to the word line WLK. CELL_K−1, CELL_K and CELL_K+1 represent memory cells coupled to the word lines WLK−1, WLK and WLK+1, respectively. The memory cells CELL_K−1, CELL_K and CELL_K+1 may include cell transistors TR_K−1, TR_K and TR_K+1 and cell capacitors CAP_K−1, CAP_K and CAP_K+1, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the word line WLK is frequently activated or activated for a long time, the voltage of the word line WLK frequently toggles or is retained at a high voltage for a long time. Then, a coupling effect between the word line WLK and the word lines WLK−1 and WLK+1 may have an influence on data stored in the memory cells CELL_K−1 and CELL_K+1 coupled to the word lines WLK−1 and WLK+1. Such an influence can reduce the time during which the data stored in the memory cells can be retained and is generally known as the word line or row hammer effect.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Hereafter, a normal refresh operation may indicate an operation of refreshing a word line corresponding to a counting address, and a target refresh operation may indicate an operation of refreshing a word line corresponding to a target address.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, the various embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a configuration diagram of a memory device which performs a target refresh operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the memory device may include a memory bank <b>210</b>, an active controller <b>220</b>, a refresh counter <b>230</b>, a target address generator <b>240</b>, a refresh controller <b>250</b> and an address selector <b>201</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The memory bank <b>210</b> may include a plurality of word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLx, a plurality of bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BLy, and a plurality of memory cells MC coupled between the word lines and the bit lines, where x and y are natural numbers. The memory bank <b>210</b> may include circuits for controlling the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLx and the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BLy and writing data to the memory cells or reading data of the memory cells, which are well known in the art and as such are not are not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The memory bank <b>210</b> may activate a word line corresponding to a row address RADD received from the address selector during an active period of an active signal ACTIVE received from the active controller <b>220</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The address selector <b>201</b> may select an input address IADD and output the selected input address as the row address RADD. When a refresh section signal REFS is activated at a refresh operation section, the address selector <b>201</b> may select a counting address CADD and output the selected signal as the row address RADD, and when a target refresh section signal TRRS is activated at a target refresh operation section, the address selector <b>201</b> may select a target address TADD and output the selected address as the row address RADD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The active controller <b>220</b> may enable the active signal ACTIVE in response to an active command ACT, and disable the active signal ACTIVE in response to a precharge command PRE. The active controller <b>220</b> may activate the active signal ACTIVE during a set period, in response to a refresh signal REFP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">When the refresh signal REFP is activated, the refresh counter <b>230</b> may perform counting to generate the counting address CADD. For example, when the refresh signal REFP is activated, the refresh counter <b>230</b> may increase the value of the counting address CADD by 1. When the value of the counting address CADD is increased by 1, it may indicate that the counting address CADD is changed to select the (K+1)th word line this time in case where the Kth word line was selected last time. However, when the target refresh section signal TRRS is enabled, the refresh counter <b>230</b> may not perform counting even though the refresh signal REFP is enabled, but retain the value of the counting address CADD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The target address generator <b>240</b> may store the address of a row hammering word line between points of time that the refresh command REF is applied. The address of the row hammering word line will be hereafter referred to as a row hammering address. The row hammering word line may indicate a word line of which the active count or frequency is equal to or more than a reference count or frequency or which satisfies other conditions that may deteriorate data of memory cells coupled to word lines adjacent thereto. The row hammering word line may be detected by detecting logic or a memory controller in the memory device. The detection signal DET is enabled when the activated word line is a row hammering word line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In the memory device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the target address generator <b>240</b> may store one address. When the detection signal DET is enabled, the target address generator <b>240</b> stores an input address IADD which is a row hammering address. When the refresh signal REFP is enabled in a state where the target refresh section signal TRRS is enabled, the target address generator <b>240</b> may generate a target address TADD by adding or subtracting a set value to or from the stored address. For example, when the refresh signal REFP is enabled for the first time in a state where the target refresh section signal TRRS is activated, the target address generator <b>240</b> may generate a target address TADD by subtracting 1 from the stored address, and the target address TADD will be hereafter referred to as a first target address. When the refresh signal REFP is enabled for the second time, the target address generator <b>240</b> may generate a target address TADD by adding 1 to the stored address, and the target address TADD will be hereafter referred to as a second target address.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The refresh controller <b>250</b> may generate the refresh signal REFP and the refresh section signal REFS in response to the refresh command REF. When the refresh command REF is applied, the refresh controller <b>250</b> may activate the refresh section signal REFS during a refresh section in which a refresh operation is performed, and enable the refresh signal REFP one or more times during the refresh section. Hereafter, suppose that the refresh controller <b>250</b> enables the refresh signal REFP three times during the refresh section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">When the refresh signal REFP is enabled for the first time, a word line corresponding to the counting address CADD may be refreshed. Then, when the target refresh section signal TRRS is enabled and the refresh signal REFP is enabled for the second time, a word line corresponding to the first target address TADD may be refreshed, and when the refresh signal REFP is enabled for the third time, a word line corresponding to the second target address TADD may be refreshed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The target address generator <b>240</b> may store one address between two adjacent refresh commands. A target refresh operation using the stored address may be performed in response to the latter refresh command between the two adjacent refresh commands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram for describing an equal-interval refresh operation and a bust refresh operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The number of refresh commands REF which the memory controller (not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) applies to the memory bank <b>210</b> during a preset time may be preset according to design. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the refresh command REF may be applied at equal intervals (tRFC) in the case of the equal-interval refresh operation (section A). At this time, the equal interval (tRFC) may be set to equal a value derived by dividing the set time by the designed number of refresh commands REF to be performed during the set time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment, the memory controller may skip refresh commands REF which are to be applied at set time points, as indicated by SKIP<b>1</b>, SKIP<b>2</b> and SKIP<b>3</b>. In such a case, in order to apply all refresh commands REF corresponding to the designed number during a set time, the memory controller after the skipping period of SKIP<b>1</b>, SKIP <b>2</b>, and SKIP<b>3</b>, may successively apply the remaining preset number of refresh commands REF at a shorter interval than the equal-interval refresh operation, so that they may performed within the preset period. In other words, the memory controller may compensate for the skipped refresh commands REF. Such a refresh operation is referred to as a burst refresh operation (section B).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> describes the normal and target refresh operations of the memory device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, when the refresh commands REF are applied at equal intervals, one address (for example, ADD<b>1</b>) may be stored in the target address generator <b>240</b> in case where the detection signal DET is activated between two adjacent refresh commands REF, and a target refresh operation using the stored address ADD<b>1</b> may be performed in response to the latter refresh command REF between the two adjacent refresh commands REF. For example, a first target address may be set to ADD<b>1</b>−1, and a second target address may be set to ADD<b>1</b>+1. Hence, in this example, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, word lines corresponding to the addresses ADD<b>1</b>−1 and ADD<b>1</b>+1 the data of which are subject to deterioration due to a row hammering effect are immediately refreshed through the target refresh operation, thus preventing the row hammering effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a diagram describing a problem which may occur during the normal and target refresh operations of the memory device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, target refresh operations for addresses ADD<b>1</b> to ADD<b>3</b> stored in the target address generator <b>240</b> cannot be performed in a section X where refresh commands REF are skipped as indicated by SKIP<b>1</b>, SKIP<b>2</b> and SKIP<b>3</b>. That is because, since the target address generator <b>240</b> can store only one address, the address ADD<b>1</b> is deleted the moment the address ADD<b>2</b> is stored, the address ADD<b>2</b> is deleted the moment the address ADD<b>3</b> is stored, and the address ADD<b>3</b> is deleted the moment the address ADD<b>4</b> is stored.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Thus, although the target refresh operations using the ADD<b>1</b> to ADD<b>4</b> need to be performed during a burst refresh operation section Y, only the target refresh operation using the address ADD<b>4</b> is performed. Thus, it is difficult for the memory device to properly cope with data deterioration caused by the row hammering effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a configuration diagram of a memory device, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the memory device may include a memory bank <b>510</b>, an active controller <b>520</b>, a refresh counter <b>530</b>, a target address generator <b>540</b>, a refresh controller <b>550</b>, a control signal generator <b>560</b>, a target refresh controller <b>570</b> and an address selector <b>501</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The memory bank <b>510</b>, the active controller <b>520</b>, the refresh counter <b>530</b>, the refresh controller <b>550</b> and the address selector <b>501</b> may be configured and operated in the same manner as the corresponding memory bank <b>210</b>, the active controller <b>220</b>, the refresh counter <b>230</b>, the refresh controller <b>250</b> and the address selector <b>201</b> of the memory device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The target refresh controller <b>570</b> may detect a row hammering address using an input address IADD and an active command ACT, and enable a detection signal DET when the row hammering address is detected. The target refresh controller <b>570</b> may detect a word line of which the active count or frequency is equal to or more than a reference count or frequency or which satisfies other conditions which deteriorate data of memory cells coupled to adjacent word lines, using the input address IADD and the active command ACT. When the input address IADD and the active command ACT are used, the active count and frequency of each word line can be recognized. A row hammering address may be detected through various methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">When a row hammering word line is detected between two adjacent refresh commands REF, the target refresh controller <b>570</b> may enable a target refresh section signal TRRS during a set section, in response to the latter refresh command REF between the two adjacent refresh commands REF. The set section may indicate a section required for performing a target refresh operation using a target address which is generated through a stored address. For example, when the refresh signal REFP is enabled three times in response to the refresh command REF, the target refresh controller <b>570</b> may enable the target refresh section signal TRRS in a section where two refresh signals REFP of the three refresh signals REFP are included. In addition, the target refresh controller <b>570</b> may enable the target refresh section signal TRRS in other sections where a target refresh operation is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The control signal generator <b>560</b> may detect a skip of the refresh command and a burst refresh operation, and generate a control signal CON for controlling the target address generator <b>540</b>. The control signal generator <b>560</b> may enable the control signal CON in response to the refresh command REF in a section where the refresh command REF is applied at a first interval, enable the control signal CON at a second interval equal to or longer than the first interval during a skip operation section where the refresh command REF is not applied for a longer time than the first interval, and disable the control signal CON during a burst refresh operation section where the refresh command REF is applied at a third interval shorter than the first interval.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Hence, unlike the target address generator <b>240</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the target address generator <b>540</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may store a plurality of row hammering addresses. The target address generator <b>540</b> may store a plurality of addresses the number of which corresponds to the number of times the refresh command REF is skipped. The target address generator <b>540</b> may also generate one or more target addresses using the stored address or addresses during a burst refresh operation. When the number of times the refresh command REF was skipped is k where k is 0, 1, 2, . . . , the target address generator <b>540</b> may store (k+1) row hammering addresses during a section where the refresh command REF was skipped. For example, when the number of times the refresh command REF was skipped is 3, the target address generator <b>540</b> may store four row hammering addresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a configuration diagram of the target address generator <b>540</b>.</div>
