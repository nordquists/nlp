<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/993,207, filed Jun. 11, 2013, now U.S. Pat. No. 9,285,146, entitled “Ejector”, which is the U.S. national stage of PCT/CN11/00001, filed Jan. 4, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety as if set forth at length.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to refrigeration. More particularly, it relates to ejector refrigeration systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Earlier proposals for ejector refrigeration systems are found in U.S. Pat. No. 1,836,318 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,277,660. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one basic example of an ejector refrigeration system <b>20</b>. The system includes a compressor <b>22</b> having an inlet (suction port) <b>24</b> and an outlet (discharge port) <b>26</b>. The compressor and other system components are positioned along a refrigerant circuit or flowpath <b>27</b> and connected via various conduits (lines). A discharge line <b>28</b> extends from the outlet <b>26</b> to the inlet <b>32</b> of a heat exchanger (a heat rejection heat exchanger in a normal mode of system operation (e.g., a condenser or gas cooler)) <b>30</b>. A line <b>36</b> extends from the outlet <b>34</b> of the heat rejection heat exchanger <b>30</b> to a primary inlet (liquid or supercritical or two-phase inlet) <b>40</b> of an ejector <b>38</b>. The ejector <b>38</b> also has a secondary inlet (saturated or superheated vapor or two-phase inlet) <b>42</b> and an outlet <b>44</b>. A line <b>46</b> extends from the ejector outlet <b>44</b> to an inlet <b>50</b> of a separator <b>48</b>. The separator has a liquid outlet <b>52</b> and a gas outlet <b>54</b>. A suction line <b>56</b> extends from the gas outlet <b>54</b> to the compressor suction port <b>24</b>. The lines <b>28</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>56</b>, and components therebetween define a primary loop <b>60</b> of the refrigerant circuit <b>27</b>. A secondary loop <b>62</b> of the refrigerant circuit <b>27</b> includes a heat exchanger <b>64</b> (in a normal operational mode being a heat absorption heat exchanger (e.g., evaporator)). The evaporator <b>64</b> includes an inlet <b>66</b> and an outlet <b>68</b> along the secondary loop <b>62</b> and expansion device <b>70</b> is positioned in a line <b>72</b> which extends between the separator liquid outlet <b>52</b> and the evaporator inlet <b>66</b>. An ejector secondary inlet line <b>74</b> extends from the evaporator outlet <b>68</b> to the ejector secondary inlet <b>42</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In the normal mode of operation, gaseous refrigerant is drawn by the compressor <b>22</b> through the suction line <b>56</b> and inlet <b>24</b> and compressed and discharged from the discharge port <b>26</b> into the discharge line <b>28</b>. In the heat rejection heat exchanger, the refrigerant loses/rejects heat to a heat transfer fluid (e.g., fan-forced air or water or other fluid). Cooled refrigerant exits the heat rejection heat exchanger via the outlet <b>34</b> and enters the ejector primary inlet <b>40</b> via the line <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The exemplary ejector <b>38</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is formed as the combination of a motive (primary) nozzle <b>100</b> nested within an outer member <b>102</b>. The primary inlet <b>40</b> is the inlet to the motive nozzle <b>100</b>. The outlet <b>44</b> is the outlet of the outer member <b>102</b>. The primary refrigerant flow <b>103</b> enters the inlet <b>40</b> and then passes into a convergent section <b>104</b> of the motive nozzle <b>100</b>. It then passes through a throat section <b>106</b> and an expansion (divergent) section <b>108</b> through an outlet (exit) <b>110</b> of the motive nozzle <b>100</b>. The motive nozzle <b>100</b> accelerates the flow <b>103</b> and decreases the pressure of the flow. The secondary inlet <b>42</b> forms an inlet of the outer member <b>102</b>. The pressure reduction caused to the primary flow by the motive nozzle helps draw the secondary flow <b>112</b> into the outer member. The outer member includes a mixer having a convergent section <b>114</b> and an elongate throat or mixing section <b>116</b>. The outer member also has a divergent section or diffuser <b>118</b> downstream of the elongate throat or mixing section <b>116</b>. The motive nozzle outlet <b>110</b> is positioned within the convergent section <b>114</b>. As the flow <b>103</b> exits the outlet <b>110</b>, it begins to mix with the flow <b>112</b> with further mixing occurring through the mixing section <b>116</b> which provides a mixing zone. In operation, the primary flow <b>103</b> may typically be supercritical upon entering the ejector and subcritical upon exiting the motive nozzle. The secondary flow <b>112</b> is gaseous (or a mixture of gas with a smaller amount of liquid) upon entering the secondary inlet port <b>42</b>. The resulting combined flow <b>120</b> is a liquid/vapor mixture and decelerates and recovers pressure in the diffuser <b>118</b> while remaining a mixture. Upon entering the separator, the flow <b>120</b> is separated back into the flows <b>103</b> and <b>112</b>. The flow <b>103</b> passes as a gas through the compressor suction line as discussed above. The flow <b>112</b> passes as a liquid to the expansion valve <b>70</b>. The flow <b>112</b> may be expanded by the valve <b>70</b> (e.g., to a low quality (two-phase with small amount of vapor)) and passed to the evaporator <b>64</b>. Within the evaporator <b>64</b>, the refrigerant absorbs heat from a heat transfer fluid (e.g., from a fan-forced air flow or water or other liquid) and is discharged from the outlet <b>68</b> to the line <b>74</b> as the aforementioned gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Use of an ejector serves to recover pressure/work. Work recovered from the expansion process is used to compress the gaseous refrigerant prior to entering the compressor. Accordingly, the pressure ratio of the compressor (and thus the power consumption) may be reduced for a given desired evaporator pressure. The quality of refrigerant entering the evaporator may also be reduced. Thus, the refrigeration effect per unit mass flow may be increased (relative to the non-ejector system). The distribution of fluid entering the evaporator is improved (thereby improving evaporator performance). Because the evaporator does not directly feed the compressor, the evaporator is not required to produce superheated refrigerant outflow. The use of an ejector cycle may thus allow reduction or elimination of the superheated zone of the evaporator. This may allow the evaporator to operate in a two-phase state which provides a higher heat transfer performance (e.g., facilitating reduction in the evaporator size for a given capability).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The exemplary ejector may be a fixed geometry ejector or may be a controllable ejector. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows controllability provided by a needle valve <b>130</b> having a needle <b>132</b> and an actuator <b>134</b>. The actuator <b>134</b> shifts a tip portion <b>136</b> of the needle into and out of the throat section <b>106</b> of the motive nozzle <b>100</b> to modulate flow through the motive nozzle and, in turn, the ejector overall. Exemplary actuators <b>134</b> are electric (e.g., solenoid or the like). The actuator <b>134</b> may be coupled to and controlled by a controller <b>140</b> which may receive user inputs from an input device <b>142</b> (e.g., switches, keyboard, or the like) and sensors (not shown). The controller <b>140</b> may be coupled to the actuator and other controllable system components (e.g., valves, the compressor motor, and the like) via control lines <b>144</b> (e.g., hardwired or wireless communication paths). The controller may include one or more: processors; memory (e.g., for storing program information for execution by the processor to perform the operational methods and for storing data used or generated by the program(s)); and hardware interface devices (e.g., ports) for interfacing with input/output devices and controllable system components.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">As is discussed further below, in addition to or separately from controlling an effective area of the throat, an effective area of the motive nozzle exit may be varied/controlled. The area ratio of a nozzle such as that of an ejector is ratio of exit area to throat area. With a conventional controllable ejector, using the needle to reduce throat area causes an associated increase in area ratio. A fifty percent reduction in throat area would cause a doubling in area ratio. If the area ratio is too large, the supersonic flow will be overexpanded. This results in a loss of efficiency which can be in the range of 20%. Thus, with an ejector having a controllable throat area, adding exit area control allows for an at least partial compensation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an ejector <b>200</b> which may be formed as a modification of the ejector <b>38</b> (either an actual modification or a design modification) and may be used in place thereof. An exemplary means for varying the effective area of the exit comprises a valve element (needle) which, along at least a portion of its range of motion, extends through the exit. A first exemplary such needle (exit needle) <b>204</b> is shown coaxial with the needle <b>132</b> (throat needle) along a centerline <b>1000</b> of the ejector. A needle <b>204</b> has a tip portion <b>206</b> opposite and facing the tip portion <b>136</b> of the needle <b>132</b>. The needle <b>204</b> has a shaft <b>208</b> extending downstream from the tip. For moving the needle <b>204</b> to vary the effective area of the exit (e.g., the annular area between the needle and the inner surface of the motive nozzle at the exit or at a location close enough to the exit to produce the same or similar effect), an actuator <b>210</b> is coupled to the needle. Exemplary actuator <b>210</b> is a rotary actuator (e.g., a step motor). The exemplary actuator <b>210</b> is coupled to the needle valve via a geartrain. The exemplary geartrain includes a drive bevel gear <b>220</b> mounted to a shaft <b>222</b> of the actuator <b>210</b> to be driven thereby. Teeth of the drive bevel gear <b>220</b> are enmeshed with teeth of a driven bevel gear <b>224</b>. The exemplary shaft <b>222</b> and its axis of rotation are orthogonal to and intersecting the needle shaft and the centerline of the ejector. Back and forth reciprocal rotation by the actuator <b>210</b> drives back and forth reciprocal translation of the needle <b>204</b>. Although shown for ease of illustration as conical tip protuberances, the tips may be other than conical and may have similar maximum diameter to an adjacent portion of the shaft an may have known or yet-developed profiles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The exemplary needle <b>204</b> has a downstream divergent tapering portion <b>240</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). The exemplary range of motion extends from a maximally inserted/extended condition/position <b>204</b>′ to a maximally withdrawn/retracted condition/position <b>204</b>″. An exemplary range of motion is at least 25% of the divergent length L<sub>D </sub>of the motive nozzle, more narrowly, 75-95%. Along at least a portion of this range of motion, the tapering portion is axially aligned with the exit so that insertion of the needle decreases the effective exit area (e.g., as approximated by the cross-sectional area of the annular space/gap between the exit and the portion <b>240</b>). Similarly, retraction increases the effective exit area. The exemplary expansion (divergent) section <b>108</b> is shown having a characteristic half angle θ<sub>2</sub>. The exemplary portion <b>240</b> is shown having an exemplary half angle θ<sub>1</sub>. In the example, θ<sub>2 </sub>is constant so that the expansion section <b>108</b> is conical. Similarly, at least over some part of the tapering portion <b>240</b>, θ<sub>1 </sub>is constant to define a frustum of a cone. If based on an existing ejector or its motive nozzle, the angles and dimensions of the ejector and/or nozzle may be preserved. Exemplary θ<sub>1 </sub>for such configuration is 0-30°, more narrowly 0-10°, or 2-10°, or 5-10°. Similarly exemplary θ<sub>2 </sub>is 0-30°, more narrowly 0-10°, or 2-10°, or 5-10°. Other nozzle profiles including non-uniform angles θ<sub>1</sub>. and θ<sub>2 </sub>are possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">By way of example, the effective exit cross-sectional area reduction between the min and max conditions may be at least 5% of the max condition, more narrowly, at least 10% or 10-40%. These may be smaller than associate throat area reductions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4A</figref> show a single-needle ejector <b>300</b> which may be otherwise similar to the ejector <b>200</b> but which lacks the needle <b>132</b> and associated actuator, etc. Instead, the proportions of the needle <b>304</b> and the motive nozzle are such that, at least along a portion of the range of motion of the needle, the needle extends into the throat and spans a distance from the throat to the exit. Along at least this portion of the range of motion, the needle controls both the effective throat area and the effective exit area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an ejector <b>320</b> which may be otherwise similar but having a needle <b>322</b> which, along at least a portion of its range of motion, controls only an effective area of the throat and not the exit (e.g., by having the tapering portion end ahead of the exit). This may be achieved by a narrower and/or relatively short tapering portion <b>324</b>. An exemplary control over the throat area may have a similar range as the aforementioned control over exit area. For example, a difference in area between min throat and max throat conditions may be at least 10% of the max throat condition area, more narrowly, at least 20% or 35-100%. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an ejector <b>340</b> wherein only the exit area is controlled by a needle <b>342</b> having a shorter, broader tapering portion <b>344</b> positioned to control only exit area and not throat area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">As a further alternative, a single needle may be actuated from upstream but extend through the motive nozzle throat so as to control effective properties of the divergent section <b>108</b> and the exit <b>110</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a motive nozzle of an ejector <b>400</b> which may be otherwise similar to the ejector <b>38</b> but with a different needle. The exemplary needle <b>402</b> has a relatively narrow upstream portion <b>404</b> which forms a main body of the needle. Downstream of the upstream portion <b>404</b> is a divergent (downstream divergent) portion <b>406</b>. Downstream of divergent portion <b>406</b> is a convergent (downstream convergent) portion <b>408</b> which extends to a downstream tip <b>410</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also shows a range of motion between an upstream-most maximally retracted position <b>402</b>′ and a downstream-most maximally extended position <b>402</b>″. It can be seen that, over some portions of the range of motion, the needle <b>402</b> controls both the effective throat area (e.g., the area of the annular space between the throat <b>106</b> and the needle) and the effective exit area. The exemplary divergent portion <b>406</b> has a half angle which may have the same magnitude as θ<sub>1</sub>. The narrow portion of the needle at the upstream end <b>412</b> of the tapering portion (which forms a junction with the straight portion) may have a diameter less than 75% (more narrowly less than 50%) of the maximum needle diameter (e.g., the diameter at the junction <b>414</b> between <b>408</b> and <b>406</b>), with a lower boundary limited by strength of material (e.g., of the stainless steel used in needles). This may also be less than 50% of the throat diameter, more narrowly less than 25%. An exemplary such configuration is estimated to eliminate a quarter to three quarters of the losses associated with throat control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows motive nozzle of an ejector <b>430</b> which may be otherwise similar to the ejector <b>38</b> or the ejector <b>400</b>. For example, relative to ejector <b>38</b>, the ejector <b>430</b> may add similar divergent and convergent portions <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> to its needle <b>432</b>, respectively, as does the ejector <b>400</b> while retaining a relatively broader proximal main shaft portion <b>438</b>. The needle (shown with broken line illustrations of a retracted condition and an extended condition) has a convergently downstream tapering portion (downstream convergent) <b>440</b> extending downstream from a junction <b>442</b> with the shaft portion <b>438</b> to a junction <b>446</b> with the portion <b>406</b>. This junction <b>446</b> establishes a local waist in the needle. The local waist may be, in at least part of the range of motion, near the throat <b>106</b>. With the exemplary arrangement, retraction from the solid line position may have a similar effect to retraction of the needle of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> on both effective throat and exit areas. However, a further insertion also has the same effect on exit area as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> but tends to reduce effective throat area as a greater proportion of the throat is occupied by the portion <b>440</b>. In an exemplary redesign from a convention needle, the tapering portion <b>440</b> may be preserved from near the tip of the baseline needle. An exemplary half angle of taper is about 5°, more broadly 2-15°. A minimum diameter at the neck/junction <b>446</b> between the portions <b>440</b> and <b>406</b> is may correspond to that of the end <b>412</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows another modification in a motive nozzle of an ejector <b>456</b> wherein the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> protuberance is replaced in a needle <b>462</b> (shown retracted but with a broken line illustration of an extended condition) by a relatively narrow counterpart including a proximal portion <b>464</b> extending from the tapering portion <b>440</b> to create a stepped axial cross-section. A distal tapering portion <b>466</b> extends to a tip <b>468</b>. Over much of its range of motion, with the portion <b>464</b> at the exit, there will be little effect on the effective exit area. However, with retraction, the tapering portion <b>466</b> will pass through the exit occupying lesser and lesser fractions of the exit and thereby increasing effective exit area. A diameter of the portion <b>466</b> may be similar to that of the junctions <b>412</b>, <b>446</b>. Length of the portion <b>464</b> may be effective to provide simultaneous control of throat and exit areas along at least part of its range of motion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an ejector <b>480</b> otherwise similar to the ejector <b>460</b> but having a needle <b>482</b> relatively longer intermediate portion <b>484</b>. A distal/downstream tapering portion <b>490</b> of the needle, tapering from the intermediate portion <b>484</b> to the tip <b>492</b> is positioned to control an effective area of the mixer during at least a portion of the range of motion of the needle. The mixer may be oversized when the nozzle areas are reduced. With the needle tip <b>492</b> penetrating into the mixer constant area portion, the flow area of the mixer also is reduced to at least partially compensate for reduced total flow. The needle intermediate portion <b>484</b> and tip <b>492</b> may induce shocks in the mixer and avoid shocks occurring in the diffuser.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The ejectors may be fabricated from conventional components using conventional techniques appropriate for the particular intended uses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">A controllable ejector, such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is generally used to control the high-side pressure (e.g., in a baseline system or in modifications herein). The high-side pressure is the refrigerant pressure that exists from the compressor exit <b>26</b> to the ejector inlet <b>40</b>. For transcritical cycles such as CO<sub>2</sub>, raising the high side pressure decreases the enthalpy out of the gas cooler and increases the cooling available for a given compressor mass flow rate. However, increasing the high side pressure also increases the compressor power. There is an optimum pressure value that maximizes the system efficiency at a given operating condition. Generally, this target value varies with the refrigerant temperature leaving the gas cooler. A high side pressure-temperature curve may be programmed in the controller. To raise the high-side pressure the throat area <b>106</b> is reduced. The controller does this by moving the needle <b>132</b> into the throat (to the right in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">For the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> embodiment, there are two independent actuators which may be varied by the controller <b>140</b>. The upstream needle <b>132</b> would be controlled in the same way as the traditional ejector needle in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>; that is, it would be used to control the high-side pressure. The downstream needle <b>204</b> is varied to control the area expansion ratio of the motive nozzle. The expansion ratio can be defined as the ratio of the exit area of the motive nozzle (at <b>110</b>) divided by the throat (or other minimum) area of the motive nozzle (at <b>106</b>). For a given system operating condition there is an optimum expansion ratio. Increasing the expansion ratio increases the depressurization of the refrigerant that occurs in the motive nozzle. Generally it is desirable, for optimum ejector efficiency, to depressurize the motive flow to a value that is similar to the pressure at the suction port <b>42</b>. As needle <b>132</b> is inserted into the throat (moves to the right) to raise the high-side pressure, the area ratio increases. To maintain the same area ratio, needle <b>204</b> is moved toward the throat (to the left).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">It may also be desirable to vary the expansion ratio while holding needle <b>132</b> constant if the system operating conditions change. For example, if the system <b>20</b> is a container refrigeration system, then there may be several different cold-air set points. If the cold-air set point, is lowered then the evaporator <b>64</b> pressure will decrease. To optimize the ejector performance it may be desirable to increase the area ratio in order to lower the pressure of the refrigerant leaving the motive nozzle. To do this controller <b>140</b> may further insert needle <b>204</b> into the motive nozzle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> have a single downstream needle <b>304</b>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> have a single upstream needle. The primary function of such needle is to vary the throat size to control the high-side pressure. By doing so it also varies the exit area. The area ratio as a function of throat size is pre-designed by the needle and motive nozzle geometry. The needle of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may reduce the throat size either by moving to the right (downstream) or to the left (upstream) from the maximum throat area position. In this way, the change in area ratio with throat size will be different depending on which way the needle is moved. Therefore the controller may choose between two different area ratios for a given throat area. For example, if the throat is being reduced from the max. throat condition due to reduced load, the larger of two available area ratios may be chosen when there is a large overall pressure ratio (between gas cooler and evaporator) and the smaller area ratio may be chosen when there is a smaller overall pressure ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The controller may estimate the pressure at the motive nozzle exit based on models and on the motive nozzle inlet conditions (measured pressure and temperature along line <b>36</b>). The suction port pressure (along line <b>74</b>) may also be measured. The controller may use this information to determine the desired area ratio.</div>
