<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Implementations herein relate to systems and methods of processing information associated with networked systems including features and functionality related to allowing first users, such as celebrities, to interact and process transactions with other users, such as fans of the celebrities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Description of Related Information and Demand:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Celebrities want to offer their work and/or content directly to their fans without gatekeepers like networks, publishers, and record labels, and other middlemen standing in the way preventing them from doing so or taking a large cut of their revenue they could realize from such offerings. The few mundane options that exist have so many drawbacks that they are typically not worth the time needed to employ them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Fans that are passionate i.e. ‘power fan’ users are willing to pay for exclusive content and opportunities from the celebrities they idolize. Moreover, celebrities would like an easy and reputation-preserving way to make money by selling content and experiences to fans, but there are currently many barriers to doing this in a meaningful and efficient way. The lack of a platform/marketplace to facilitate such transactions results in a great deal of pent-up supply and unfulfilled demand. There is a need for systems and methods that solve such problems, e.g., via implementations that involve features such as publicizing this opportunity, registering and enrolling fans and users, collecting revenue, offering access to digital content and other opportunities directly to the fans/users for a set price, for instance a monthly subscription price, and/or delivering the content and opportunities on behalf of the celebrity.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE IMPLEMENTATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary implementations, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a sufficient understanding of the subject matter presented herein. But it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. Moreover, particular aspects described herein are provided by way of example and should not be used to limit the scope of the invention to these particular implementations. In other instances, certain well-known data structures, timing protocols, software operations, procedures, and components have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Celebrities want to offer their work and/or content directly to their fans/users without gatekeepers such as third party networks, publishers, and record labels, and other middlemen standing in the way preventing them from doing so or taking revenue they could realize from such offerings. Accordingly, the present systems and methods allow celebrities, via platform tools and computer network features and functionality as set forth herein, to offer access to digital content and other opportunities directly to the fans/users for a set price, for instance, a monthly subscription price.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Implementations herein provide a technology platform and/or systems or methods that may make the process for exclusive subscription based digital media content between a celebrity and a fan centralized without middlemen, according to some embodiments. This system provides a social middleware and a data platform by reducing transactional friction and providing transaction sharing, security, and privacy. It can also provide personal verification for fans/users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">From a fan/user's perspective, there is currently a barrier between them and the person whom they admire. The fan/user often desires direct interaction with these celebrities but security concerns can keep celebrities away from personal interactions and events that make that viable. Currently, fans/users must work hard to find memorabilia auctions or follow those they admire social media sites, but the fan/user must proactively search these out. Fans/users also use entertainment news, fan magazines and fan clubs, but, among other things, these channels of information are not personal, two-way, or unique. Fans/users may also attend live events to meet or experience being near celebrities, for example, book signings, concerts, conventions, sporting events and charity fundraisers are among the most popular ways fans/users have an experience with their favorite celebrities. However, all of these lack an element of uniqueness and exclusivity, which this system can facilitate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram depicting an illustrative system and interactions between components thereof, consistent with one or more aspects related to the innovations herein. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, such system may serve as a direct channel that automates the connection between celebrities, their fans/users and/or other people or entities who want to offer them opportunities. In some implementations, it may be configured as a connection platform providing delivery and authentication of premium content and unique experiences for fans/users. As mentioned above, celebrity time and attention is a commodity that is often under-leveraged. Systems herein serve as a marketplace for that commodity. The site and platform need not necessarily eliminate intermediary parties (agent, manager, publicist, etc.), but they may render their job more efficient by enabling middlemen to stick to celebrity placements that they consider more worthwhile. A celebrity may employ agents in addition to the systems and methods herein to maximize opportunities. Celebrities may also feel more comfortable using this system, as opposed to existing social media platforms, because it has cloaking tools that preserve their privacy while ensuring authenticity for a fan.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Computer networks as well as associated computer components and processing may be leveraged to provide such communication ability and direct exposure. The illustrative diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of such a network. For instance, the service/experience fulfillment database <b>110</b> in communication with the overall system <b>112</b>. The database <b>110</b> may be configured in communication with the front end web sites <b>120</b> and the vendor fulfillment administration components <b>130</b>. The system <b>112</b> and database <b>120</b> may interact with both the front end web sites <b>120</b> and the vendor fulfillment admin <b>130</b> components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The front end web sites <b>120</b> are the forward facing interfaces for the customers and/or fans <b>122</b>. The vendor fulfillment administration is the rear facing part of the system that connects with the celebrities and/or vendors <b>132</b>. Thus, the system <b>112</b> and database <b>120</b> allow the customers and/or fans <b>122</b> and the celebrity vendors <b>132</b> to connect, at <b>140</b>, both in an information processing context and directly. The system enables physical or digital experiences or services to be scheduled, planned, occur, etc., without third party complications or intervention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In some implementations, vendors <b>132</b> may upload experience based products which appear on the front end web sites <b>120</b>. The customers and/or fans <b>122</b> may then find the experiences and/or products on the front end websites <b>120</b> and purchase these experiences and/or products. The system <b>112</b> may also generate information such as confirmation messages to both the customers <b>122</b> and vendors <b>132</b>. The system <b>112</b> handles the financial aspects of the transactions and/or bank interactions. Vendor <b>132</b> and customer <b>122</b> may optionally negotiate a schedule for the experience as well as a location for the experience, be it either digital or physical. Customers <b>122</b> and vendors <b>132</b> can check the status of the experience deal by logging into the system <b>112</b> or by receiving status updates from the system <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the features shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and described elsewhere herein, the present systems and methods may be configured with various inputs and outputs. For example, implementations may process information received from components associated with entities such as customers, fans, users, studios, companies, potential partners, talent/celebrities or their representatives. Other inputs and information processed therefrom may include data from payment related components, data regarding items for sale or auction, content coming in for submission, information associated with cloaking and/or security, and/or communications from anyone who wants access to the celebrity (e.g., brands, producer, charity, fans/users, etc).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">After processing and/or transformation via the systems and methods herein, outputs as well as information or data regarding products and experiences coming out of the system may include experiences in both physical and digital form, one or more interfaces for celebrities which allow them to approve or decline transactions, personalized or customized content for fans/users, streaming services, and portals or components for the creation of in-house content, among other things.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">With respect to systems and methods herein configured as platform-type arrangements, implementations may include or involve a social middleware, other data platform and/or related components. Here, for example, such implementations may be configurable as a social middleware that combines social media and online commerce. For example, a system may be configured as a stand-alone platform that integrates with other social media platforms, including features of focus and personalization keyed to the specific interests of a user set forth in the social media platform. Implementations may also be configured as a digital repository of opportunities for artists, athletes, and/or other notable figures, including features that assist these individuals in more fully utilizing their time and earning potential.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, connection between celebrities and the public may be configured with a cloaking service/technology that provides a measure of security and privacy for the celebrities. Such cloaking components may allow celebrities using the system to interact with fans/users via social platforms without having to reveal or compromise personal accounts or information. Systems herein may also serve as a trusted marketplace platform that lies between the celebrity and the fans/users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The present system may also include a data platform that allows for information, online communication, and the exchange of opportunities between those using the platform, whether they be consumers, celebrities, charities, etc. Those opportunities may be syndicated and/or archived on their behalf, creating an idea bank that is accessible to multiple users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">As such, implementations are provided where platforms or marketplaces that resolve unfulfilled demand are accomplished and/or where celebrities achieve a reputation-preserving way to make money by selling content and experiences to fans/users. According to some embodiments, for example, systems and methods herein may resolve the underlying drawbacks via features of publicizing this opportunity over computer networks, registering and enrolling fans/users, collecting payments, and/or processing or delivering the content, opportunities and experiences on behalf of the celebrity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Without the present systems and functionality, fans or users would typically receive filtered content not from the celebrity themselves but from the people or entities that represent them. The content that is sent out directly from a celebrity via their own social media accounts is usually sent to many sources at once and may lack an exclusivity that many fans crave. Also, agents and middlemen generally require a fee of their celebrity clients, whereas the present systems may fill gap in a celebrity's opportunity lineup without such middleman influences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">There are multiple illustrative scenarios wherein the platform may be used. Some of these include the promotion of events, charitable fundraisers, memorabilia sales, agents wanting to streamline the submission of opportunities to the celebrities they represent, and situations where celebrities wish to have direct control over opportunities without the need for a middleman, among other things.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Artists, athletes, and luminaries are accomplished people with time and attention that isn't fully utilized. Fame is an intangible asset, but fame has a marketplace value when attached to the time, activities, and memorabilia of a notable person. The systems and methods described herein provide a central way to monetize a celebrity brand and a platform for trading on their famous names for commerce other than via Hollywood-style agents and gatekeepers or other middlemen. The systems and methods described herein are also configured to provide alternative opportunities to celebrities than those that may be found by an agent or middlemen, who may be unable or unwilling to find every opportunity given their own workloads and commitments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the systems and methods described herein can enable celebrities to sidestep the issue wherein an agent usually earns a percentage of a client's paycheck, even when the client finds and negotiates his or her own deals. Not every deal needs an agent and, sometimes, a fan might be a better source for certain types of opportunities. For example, a corporate CEO who is obsessed with baseball might want to invite star baseball players to appear at an event, but an agent might dismiss the request as not being worth the time. Yet, the retired player would have liked to take part in the opportunity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, this system can help celebrities or their representatives maximize smaller and/or alternate opportunities for local celebrities, such as local sports stars or regional TV personalities, this may be a significant method by which they can extend their income and connect with fans/users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart depicting an illustrative process of fulfillment architecture consistent with one or more aspects related to the innovations herein. Through this system, fans/users gain access to exclusive content, experiences, and items directly through a celebrity's page, and this system provides a platform for fans/users to complete the transaction. This can include everything from finding what they want to purchase, arranging for shipping and billing, and finally paying to complete the transaction all in one centralized place.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Celebrities are looking for new, unimpeded ways to engage their fan base. Existing social media platforms, such as those on the Internet, are useful for broadcasting comments and promoting appearances, but are not conducive to interacting with fans/users in a potentially lucrative way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Some traditional methods of engaging the fan base and press are also not popular with celebrities. For example, many celebrities dislike the press and find promotional tours exhausting. Currently, these media tours are the best and only way for celebrities to promote themselves as a brand. There are also not easy nor accessible ways to promote as well as actively sell that brand when a celebrity doesn't have an upcoming film or TV show that's worthy of a sponsored junket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Another problem with fan engagement is that it involves one way fan solicitation of the celebrity. For example, fans/users may have to line up outside of theaters, send tweets, post social media messages, write fan mail and many other activities in the hope that the celebrity will pick them for an autograph, special connection on social media etc. As such, there is a need for systems and methods that offer more predictable options for fans/users willing to pay to ensure that they get the attention they crave. Implementations herein provide tools to supplement and enhance the fan interaction with celebrities with a greater degree of certainty.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Also, current methods of reaching fans/users are limiting for celebrities. Many don't know that they can provide a meaningful connection to fans/users via social media with minimal effort. Examples of under-utilized tools are video chat, email exchange, micro-blogging sites, etc. However, in the present implementations, especially when combined with cloaking devices, the privacy of celebrities can be protected while their direct interaction with fans/users increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">There are many other problems with current celebrity marketing. For example, for celebrities who aren't as popular, or who have a niche level of fame, there are also very few good ways to make money off of that fame. For instance, there may a retired sports star might own some market-worthy memorabilia but that star may have had a relatively short athletic career, and may not even have an agent. This can make it hard to find and tap into their existing fan base. Currently, if the athlete wants to make money selling their memorabilia, he or she might participate in a convention attended by fans/users. However, that athlete may have more fans/users dispersed throughout the United States or the world, who aren't able to attend such a convention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Implementations herein utilize online solutions that enable the celebrity to sell memorabilia online, and reach a wider audience than offline. But selling personal memorabilia on a website may not be optimal, and does not necessarily enhance their personal brand or image. And because celebrities sometimes only sell to niche markets, and because they may not have the tools to reach a large number of people within that market, it's likely that they are not receiving market price for their time and/or memorabilia. Systems and methods herein may increase and help to set the income they receive from selling this memorabilia or making personal appearances by streamlining the sales process for celebrities, aiding in booking appearances and maintaining celebrity reputations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The illustrative flowchart <b>200</b> regarding fulfillment architecture of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of how items can get fulfilled by the back end systems. The process of fulfillment may vary as a function of the type of product and the identity of the entity fulfilling the request. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also illustrates exemplary order status IDs that correspond to each step in the process. Also shown are credit charging steps. In the process, revenue is recognized when the item reaches the shipped step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, each process begins with a checkout in <b>202</b>. The checkout either fails, and is cancelled in <b>204</b>, or succeeds and begins the fulfillment process. If the checkout succeeds, the order is placed and checked for fraud in <b>206</b>. If the fraud check passes, the checkout proceeds to fulfillment ready stage in <b>208</b>. If the fulfillment ready fails, the order is cancelled in <b>204</b>. If the fulfillment is deemed ready, the order proceeds depending on whether the order was for an experience or another product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">If the order is for an experience, the process proceeds to charge the user in <b>210</b>, for example by charging their credit card. Next, the prescheduled events proceed to pending events, whereas the non-prescheduled events proceed to a pending schedule and schedule negotiation until they are successfully schedules. After the pending event stage, the system waits for scheduled time/travel if necessary, and then the event happens. When the event has taken place, revenue may be recognized in <b>260</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">If the order is not for an experience, a determination may be made as to whether the vendor is to fulfill the order or not in <b>212</b>. If the vendor is to fulfill the order, the next determination is whether the order is for a physical or digital goods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">If the order is for physical goods, the goods are picked and personalized in <b>220</b>. If there is an issue in personalization (e.g., an order cannot be personalized as specified), the order goes back to the picked step until the order is correct and ready to proceed. A quality assurance (QA) evaluation is performed, and after QA approval, the physical goods are packed. Then the order price is charged and the carrier ships the goods. Finally, the shipped goods trigger the system to recognize the revenue in <b>260</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">If the goods are digital, the digital goods are produced in <b>230</b>, and then a QA check may be performed on them. If there is an issue, the digital goods are produced again and QA checks again until the order is correct. Once QA approval is obtained, a charge can be issued for payment. A produced pending stage may follow until a period to wait for scheduled delivery time elapses. After this time, the order is sent or posted. Finally, the shipped goods trigger the system to recognize the revenue in <b>260</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">If the goods to be shipped are not vendor fulfilled in <b>212</b>, and the goods are physical, the goods are picked in <b>240</b>. A QA evaluation may also be performed, and if there is an issue, the goods are picked again until QA approves. After QA approval, the physical goods are packed. Then the order price is charged and the carrier ships the goods. Finally, the shipped goods trigger the system to recognize the revenue in <b>260</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">If the goods to be shipped are not vendor fulfilled in <b>212</b>, and the goods are digital, then the digital goods are produced in <b>250</b> and checked by QA. If there is an issue, the digital goods are produced again until QA approves. Next, if the QA approves, the charges are applied. The produced goods are then pending and may have to wait for a scheduled time to send/post the goods. Finally, the shipped goods trigger the system to recognize the revenue in <b>260</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">As such, systems and methods herein provide transactions and monetization for celebrities by providing payment and collection services. The fulfillment platform, with certain illustrative functionality shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, allows for order fulfillment for a variety of scenarios including, but not limited to, single orders or large group purchases such as a group of friends joining together to purchase a private concert. For a celebrity using this system, money paid for their services can be available immediately via a dashboard interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Systems and methods herein may also include different levels of access for fans/users, according to some implementations. Exemplary levels may include a fee-based subscription, a set of privileges earned by actions tracked on the site, and various combinations of the two. Between levels of free membership and all-access paid membership, there may be intermediate levels of membership with varying subscription rates, and corresponding access to information and opportunities for the fan, according to some embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Other aspects of systems and methods herein may include transactional sharing. Implementations may also allow for multiple types of content sharing and transactions. These include, but are not limited to, the selling of memorabilia and the use of digital/online souvenirs as a receipt and keepsake for individual people such as fans/users, celebrities, donors and collectors, as well as organizations such as studios, non-profits, companies, brands, and sports teams including players and owners.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Transactions performed via the platforms herein may include pay-for-content/privileges features and implementations. Among other things, systems and methods involving pay-for-content/privileges functionality may serve as a publishing platform, aggregation tool, and/or distribution channel enabling celebrities to offer exclusive content and a first-look rights on special offers to fans/users for a fee. For example, fans/users may subscribe to a famous theme or endeavor channel (e.g., chefs channel) in order to view a weekly live point-of-view broadcast of the activity or event of interest (e.g., chef cooking a particular dish). Other exemplary implementations may include fans or users subscribing to another channel, such as a famous snowboarder's channel, in order to access an exclusive archive of trick tips and to have the opportunity to buy VIP passes and/or meet-and-greets with the celebrity before they are made available through other channels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Systems and methods herein may utilize a central computer based graphical user interface dashboard that can inform the fan/subscriber of updated digital media content and prices, according to some embodiments. Certain personalized options, for example, may include use of celebrity video, including video shot by the celebrity, and/or augmented reality digital content. Such content may include point-of-view footage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">In some configurations, this content is made exclusive in order to be sold to fans or users via a number of different pricing mechanisms. Illustrative pricing mechanisms include, but are not limited by the following examples:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Freemium: non-paying fans/users will still be able to access small excerpts of celebrity content, and a limited selection of lo-resolution photos; while for a fee based subscription, fans/users are able to access more premium, exclusive content including invitations to special events and high resolution photos.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Bundle pricing: fans/users are able to choose any number of celebrities to receive exclusive content from for one price. For example, the fan may like to follow action stars, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose subscription to their exclusive content runs for $19.99/month, for example, but they may get themselves a deal by purchasing access to exclusive content for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise and Vin Diesel together for $49.99, for example. Such bundling may also be utilized, e.g., for a fan that wants exclusive access to 8 bands but wants a deal for bundling them together rather than paying for access to each one individually.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Pay-per-view: a subscribed fan may have access to a certain tier of personal celebrity videos from which they may choose for a price; additionally, a fan can buy a subscription for a certain celebrity's content, which would then enable them to see a given amount of that celebrity's videos, music or other content.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Premiercast: the present systems and methods may provide fans/users the opportunity to receive what is referred to herein as Premiercast, a high-concept broadcast feed direct from their celebrity, which they will self-select for free via their membership. One example of such broadcasting might include a personalized message from a celebrity, featuring his or her message recorded just yesterday from on the set, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">By means of such fulfillment/architecture features in conjunction with innovative information processing herein, systems and methods herein provide fans/users and celebrities with improved ways to connect. For example, a fan/consumer can use the platform to verify celebrity presence and participation on the site. Another example may be the ability to unite with other platform-based fans/users to create group offerings for a celebrity, such as asking Jennifer Lopez to perform at a local party. Still another example may be ensuring that requests for charity performances are actually delivered, or ensuring that donated moneys are funneled to the right charity personnel. Further implementations may process transactions like arranging events such as a meet and greet, having dinner with a celebrity for charity, sending a 280-character message of inspiration (or other message) to a celebrity, ordering a birthday voice mail message for one's mom from a favorite comedienne, purchasing digital souvenirs which include an authenticated seal such as a digital coin which lets others know a user has had a certain celebrity experience, purchasing a note or a tag from a celebrity for one's social media profile or site, participating in a call or lesson with a hero and commemorating it on a social media site, receiving a personalized video greeting from a celebrity, having a music lesson from a favorite celebrity, playing an online game with a celebrity, providing more niche or local offerings to local celebs such as local chefs or sports stars, having celebrities work on projects that are market-specific, generate reports and analytics for celebrities about certain markets, voting on a celebrity and their reputation via a ratings system, and participating in a virtual town hall meeting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Properly handling and processing information to achieve improved reputation management functionality relates to other facets of the system, according to some embodiments. Given that a celebrity's reputation is directly linked to his/her personal brand, reputation management tools are another resource that agents and public relations personnel may find useful. One of these tools may be the platform's ratings system, where fans/users may rate others that they have interacted with, as linked to a variety of online services. Indeed, such functionality provides a social incentive for behaving and delivering on promised goods and services. Systems herein may also be configured to preclude celebrities from interacting with a fan who has a poor online reputation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Another reputational element included in some implementations of the platform's functionality is turning the system into a game-like environment. Such systems may include game-like incentives such as points, medals, trophies, coins and progressive levels to reward users for engaging with the site and to keep fans/users returning to interact with those they want to, on the system platform. These incentives may also be displayed on a profile page so fans see which other fans are interacting with which celebrities and to garner a competitive urge to collect more incentives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Charitable giving may also be an aspect of the system platform, according to some embodiments. Many celebrities have charitable causes with which they are connected. The charities and the celebrities that support them are always looking for ways to increase awareness and donations. Here, implementations may be configured to allow fans/users to connect directly to their favorite star's charity in real time, or near real-time. Further, a suggestion engine may be utilized to promote offers to specific users, depending on their chosen interests. For example, a fan who loves Betty White, a noted animal activist, might receive a message from Ms. White asking for donations to her favorite shelter. In exchange the fan might receive a digital souvenir commemorating the gift such as a thank you email, from Betty White. The system platform may handle the payment exchange, and support new projects or charitable causes from Ms. White. Further, charitable opportunities may be directly submitted to celebrities or their representatives and digitally archived, so that celebrities can access this info at any given time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In another example, present celebrity auctions typically only reach a limited number of off-line fans. However, there may be many more people around the world who would bid on the item when given the opportunity consistent with the innovations herein, such as via the present network, web and/or online functionality. Thus, currently, such items rarely receive full market value bids. Charities may use such opportunity with implementations herein to become more visible regarding their auction items, to maximize the time and the attention of the celebrity supporter. This functionality is particularly helpful to smaller charities that do not have large brand names, but still want the support of celebrities to endorse their brand, and raise awareness and donations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Another problem for charitable organizations is that they can miss out on donated celebrity items in situations where the celebrity must donate 100% of the item/experience or nothing at all. Such limitation excludes celebrities and offerings where the celebrity would be willing to donate a material percentage of proceeds but still wants to make some money for their effort. Implementations herein are configured to provide customized relationships of this nature, and via these implementations: (1) celebrities are provided functionality to customize their opportunities, and (2) more charities receive more attention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Additionally, celebrities often want to start their own foundations, but need help with the administrative aspects of running a charity. This system may host an umbrella organization that oversees and administers the charity on behalf of a celebrity. For instance, someone might be able to donate to System.org/EvaLongoria Foundation. Here, then, the present implementations may be used to handle the financial transactions of such a non-profit project.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">This system may also be used as a vehicle for charities to fundraise and drive traffic. These can be rated in an online rating systems as well. In addition, any non-profits need a consistent cash flow because they may only have a few big fundraisers per year, thus making their cash flow uneven. Non-profits also need general funds for operations. Implementations herein may also be used as a source for funding general administrative and overhead costs, or similar aspects for which it is often difficult to raise money.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Additionally, charities face challenges regarding distribution. They may have an email list and regular supporters, but if they have a celebrity item to auction off on a visible site, they may be able to reach a much wider audience in order to maximize bidding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Systems and methods herein may also archive offers or fan-based ideas for celebrity performances or work, including a timeline. Implementations herein may be configured to utilized these to provide more niche offerings to local and regional fans/users. Also to offer market tools for agents and managers. Additionally, as discussed above, to enable charities to smooth out their funding year-round, and stay visible. Implementations may offer celebrities and their teams an interface such as a control panel enabling them to post offerings for sale, get alerts for tasks required to fulfill sales, respond to offers, and track the status of their listings. This system can add real-time scheduling, delivery and inventory to transactions for celebrities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustration of an example administrative graphical user interface consistent with one or more aspects related to the innovations herein. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a map of an illustrative Graphical User Interface (GUI) of exemplary vendor administration functionality is shown. In the illustrative GUI depicted, a ‘to-do’ button <b>302</b> may display what the vendor needs to do now. The ‘to-dos’ <b>302</b>/‘current to-dos’ <b>304</b> may be the first screen that shows up when the vendor logs in. In some implementations, only items that need to be done and can be done now show up on this screen. Items may be sorted by priority. Each item type has a custom UI that explains to the vendor the next steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">The GUI <b>300</b> may include a product management button <b>306</b>, a history/reports button <b>308</b> an account button <b>310</b>, and a calendar button <b>312</b>. A list of notifications may also be displayed, for example including display for the scheduled events happening now section <b>314</b>, the physical items that need fulfillment now <b>316</b>, Tweets/Facebook posts <b>318</b>, the scheduled experiences that need a time section <b>320</b>, the request a quote section <b>322</b>, and a messages section <b>324</b>. The GUI may also include a fulfillment section <b>330</b> and a marketing section <b>340</b>. The fulfillment section <b>330</b> may include physical items, events, Facebook, and Tweets sections. The marketing section <b>340</b> may include Tweets and Facebook sections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Some examples of the ways a celebrity may use the platform include allowing a direct conduit to a celebrity for any individual or entity, such as a fan or a movie studio or a partner that wants to provide them with work or a project, using virtual opportunities to connect with fans/users on social media, and/or enabling a celebrity to better manage their appointments and career opportunities. With this system, they are able to do as much or as little offered work as they like. They are also able to search for types of projects which may be offered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Additionally, celebrities may manage their own career remuneration without paying fees to a middleman. They are also safer in their personal interactions with fans/users, due to cloaking mechanisms. They may offer content directly to a celebrity's fan base, thereby bypassing middlemen and distribution channels and effecting a grass-roots sales effort. An example might be a band's pre-selling an album to dedicated listeners or fans. Celebrities may take digital control of tracking, publication, and distribution of anything to do with a celebrity's name or brand. They may publish celebrity content such as direct certain photos, post on update on a social media site, and share a positive movie review. Systems and methods are configured such that celebrities may steer multiple sites from one control panel and streamline the publicity process. Implementations may be configured to deliver a wish list to fans/users or thank you notes to those with whom they have interacted. Celebrities may be provided functionality enabling them to donate all or some of the proceeds of a certain concert to charity, and the giving process can be automated. Systems may also be configured to ensure that charity moneys, based on appearances, are delegated to the right personnel, thereby reducing risk of scandal and misappropriation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">As celebrities sometimes have resources at their disposal, this system can also feature anyone including lesser known celebrities, which can flatten out the industry's payment curve by enabling many celebrities to better find their sales niche. It may also allow fans/users through the middlemen gatekeepers. Systems and methods herein may initially leverage other people's content and then create their own content. They may also be configured to create and/or involve a pay-wall service within an already premium channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">This system may offer curated and targeted distribution for exclusive content, according to some embodiments, for example via the GUI. In some cases this system may offer its own publishing tools. In other cases it may enable celebrities to use existing publishing platforms and tools such as YouTube and Flickr with additional paywall features provided by this system. For instance, the celebrity publishes a video on YouTube but adjusts the videos setting so it is only viewable to paying members of their channel on the present platform. Systems and methods herein may be configured to do this by marking a celebrity video as private, and embed it behind a paywall, then automatically generate messages to fans/users, who will be enabled to pick their “social circle” of friends or other fans/users who can pay for this content.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">The scarcity of celebrity digital media content can makes it more valuable and exclusive thus helping maximizing the potential for more monetization opportunities. This system can provide the ability of certain limitations to a given celebrity's digital media content by either offering it for a limited time, or by limiting the number of people who can download or purchase it. Also as an example, a subscription to certain content can be limited to a fan/user's Facebook friends, a select ten of whom can be invited to purchase it—such content might be a video, a piece of music, an invitation to a meet-up online or special event or other forms of exclusive content.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The present content distribution functionality may enable content to be available world-wide over a wide area network such as the internet. To this effect, this system can create niche site areas for international celebrities, as well as U.S.-based ones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Systems and methods herein may leverage existing publishing platforms and can publish exclusive content. Fans/users can self-select for free on this system's publishing platforms, based on their personal “opt in” subscriptions. These include, but are not limited to, social networking sites such as FACEBOOK™, TWITTER™, TUMBLR™, WORDPRESS™, YOUTUBE™, PINTERES™, INSTAGRAM™, VIMEO™, and any other publishing platform and each will notify a fan when their chosen celebrity publishes something. The user/celebrities can select published content as “Private,” while they embed or Share their content with this system's platform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">Celebrities can aggregate their exclusive content and create bundles—for example, $19.95 for three celebrity videos, $29.95 for five. A free preview of the content can be included on the celebrity's pages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Systems and methods herein may also provide celebrities with social metrics, which will help them know and cultivate their fan bases, according to some embodiments. Implementations of this system also provide celebrities with tools to develop their brand and offer exclusive access to content whether it be for free or for a premium subscription model. As systems herein are well-suited for power fans, celebrities may be provided with functionality to involve their fans in obtaining input from them to help determine who will go on tour with them, or who should co-star in a movie with them, as in prizes or contests, for example. Further, systems may give power fans first access to celebrity live performance tickets, as a way to create a continually meaningful connection, and an important, continuous feedback loop for celebrities, according to some embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Many options may be utilized to connect with fans. Some of those options include social networking websites such as Facebook, for example. Systems and methods herein may be innovatively utilized with such social networking sites, e.g., by using the Facebook canvas as an iFrame by having a DRM player inside of an API component of the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0006" num="0000">Third Party Integration</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">The system platform may be configured as a stand-alone site, and/or it can also integrate with third party social network websites and mobile applications. These configurations allow establishment of user preferences, such as identifying a user's top celebrity idols or using the site's recommendation engine to maximize fan engagement. The recommendation engine may also integrate information from third parties and suggest items or donations that a fan is able to purchase or make from a celebrity wish list.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram depicting interactions among the elements of the systems consistent with one or more aspects related to the innovations herein. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing how the system may integrate with other platforms, including fulfillment and payment features. As shown, the fan or user may utilize a front end user facing interface provided by one or more third parties and/or this system itself. The product type checkout may occur either through this system or the third party system. The back end system may include the experience fulfillment components and a database to store the payment and fulfillment details.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">The system connection platform may be a stand-alone website, a Facebook app, or an interface to other third-party social media platforms. Other implementations may be applications such as an HTML 5 application, which would provide access to the platform for those who are not able to download, and have no access to the application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides a high level overview of some illustrative functionality and architecture of an exemplary system. Product information may be stored in a first database <b>400</b> configured to hold product information and control the front end. This data can be displayed in a variety of one or more front end components which can be controlled by the first database <b>400</b>. Exemplary front end components and their check out modules may be different websites <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, co-branded components/websites <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b>, and/or front end may include one or more mobile apps components <b>418</b>, <b>420</b>. Each front end can include a product selection UI, through which a user may view and/or select products <b>402</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>410</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>418</b>. Each front end can also display UI screens and fields to collect customer information specific to the many product types offered <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>416</b>, <b>420</b>. Order data along with fulfillment information can be received via the front end UI by the backend system <b>422</b> and can be stored in a second database <b>424</b> configured to manage order and fulfillment data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is another block diagram depicting further interactions among the elements of the systems consistent with one or more aspects related to the innovations herein. As with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first database <b>500</b> may contain product information and may provide the product information for processing and use by the front end components. Product selection UI front end components can display product information and receive product selections in <b>502</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>518</b>. Users can view, select, and choose to purchase products, and the front end can receive customer information related to a purchase in <b>504</b>, <b>508</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>520</b>. The second database <b>522</b> and backend system can receive the customer information via the front end and manage the order and fulfillment process, at <b>522</b>. Once an order is placed, it may be determined whether it is to be fulfilled internally, at <b>524</b>. If so, the order is handled by an internal fulfillment process powered by internal admin UI <b>526</b>. If not, the order is handled by celebrities/vendors who use the vendor admin UI, at <b>528</b>, which coordinates what things the vendor needs to do to fulfill customer orders and when they should be done. As with the customer front end screens which are customized based on the product type and other product information, the backend systems can process information differently as a function of the type of product being purchased. After fulfillment has been processed in <b>528</b> or <b>528</b>, the order is actually fulfilled in <b>530</b> (i.e., an order can be shipped or an experience may take place).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">System Processing and Navigation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow diagram showing how selection of product types and product type flags may drive the presentation of the user interface screens for ordering, selection, and payment, consistent with certain implementations herein. These selections can also control the back end functionality required for product fulfillment. The architecture allows new product types to be created without code changes. Many product types, including types that are new to ecommerce/software, are supported. Each product type has a unique set of fields and UI screens for a user to complete. Examples of product types may include the following types. A ‘Product Physical’ or ‘Normal Product’ is a normal physical product (such as a product which may be sold via conventional e-commerce systems). A ‘Facebook Post’ is a Facebook post from a celebrity or vendor which can be purchased. A ‘Twitter Follow’ is a Twitter follow from a celebrity/vendor which can be purchased. A ‘Twitter Shout Out’ is a Twitter shout out from a celebrity/vendor which can be purchased. A ‘Chat Video’ is an online video chat with a celebrity/vendor which can be purchased. A ‘Chat Phone Call’ is a phone chat with a celebrity/vendor which can be purchased. An ‘Event Physical’ is access to an event from a celebrity/vendor that takes place at a preset place and time which can be purchased. A ‘Subscription’ is subscription access to periodic content from a celebrity/vendor which can be purchased. A ‘Badge’ is a customized badge from a celebrity/vendor which can be purchased. An ‘Event Preannounce List’ is a special experience from a celebrity/vendor which can be purchased and may be selected from a list of events. For example, a meet-and-great with the celebrity/vendor at any one of the concerts in a musician's concert tour may be a product in this category. A ‘Message Video’ is a custom video message from a celebrity/vendor which can be purchased. A ‘Meeting Schedulable Digital’ is a digital meeting with the celebrity/vendor which can be purchased and which may have a time that is negotiated between the buyer and the celebrity/vendor. A ‘Meeting Schedulable Physical is a physical meeting with the celebrity/vendor which can be purchased and which may have a time that is negotiated between the buyer and the celebrity/vendor. A ‘Gift Certificate Digital’ is a gift certificate for a digital product or experience such as those described above, and a ‘Gift Certificate Physical’ is a gift certificate for a physical product or experience such as those described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">A product types table <b>600</b>, which has a record for each product type, may be included in the system. Implementations herein may utilize UI element features that present different UI fields and UI screens based on the product type of each product. Each product type in the table <b>600</b> includes product type flag data <b>602</b> which can be used to identify the product types within the system. Here, for example, various implementations and functionality may be achieved by performing processing as a function of data fields which represent the product type flags <b>602</b> in the data records/fields of the product types table <b>600</b>. Also, product type flag field definitions <b>604</b> may be provided to define certain characteristics of each product type. For example, product types may be defined as ‘isPhysical’ or ‘isExperience’, indicating whether the product is a physical product or an experience, respectively. Product types may be defined as having a ‘PresetTime’ or ‘TimeNegotiable’, indicating whether the product (e.g., an experience) has a set time or has a time that can be agreed upon between the buyer and the celebrity/vendor. Product types may be defined as ‘LocationNegotiable’, indicating whether the product (e.g., an experience) has a location that can be agreed upon between the buyer and the celebrity/vendor. Product types may also be defined as ‘ContactInfoNeeded’, ‘FacebookIdNeeded’, ‘TwitterHandleNeeded’, ‘RecipientNameNeeded’, and/or ‘CommentNeeded’, indicating whether certain information such as contact, Facebook, Twitter, name, or comment information is required from the buyer in order to complete the product transaction. One example involving a SQL realization of product types table functionality is set forth in Appendix A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">In addition, other customization functionality may be controlled by product flags <b>606</b> in the product types table <b>600</b> for each product. For example, an ‘isPersonalized’ flag may indicate that the product is personalized to the buyer. ‘BackgroundCheckRequired’ and/or ‘AgeVerificationRequired’ flags may indicate that additional information about the user (i.e., a background check or an age verification) is required to complete the product transaction. In addition, further customization functionality may be driven by the order flags fields <b>608</b>, which are fields specific to each individual purchase of a product. For example, an ‘isGift’ flag may indicate that the product was purchased by the buyer as a gift for another party. One example involving the flags in the product types table is set forth in Appendix B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">When a product types table <b>600</b> has been generated, including some or all of the data described above, it can be used in ordering celebrity products. For example, the product checkout screens described in the context of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> above can present a variety of UI screens to a user. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an optional UI screen A with variable fields is presented in <b>610</b>. This screen presents options for a user to select, such as the type of product to be purchased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Depending on which options are selected, the system can present another optional UI screen B in <b>612</b> or a required UI screen X in <b>614</b>. For example, screen B can present optional fields associated with the choice received via screen A. Once the fields in screen B have been entered, the system can proceed to the required UI screen X in <b>614</b>. Likewise, depending on what is received via screen X, the system can display optional UI screen C <b>616</b> or required UI screen Y <b>618</b>. After all required fields (and/or optional fields) have been displayed and data has been received, the order is placed in <b>620</b>. Note that this sequence is an example only, as other sequences of UI screens consistent with the innovations herein may be displayed to a user in the process of placing an order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> are exemplary flow diagrams of illustrative order placement and customer information processing functionality, respectively, consistent with one or more aspects related to the innovations herein. These diagrams provide an illustrative overview of how products with an experience product type may get processed by the back-end, after purchase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">While back-end systems and methods may behave similarly to conventional ecommerce back-ends when processing conventional products, implementations herein may possess various novel functionality involved with efficiently handle experience product types. With regard to making an experience happen, multiple people must be brought together in the same place at the same time. Multiple people are involved and difficult to schedule a time and place that works for all involved. Determining, coordinating and communicating all the details of the logistics required for an experience is too time-consuming and error-prone without solutions such as those provided via the systems and methods herein. Among other things, implementations herein enable fulfillment of many experience orders simultaneously, with various innovative processing, and without losing track of any details. Such implementations provide features and functionality that are essential to providing a good experience for the buyers and sellers involved, while accomplishing objectives at a low cost to provide better value to customers while still maintaining suitable/sensible profit margins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart depicting an example of order placement consistent with one or more aspects related to the innovations herein. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> provides one illustrative high level overview of a back-end fulfillment process for experiences. The illustrative backend processing of an order shown here begins when the order is successfully placed on the front end by a customer, at <b>702</b>. In some cases, a purchase is made as gift <b>704</b>, in which case purchaser is not buying the experience for themselves, but instead is giving it as a gift to another person. The recipient will receive a Gift Ticket in this case, at <b>706</b>. If the gift case, the customer may be charged immediately after the Gift Ticket is sent, at <b>710</b>, which is earlier in the fulfillment process than charging sometimes occurs in the non-gift case.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">As a next step in this illustrative fulfillment process, at <b>708</b>, one or more information gathering processes may be performed, e.g., to make sure all the necessary information has been gathered from the customer or the gift recipient, such as information to schedule the experience and/or do a background check if necessary. Exemplary details of what may occur during an illustrative information gathering process <b>708</b> are set forth in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. If this processing fails, the order may be canceled, at <b>714</b>. After a successfully completed background check and/or scheduling processes, at <b>712</b>, payment may be effected, e.g., the customer's credit card may be charged (settled) to collect the revenue for experiences. Here, the credit card may have been previously been authorized for the amount of the purchase, so unless the authorization had expired, the credit card charge/settle will succeed. If the original authorization has expired, and the credit card was not able to be authorized again, then the order may be cancelled <b>714</b> at this point due to the inability to collect payment. If the money was successfully collected, an event summary email may then be sent, at <b>716</b>, summarizing what will happen and when. If the experience is not a gift, an experience memento ticket may be sent to the buyer, at <b>718</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">After such optional processing is performed, final logistics such as final location logistics may be determined and entered into the system, at <b>720</b>. In some cases, for example, the experience may happen at a location selected by the customer or giftee. In other cases, it will happen at the location chosen by the luminary/vendor. In either case, the final logistics information will be entered into the system, so they can be communicated to the customer and/or the celebrity/vendor, as in steps <b>722</b>-<b>734</b>, via various email or other communication(s) such as the following.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">For example, implementations herein may send out up to two additional reminder emails, the first of which will be sent 1 week before the experience, at <b>726</b>. If there's greater than 1 week until the experience, the system may wait until there is just 1 week before the experience to send the reminder/logistics email, at <b>724</b>. Another reminder/logistics email may be sent closer in time, as well, such as 1 day before the experience, <b>728</b>, <b>730</b>, <b>732</b>, unless there isn't more than a day before the experience. Finally, the experience that the customer purchased occurs, <b>734</b>, and the presently described, illustrative experience fulfillment process is complete.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart depicting an example customer background check process consistent with one or more aspects related to the innovations herein. Systems and methods, here, may provide functionality that help monitor and maintain security for celebrities. Such celebrities may spend a great deal of money on physical security when they make personal appearances, but they cannot attend every event in person because not every event can be vetted. As such, these background/security implementations and tools provide personalized interaction with fans/users while maintaining a layer of security and privacy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Additionally, there is a need for a fan to verify that an online celebrity, or their piece of memorabilia, is authentic. Authentication of items signed by notable people affects the value of the item, as well as the reputation of all involved in its sale. Furthermore, there are some challenges to the process of purchasing and consuming celebrity-related content. Consumers have an expectation that they can purchase content on-demand, however region-locking and release window technologies often impede this process, even if consumers will buy content legally when available, but will resort to pirating if not legally available. There is a definite need for a trusted verification source, as well as a digital record of the transaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Other example uses for this system involve using Security APIs As a Component of the System, such as implementations that include video/audio fingerprinting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">Further, systems and methods herein may involve various features related to security, according to some embodiments. For example, implementations are configured to handle security problems in a multitude of ways, including watermarking, to ensure paywall integrity, and Digital Rights Management (DRM). Such security may be useful for celebrities to protect their online content and identities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Methods here may also involve verification of the various opportunities, according to some embodiments. Here, implementations may be configured with features to protect the reputation of the celebrity and/or the authenticity of the good, service or offering, things that celebrities are concerned about. Such system verification processes may ensure that opportunities for celebrities are legitimate, and backed by whom they assert they are backed. Functionality may also be provided to assure fans/users that the celebrity experience is authentic. Further, implementations may be configured with a ratings system for both fans/users and celebrities, to help provide measures of assurance for people on the platform, according to some embodiments. Such implementations may even incorporate information from other social media sites to make it more interactive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring to the illustrative processing shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, implementations here may first check to see if the products in this order require scheduling or a background check, at <b>802</b>. If not, processing may proceed through steps <b>822</b> and <b>838</b>, to the end <b>848</b>, after which the system continues at step <b>712</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">If scheduling or a background check is needed and hasn't already been accomplished, then processing may be performed to reach out to the customer to collect this information, at <b>804</b>. Such processing may result in the initiation of various communications, such as emails, phone calls, and/or other methods or functionality. Further illustrative processing may be performed, at <b>806</b>, if a response from the customer is not received within a certain time period, such as 7 days. Here, if the item ordered is a gift <b>808</b>, then implementations may follow up with an email to the giftee, at <b>810</b>, as well as with an email to the buyer, at <b>812</b>. Such communications are optional and serve as additional prompts to get the information needed to fulfill the experience item. Turning back to the illustrated processing, implementations may wait up to a set period, such as 7 days, for a response, at <b>814</b>. If no response is received, attempts to contact the customer and/or giftee may be escalated, at <b>816</b>. Such escalation may include functionality in the form performing processing to initiate phone calls or other communications by a customer service/concierge component or individual. Again, implementations may wait another set period such as 7 days, at <b>818</b>, and, if a response is still not received, additional processing may be performed. For example, implementation may wait another period of time, such as 1 year, for a non-gift order <b>844</b>/<b>842</b>, after which the order will be cancelled, at <b>840</b>. For a gifted order, implementations may wait almost indefinitely for a response, at <b>846</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">If at any point in the process, a response is received from the customer, then the various information needed from the customer may be collected, at <b>820</b>. If a background check is required, information is collected from the customer, or from the giftee in case of a gift. If scheduling is required, information is collected about the customer's or giftee's availability. Here, for example, implementations may be configured to collect at least 3 days and times that the customer is available. Once the needed information is collected from the customer, the system accesses information regarding subsequent processing to be performed, at <b>822</b>. For example, if scheduling is required <b>832</b>, processing may be performed to contact the luminary/vendor to see if any of the dates and times that the customer is available match up with the availability of the luminary/vendor, at <b>834</b>. Implementations may be configured such that the customer or giftee cannot just specify a time that they want the experience to happen, because the luminary/vendor must also be available for the experience to occur. If any of the times specified by the customer are acceptable to the luminary/vendor, then the agreed upon date and time is confirmed and processed by the system, at <b>836</b>. If the luminary/vendor is not available at any of the times specified by the customer, then implementations may perform processing to allow the luminary/vendor to enter several dates and times into the system as to when the luminary/vendor is available, at <b>836</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">If, at <b>824</b>, a background check is required, then the background check processing/processes may be started at <b>826</b>. The results of the background check, once complete, will get entered into the system for processing, at <b>828</b>. The system may then evaluate if scheduling/background check process had completed successfully, at <b>838</b>. If the celebrity/vendor had not agreed with the customer available dates, but had specified alternatives, then the scheduling problem is deemed fixable and the system loops back to contact the customer or giftee, this time communicating to the customer the alternative times that the vendor is available, as per step <b>802</b> and onward. It is possible that the customer and luminary/vendor cannot find a mutually agreeable time to schedule, in which case the order is canceled, at <b>840</b>. If the background check fails outright, the order may also be cancelled <b>840</b>. In some cases, a background check may end up in a marginal state, that needs further evaluation. In these cases, various processing may be performed as to how to proceed. In these marginal cases, processing might be performed to reach out to the customer again <b>838</b>, <b>802</b>, e.g. to gather additional information to help decide whether to accept or cancel the order. If all the checks pass successfully, the scheduling and background check processes are flagged as complete, at <b>848</b>, and the process proceeds from step <b>708</b>, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, to step <b>712</b>.</div>
