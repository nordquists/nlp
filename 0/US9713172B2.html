<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to a mobile terminal random access procedure for obtaining uplink time synchronization and access to a network and specifically to an apparatus and method that allows a mobile terminal to correctly map signature indexes onto cyclic shifted Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences when the deployed cells support a high-speed mobility by informing a mobile terminal whether a cell supports high-speed mobility.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) is a European-type, third generation IMT-2000 mobile communication system that has evolved from a European standard known as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). UMTS is intended to provide an improved mobile communication service based upon a GSM core network and wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) wireless connection technology. In December 1998, a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) was formed by the ETSI of Europe, the ARIB/TTC of Japan, the T1 of the United States, and the TTA of Korea. The 3GPP creates detailed specifications of UMTS technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to achieve rapid and efficient technical development of the UMTS, five technical specification groups (TSG) have been created within the 3GPP for standardizing the UMTS by considering the independent nature of the network elements and their operations. Each TSG develops, approves, and manages the standard specification within a related region. The radio access network (RAN) group (TSG-RAN) develops the standards for the functions, requirements, and interface of the UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), which is a new radio access network for supporting W-CDMA access technology in the UMTS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides an overview of a UMTS network. The UMTS network includes a mobile terminal or user equipment (UE) <b>1</b>, a UTRAN <b>2</b> and a core network (CN) <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The UTRAN <b>2</b> includes several radio network controllers (RNCs) <b>4</b> and NodeBs <b>5</b> that are connected via the I<sub>ub </sub>interface. Each RNC <b>4</b> controls several NodeBs <b>5</b>. Each NodeB <b>5</b> controls one or several cells, where a cell covers a given geographical area on a given frequency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Each RNC <b>4</b> is connected via the Iu interface to the CN <b>3</b> or towards the mobile switching center (MSC) <b>6</b> entity of the CN and the general packet radio service (GPRS) support Node (SGSN) <b>7</b> entity. RNCs <b>4</b> can be connected to other RNCs via the I<sub>ur </sub>interface. The RNC <b>4</b> handles the assignment and management of radio resources and operates as an access point with respect to the CN <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The NodeBs <b>5</b> receive information sent by the physical layer of the UE <b>1</b> via an uplink and transmit data to the UE <b>1</b> via a downlink. The Node-Bs <b>5</b> operate as access points of the UTRAN <b>2</b> for the UE <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The SGSN <b>7</b> is connected to the equipment identity register (EIR) <b>8</b> via the G<sub>f </sub>interface, to the MSC <b>6</b> via the G<sub>S </sub>interface, to the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) <b>9</b> via the G<sub>N </sub>interface, and to the home subscriber server (HSS) via the G<sub>R </sub>interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The EIR <b>8</b> hosts lists of UEs <b>1</b> that are allowed to be used on the network. The EIR <b>8</b> also hosts lists of UEs <b>1</b> that are not allowed to be used on the network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The MSC <b>6</b>, which controls the connection for circuit switched (CS) services, is connected towards the media gateway (MGW) <b>11</b> via the N<sub>B </sub>interface, towards the EIR <b>8</b> via the F interface, and towards the HSS <b>10</b> via the D interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The MGW <b>11</b> is connected towards the HSS <b>10</b> via the C interface and also to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The MGW <b>11</b> also allows the codecs to adapt between the PSTN and the connected RAN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The GGSN <b>9</b> is connected to the HSS <b>10</b> via the G<sub>C </sub>interface and to the Internet via the G<sub>I </sub>interface. The GGSN <b>9</b> is responsible for routing, charging and separation of data flows into different radio access bearers (RABs). The HSS <b>10</b> handles the subscription data of users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The UTRAN <b>2</b> constructs and maintains an RAB for communication between a UE <b>1</b> and the CN <b>3</b>. The CN <b>3</b> requests end-to-end quality of service (QoS) requirements from the RAB and the RAB supports the QoS requirements set by the CN <b>3</b>. Accordingly, the UTRAN <b>2</b> can satisfy the end-to-end QoS requirements by constructing and maintaining the RAB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The services provided to a specific UE <b>1</b> are roughly divided into CS services and packet switched (PS) services. For example, a general voice conversation service is a CS service and a Web browsing service via an Internet connection is classified as a PS service.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The RNCs <b>4</b> are connected to the MSC <b>6</b> of the CN <b>3</b> and the MSC is connected to the gateway MSC (GMSC) that manages the connection with other networks in order to support CS services. The RNCs <b>4</b> are connected to the SGSN <b>7</b> and the gateway GGSN <b>9</b> of the CN <b>3</b> to support PS services.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The SGSN <b>7</b> supports packet communications with the RNCs. The GGSN <b>9</b> manages the connection with other packet switched networks, such as the Internet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a structure of a radio interface protocol between a UE <b>1</b> and the UTRAN <b>2</b> according to the 3GPP radio access network standards. As illustrated In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the radio interface protocol has horizontal layers comprising a physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and has vertical planes comprising a user plane (U-plane) for transmitting user data and a control plane (C-plane) for transmitting control information. The U-plane is a region that handles traffic information with the user, such as voice or Internet protocol (IP) packets. The C-plane is a region that handles control information for an interface with a network as well as maintenance and management of a call. The protocol layers can be divided into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the three lower layers of an open system interconnection (OSI) standard model.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The first layer (L1), or physical layer, provides an information transfer service to an upper layer by using various radio transmission techniques. The physical layer is connected to an upper layer, or medium access control (MAC) layer, via a transport channel. The MAC layer and the physical layer exchange data via the transport channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The second layer (L2) includes a MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer, and a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer. The MAC layer handles mapping between logical channels and transport channels and provides allocation of the MAC parameters for allocation and re-allocation of radio resources. The MAC layer is connected to an upper layer, or the radio link control (RLC) layer, via a logical channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Various logical channels are provided according to the type of information transmitted. A control channel is generally used to transmit information of the C-plane and a traffic channel is used to transmit information of the U-plane. A logical channel may be a common channel or a dedicated channel depending on whether the logical channel is shared.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the different logical channels that exist. Logical channels include a dedicated traffic channel (DTCH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a common traffic channel (CTCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a broadcast control channel (BCCH), and a paging control channel (PCCH), or a Shared Control Channel (SCCH), as well as other channels. The BCCH provides information including information utilized by a UE <b>1</b> to access a system. The PCCH is used by the UTRAN <b>2</b> to access a UE <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Additional traffic and control channels are introduced in the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) standard for the purposes of MBMS. The MBMS point-to-multipoint control channel (MCCH) is used for transmission of MBMS control information. The MBMS point-to-multipoint traffic channel (MTCH) is used for transmitting MBMS service data. The MBMS scheduling channel (MSCH) is used to transmit scheduling information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport channels. The MAC layer can be divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC-c/sh sub-layer, a MAC-hs sub-layer and a MAC-m sublayer according to the type of transport channel being managed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The MAC-b sub-layer manages a broadcast channel (BCH), which is a transport channel handling the broadcasting of system information. The MAC-c/sh sub-layer manages a common transport channel, such as a forward access channel (FACH) or a downlink shared channel (DSCH), which is shared by a plurality of UEs <b>1</b>, or in the uplink the radio access channel (RACH). The MAC-m sublayer may handle MBMS data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from a UE <b>1</b> perspective. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from a UTRAN <b>2</b> perspective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The MAC-d sub-layer manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is a dedicated transport channel for a specific UE <b>1</b>. The MAC-d sublayer is located in a serving RNC <b>4</b> (SRNC) that manages a corresponding UE <b>1</b>. One MAC-d sublayer also exists in each UE <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The RLC layer supports reliable data transmissions and performs segmentation and concatenation on a plurality of RLC service data units (SDUs) delivered from an upper layer depending of the RLC mode of operation. The RLC layer adjusts the size of each RLC SDU received from the upper layer in an appropriate manner based upon processing capacity and then creates data units by adding header information. The data units, or protocol data units (PDUs), are transferred to the MAC layer via a logical channel. The RLC layer includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC SDUs and/or the RLC PDUs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The BMC layer schedules a cell broadcast (CB) message transferred from the CN <b>3</b>. The BMC layer broadcasts the CB message to UEs <b>1</b> positioned in a specific cell or cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The PDCP layer is located above the RLC layer. The PDCP layer is used to transmit network protocol data, such as the IPv4 or IPv6, efficiently on a radio interface with a relatively small bandwidth. The PDCP layer reduces unnecessary control information used in a wired network, a function called header compression, for this purpose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third layer (L3) is only defined in the C-plane. The RRC layer controls the transport channels and the physical channels in relation to setup, reconfiguration, and the release or cancellation of the radio bearers (RBs).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">A RB signifies a service provided by the second layer (L2) for data transmission between a UE <b>1</b> and the UTRAN <b>2</b>. The set up of the RB generally refers to the process of stipulating the characteristics of a protocol layer and a channel required for providing a specific data service and setting the respective detailed parameters and operation methods. The RRC also handles user mobility within the RAN and additional services, such as location services.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Not all different possibilities for the mapping between the RBs and the transport channels for a given UE <b>1</b> are available all the time. The UE <b>1</b>/UTRAN <b>2</b> deduce the possible mapping depending on the UE state and the procedure presently executed by the UE/UTRAN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The different transport channels are mapped onto different physical channels. The configuration of the physical channels is given by RRC signaling exchanged between the RNC <b>4</b> and the UE <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Initial access is a procedure whereby a UE <b>1</b> sends a first message to the UTRAN <b>2</b> using a common uplink channel, specifically the Random Access Channel (RACH). For both GSM and UMTS systems, the initial access procedure involves the UE <b>1</b> transmitting a connection request message that includes a reason for the request and receiving a response from the UTRAN <b>2</b> indicating the allocation of radio resources for the requested reason.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">There are several reasons, or establishment causes, for sending a connection request message. Table I indicates the establishment causes specified in UMTS, specifically in 3GPP TS 25.331.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The “originating call” establishment cause indicates that the UE <b>1</b> wants to setup a connection, for example, a speech connection. The “terminating call” establishment cause indicates that that UE <b>1</b> answers to paging. The “registration” establishment cause indicates that that the user wants to register only to the network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">A physical random access procedure is used to send information over the air. The physical random access transmission is under control of a higher layer protocol, which performs important functions related to priority and load control. This procedure differs between GSM and UMTS radio systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The description of GSM random access procedure can be found in “The GSM System for Mobile Communications” published by M. Mouly and M. B. Pautet, 1992. As the present invention is related to UMTS enhancement and evolution, the W-CDMA random access procedure is detailed herein. Although the present invention is explained in the context of UMTS evolution, the present invention is not so limited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The transport channel RACH and two physical channels, Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) and Acquisition Indication Channel (AICH), are utilized in this procedure. The transport channels are channels supplied by the physical layer to the protocol layer of the MAC layer. There are several types of transport channels to transmit data with different properties and transmission formats over the physical layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Physical channels are identified by code and frequency in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode and are generally based on a layer configuration of radio frames and timeslots. The form of radio frames and timeslots depends on the symbol rate of the physical channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">A radio frame is the minimum unit in the decoding process, consisting of 15 time slots. A time slot is the minimum unit in the Layer 1 bit sequence. Therefore, the number of bits that can be accommodated in one time slot depends on the physical channel.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The transport channel RACH is an uplink common channel used for transmitting control information and user data. The transport channel RACH is utilized in random access and used for low-rate data transmissions from a higher layer. The RACH is mapped to an uplink physical channel, specifically the PRACH. The AICH is a downlink common channel, which exists as a pair with PRACH used for random access control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The transmission of PRACH is based on a slotted ALOHA approach with fast acquisition indication. The UE randomly selects an access resource and transmits a RACH preamble part of a random access procedure to the network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">A preamble is a short signal that is sent before the transmission of the RACH connection request message. The UE <b>1</b> repeatedly transmits the preamble by increasing the transmission power each time the preamble is sent until it receives the Acquisition Indicator (AI) on AICH, which indicates the detection of the preamble by the UTRAN <b>2</b>. The UE <b>1</b> stops the transmission of the preamble once it receives the AI and sends the message part at the power level equal to the preamble transmission power at that point, adding an offset signaled by the UTRAN <b>2</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a power ramping procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">This random access procedure avoids a power ramping procedure for the entire message. A power ramping procedure would create more interference due to unsuccessfully sent messages and would be less efficient due to a larger delay since it would take much more time to decode the message before an acknowledgement could be transmitted to indicate successful receipt of the message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The main characteristics of the RACH is that it is a contention based channel subject to collisions due to simultaneous access of several users, which may preclude decoding of the initial access message by the network. The UE <b>1</b> can start the random access transmission of both preambles and message only at the beginning of an access slot. This access method is, therefore, a type of slotted ALOHA approach with fast acquisition indication</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The time axis of both the RACH and the AICH is divided into time intervals or access slots. There are 15 access slots per two frames, with each frame having a length of 10 ms or 38400 chips, and the access slots are spaced 1.33 ms or 5120 chips apart. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the number and spacing of access slots.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The UTRAN <b>2</b> signals information regarding which access slots are available for random access transmission and the timing offsets to use between RACH and AICH, between two successive preambles and between the last preamble and the message. For example, if the AICH transmission timing is 0 and 1, it is sent three and four access slots after the last preamble access slot transmitted, respectively. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the timing of the preamble, AI and message part</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The timing at which the UE <b>1</b> can send the preamble is divided by random access sub channels. A random access sub channel is a subset including the combination of all uplink access slots. There are 12 random access sub channels. A random access sub channel consists of the access slots indicated in Table II.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">The main purpose of the LTE (Long Term Evolution) random access procedure is to obtain uplink time synchronization and to obtain access to the network. A random access mechanism can be described where a preamble is sent from a UE<b>1</b> to a NodeB <b>5</b> in order to determine the timing misalignment. The preamble structure is based on Zadoff-Chu sequences with Zero Correlation Zone (ZC-ZCZ) and different root sequence indices when the required number of zones cannot be generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">The zero-correlation zone for the ZC-ZCZ sequence is generated using a cyclic shift version of the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) carrier sequence. Cyclic shifts within the same root sequence then form an ideal set of signatures for LTE RACH preambles since their cross-correlation is zero.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">However, this is true only if the frequency error is small and for UEs <b>1</b> with low mobility. The excellent properties of ZC-ZCZ sequences disappear as the frequency error increase for high-speed mobility UEs <b>1</b>, thereby inducing overlapping between shifted sequences and making the sequence detection poor and impossible in some cases. Therefore, the cyclic shift is designed to avoid overlapping with the next shifted position when high-speed mobility UEs <b>1</b> are supported within the cell, which results in the use of a restricted set of cyclic shifts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">In other words the preamble cyclic shift length design differs for cells supporting high-speed mobility UEs <b>1</b>. In fact, the cyclic shift depends not only on cell size but is also proportional to sequence index when there is high Doppler.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Therefore, the LTE RACH preamble sequence design is different for low and high mobility UEs <b>1</b>. Furthermore, the conventional procedure does not use Zadoff-Chu sequences with Zero Correlation Zone (ZC-ZCZ) sequences for the RACH preamble.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">For example, the WCDMA RACH preamble consists of 4096 chips, which is a sequence of 256 repetitions of Hadamard codes of length 16 and scrambling codes. This facilitates simple and accurate frequency error estimation then the same sequence design is used for both low and high speed UEs <b>1</b>.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">The present invention allows a UE <b>1</b> to correctly map the signature indexes onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences when the deployed cells support a high-speed mobility UE <b>1</b>. The present invention proposes to inform a UE <b>1</b> whether a cell supports high-speed mobility such that RACH signatures may be correctly mapped onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences. This information may either be broadcast on the system information in a cell or fixed in the standard. Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">The ZC sequences of odd length N are defined by the following equation:
<br/>
<i>au</i>(<i>k</i>)=exp[−<i>j</i>2π<i>M</i>(<i>k</i>(<i>k+</i>1)/2<i>N</i>)], where:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0156">N is a sequence length,</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0157">M=1 . . . N−1 is a root index of different sequences, and</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0158">k=0 . . . N−1 are indexes of the samples of a sequence.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0159">ZC sequences have ideal correlation properties in the absence of frequency error, such that the periodic autocorrelation shows no side-peaks and the cross-correlation between two sequences with different a root index M has a constant value when the index of the samples of a sequence N is a prime number. Therefore, cyclic shifts of a sequence form an ideal set of signatures for RACH preambles because their cross-correlation is zero and they can all be detected simultaneously using frequency domain processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0160">The number of cyclic shifts available for a single root index M depends on the length of the sequence and the propagation delay uncertainty: The shift must be larger than the maximum propagation delay for given cell sizes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0161">However, this is true only if the frequency error is small, such as for low-speed mobility UEs <b>1</b>. The ZC sequences are quite sensitive to the frequency error. The frequency error does not severely affect the cross-correlation between two ZC sequences but affects the detection of contiguous sequences due to overlapped channel response that cannot be discriminated from each other, an example of which is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The duration between the correct timing of the delay profile in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, such as t for M and 2t for M+1, and the alias of the delay profile, such as t-M and t+M, caused by large frequency offset in a high-speed mobility UE <b>1</b> is proportional to sequence index M.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0162">Performance is improved if cyclic shifts in high Doppler environments are limited so that the cyclic shift pairs of each sequence period uncertainty are not in the sequence period uncertainty of any RACH preamble and the cyclic shift of t−1 of each sequence period uncertainty is different from the cyclic shifts of t+1 of all sequences period uncertainty. This results in using a restricted set of cyclic shifts for cells supporting high-speed mobility UEs <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0163">The cyclic shift design may be done such that the alias channel response is not overlapped with the other circular shift positions since the frequency offset in a high-speed mobility UE <b>1</b> is proportional to sequence index M. Rules and methods of such design are known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0164">The cyclic shift design is different depending upon whether a cell supports high-speed mobility UEs <b>1</b>. The basic random access procedure is for a UE <b>1</b> to send a random access preamble (message 1), which carries the signature access to Node B <b>5</b>. However, the access signature is only sent to meet coverage requirement for non-synchronized random access within the LTE framework.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0165">The waveform of the LTE signature is based on Zadoff-Chu (ZC) with zero-correlation zones (ZCZ) and different mother sequence indexes when the required number of zones cannot be generated. This is because the number of ZCZ sequences is reduced inversely proportionally to cell radius. Therefore, additional ZCZ sequences from another index are added when the number of ZCZ sequences insufficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0166">The zero-correlation zones allow for ideal detection in the presence of interfering preambles. The optimal auto-correlation property of the CAZAC sequence is destroyed when the Doppler spread of a high-speed mobility UE <b>1</b> induces the frequency offset, thereby resulting in degraded detection performance. Doppler shift and frequency error on the uplink have properties depending on the channel condition, for example, line-of-site (LOS) condition or Non-line-of-site (NLOS) condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0167">Frequency offset due to UE <b>1</b> mobility is spread over a range from the carrier frequency In NLOS. Therefore, a UE <b>1</b> tracks around the Δf<sub>BS</sub>+Δf<sub>UE </sub>frequency offset. The frequency offset of the received uplink signal is nearly zero and one way Doppler spread can be considered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0168">The maximum frequency offset of the receiver signal In LOS, such as when a high-speed mobility vehicle moves towards or away from the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) <b>2</b>, is described as:
<br/>
<i>f</i> <sub>offset,UL</sub> <i>=Δf</i> <sub>UE</sub>+2<i>f</i> <sub>Doppler</sub> <sub>_</sub> <sub>max</sub>, where
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0169">f<sub>BS </sub>denotes the base station frequency drift,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0170">Δf<sub>UE </sub>denotes UE <b>1</b> frequency error and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0171">f<sub>Doppler</sub> <sub>_</sub> <sub>max </sub>denotes the maximum Doppler frequency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0172">The worst-case frequency offset is around 1400 Hz with mobility of 350 km/h at a 2 GHz carrier frequency. A UE <b>1</b> tracks around 650 Hz Doppler shift on the downlink in the LOS environment and then transmits uplink data compensated frequency offset in advance based on the estimated frequency offset on the downlink. Therefore, the frequency offset due to UE <b>1</b> mobility becomes twice of the Doppler shift of the channel at the NodeB <b>2</b>, for example, 1300 Hz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0173">There may be two or three dominant components at the detection stage if there is frequency offset at the receiver due to Doppler spread or residual frequency offset, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Therefore, the frequency offset spreads the channel response over a wide range depending on the sequence index M that is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0174">It is possible to predict where the channel response will occur if frequency offset exists when the ZC sequence index is known. The circular shift should be designed such that the alias channel response is not overlapped with the other circular shift positions. Therefore, the cyclic shift is depends not only on the cell size but also is proportional to the sequence index M, which results in the restricted set of cyclic shifts as compared to the low Doppler case and also in different RACH signature mapping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0175">The methods and approaches regarding how to design the cyclic shifts when a cell supports high-speed mobility are known in the art. For example, rules for three different approaches are proposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0176">The first approach is an “additional margin method” where:
<br/>
1≦<i>M&lt;</i>2<i>T</i> <sub>0 </sub>and <i>N−</i>2<i>T</i> <sub>0</sub> <i>&lt;M&lt;N−</i>1
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0177">The second approach is a “multiple circular shifts as one opportunity method” where:
<br/>
2<i>T</i> <sub>0</sub> <i>≦M&lt;└N/</i>3┘ and <i>N−└N/</i>3┘&lt;<i>M≦N−</i>2<i>T</i> <sub>0 </sub>
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0178">The third approach is an “index selection method” where:
<br/>
└<i>N/</i>3┘≦<i>M≦└</i>2<i>N/</i>3┘
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0179">In all three approaches, N is a sequence length or ZC sequence length, M is one sequence index or a ZC root index, and T<sub>0 </sub>is the minimum cyclic shift for a given cell based on cell size. The necessary information, such as N, can be fixed in a standard while other information, such as T<sub>0 </sub>and M, should be broadcast on the system information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0180">The present invention proposes that the network broadcast one information bit to inform a UE <b>1</b> if high-speed mobility UEs is supported. This information bit would enable correct mapping of RACH signatures onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences. A UE <b>1</b> reads the information bit indicating support of high-speed mobility in a cell or indicating the use of a restricted set of cyclic shifts upon receiving a broadcast message relative to RACH information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0181">Information related to T<sub>0 </sub>and M shall have already obtained by a UE <b>1</b> from information broadcast by the E-UTRAN <b>2</b> before processing the information bit. The UE <b>1</b> shall have also already obtained information related to N and the maximum number of RACH signatures from the broadcast information if those values are not fixed by a standard. The UE <b>1</b> then determines whether the information bit indicates that high-speed mobility is supported.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0182">Mapping of RACH signatures onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences can be easily performed for each cell when high-speed mobility is not supported, as indicated by the information bit having a value of “FALSE” or “0.” A UE <b>1</b> and E-UTRAN <b>2</b> can map RACH signatures onto the ZC sequences of index M, with RACH signatures incrementally mapped onto subsequent cyclic-shifted versions by T<sub>0 </sub>of the same ZC sequence until all possible cyclic shifts have been mapped for a given index M. New consecutive indexes M are added until the total number of signatures equals a value specified in the standard or system information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0183">The E-UTRAN <b>2</b> may broadcast only one index M, with the UE <b>1</b> using consecutive indexes to generate the number of required preambles. An alternative is for the E-UTRAN <b>2</b> to broadcast a set of several indexes M not necessarily consecutive to each other, with the UE <b>1</b> using the first index within the set and then using consecutive indexes within the set and mapping signatures in the same manner by starting from a higher or lower sequence index.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0184">Specifically, the UE <b>1</b> starts mapping RACH signatures onto the cyclic shifted ZC sequences by mapping onto the first ZC sequence of the received index M or on the first index M in a received list. The UE <b>1</b> then incrementally maps the next subsequent signatures onto subsequent right-cyclic-shifted versions by the minimum cyclic shift length T<sub>0 </sub>of the same ZC sequence index M until the maximum number of RACH signatures is reached or all possible cyclic shifts of index M have been obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0185">The UE <b>1</b> maps the next signature onto the next ZC sequence index M+1 or the next index in the list if the maximum number of RACH signatures is not reached before all possible cyclic shifts of index M are used. The UE <b>1</b> then maps the next subsequent signatures onto its subsequent right-cyclic-shifted versions by the minimum cyclic shift length T<sub>0</sub>. This signature mapping is repeated over all ZC sequence indexes and stops when the maximum number of RACH signatures is reached.</div>
