<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, ultra high density storage devices have been proposed using a three-dimensional (3D) stacked memory stack structure sometimes referred to as a Bit Cost Scalable (BiCS) architecture. For example, a 3D NAND stacked memory device can be formed from an array of alternating conductive and dielectric layers. A memory opening is formed through the layers to define many memory layers simultaneously. A NAND string is then formed by filling the memory opening with appropriate materials. A straight NAND string extends in one memory opening, while a pipe- or U-shaped NAND string (p-BiCS) includes a pair of vertical columns of memory cells. Control gates of the memory cells may be provided by the conductive layers.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">As discussed above, the present disclosure is directed to three-dimensional non-volatile memory devices, such as vertical NAND strings and other three-dimensional devices, and methods of making the same, the various aspects of which are described below. The embodiments of the disclosure can be employed to form various semiconductor devices such as three-dimensional monolithic memory array devices comprising a plurality of NAND memory strings. The drawings are not drawn to scale. Multiple instances of an element may be duplicated where a single instance of the element is illustrated, unless absence of duplication of elements is expressly described or clearly indicated otherwise. Ordinals such as “first,” “second,” and “third” are employed merely to identify similar elements, and different ordinals may be employed across the specification and the claims of the instant disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">A monolithic three dimensional memory array is one in which multiple memory levels are formed above a single substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer, with no intervening substrates. The term “monolithic” means that layers of each level of the array are directly deposited on the layers of each underlying level of the array. In contrast, two dimensional arrays may be formed separately and then packaged together to form a non-monolithic memory device. For example, non-monolithic stacked memories have been constructed by forming memory levels on separate substrates and vertically stacking the memory levels, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,915,167 titled “Three Dimensional Structure Memory.” The substrates may be thinned or removed from the memory levels before bonding, but as the memory levels are initially formed over separate substrates, such memories are not true monolithic three dimensional memory arrays. The substrate may include integrated circuits fabricated thereon, such as driver circuits for a memory device</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The various three dimensional memory devices of the present disclosure include a monolithic three-dimensional NAND string memory device, and can be fabricated employing the various embodiments described herein. The monolithic three dimensional NAND string is located in a monolithic, three dimensional array of NAND strings located over the substrate. At least one memory cell in the first device level of the three dimensional array of NAND strings is located over another memory cell in the second device level of the three dimensional array of NAND strings.</div>

A source region <b>12</b> can be formed in a region of the substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b> that is laterally offset from the memory stack structures <b>55</b>. Alternatively, a source region can be formed directly underneath memory stack structures <b>55</b> of memory cells, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/317,274, filed on Jun. 27, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference.

The gate stack <b>205</b> can include any type of gate stack known in the art. For example, each gate stack <b>205</b> can include, from one side to another, a gate dielectric, a gate electrode, and an optional gate cap dielectric. Optionally, a planarization dielectric layer <b>170</b> including a dielectric material may be employed in the peripheral device region <b>200</b> to facilitate planarization of the portion of material stacks to be subsequently formed on the substrate <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">A stack of alternating layers of a first material and a second material different from the first material is formed over a top surface of the substrate <b>8</b>.

Alternatively, the first material can be an insulator material that forms insulating layers <b>32</b>, and the second material can be a sacrificial material that is deposited as sacrificial layers, and is at least partly replaced with a conductive material to form various conductive line structures after formation of memory stack structures <b>55</b>. In one embodiment, the alternating stack can include insulating layers <b>32</b> and material layers, which may comprise a sacrificial material that is subsequently replaced with a conductive material that forms control gate electrodes, or may comprise a conductive material that is patterned into control gate electrodes of a memory device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The memory stack structures <b>55</b> can be formed through the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>46</b>) of the insulating layers <b>32</b> and the electrically conductive layers <b>46</b> employing the various methods of the present disclosure to be described below. A drain region <b>63</b> can be formed on top of each semiconductor channel <b>60</b>.

A retro-stepped dielectric fill portion <b>65</b> may be optionally employed over the stepped surfaces. As used herein, a retro-stepped structure refers to a structure in which the horizontal vertical cross-sectional area changes stepwise with a vertical distance from a top surface of a substrate such that a vertical cross-sectional area of the structure at a lower horizontal plane is included in vertical cross-sectional areas of the structure at an overlying horizontal plane.</div>

If the material layers between vertically neighboring pairs of insulating layers <b>32</b> are sacrificial material layers <b>42</b>, the sacrificial material layers <b>42</b> can be removed by introducing an etchant through the contact via trench. The etchant removes the material of the sacrificial material layers <b>42</b> selective to the material of the insulating layers <b>32</b> to form backside recesses. Electrically conductive layers <b>46</b> can be formed by depositing at least one conducive material in the backside recesses. The electrically conductive layers <b>46</b> include control gate electrodes for the memory stack structures <b>55</b>. The electrically conductive layers <b>46</b> can form terraced (stepped) structures within the contact region <b>300</b> in order to facilitate formation of contact via structures <b>66</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">The contact via structures <b>66</b> can be formed by forming via cavities that extend to the stepped surfaces of the electrically conductive layers <b>46</b>, and by filling each via cavity with an optional dielectric liner <b>64</b> and a contact via structure <b>66</b>. The dielectric liner <b>64</b>, if present, may enhance electrical isolation of the contact via structures <b>66</b>. A hard mask layer <b>36</b> may be optionally employed to facilitate formation of the contact via structures <b>66</b>. Peripheral contact via structures <b>86</b> can be formed in the peripheral device region <b>200</b>. A backside contact via structure <b>76</b> can be formed through the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>46</b>) to provide electrical contact to the source region <b>12</b>. A dielectric spacer <b>74</b> can be employed to provide electrical isolation for the backside contact via structure <b>76</b>.

The insulating layers <b>32</b> can comprise insulator layers that provide the functionality of electrical insulation, and the sacrificial material layers <b>42</b> can comprise sacrificial layers that are subsequently removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">The first material can be at least one electrically insulating material.

For example, the second material can be doped polysilicon, tungsten, tungsten nitride, tantalum, tantalum nitride, titanium, titanium nitride, cobalt, copper, aluminum, an alloy thereof, or a combination thereof. Alternatively, the sacrificial material layers <b>42</b> may comprise sacrificial layers, such as silicon nitride or polysilicon sacrificial layers. In this case, at least one, and/or each, of the sacrificial material layers <b>42</b> can be a sacrificial material layer. In an illustrative example, the sacrificial material layers <b>42</b> can be silicon nitride layers that can be subsequently removed, for example, by a wet etch employing phosphoric acid.</div>

The high electric field erase saturation condition under negative bias causes the electrons to be emitted from the corners of the control gate electrodes into the adjacent separator structures <b>45</b> during the GIDL erase step at the same time as the holes are drawn into the charge storage element <b>54</b> from the channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">The charge carriers, such as electrons, may be permanently stored in any portion of the separator structures <b>45</b>. For example, for separator structures <b>45</b> containing only a silicon oxide fill, the electrons may be stored in the silicon oxide fill. For separator structures that contain a charge trapping dielectric, such as silicon nitride or oxynitride liners <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B or core <b>142</b>, the charge may be stored in these charge trapping dielectric liners or core. In one embodiment, the first dielectric liners <b>14</b>A and the second dielectric liners <b>14</b>B can include a charge trapping material (such as silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride), and the electrons can be trapped within the first dielectric liners <b>14</b>A and the second dielectric liners <b>14</b>B. In another embodiment, the dielectric fill material portions <b>142</b> can include a charge trapping material (such as silicon nitride or oxynitride), and the electrons can be trapped within the dielectric fill material portions <b>142</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">The negative voltage applied to the selected control gate electrodes (e.g., selected electrically conductive layers (<b>146</b> or <b>461</b>, <b>462</b>, <b>463</b>)) can be in a range from negative 2 V to negative 20 V, such as negative 3V to negative 7V, although lesser and greater magnitudes can also be employed. If desired, the negative voltage may be pulsed during the erase operation. For example, the negative voltage may be pulsed with a step wise increase (i.e., each subsequent pulse or set of pulses may be more negative than the prior pulse or set of pulses). During the erase operation, the unselected control gates and/or other nodes of the device may be grounded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">Optionally, the set of the semiconductor layers <b>146</b> of the third, fourth and fifth embodiments may be replaced with a different set of electrically conductive layers having a higher conductivity (such as electrically conductive layers including metallic materials such as TiN, TaN, WN, W, Cu, Al, Co, Ru, or combinations thereof). In this case, a backside contact trench can be employed to remove the doped or undoped semiconductor material of the semiconductor layers <b>146</b> selective to the insulator layers <b>32</b> and to form backside recesses. The backside recesses can be filled with at least one metallic material to form electrically conductive layers having a greater conductivity than the semiconductor layers <b>146</b> of the third or fourth embodiment. In case metallic materials <b>46</b> are used, then the blocking dielectric is formed by dielectric layer deposition rather than by oxidation of semiconductor layers <b>146</b>. Furthermore, rather than using discreet floating gates as the charge storage regions/memory structures, a continuous charge trapping dielectric layer (e.g., silicon nitride layer) may be used as the charge storage regions/memory structures in each device level, as described with respect to the second embodiment above. In this case, the tunneling dielectric may be formed by deposition of a tunneling dielectric layer(s) rather than oxidation of silicon floating gates. Furthermore, the recesses <b>49</b>A may be omitted in this case.</div>
