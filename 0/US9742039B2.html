<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/064,820 filed Mar. 9, 2016, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/687,848 filed Mar. 19, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 9,350,050 issued May 24, 2016, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference to the extent permitted by law. The present invention contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Application JP 2006-095608 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Mar. 30, 2006, the entire contents of which being incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a battery including a positive electrode, a negative electrode, an electrolyte, and a negative electrode current collector, at least part of which is formed as a rough surface, and also relates to a current collector and a negative electrode forming the battery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">With progress in science and technology such as semiconductor technology, personal computers (PCs), mobile phones, and the like have been developed, and batteries utilized as power supply for electronic apparatus have been expected to facilitate handling of the batteries such as reduction in size and weight, and to exhibit excellent electric properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of such expectations, the following types of lithium-ion secondary batteries have been developed and have widely been used: a lithium-ion secondary battery having a graphite material that uses an intercalation reaction of lithium (Li) between graphite layers, or a lithium-ion secondary battery utilizing a carbonaceous material as a negative electrode active material to which lithium insertion and extraction into pores are applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, as increasing in power and time consumed for the electronic apparatus due to higher performance of the electronic apparatus, an increase in capacity and power generation of a secondary battery have been desired, and especially in capacity, property improvement has much been desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">A battery including a negative electrode active material layer formed of a carbon material such as graphite may be difficult to greatly improve properties because a battery capacity of the negative electrode active material is about to reach the theoretical limit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Increasing a thickness of an active material layer may improve battery capacity; however, if such thick electrode is formed of a smooth current collector typically used in the related art, peeling (detaching} strength decreases to deteriorate cycle characteristics of the battery. Further, if an amount of a binder is increased so as to control to lower peeling strength, load characteristic of the battery is lowered, thereby adversely affecting the cycle characteristics of the battery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-7305 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-95474 disclose a method of fabricating a battery using a thin plate-form current collector that includes rough surfaces of both principal planes to control to lower peeling strength. Such a current collector having rough surfaces may improve peel strength without extremely increasing amount of the binder as described above. However, if such a current collector includes rough surfaces for lowering peeling strength, the current collector may become susceptible to crack or fracture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">While, a negative electrode active material containing silicon (Si), tin (Sn), metal lithium (Li), and the like has been examined. Since such a negative electrode active material can be inserted much lithium (Li) as compared a case with a carbon material, capacity of the battery may greatly be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">However, since the negative electrode active material containing silicon (Si) and tin (Sn) drastically changes its volume when charging and discharging the battery, the inner pressure increases to impose loads upon members located around the negative electrode active material. Further, in an electrode having an alloyed interface between a current collector and an active material layer, both the current collector and the active material layer may be cracked or fractured, resulting in lowering the battery capacity.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an embodiment of the present invention, since a current collector includes a first principal plane and a second principal plane having mutually different roughness between the first principal plane and the second principal plane, occurrence of crack or fracture on the electrode may be controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, according to an embodiment of the present invention, since a negative electrode formed of a current collector includes a first principal plane and a second principal plane having mutually different roughness between the first principal plane and the second principal plane, occurrence of crack or fracture on the electrode may be controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an embodiment of the present invention, since a battery includes a first principal plane and a second principal plane of the negative current collectors having mutually different roughness between the first principal plane and the second principal plane, higher capacity of the battery may be obtained by forming the battery using the negative electrode active material that drastically changes its volume while controlling occurrence of crack or fracture on the electrode.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a battery <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention includes an electrode winding body <b>3</b> located around a center <b>4</b> inside a prismatic battery can <b>2</b>, an upper surface of which is opened and enclosed with a battery lid <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The battery can <b>2</b> is formed of a nickel-plated iron, and the electrode winding body <b>3</b> includes mutually faced wound positive and negative electrodes <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> through a pair of wound separators <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> containing electrolytes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The battery lid <b>5</b> is attached to the battery can <b>2</b> by caulking through gaskets and the like. Specifically, the inside of the battery can <b>1</b> is air-tightly enclosed with the battery can <b>2</b> and the battery <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> schematically shows a cross-sectional structure of a winding surface of the winding body according to an embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The electrode winding body <b>3</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention includes strip-shaped (thin plate-shaped) positive and negative electrodes <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> that are mutually faced through separators <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> containing electrolytes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be noted that, although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> schematically shows that the electrode winding body <b>3</b> forming a rectangular winding, the electrode winding body <b>3</b> has a cross-sectional shape having a curved portion (non-bent curved portion) such as an elliptic form inside the long and narrow battery can <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">A positive electrode lead wire (not shown) formed of aluminum (Al) and the like, and a negative electrode lead wire (not shown) made of nickel (Ni) and the like are respectively connected to the positive and negative electrodes <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> of the electrode winding body <b>3</b>. The positive lead wire is welded to a safety valve mechanism <b>6</b> to electrically connect to the battery lid <b>5</b>. The negative electrode lead wire is directly</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, in the positive electrode <b>9</b> including a positive electrode current collector <b>11</b> with a first principal plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>corresponding to the inner surface and a second principal plane corresponding to the outer surface of the winding structure, an internal positive electrode active material layer <b>12</b> is formed on the side of the first principal plane <b>11</b> <i>a </i>and an external positive electrode active material layer <b>13</b> is formed on the side of the second principal plane <b>11</b> <i>b</i>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Both the internal positive electrode active material layer <b>12</b> and the external positive electrode active material layer <b>13</b> may not necessarily be included. It is preferable that the internal positive electrode active material layer <b>12</b> and the external positive electrode active material layer <b>13</b> be selectively provided according to a desired configuration or desired properties of an objective battery. The positive electrode current collector <b>11</b> may be formed of aluminum, nickel, stainless steel, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The internal positive electrode active material layer <b>12</b> and the external positive electrode active material layer <b>13</b> contain any one of or two or more of positive electrode materials that can insert and extract lithium ions as a positive electrode active material and may optionally contain a conductive material such as a carbon material and a binder such as poly(vinylidene fluoride). As examples of the lithium transition metal composite oxide, a compound shown by a general formula LixMO2 may preferably given. Since a lithium-containing metal composite oxide may generate a high voltage and a high energy density; higher capacity for the secondary battery may be realized. For example, M preferably represents at least one type of transition metal elements selected from the group consisting of cobalt, nickel, and manganese (Mn). The subscript x represents the value that may vary with charging and discharging state of the battery and may fall in the range of 0.5≦x≦1.10. The specific examples of lithium transition metal composite oxide may include LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>or LiNiO<sub>2</sub>. Notice that the positive electrode active material may be used alone or a combination of two or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, in the negative electrode <b>10</b> including a negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> with an first principal plane <b>14</b> <i>a </i>corresponding to the inner surface and a second principal plane corresponding to the outer surface of the winding structure, an internal negative electrode active material layer <b>15</b> is formed on the side of the first principal plane <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and an external negative electrode active material layer <b>16</b> is formed on the side of the second principal plane <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Both the internal negative electrode active material layer <b>15</b> and the external negative electrode active material layer <b>16</b> may not necessarily be included. It is preferable that the internal negative electrode active material layer <b>15</b> and the external negative electrode active material layer <b>16</b> be selectively provided according to a desired thickness or desired materials suitable for surface roughness of the negative current collector <b>14</b> as will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">It should be noted that the negative electrode current collector and the negative electrode <b>10</b> are used as the first embodiment of the current collector and the negative electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> may be preferably formed of copper (Cu), stainless steel, nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo) or aluminum (Al). Of these, the metal elements that may easily be alloyed with the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are preferable. For example, when the inner and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> contain at least one type of the individual elements or compounds selected from the group consisting of silicon (Si) and tin (Sn), copper (Cu), titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al) or nickel (Ni) may be given as materials that can easily be alloyed. It should be noted that the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> may include a single layer or a plurality of layers. In that case, layers that contact with the inner and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> may be formed of metal materials that can easily be alloyed with the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> and other layers may be formed of other metal materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In the battery <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention, if roughness (Ra value) of the first and second principal planes <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b </i>of the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> forming the negative electrode <b>10</b> are mutually different, a battery, though having the current collector <b>14</b> at least part of which includes rough surface, may include the negative electrode <b>10</b> that are not susceptible to crack or fracture, even when forming a thicker active material layer. Here, the Ra value represents parameters of surface roughness according to the JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) standard and implies an arithmetic mean surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">If the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> differentiates in the surface roughness between the first and second principal planes <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, occurrence of crack or fracture on the electrode may be controlled when the negative electrode active material layer is formed on both surfaces of the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, or when the negative electrode active material layer is formed only on one surface. However, when the negative electrode active material layer is formed only on one surface, a higher-performance battery may particularly be obtained. It should be noted that if the active material layer is formed only on one principal plane of the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b>, and only the surface where the active material layer is formed includes rough surface, excellent characteristics may be obtained; and when the active material layer is formed on both principal planes, and both of the principal planes include rough surfaces having different degrees of roughness, excellent characteristics may particularly be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In the surface roughness of the current collector, the roughness Ra of the principal plane having higher roughness may preferably be equal to or greater than 0.2 μm. Accordingly, adhesion may be increased. However, when an extreme roughing treatment is applied, if roughness of both surfaces of the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> is decreased to include mutually different degrees of roughness, the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> is susceptible to crack or fracture. Therefore, the value Ra of the principal plane having higher roughness may preferably be equal to or less than 3.0 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be noted that the optimum value of the roughness Ra and the range thereof are affected by the thickness of the current collector. For example, if a current collector having a thickness of about 5 to 20 μm available at present is unused but instead a thicker current collector is used, drastic roughness may be suppressed to result in less crack or fracture. Therefore, it is preferable that the optimum value of the roughness Ra and the range thereof be carefully selected based on the relationship. However, a battery having an extremely thick current collector may not increase capacity of the battery due to an increase in the volume of the current collector portion. Therefore, in the battery <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention, as the current collector with which cycle characteristics can be maintained and crack or fracture can be prevented, the current collector having a thickness of about 5 to 30 μm and having the above described range of the Ra value (roughness) may be preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, it is preferable that difference in roughness between both surfaces of the first and second principal planes <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b </i>may be equal to or greater than 0.05 μm base on the Ra value. In contrast, although one principal plane includes a desired value in roughness, if roughness of the other surface may have approximately the same roughness of one principal plane, improvements of characteristics will be limited to certain degrees as will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, as will be described later, the battery according to an embodiment of the present invention can achieve an excellent effect particularly when both of the positive electrode <b>9</b> and the negative electrode <b>10</b> includes the active material layers that have a thickness greater than 70 μm for the thickness of either one of the current collectors. The electrode having such a thick active material layer may exhibit a decrease in peel strength and may apply large stress to an interface that does not support an entire surface of the current collector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, the electrode becomes susceptible to crack or fracture when charging and discharging the battery. It should be noted that the thickness of the active material layer may be defined as one obtained at full discharge where the remaining battery capacity in the apparatus using the battery reaches zero. That is, this case is different from a case where a battery voltage is set to zero by attaching a fixed resistor to a power supply terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In the battery according to an embodiment of the present invention, if roughness of the first and second principal planes <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b </i>of the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> are mutually different, crack or fracture of the electrode, though including a particularly thick active material layer, may be lowered or prevented while maintaining adhesion to the interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The internal and external negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> may contain at least one kind of individual elements or compounds selected from the group consisting of metal elements or semimetal elements which can be alloyed with lithium (Li) as a negative electrode active material due to obtaining high energy density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Examples of such metal elements or semimetal elements include palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), aluminum (Al), indium (In), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb) or bismuth (Bi). As examples of these compounds, compounds shown by the chemical formula Mas, Mbt may be given. In the chemical formula, Ma represents at least one kind of metal elements and semimetal elements which can be alloyed with lithium (Li) and Mb represents at least one kind of elements other than Ma. The value s indicates s&gt;0 and the value t indicates t≧0, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Of these metal elements and semimetal elements, individual elements such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn) or lead (Pb), or compounds including the individual elements may be preferable, with individual elements of the silicon (Si) or tin (Sn), or compounds formed of the individual elements of the silicon (Si) or tin (Sn). Thus, the individual element and the compound of silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) have large ability to insert and extract lithium (Li), and may increase energy density of the negative electrode <b>10</b> depending on a combination thereof. It should be noted that the compound of silicon (Si) and tin (Sn) may be crystal or amorphous; however, amorphous or an aggregate of microcrystallite may be preferable. The amorphous or microcrystallite may include a broad pattern that has half the width of a peak in a diffraction pattern obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis using CuKα as characteristic X-rays is 0.5° or more at 2θ and ranges of from 30° to 60° at 2θ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Examples of the compound of silicon (Si) and tin (Sn), include SiB<sub>4</sub>, SiB<sub>6</sub>, Mg<sub>2</sub>Si, Mg<sub>2</sub>Sn, Ni<sub>2</sub>Si, TiSi<sub>2</sub>, MoSi<sub>2</sub>, CoSi<sub>2</sub>, NiSi2, CaSi<sub>2</sub>, CrSi<sub>2</sub>, Cu<sub>5</sub>Si, FeSi<sub>2</sub>, MnSi<sub>2</sub>, NbSi<sub>2</sub>, TaSi<sub>2</sub>, VSi<sub>2</sub>, WSi<sub>2</sub>, ZnSi<sub>2</sub>, SiC, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, Si<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O, SiOv (0&lt;v≦2), SnOw (0&lt;w≦2), SnSiO<sub>3</sub>, LiSiO or LiSnO.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Some of high capacity active materials that can form the first and second negative electrode active material layer <b>15</b> and of the negative electrode <b>10</b> may drastically change the volume when the battery is charged and discharged as described earlier. In particular, if the high capacity active material contains silicon (Si) or tin (Sn), when the active material layer is thin, the volume may change drastically to peel off the layer from the interface of the current collector and to apply stress to the entire inside of the battery when the battery is charged and discharged, thereby further causing the electrode to be either cracked or fractured. In the battery according to the embodiment of the present invention, when the individual element or compound of silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) is used as the negative electrode active material to obtain high energy density, since the negative electrode can control crack or fracture, thereby forming a large capacity battery without the above-mentioned issues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The first and second negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> may be preferably formed by at least one method selected from the group consisting of a vapor-phase method, a liquid-phase method and a sintering method. Specifically, the battery may be prevented from being destroyed as the internal and external negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are expanded and contracted when the battery is charged and discharged and the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> and the first and second negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> can be integrated to improve electron conductivity in the internal and external negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>. The binder and gaps may be decreased or eliminated so that the negative electrode <b>30</b> may be reduced in thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">It should be noted that the baking method includes mixing powder containing active material and the binder to mold a layer, and the resultant layer is heat-treated in the non-oxidizing atmosphere to form a denser layer than the layer before the heat treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The first and second negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> may be preferably formed by at least one method selected from the group consisting of a vapor-phase method, a liquid-phase method and a sintering method. The internal and external negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> may preferably be alloyed with the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> at least on a part of the interface between the internal and external negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b>. Specifically, at the interface, elements of the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> should preferably be diffused into the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> or elements of the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> should preferably be diffused into the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> or those elements should preferably be diffused to each other. Although it is frequently observed that the alloying may take place simultaneously when the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are formed by the vapor-phase method, the liquid-phase method or the sintering method, the alloying may take place due to a further heat treatment. It should be noted that the above-mentioned diffusion of elements may be included in alloying in the application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">It should be noted that the first and second negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> may be formed by coating, specifically, negative electrode active materials and powder may optionally be bonded with a binder such as vinylidene polyfluoride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">In this case, powder of silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) compound may preferably have a primary particle diameter selected in a range of from 0.1 μm to 35 μm and more preferably the above primary particle diameter may be selected in a range of from 0.1 μm to 25 μm. If the particle diameter is smaller than this range, an undesired reaction occurs remarkably between the particle surface and an electrolytic solution, thereby deteriorating capacity or efficiency of the electrodes. If, on the other hand, the particle diameter is larger than this range, a reaction between it and lithium (Li) may not proceed within the particle, thereby decreasing the capacity of the electrodes. It should be noted that as a particle size measuring method, an observation method based on an optical microscope or electron microscope or laser diffraction method may be given, and it is preferable that the above observation method or the above laser diffraction method may be selectively used in response to the particle size region. It is also preferable that classification may be carried out to obtain a desired particle size. A classification method is not particularly limited, and a sieve or a wind power classifier may be used in a dry method or a wet method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be noted that powder of the individual element or compound of silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) can be manufactured by a related-art method used in a powder metallurgy and the like.

In particular, it is preferable that the gas atomizing method or the mechanical alloying method may be used.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">A current collector, a negative electrode and a battery according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In this embodiment, a so-called element winding type cylindrical battery shown in a partly cutaway perspective view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a battery <b>21</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention includes a cylindrical battery can <b>22</b> with its upper surface opened in which a electrode winding body <b>23</b> is located at a center pin <b>24</b> (not shown) and which is sealed by a battery lid <b>25</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The battery lid <b>25</b> includes a safety valve mechanism <b>38</b> together with a heat sensitive resistance element (positive temperature coefficient which will hereinafter be simply referred to as a “PTC element”) <b>39</b> incorporated therein, and it is attached to the battery can <b>22</b> when caulked through gaskets (not shown) and the like. That is, the inside of the battery <b>21</b> is hermetically closed by the battery can <b>22</b> and the battery lid <b>25</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">The safety valve mechanism <b>38</b> is electrically connected to the battery lid <b>25</b> through the PTC element <b>39</b>. When an internal pressure of the battery <b>21</b> is increased to be higher than a constant value by inside short-circuiting or with application of heat from the outside, a built-in disk plate, for example, is caused to invert to disconnect electric connection between the battery lid <b>25</b> and the electrode winding body <b>23</b>. The PTC element <b>39</b> may prevent abnormally-intensive heat from being generated due to a large electric current by limiting an electric current increased by the increase of resistance when a temperature rises.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> schematically shows a cross-sectional structure of the winding surface of the electrode winding body <b>23</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In this embodiment, the electrode winding body <b>23</b> has an arrangement in which the strip-like (thin plate-like) positive electrode and negative electrodes <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> are located in an opposing fashion through the separators <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> containing electrolyte, these positive and negative electrodes <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> being wound around the electrode winding body <b>23</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">A positive lead wire made of aluminum (Al), for example, and a negative lead wire made of nickel (Ni) and the like (not shown) are respectively connected to the positive electrode <b>29</b> and the negative electrode <b>30</b> of the electrode winding body <b>23</b>. A positive lead wire is welded to the safety valve mechanism <b>38</b> and thereby electrically connected to the battery lid <b>25</b>, and the negative lead wire is directly welded to the battery can <b>22</b> and thereby electrically connected thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Here, the positive electrode <b>29</b> includes a positive electrode current collector <b>31</b> including a first principal plane <b>31</b> <i>a </i>used as an inner surface in the winding structure and a second principal plane <b>31</b> <i>b </i>used as an outer surface wherein a first positive electrode active material layer <b>32</b> is formed on the side of the first principal plane <b>31</b> <i>a </i>and a second positive electrode active material layer <b>33</b> is formed on the side of the second principal plane <b>31</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Both of the first and second positive electrode active material layers <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> need not always be provided and they should preferably be selected and configured in response to target battery arrangement and characteristics. The positive electrode current collector <b>31</b> may be made of aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni) or stainless steel, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Also, the first and second positive electrode active material layers <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> may contain a positive electrode active material and they may contain a conductivity assisting agent such as a carbonaceous material and a binder such as poly(vinylidene) fluoride if necessary. Lithium containing metal composite oxide expressed by a general formula Li<sub>x</sub>MO<sub>2</sub>, for example, should preferably be used as the positive electrode active material because the lithium containing metal composite oxide is able to generate a high voltage and it is high in density so that it can make the secondary battery become higher in capacity. It should be noted that M is more than one kind of transition metal and it should be at least one kind selected from a group consisting of cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and manganese (Mn). The x may differ depending on the battery charging and discharging states and it is a value generally selected in a range of 0.05≦x≦1.10. LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>or LiNiO<sub>2 </sub>may be enumerated as specific examples of such lithium containing metal composite oxide. It should be noted that the positive electrode active material may use any one kind of lithium containing metal composite oxide and that it may mix more than two kinds of lithium containing metal composite oxides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">On the other hand, the negative electrode <b>30</b> includes a negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> having a first principal plane <b>34</b> <i>a </i>used as an inner surface in the winding structure and a second principal plane <b>34</b> <i>b </i>used as an outer surface and in which a first negative electrode active material layer <b>35</b> is formed on the side of the first principal plane <b>34</b> <i>a </i>and a second negative electrode active material layer <b>36</b> is formed on the side of the second principal plane <b>34</b> <i>b</i>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">It should be noted that both of the first and second negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> need not always be provided as will be described later on. Thicknesses and materials thereof should preferably be selected in response to roughness of the surface of the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> which will be described later on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">It should be noted that the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> and the negative electrode <b>30</b> may be used as the current collector and the negative electrode according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In the battery <b>31</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention, if roughness (Ra value) of the first and second principal planes <b>34</b> <i>a </i>and <b>34</b> <i>b </i>of the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> forming the negative electrode <b>30</b> are mutually different, a battery, though having the current collector <b>34</b> at least part of which includes rough surface, may include the negative electrode <b>30</b> that are not susceptible to crack or fracture, even when forming a thicker active material layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Here, the Ra value represents parameters of surface roughness according to the JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) standard and implies an arithmetic mean surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">If the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> differentiates in the surface roughness between the first and second principal planes <b>34</b> <i>a </i>and <b>34</b> <i>b</i>, occurrence of crack or fracture on the electrode may be controlled when the negative electrode active material layer is formed on both surfaces of the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>, or when the negative electrode active material layer is formed only on one surface. However, when the negative electrode active material layer is formed only on one surface, a higher-performance battery may particularly be obtained. It should be noted that if the active material layer is formed only on one principal plane of the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b>, and only the surface where the active material layer is formed includes rough surface, excellent characteristics may be obtained; and when the active material layer is formed on both principal planes, and both of the principal planes include rough surfaces having different degrees of roughness, excellent characteristics may particularly be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">In the surface roughness of the current collector, the roughness Ra of the principal plane having higher roughness may preferably be equal to or greater than 0.2 μm. Accordingly, adhesion may be increased. However, when an extreme roughing treatment is applied, if roughness of both surfaces of the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> is decreased to include mutually different degrees of roughness, the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> is susceptible to crack or fracture. Therefore, the value Ra of the principal plane having higher roughness may preferably be equal to or less than 3.0 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">It should be noted that the optimum value of the roughness Ra and the range thereof are affected by the thickness of the current collector. For example, if a current collector having a thickness of about 5 to 20 μm available at present is unused but instead a thicker current collector is used, drastic roughness may be suppressed to result in less crack or fracture. Therefore, it is preferable that the optimum value of the roughness Ra and the range thereof be carefully selected based on the relationship. However, a battery having an extremely thick current collector may not increase capacity of the battery due to an increase in the volume of the current collector portion. Therefore, in the battery <b>21</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention, as the current collector with which cycle characteristics can be maintained and crack or fracture can be prevented, the current collector having a thickness of about 5 to 30 μm and having the above described range of the Ra value (roughness) may be preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, it is preferable that difference in roughness between both surfaces of the first and second principal planes <b>34</b> <i>a </i>and <b>34</b> <i>b </i>may be equal to or greater than 0.05 μm base on the Ra value. In contrast, although one principal plane includes a desired value in roughness, if roughness of the other surface may have approximately the same roughness of one principal plane, improvements of characteristics will be limited to certain degrees as will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Further, as will be described later, the battery according to an embodiment of the present invention can achieve an excellent effect particularly when both of the positive electrode <b>29</b> and the negative electrode <b>30</b> includes the active material layers that have a thickness greater than 70 μm for the thickness of either one of the current collectors. The electrode having such a thick active material layer may exhibit a decrease in peel strength and may apply large stress to an interface that does not support an entire surface of the current collector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Accordingly, the electrode becomes susceptible to crack or fracture when charging and discharging the battery. It should be noted that the thickness of the active material layer may be defined as one obtained at full discharge where the remaining battery capacity in the apparatus using the battery reaches zero. That is, this case is different from a case where a battery voltage is set to zero by attaching a fixed resistor to a power supply terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">In the battery according to an embodiment of the present invention, if roughness of the first and second principal planes <b>34</b> <i>a </i>and <b>34</b> <i>b </i>of the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> are mutually different, crack or fracture of the electrode, though including a particularly thick active material layer, may be lowered or prevented while maintaining adhesion to the interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">The negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> should be preferably made of copper (Cu), stainless steel, nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo) or aluminum (Al). Of these metal elements, the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> should preferably be made of metals which can easily be alloyed with the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>. For example, when the inner and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> contain at least one kind selected from a group consisting of individual elements or compounds of silicon (Si) and tin (Sn) as will be described later on, copper (Cu), titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al) or nickel (Ni) may be enumerated as materials that can be alloyed easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">It should be noted that the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> may be composed of either a single layer or a plurality of layers. In that case, layers that contact with the inner and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> may be made of metal materials that can be alloyed with the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> and other layers may be made of other metal materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">The inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> may contain at least one kind selected from a group consisting of individual elements and compounds of metal elements or semimetal elements which can be alloyed with lithium metal and lithium (Li) as a negative electrode active material because they can generate high energy density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">As such metal elements or semimetal elements, there can be enumerated palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), aluminum (Al), indium (In), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb) or bismuth (Bi). Compounds expressed by a chemical formula Ma<sub>s</sub>Mb<sub>t</sub>, for example, may be enumerated as these compounds mentioned above. In this chemical formula, Ma expresses at least one kind of metal elements and semimetal elements which can be alloyed with lithium (Li) and Mb expresses at least one kind of other elements than Ma. The values of s and t are given by inequalities of s&gt;0 and t≧0, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Of these metal elements and semimetal elements, individual elements or compounds of silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn) or lead (Pb) should be preferable and particularly-preferable metal elements and semimetal elements are individual elements of the silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) or compounds thereof. The reason for this is that the individual element and the compound of silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) have large ability to insert and extract lithium (Li) and that they are able to increase energy density of the negative electrode <b>30</b> depending on a combination thereof. It should be noted that the compound of silicon (Si) and tin (Sn) may be either crystal or amorphous and that it should preferably be a polymer of amorphous or microcrystal. The amorphous or microcrystal may have a pattern in which a half width of a peak of a diffraction pattern obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis using CuKα as characteristic X-rays is higher than 0.5° at 2θ and it may also have a broad pattern in which a half width ranges of from 30° to 60° at 2θ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">As the compound of silicon (Si) and tin (Sn), there may be enumerated SiB<sub>4</sub>, SiB<sub>6</sub>, Mg<sub>2</sub>Si, Mg<sub>2</sub>Sn, Ni<sub>2</sub>Si, TiSi<sub>2</sub>, MoSi<sub>2</sub>, CoSi<sub>2</sub>, NiSi<sub>2</sub>, CaSi<sub>2</sub>, CrSi<sub>2</sub>, Cu<sub>5</sub>Si, FeSi<sub>2</sub>, MnSi<sub>2</sub>, NbSi<sub>2</sub>, TaSi<sub>2</sub>, VSi<sub>2</sub>, WSi<sub>2</sub>, ZnSi<sub>2</sub>, SiC, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, Si<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O, SiO<sub>v </sub>(0&lt;v≦2), SnO<sub>w </sub>(0&lt;w≦2), SnSiO<sub>3</sub>, LiSiO or LiSnO, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">Some of high capacity active materials that can construct the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layer <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> of the negative electrode <b>30</b> may be caused to change its volume vehemently when the battery is charged and discharged as mentioned before. In particular, if the high capacity active material contains silicon (Si) or tin (Sn), then even when the active material layer is thin, its volume may change considerably to release the layer from the interface of the current collector and to apply stress to the whole of the inside of the battery when the battery is charged and discharged, which further causes the electrode to be either cracked or split. According to the arrangement of the battery according to the embodiment of the present invention, similarly to the first embodiment, when the individual element or compound of silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) is used as the negative electrode active material in order to obtain high energy density, since it is possible to suppress the negative electrode from being either cracked or split, it becomes possible to construct a large-capacity battery in which the problems can be avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">The inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> should be preferably formed by at least one method selected from a group consisting of a vapor-phase method, a liquid-phase method and a sintering method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Specifically, the reason for this is that this arrangement can suppress the battery from being destroyed as the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> are expanded and contracted when the battery is charged and discharged and that the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> and the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> can be integrated to improve electronic conductivity in the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>. Also, the binder and gaps can be decreased or removed so that the negative electrode <b>30</b> can be reduced in thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">The inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> should preferably be alloyed with the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> at least on a part of the interface between them and the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b>. Specifically, at the interface, constitutive elements of the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> should preferably be diffused into the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> or constitutive elements of the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> should preferably be diffused into the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> or those constitutive elements should preferably be diffused to each other. Although it is frequently observed that this alloying may take place simultaneously when the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> are formed by the vapor-phase method, the liquid-phase method or the sintering method, the alloying may take place due to a further heat treatment. It should be noted that the above-mentioned diffusion of elements may be included in alloying in the application of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">It should be noted that the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> may be formed by coating, to be concrete, negative electrode active materials and powders may be bonded by a binder such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyimide, polyamideimide and poly(vinylidene) fluoride, if necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In this case, it is preferable that powder of silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) compound should preferably have a primary particle size selected in a range of from 0.1 μm to 35 μm and it is more preferable that the above primary particle size should be selected in a range of from 0.1 μm to 25 μm. If the particle size is smaller than this range, then an undesired reaction between the particle surface and an electrolytic solution, which will be described later on, becomes remarkable and there is then a risk that capacity or efficiency will be deteriorated. If on the other hand the particle size is larger than this range, then a reaction between it and lithium (Li) becomes difficult to proceed within the particle and there is then a risk that the capacity will be lowered. It should be noted that an observation method based on an optical microscope or electron microscope or laser diffraction method may be enumerated as a particle size measuring method and it is preferable that the above observation method or the above laser diffraction method should be selectively used in response to the particle size region. Also, it is preferable that classification should be carried out in order to obtain a desired particle size. A classification method is not limited in particular, and a sieve or a wind power classifier can be used in a dry method or a wet method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">It should be noted that powder of the individual element or compound of silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) can be manufactured by a related-art method used in a powder metallurgy and the like. As the related-art method, there may be enumerated a method in which a raw material is melted by a melting furnace such as an arc remelting furnace and a high-frequency induced heating furnace, cooled and ground, a method of quenching a melted metal of a raw material such as a single roll quenching method, a twin-roll quenching method, a gas atomizing method, a water atomizing method or a centrifugal atomizing method and a method in which a melted metal of a raw material is solidified by a cooling method such as a single roll quenching method and a twin-roll quenching method and ground by a suitable method such as a mechanical alloying method. In particular, it is preferable that the gas atomizing method or the mechanical alloying method should be used. It should be noted that these synthesis and grinding should preferably be carried out in the inert gas atmosphere such as argon (Ar) gas, nitrogen (N) gas or helium (H) gas or in the vacuum atmosphere in order to prevent metals from being oxidized by oxygen (O) in the air.</div>

It should be noted that M is more than one kind of transition metal and it may be at least one kind selected from a group consisting of cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and manganese (Mn). The subscript x may differ depending on the charging and discharging state of the battery and it may be selected so as to satisfy a condition indicated by 0.5≦x≦1.10.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">On the other hand, the negative electrode <b>50</b> includes the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> having a first principal plane <b>54</b> <i>a </i>used as an inner surface in the winding structure and a second principal plane <b>54</b> <i>b </i>used as an outer surface in which an inner surface positive electrode active material layer <b>55</b> is formed on the side of the first principal plane <b>54</b> and an outer surface positive electrode active material layer <b>56</b> is formed on the side of the second principal plane <b>54</b> <i>b</i>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">It should be noted that, as will be described later on, both of the inner and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> need not always be provided. Their thicknesses and materials should preferably be selected in response to roughness of the surface of the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> which will be described later on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">It should be noted that the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> and the negative electrode <b>50</b> are used as the third embodiment of the current collector and the negative electrode according to an embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> should be preferably made of copper (Cu), stainless steel, nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo) or aluminum (Al). Of these metal elements, the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> should preferably be made of metals which can easily be alloyed with the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>. For example, when the inner and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> contain at least one kind selected from a group consisting of individual elements or compounds of silicon (Si) and tin (Sn) as will be described later on, copper (Cu), titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al) or nickel (Ni) may be enumerated as materials that can be alloyed easily. It should be noted that the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> may be composed of either a single layer or a plurality of layers. In that case, layers that contact with the inner and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> may be made of metal materials that can be alloyed with the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> and other layers may be made of other metal materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">In the battery <b>41</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention, if roughness (Ra value) of the first and second principal planes <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b </i>of the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> forming the negative electrode <b>50</b> are mutually different, a battery, though having the current collector <b>34</b> at least part of which includes rough surface, may include the negative electrode <b>50</b> that are not susceptible to crack or fracture, even when forming a thicker active material layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Here, the Ra value represents parameters of surface roughness according to the JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) standard and implies an arithmetic mean surface roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">If the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> differentiates in the surface roughness between the first and second principal planes <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b</i>, occurrence of crack or fracture on the electrode may be controlled when the negative electrode active material layer is formed on both surfaces of the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>, or when the negative electrode active material layer is formed only on one surface. However, when the negative electrode active material layer is formed only on one surface, a higher-performance battery may particularly be obtained. It should be noted that if the active material layer is formed only on one principal plane of the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b>, and only the surface where the active material layer is formed includes rough surface, excellent characteristics may be obtained; and when the active material layer is formed on both principal planes, and both of the principal planes include rough surfaces having different degrees of roughness, excellent characteristics may particularly be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">In the surface roughness of the current collector, the roughness Ra of the principal plane having higher roughness may preferably be equal to or greater than 0.2 μm. Accordingly, adhesion may be increased. However, when an extreme roughing treatment is applied, if roughness of both surfaces of the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> is decreased to include mutually different degrees of roughness, the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> is susceptible to crack or fracture. Therefore, the value Ra of the principal plane having higher roughness may preferably be equal to or less than 3.0 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">It should be noted that the optimum value of the roughness Ra and the range thereof are affected by the thickness of the current collector. For example, if a current collector having a thickness of about 5 to 20 μm available at present is unused but instead a thicker current collector is used, drastic roughness may be suppressed to result in less crack or fracture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Therefore, it is preferable that the optimum value of the roughness Ra and the range thereof be carefully selected based on the relationship. However, a battery having an extremely thick current collector may not increase capacity of the battery due to an increase in the volume of the current collector portion. Therefore, in the battery <b>41</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention, as the current collector with which cycle characteristics can be maintained and crack or fracture can be prevented, the current collector having a thickness of about 5 to 30 μm and having the above described range of the Ra value (roughness) may be preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, it is preferable that difference in roughness between both surfaces of the first and second principal planes <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b </i>may be equal to or greater than 0.05 μm base on the Ra value. In contrast, although one principal plane includes a desired value in roughness, if roughness of the other surface may have approximately the same roughness of one principal plane, improvements of characteristics will be limited to certain degrees as will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Further, as will be described later, the battery according to an embodiment of the present invention can achieve an excellent effect particularly when both of the positive electrode <b>49</b> and the negative electrode <b>50</b> includes the active material layers that have a thickness greater than 70 μm for the thickness of either one of the current collectors. The electrode having such a thick active material layer may exhibit a decrease in peel strength and may apply large stress to an interface that does not support an entire surface of the current collector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Accordingly, the electrode becomes susceptible to crack or fracture when charging and discharging the battery. It should be noted that the thickness of the active material layer may be defined as one obtained at full discharge where the remaining battery capacity in the apparatus using the battery reaches zero. That is, this case is different from a case where a battery voltage is set to zero by attaching a fixed resistor to a power supply terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">In the battery according to an embodiment of the present invention, if roughness of the first and second principal planes <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b </i>of the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> are mutually different, crack or fracture of the electrode, though including a particularly thick active material layer, may be lowered or prevented while maintaining adhesion to the interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">The internal and external negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>66</b> may contain at least one kind of individual elements or compounds selected from the group consisting of metal elements or semimetal elements which can be alloyed with lithium (Li) as a negative electrode active material due to obtaining high energy density.</div>

As examples of these compounds, compounds shown by the chemical formula Mas, Mbt may be given. In the chemical formula, Ma represents at least one kind of metal elements and semimetal elements which can be alloyed with lithium (Li) and Mb represents at least one kind of elements other than Ma.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Of these metal elements and semimetal elements, individual elements such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn) or lead (Pb), or compounds including the individual elements may be preferable, with individual elements of the silicon (Si) or tin (Sn), or compounds formed of the individual elements of the silicon (Si) or tin (Sn). Thus, the individual element and the compound of silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) have large ability to insert and extract lithium (Li), and may increase energy density of the negative electrode <b>10</b> depending on a combination thereof. It should be noted that the compound of silicon (Si) and tin (Sn) may be crystal or amorphous; however, amorphous or an aggregate of microcrystallite may be preferable. The amorphous or microcrystallite may include a broad pattern that has half the width of a peak in a diffraction pattern obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis using CuKα as characteristic X-rays is 0.5° or more at 2θ and ranges of from 30° to 60° at 2θ.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Some of high capacity active materials that can form the first and second negative electrode active material layer <b>55</b> and of the negative electrode <b>50</b> may drastically change the volume when the battery is charged and discharged as described earlier. In particular, if the high capacity active material contains silicon (Si) or tin (Sn), when the active material layer is thin, the volume may change drastically to peel off the layer from the interface of the current collector and to apply stress to the entire inside of the battery when the battery is charged and discharged, thereby further causing the electrode to be either cracked or fractured. In the battery according to the embodiment of the present invention, when the individual element or compound of silicon (Si) or tin (Sn) is used as the negative electrode active material to obtain high energy density, since the negative electrode can control crack or fracture, thereby forming a large capacity battery without the above-mentioned issues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">The first and second negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> may be preferably formed by at least one method selected from the group consisting of a vapor-phase method, a liquid-phase method and a sintering method. Specifically, the battery may be prevented from being destroyed as the internal and external negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> are expanded and contracted when the battery is charged and discharged and the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> and the first and second negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> can be integrated to improve electron conductivity in the internal and external negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Also, the inner surface and outer surface negative electrode active material layers <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> should preferably be alloyed with the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> at least on a part of the interface between them and the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">First, the positive electrode <b>9</b> was formed. Specifically, a positive electrode mixture was prepared by mixing 91 wt % of LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.19</sub>Al<sub>0.01</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>having an average secondary particle size of 15 μm, 6 wt % of graphite used as a conductive assisting agent and 3 wt % of polyvinylidene fluoride used as a binder.

Subsequently, this positive electrode mixture slurry was coated on the aluminum positive electrode current collector <b>11</b> having a thickness of 20 μm, dried and compression-molded by a roller press machine and thereby the inner surface positive electrode active material layer <b>12</b> and the outer surface positive electrode active material layer <b>13</b> are formed, resulting in the positive electrode <b>9</b> being obtained.</div>

With respect to the first principal plane <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and the second principal plane <b>14</b> <i>b </i>having predetermined different surface roughness, a mixture of natural graphite with a particle size of 25 μm and PVdF at a mixing ratio of 95:5 (wt %) was dispersed into NMP. After the negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> was formed by coating the resultant mixture on the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b>, they were dried and pressed and thereby the negative electrode <b>10</b> was obtained. It should be noted that the thickness of the active material layers was obtained when the thickness of the negative electrode in the completely discharged state was measured in actual practice. The thickness obtained immediately after the electrode was manufactured (from film deposition to press-molding) becomes a little smaller value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">It should be noted that, when the cross section of the negative electrode <b>10</b> was sliced by a focused ion beam (FIB: Focused Ion Beam) in order to observe the interface between the negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> and the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> and analyzed by AES (Auger electron spectroscopy), it was confirmed that the negative electrode active material layers <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> and the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> were alloyed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">After the positive electrode <b>9</b> and the negative electrode <b>10</b> were manufactured, a positive lead wire with an insulating tape attached thereto was connected to one end of the positive electrode current collector <b>11</b> of the positive electrode <b>9</b>, the positive electrode <b>9</b> and the negative electrode <b>10</b> were laminated through the 30 μm-thick separators <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> made of micro-porous polyethylene film, wound and thereby the electrode winding body <b>3</b> with a shortest diameter S of 17.37 mm and a longest diameter L of 17.45 mm was manufactured. After the electrode winding body <b>3</b> was formed, both end portions perpendicular to the winding surface of the electrode winding body <b>3</b> were sandwiched by a pair of insulating plates, the positive electrode lead wire was welded to the safety valve mechanism <b>6</b>, the negative electrode lead wire (not shown) was welded to the bottom portion of the battery can <b>2</b> and the electrode winding body <b>3</b> was housed within the battery can <b>2</b> made of iron.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">Thereafter, an electrolytic solution was injected into the inside of the battery can <b>2</b>. As the electrolytic solution, there was employed such electrolytic solution in which LiPF<sub>6 </sub>with a concentration of 1 mol/dm<sup>3 </sup>was dissolved into a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) used as a solvent and diethyl carbonate (DEC) with a weight ratio of EC:DEC=3:7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">After the electrolytic solution was injected into the inside of the battery can <b>2</b>, the battery lid <b>5</b> was caulked to the battery can <b>2</b> through the gasket and thereby the battery <b>1</b> was obtained as a square secondary battery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">With respect to such battery, batteries corresponding to examples 1-1 to 1-7 and comparative examples 1-1 to 1-8 were manufactured by changing combinations of roughness of the first principal plane <b>14</b> <i>a </i>used as the inner surface of the winding structure and the second principal plane <b>14</b> <i>b </i>used as the outer surface of the winding structure, the thickness of the inner surface negative electrode active material layer <b>15</b> formed on the first principal plane <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and the thickness of the outer surface negative electrode active material layer <b>16</b> formed on the second principal plane <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, respectively and discharge capacity retention rates thereof were measured. Measured results are shown on the following TABLE 1.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">In this example, the element winding type square battery described in the first embodiment was manufactured and used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">It should be noted that, when the battery according to this example was manufactured, first, the natural graphite, silicon particles with an average particle size of 3 μm and polyamide acid were mixed in the NMP and thereby formed as slurry and this slurry was coated on a current collector. Next, after the electrode was dried and press-molded, a resultant molded product was heat-treated at 400° C. for three hours in the atmosphere of argon (Ar) gas. In that case, a mixing ratio of polyamide acid relative to the silicon particles was adjusted so as to reach 10% in weight ratio.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">From the results in the TABLE 4, it could be confirmed that, also when the active material layer is made of tin (Sn), the batteries in the examples 4-1 to 4-4 in which the first and second principal planes <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b </i>are different in roughness according to the arrangement of the present invention can exhibit higher discharge capacity retention rates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">Further, the batteries in the examples 4-1 to 4-4 having the arrangement according to an embodiment of the present invention have fewer cracks and the number of cracks can further be decreased as a difference of roughness between the first and second principal planes <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and <b>14</b> <i>b </i>is increased.</div>
<heading id="h-0016">Example 5</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">In this example, the element winding type square battery explained in the first embodiment, the element winding type cylindrical (tubular) battery explained the second embodiment and a stack type square battery were manufactured and used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">In this example, the element winding type square battery was manufactured by a procedure similar to that of the first example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">However, the inner surface negative electrode active material layer <b>15</b> and the outer surface negative electrode active material layer <b>16</b> of the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> were formed by forming silicon (Si) having a thickness of about 4 μm on the negative electrode current collector <b>14</b> by an RF (radio frequency) sputtering method. Thereafter, a resultant product was heat-treated at 280° C. for six hours in the atmosphere of argon (Ar) gas and the resultant product was used as a negative electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">Also, in this example, the element winding type cylindrical battery explained in the second embodiment was manufactured and used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">The element winding type cylindrical battery <b>21</b> was manufactured by the following procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">First, the positive electrode <b>29</b> was manufactured. Specifically, a positive electrode mixture was prepared by mixing 91 wt % of LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.19</sub>Al<sub>0.01</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>having an average secondary particle size of 15 μm, 6 wt % of graphite used as a conductive assisting agent and 3 wt % of poly(vinylidene) fluoride used as a binder. After that, this positive electrode mixture was dispersed into N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and thereby formed as positive electrode mixture slurry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">Subsequently, this positive electrode mixture slurry was coated on the aluminum positive electrode current collector <b>31</b> having a thickness of 20 μm, dried and compression-molded by a roller press machine and thereby the inner surface positive electrode active material layer <b>32</b> and the outer surface positive electrode active material layer <b>33</b> were formed, resulting in the positive electrode <b>29</b> being obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">Subsequently, the negative electrode <b>30</b> was manufactured. Specifically, first, a 12 μm-thick rolled copper foil was prepared, copper particles were deposited on the surface, one surface or both surfaces with roughness of Ra of 0.05 μm by an electrolytic deposition method and thereby copper foil with a predetermined surface roughness was obtained as the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b>. The electrolytic deposition method in the manufacturing of this negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> was carried out by adjusting a time and electrolytic conditions in the deposition of the copper particles in such a manner that the first principal plane <b>34</b> <i>a </i>used as the inner surface of the winding structure finally and the second principal plane <b>34</b> <i>b </i>used as the outer surface may have different roughness. Silicon (Si) having a thickness of about 4 μm was deposited on the first principal plane <b>34</b> <i>a </i>and the second principal plane <b>34</b> <i>b </i>having predetermined different surface roughness of the thus obtained negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> by an RF sputtering method. Thereafter, the resultant product was heat-treated at 280° C. for six hours in the atmosphere of argon (Ar) gas and the finally obtained product was used as the negative electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">It should be noted that, when the cross section of the negative electrode <b>30</b> was sectioned by a focused ion beam (FIB: Focused Ion Beam) in order to observe the interface between the negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> and the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> and analyzed by AES (Auger electron spectroscopy), it was confirmed that the negative electrode active material layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> and the negative electrode current collector <b>34</b> were alloyed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">After the positive electrode <b>29</b> and the negative electrode <b>30</b> were manufactured, a positive lead wire with an insulating tape attached thereto was connected to one end of the positive electrode current collector <b>31</b> of the positive electrode <b>29</b>, the positive electrode <b>29</b> and the negative electrode <b>30</b> were laminated through the 30 μm-thick separators <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> made of a micro-porous polyethylene film, wound and thereby the electrode winding body <b>23</b> having a shortest diameter S of 17.37 mm and a longest diameter L of 17.45 mm was manufactured. After the electrode winding body <b>23</b> was formed, both end portions perpendicular to the winding surface of the electrode winding body <b>23</b> were sandwiched by a pair of insulating plates, the positive electrode lead wire was welded to the safety valve mechanism <b>36</b>, the negative electrode lead wire (not shown) was welded to the bottom portion of the battery can <b>22</b> and the electrode winding body <b>23</b> was housed within the battery can <b>22</b> made of iron.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Thereafter, the center pin <b>24</b> was inserted into the center of the electrode winding body <b>23</b>. Subsequently, an electrolytic solution was injected into the inside of the battery can <b>22</b>. As the electrolytic solution, there was employed such electrolytic solution in which LiPF<sub>6 </sub>with a concentration of 1 mol/dm<sup>3 </sup>was dissolved into a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) used as a solvent and diethyl carbonate (DEC) with a weight ratio of EC:DEC=3:7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">After the electrolytic solution was injected into the inside of the battery can <b>22</b>, the battery lid <b>25</b> was caulked to the battery can <b>22</b> through the gasket and thereby the battery <b>21</b> having a diameter of 18 mm and a height of 65 mm was obtained as the cylindrical type secondary battery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">Also, in this example, the element stack type square battery explained in the third embodiment was manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">The element stack type square battery <b>41</b> was manufactured by the following procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">First, silicon having a thickness of about 4 μm was deposited on the negative electrode current collector <b>54</b> having a thickness of 20 μm in which the first and second principal planes <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b </i>have predetermined Ra values by an RF sputtering method and the resultant product was heat-treated at 280° C. for six hours in the atmosphere of argon (Ar) gas. Then, the finally obtained product was used as the negative electrode. Thereafter, the lead wire <b>46</b> was attached to the negative electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">On the other hand, cobaltic acid lithium (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) used as a positive electrode active material, carbon black used as a conductive material and poly(vinylidene) fluoride were mixed. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone used as a dispersion medium was mixed to the above mixture, coated and dried on the positive electrode current collector <b>51</b> made of aluminum foils and thereby the positive electrode active material layers <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> were formed on the first and second principal planes <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and <b>51</b> <i>b </i>of the positive electrode current collector <b>51</b>. Thereafter, the lead wire <b>45</b> was attached.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">Subsequently, the thus manufactured negative electrode <b>50</b> and positive electrode <b>49</b> were wound through the separators <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> made of the micro-porous polyethylene film and sandwiched between the exterior members <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> made of aluminum laminated film. Then, an electrolytic solution was injected into the inside of the exterior members <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, the exterior members <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> were hermetically closed and thereby the battery <b>41</b> in which the electrode winding body <b>43</b> was provided within the hermetically sealed structure was manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">With respect to such battery, while the combinations of roughness of the first principal plane used as the inner surface of the winding structure and the second principal plane used as the outer surface in the winding structure, thicknesses of the inner surface negative electrode active material layer formed on the first principal plane and thicknesses of the outer surface negative electrode active material layer formed on the second principal plane were being respectively changed, batteries corresponding to the examples 5-1 to 5-3 and the comparative examples 5-1 to 5-6 were manufactured and discharge capacity retention rates thereof were measured. Measured results are shown on the following TABLE 5]. The TABLE 5 is formed of TABLES 5A and 5B so as to permit a use of a suitably large-scale.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">From the results on the TABLE 5, the examples 5-1 to 5-3 in which the first and second principal planes are different in roughness according to the arrangements of the present invention in any types of the batteries can exhibit higher discharge capacity retention rates and the number of cracks can be decreased. Therefore, it could be confirmed that far excellent characteristics can be obtained in both of the number of cracks and the discharge capacity retention rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">As described in the above-mentioned embodiments and examples, according to the battery of the present invention, since roughness of one side of the current collector is increased, roughness of one side is decreased relatively and the surface roughness values of the front and back surfaces are changed, it is possible to avoid the electrode from being either split or cracked when the battery is charged and discharged. As a result, it becomes possible to maintain high cycle characteristics even in the large-capacity battery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">More specifically, according to an embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to obtain a battery in which the negative electrode is formed of the active material layer of which volume is changed considerably and which includes such negative electrode while the electrode can be suppressed from being either cracked or split. On the other hand, there is a battery with a specification which is easy to crack or split depending on the thickness of the current collector and other arrangement of the battery. In that case, it is also possible to obtain an optimum battery arrangement by using suitable arrangements such as to keep roughness of one side at high level, to keep roughness of the other side at low level, to locate the thick active material layer at the surface with high roughness and to locate the thin active material layer at the surface with low roughness. It should be noted that, as mentioned before, particularly large improvements of characteristics could be confirmed in the winding type element arrangement battery to which local stress of electrode can be easily applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">It should be noted that the materials available in the above-described embodiments and numerical value conditions such as their quantities, their treatment times and their dimensions are merely those of the suitable examples and also dimensions, shapes and placement relationships in the respective sheets of drawings are described schematically. That is, the present invention is not limited to those embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">For example, the present invention can be applied to various battery arrangements and the containers thereof such as the exterior member and the battery can are not limited to the ones. Therefore, the present invention can be modified and changed variously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</div>
