<heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Multiple myeloma (MM) is a bone marrow cancer in which a single plasma cell clone has turned malignant and produces monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig). MM patients have a very poor prognosis. Although high response rates and increased survival can be achieved using high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous or allogeneic stem cell grafting, the majority of patients relapse and few, if any, are cured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Myeloma cells produce monoclonal Ig that is unique for each tumor and thus for each individual patient. Ig is composed of two identical heavy (H) and two identical light (L) chains. L and H chains have highly diversified variable (V) regions, VL and VH. VL and VH together form the Fv (fragment variable) that contains unique antigenic determinants called idiotopes (Id). Idiotopes collectively constitute the idiotype of the Fv (of the Ig in casu). Induction of an immune response against the idiotype, so called Id-vaccination is a promising strategy in treatment of B cell lymphomas and MM (Bendandi, Gocke et al. 1999) (Tao and Levy 1993) (Huang, Wu et al. 2004) (Hakim, Levy et al. 1996) (King, Spellerberg et al. 1998) (Biragyn, Tani et al. 1999; Biragyn, Ruffini et al. 2002), and both anti-idiotypic antibodies (Sirisinha and Eisen 1971; Hough, Eady et al. 1976) and Id-specific T cells (Lauritzsen, Weiss et al. 1994) may be of importance. However, Id is a weak self-Ag in its original context (as part of Ig). Therefore, for vaccine purposes, it is important to enhance the immunogenicity of Id.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">T helper cells (CD4+ T cells) recognize their antigen (Ag) after it has been processed through engulfment of foreign proteins by APC, proteolytic breakdown into peptide fragments that are loaded onto MHC class II molecules and transported to the surface of the APC where the peptide-MHC complex is presented to T cell receptors (TCRs) of CD4+ T cells. Activated CD4+ T cells stimulate cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) and B cells with the corresponding Ag specificity, initiating a broad response against the original Ag. A major problem concerning Id-vaccination of MM patients is that Id-specific CD4+ T cells in these patients, as extrapolated from experiments in mice [18], probably are tolerant to Id V-region determinants on the highly abundant myeloma protein. MM patients who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may be in an advantageous phase for Id-vaccination for the following two reasons: 1) relief from T cell tolerance to myeloma protein Id and 2) development of new T cells that can respond to Id-vaccination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Targeting of T cell epitopes to surface molecules on APC with Troybodies (Lunde, Munthe et al. 1999), which are equipped with a T cell epitope incorporated in a loop in a constant Ig domain results in increased T cell stimulation by a factor of 100-100000 (Lunde, Rasmussen et al. 2001). However, Troybodies do not include the Ag in its native conformation, such as Fv, and are therefore restricted to induction of T cell responses. Therefore, to induce an anti-Id B cell response and anti-Id Abs, it is necessary to include the complete Fv of the M component of the patient. As for induction of an anti-Id T cell response, an inclusion of the entire Fv will greatly increase the chance of including idiotope sequences binding the patient's HLA-molecules, which is a prerequisite for activation of Id-specific T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">There have been several approaches for rendering idiotypes more immunogenic. Protein vaccination with complete Id+ immunoglobulins (Ig) fused with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Tao and Levy 1993), or CD40 ligand (Huang, Wu et al. 2004) enhances the level of anti-Id antibodies and results in protection against B-cell lymphoma in mice. However, scFv-GM-CSF was effective only when injected as protein and not as a DNA vaccine (Hakim, Levy et al. 1996). On the other hand, DNA vaccination employing scFv fused to IL-1β did induce tumor immunity (Hakim, Levy et al. 1996). In another approach, scFv has been genetically fused with fragment C from tetanus toxin and delivered as a DNA vaccine by intramuscular (i.m.) injection. This strategy has resulted in increased levels of anti-Id antibodies, Id-specific CD4+ responses and protection against lymphoma a myelomas in mice. The mechanism of adjuvant activity of tetanus toxoid fragment C is unknown (King, Spellerberg et al. 1998). In a similar approach, scFv has been fused to chemokines like MCP3, IP10 mDF2β (Biragyn, Tani et al. 1999; Biragyn, Ruffini et al. 2002) and has been used both as a DNA and as protein vaccine (Biragyn, Tani et al. 1999). In several of these studies, foreign T cell epitopes corresponding to TT fragment-C or unique fusion sequences could have contributed to responses. Heightened anti-Id antibody responses and tumor protection has been observed. The mechanism of action of scFv-chemokine is unknown. One possibility is that the chemokine moiety targets Fv to chemokine receptors on APC for enhanced delivery of scFv. Alternatively, chemokines attract APC to the site of injection. However, both the Fragment C and chemokine fusion strategies rely on monovalent binding to their target molecules (King, Spellerberg et al. 1998; Biragyn, Tani et al. 1999). This is of concern because crosslinking has been shown to be of importance for optimal stimulation of T cells, e.g. for Troybodies (Lunde, Munthe et al. 1999).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">With these considerations in mind, the inventors have designed a novel type of recombinant antibody-like molecules called Vaccibodies, a divalent molecule comprising a flexible hinge, with no FcR binding and that contain the Ag in its native conformation, with the purpose of inducing both strong Id-specific Ab and T cell responses. Vaccibodies are large and complex macromolecules, but, surprisingly, cells were able to produce and export intact molecules.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention relates to a novel type of human recombinant antibody-like molecules useful in the treatment of i.e. multiple myeloma. These molecules, called Vaccibodies, bind APC and are able to trigger both T cell and B cell immune response. Moreover, Vaccibodies bind divalently to APC to promote a more efficient initiation of an immune response. Hence, a major purpose of the present invention is to induce a strong immune response to render adjuvants redundant. Vaccibodies comprise a dimer of a monomeric unit that consists of a scFv with specificity for a surface molecule on APC, connected through a hinge region and a Cγ3 domain to a scFv in the COOH-terminal end; the latter being of B cell lymphoma or myeloma origin (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), although any origin is possible due to the cassette cloning system in the expression vector. The said molecule is capable of inducing an immune response against multiple myeloma, but extension to a general vaccination strategy for any polypeptide should be feasible. The present invention also relates to a DNA sequence coding for this recombinant antibody based molecule, to expression vectors comprising these DNA sequences, cell lines comprising said expression vectors, to treatment of mammals preferentially by immunization by means of Vaccibody DNA, Vaccibody RNA, or Vaccibody protein, and finally to pharmaceuticals and a kit comprising the said molecules.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> The structure of the Vaccibody. The two scFvs in white target the Vaccibody to surface molecules on APC. They may be replaced by other targeting molecules, e.g. chemokine receptors. The hinge provides flexibility of the relative orientation of the two NH2-terminal scFvs and disulfide bridges the monomers. The CH3 domains (light grey) act as a spacer between the NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH terminal scFvs and participate in the dimerization through hydrophobic interactions. These dimerization motifs may be replaced by other dimerization or multimerization domains. The two scFvs shown in dark grey are the antigenic moiety of the Vaccibody. These scFvs are derived from the M component, thus harboring idiotypic sequences (black). The antigenic scFv may be replaced by any polypeptide derived from an antigenic source, conferring vaccine strategies towards any antigen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> Principle. The Vaccibody is targeted to surface molecules on APC, the complex is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis, processed and Id-peptides are presented to CD4+ T cells on MHC class II. Simultaneously, the Id may stimulate B cells with an anti-Id BCR. These B cells will also serve as APC for the CD4+ T cells. Thus, T and B cells will cooperate to enhance the response, as indicated. Anti-Id B cells will as a consequence develop into plasma cells that produce anti-Id antibodies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> The MHC class II-specific Vaccibodies bind CD19<sup>+</sup> splenocytes (white). The NIP-specific Vaccibodies (negative controls—grey), do not bind to the splenocytes. Binding was detected with streptavidinPE and 9A8bio which is a rat mAb that binds the antigenic Fv of M315 origin (Vλ1/2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> The NIP-specific control Vaccibodies exhibits binding to the hapten NIP. Supernatant from cells transfected with genes encoding NIP-specific Vaccibodies was added to ELISA plates coated with NIP-BSA. 9A8 bio (antiVλ1/2) was used as the secondary Ab. Similar results were obtained with a biotinylated anti IdAb (Ab2.1-4 bio).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> The Vaccibodies exhibit binding to DNP, hence the antigenic scFv is correctly folded. The M315 Ab, from which the antigenic scFv is derived, is specific for the hapten DNP. ELISA plates were coated with DNP-BSA. Supernatants from cells transfected with genes encoding various Vaccibodies were added. Binding was detected with 9A8 bio.</div>

There were no significant differences between the Vaccibodies with a long sequence prior to the first disulfide bridge in the hinge (h1+h4) compared to the Vaccibodies with a short hinge sequence above the first disulfide bridge (h4).</div>

Shown is data from sera taken on day 28, 14 days after the second immunization of Vaccibodies. The MHC class II-specific Vaccibodies induced a strong anti-Id Ab response. The Vaccibodies with the longest hinge (h1+h4) induced the strongest anti-Id Ab response reaching 3-4 μg/ml in sera.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0037">The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0038">The present invention relates to a recombinant human antibody-based molecule, called Vaccibodies, comprising dimers of a monomeric unit that consist of a single chain fragment variable (scFv) of immunoglobulins (Ig) with specificity for surface molecules on Ag presenting cells (APC), connected through a hinge region and a Cγ3 domain to a scFv in the COOH-terminal end, the latter being derived from a myeloma protein (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), although any origin is possible due to the cassette cloning system of the expression vector. The hinge region and the Cγ3 domains (carboxyterminal C domain of Ig) contribute to dimerization of the Vaccibody through disulfide bridges in the hinge and strong hydrophobic interactions between the two Cγ3 domains. Hence, the dimeric product will include two preferably identical scFvs with binding specificity for the same surface molecules on APC (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), enabling bivalent binding. Bivalent binding (i.e. crosslinking) is of importance to trigger activation of the target cell and thereby initiation of an immune response. Also, bivalent binding provides increased binding strength due to avidity effects, and increases the likelihood of receptor mediated endocytosis into the APC and subsequent degradation inside the APC. Furthermore, the bivalent binding may provide important receptor mediated intracellular signaling to the APC. The scFvs with a targeting function are either derived from B cell hybridomas expressing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to surface molecules on APC, or they may be derived from any source, e.g. phage display libraries. The use of scFvs from B cell hybridomas as the targeting moiety opens for a great range of possible targets due to the large collection of B cell hybridomas that produce mAbs which bind different surface molecules on APC. Furthermore, one may choose the nature of the signal given to the targeted cell by employing agonistic or antagonistic mAbs. Growing knowledge of Ab-Ag interactions will allow the improvement of the binding affinity of such mAbs to their Ag by amino acid replacements in the binding sites. This can be performed by ordinary site-directed mutagenesis. For vaccine purposes, an attractive approach is to target the Vaccibodies to surface molecules expressed exclusively on subsets of dendritic cells (DC) that are able to initiate a strong, specific immune response towards the patients own Id. Examples of such target surface molecules on APC are CD40, Toll-like receptors and chemokine receptors. Because the targeting scFv is inserted into the V cassette of the expression vector pLNOH2 (Norderhaug, Olafsen et al. 1997), it is easily exchanged with other scFvs (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0039">The crucial dimerization motifs in the Vaccibodies constructed in the examples so far, include hinge regions and Cγ3 domains. The hinge contributes to the dimerization through the formation of interchain disulfide bridges. In addition, it functions as a flexible spacer between the domains allowing the two scFvs with targeting tasks to bind simultaneously to two target molecules expressed with variable distances (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The Cγ3 domains contribute to the dimerization through hydrophobic interactions. These dimerization motifs can be exchanged with other multimerization moieties (e.g. from other Ig isotypes/subclasses).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0040">The C-terminal scFv derived from the monoclonal Ig produced by myeloma or lymphoma cells, also called the myeloma/lymphoma M component, can be genetically exchanged with other scFvs or any antigen because the vector has been constructed with a Sfi I restriction site (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Therefore, the scFv derived from the model myeloma protein used in the present example is easily swapped with scFv from the M component of any patient with B cell lymphoma or multiple myeloma. Thus, this vector will allow for rapid construction of individual patient specific vaccines. The dimeric structure of the Vaccibody not only affords crosslinking, but should also allow double loading of the patient Fv to the APC per Vaccibody molecule compared to a single scFv combined to a single targeting moiety. Furthermore, there is in a single Vaccibody duplication of serological idiotypic determinants, which might be of importance for the anti-Id B cell response. The Vaccibodies lack a CH2 domain and hence all FcR binding sites, and should therefore exclusively be taken up through its target molecules, such as MHC class II in the example used and not by any FcRs, ensuring that a large proportion of the vaccine will arrive at the intended target cells. This is in contrast to vaccines that exert their effect through the binding to an FcR on a target cell (Ravetch and Bolland 2001).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0041">Vaccibodies can be extended to a general medical treatment through induction of an immune response against any polypeptide of any origin. It is possible to replace the idiotypic scFv with other antigenic sequences of sufficient length to allow proper folding of the polypeptide. This sequence may be derived from other cancer proteins or infectious agents. Insertion of such a sequence in a Vaccibody format might also lead to activation of both arms of the immune response, similar to the Vaccibodies that are described herein, which comprise the idiotypic scFv. Immunization by means of Vaccibody protein, Vaccibody DNA, or Vaccibody RNA, the latter two executed e.g. by intramuscular injection followed by electroporation (See Examples), are all feasible methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0042">The scFvs on the NH2-terminal end of the Vaccibodies target the Vaccibodies to APC through binding to surface molecules (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and in the example shown they bind to MHC class II. MHC class II is expressed on all professional APC, so the Vaccibodies described herein are able to target B cells, DC and macrophages. Targeting of conventional Ag-Ab complexes to MHC class II induces activation of specific CD4+ T cells (Snider and Segal 1987; Casten and Pierce 1988). Targeting of Troybodies to MHC class II has previously been shown to enhance Ag presentation and T cell activation in vitro as well as in vivo (Lunde, Western et al. 2002). In the antigenic region of the molecule, the Vaccibodies of the examples contain the scFv of the myeloma protein M315 derived from the BALB/c plasmacytoma MOPC315.4. The λ2315 light chain of M315 harbors three defined somatic mutations in the CDR3 loop and functions as a model idiotypic T cell epitope in a well defined system (Bogen, Malissen et al. 1986; Bogen and Lambris 1989).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0043">The Vaccibodies have been genetically assembled, and the DNA transfected into NSO cells, 293E cells and Cos-7 cells. Transfectants produce and secrete the recombinant Vaccibody molecules. The targeting scFvs at one end of the Vaccibodies exhibit binding to MHC class II (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The antigenic scFv at the other end of the Vaccibody binds DNP (di-nitro-phenyl, the specificity of M315) (FIG. <b>5</b>). Thus, both the targeting and antigenic scFvs retain the same folding pattern as in their original context. We have evidence that Vaccibodies have the ability to induce strong T cell responses through their binding to APC and presentation of Id-peptides on class II molecules to Id-specific CD4+ T cells in vitro (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Furthermore, since they have intact Fv of the M-component, they elicit anti-Id antibodies in significant amounts in vivo when injected into BALB/c mice without adjuvants (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0044">To determine if MM patients treated with ASCT achieve remission with a low serum myeloma protein concentration, ELISA should performed for each patient's myeloma protein because routine assays (agarose gel electrophoresis, combined with immunofixation) have only a sensitivity of about 0.2-1 mg/ml, which is far too insensitive. The kinetic data of the serum myeloma protein levels will indicate if and when Id-vaccination may best be performed post ASCT to avoid the problem of T cell tolerance of newly educated thymic emigrants. To achieve this, mice are immunized with DNA encoding patient specific Vaccibodies by in vivo electroporation of muscle cells. Sera from immunized mice are absorbed on anti human Ig-Sepharose to remove crossreactive antibodies and thereafter eluted to obtain purified highly Id-specific antibodies. Sandwich ELISAs specific for each patient's myeloma are performed as follows: The purified anti-Id Ab from mice is coated in wells. Serum from the patient in casu is added. Myeloma protein binding to anti-Id antibodies will be detected by use of Ab specific for human IgG or IgA. The sensitivity of such sandwich ELISAs is usually &lt;1 ng/ml, which is &gt;106 times more sensitive than routine assays. Furthermore, to monitor development of new T cells, profile of T cells in blood will be monitored by flow cytometry with Vβ-specific mAbs, in combination with other markers.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0087">By way of example the following experiments demonstrate that Vaccibodies bind APC and are able to trigger both T cell and B cell immune response. Moreover, the following experiments show that Vaccibodies induce a strong immune response rendering adjuvants redundant. The experiments demonstrate that said molecule is capable of inducing an immune response against multiple myeloma and, further, the feasibility of treatment of mammals by immunization by means of Vaccibody DNA or Vaccibody protein. The experiments also demonstrate that another attractive approach is to target the Vaccibodies to surface molecules expressed exclusively on subsets of dendritic cells (DC), like e.g. chemokine receptors. The following examples are meant to illustrate how to make and use the invention. They are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any manner or to any degree.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0088">Vaccibodies are produced and secreted as functional dimerized molecules and is itself bound by the anti-Vλ1/2 antibody (9A8) (Bogen 1989) and the anti-idiotypic antibody Ab2.1-4 (Lauritzsen, Weiss et al. 1994).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0089">The M315 mAb binds the hapten di-nitro-phenyl (DNP) (Eisen, Simms et al. 1968). Therefore, to verify that Vaccibodies were produced, secreted and correctly folded as functional molecules, the antigenic units of Vaccibodies were tested in ELISA for their capability to bind DNP, 9A8 and Ab2.1-4 mAbs. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20<i>b </i> </figref>shows that both the NIP-specific and the MHCII-specific Vaccibodies, that both have scFv<sup>315</sup>, bind DNP, 9A8 and Ab2.1-4. This was the case with all Vaccibodies containing scFv<sup>315</sup>, both the ones with long human dimerization unit, short human dimerization unit and murine dimerization unit (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). We next tested the targeting units of the Vaccibodies. These were found to be correct; first, the NIP-specific Vaccibodies bound NIP-BSA in ELISA (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20<i>c</i> </figref>), while the MHCII-specific Vaccibodies did not (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20<i>c</i> </figref>).

To check for correct homodimerization, the Vaccibodies were metabolically labelled by growth of transfected cells in medium containing <sup>35</sup>S-methionine, vaccibodies were immunoprecipitated from supernatant using specific antibodies, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As would be expected from the theoretical consideration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, both the F<sub>v</sub> <sup>NIP </sup>F<sub>v</sub> <sup>315 </sup>and F<sub>vI-E </sub>F<sub>v</sub> <sup>315 </sup>transfectomas secreted dimeric Vaccibodies of ˜130 kDa.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0091">Class II-specific and non-targeting NIP-specific Vaccibodies were mixed with antigen presenting cells (APC) and compared for their ability to induce specific T cell activation. Irradiated BALB/c splenocytes were used as APC. The BALB/c strain has the H-2<sup>d </sup>haplotype, hence they express I-E<sup>d </sup>molecules necessary for both targeting of the MHC II-specific Vaccibodies and presentation of the λ2<sup>315 </sup>epitope to specific CD4+ T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0092">The APC were pulsed with the different Vaccibodies for 4 h and subsequently washed. Washing was performed to reduce the chance that I-E<sup>d</sup>-specific Vaccibodies in the culture medium could diminish T cell stimulation by blocking I-E<sup>d </sup>molecules (Lunde, Western et al. 2002). Polarized Th2 cells from mice transgenic for a λ2<sup>315</sup>-specific I-E<sup>d </sup>restricted TCR (Lauritzsen, Weiss et al. 1993) were added as responder T cells. The dose response curve in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that the λ2<sup>315 </sup>epitope was presented 100-1000 times more efficiently to TCR-transgenic Th2 cells when they were carried in the APC-targeted MHC II-specific Vaccibodies (both the ones with short and long human dimerization units) compared to the non-targeted NIP-specific Vaccibodies. It should be noted that Vaccibodies do not include an FcγR binding site; hence the NIP-specific Vaccibodies should not be able to enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0094">In the protein vaccination protocol, BALB/c mice were immunized twice, spaced two weeks apart, with 20 or 200 μg MHC II-specific Vaccibodies or NIP-specific Vaccibodies in PBS. Note that no adjuvant was employed. Sera from immunized mice taken at various time points after the second vaccination were then analyzed for anti-idiotypic antibodies binding M315 in ELISA. The MHC II-specific Vaccibodies elicited significant higher anti-idiotypic antibody responses after 14 days after the second immunization than did NIP-specific Vaccibodies. Vaccibodies with a long human dimerization unit induced best anti-idiotypic Ab responses (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Thus targeting of Vaccibodies enhanced anti-Id immunoresponses, however, by this route of immunization, also the non-targeted Vaccibodies induced some responses.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0096">It has recently been described that skeletal muscle can produce antibodies after injection of Ig genes and electroporation (Tjelle 2004). We therefore investigated if functional Vaccibodies were produced by i.m. plasmid injection and electroporation. Since the F<sub>v</sub> <sup>I-E </sup>F<sub>v</sub> <sup>315 </sup>Vaccibodies are specific for I-E<sup>d </sup>molecules present in BALB/c (H-2d), these Vaccibodies should be rapidly absorbed by the I-E<sup>d </sup>positive cells in BALB/c. By contrast, the non-targeted FvNIP F<sub>v</sub> <sup>315 </sup>Vaccibodies should not be absorbed. Indeed, 14 days after a single injection of 50 μg Vaccibody plasmid in quadriceps and electroporation, F<sub>v</sub> <sup>NIP </sup>F<sub>v</sub> <sup>315 </sup>Vaccibody protein was detected in significant amounts in serum, while there was no detectable F<sub>v</sub> <sup>I-E </sup>F<sub>v</sub> <sup>315 </sup>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21<i>a</i> </figref>).</div>

PCR products can be ligated into a pGEM®-T vector (pGEM®-T Easy Vector from Promega), and transformed into <i>E. coli</i>. DNA samples isolated from individual colonies can be sequenced. Getting the same sequence from three different colonies originating from three different PCRs confirms that the V regions from the myeloma Ig have been isolated. PCR SOEing can be performed and reamplification is done with primers including tags with sites for SfiI as described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. For one patient such primers had the sequence:</div>
