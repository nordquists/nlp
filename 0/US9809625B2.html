<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Provisional Patent Application U.S. Ser. No. 62/134,686 filed Mar. 18, 2015, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure provides novel macrocyclic peptides which inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 and CD80/PD-L1 protein/protein interaction, and are thus useful for the amelioration of various diseases, including cancer and infectious diseases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The protein Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory member of the CD28 family of receptors, that also includes CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS and BTLA. PD-1 is expressed on activated B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells (Agata et al., supra; Okazaki et al., <i>Curr. Opin. Immunol., </i>14:779-782 (2002); Bennett et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>170:711-718 (2003)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The PD-1 protein is a 55 kDa type I transmembrane protein that is part of the Ig gene superfamily (Agata et al., <i>Int. Immunol., </i>8:765-772 (1996)). PD-1 contains a membrane proximal immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM) and a membrane distal tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) (Thomas, M. L., <i>J. Exp. Med., </i>181:1953-1956 (1995); Vivier, E. et al., <i>Immunol. Today, </i>18:286-291 (1997)). Although structurally similar to CTLA-4, PD-1 lacks the MYPPY motif that is critical for CD80 CD86 (B7-2) binding. Two ligands for PD-1 have been identified, PD-L1 (B7-H1) and PD-L2 (b7-DC). The activation of T cells expressing PD-1 has been shown to be downregulated upon interaction with cells expressing PD-L1 or PD-L2 (Freeman et al., <i>J. Exp. Med., </i>192:1027-1034 (2000); Latchman et al., <i>Nat. Immunol., </i>2:261-268 (2001); Carter et al., <i>Eur. J. Immunol., </i>32:634-643 (2002)). Both PD-L1 and PD-L2 are B7 protein family members that bind to PD-1, but do not bind to other CD28 family members. The PD-L1 ligand is abundant in a variety of human cancers (Dong et al., <i>Nat. Med., </i>8:787-789 (2002)). The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 results in a decrease in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, a decrease in T-cell receptor mediated proliferation, and immune evasion by the cancerous cells (Dong et al., <i>J. Mol. Med., </i>81:281-287 (2003); Blank et al., <i>Cancer Immunol. Immunother., </i>54:307-314 (2005); Konishi et al., <i>Clin. Cancer Res., </i>10:5094-5100 (2004)). Immune suppression can be reversed by inhibiting the local interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1, and the effect is additive when the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L2 is blocked as well (Iwai et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>99:12293-12297 (2002); Brown et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>170:1257-1266 (2003)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">PD-L1 has also been shown to interact with CD80 (Butte M J et al, <i>Immunity; </i>27:111-122 (2007)). The interaction PD-L1/CD80 on expressing immune cells has been shown to be an inhibitory one. Blockade of this interaction has been shown to abrogate this inhibitory interaction (Paterson A M, et al., <i>J Immunol., </i>187:1097-1105 (2011); Yang J, et al. <i>J Immunol</i>. August 1; 187(3):1113-9 (2011)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">When PD-1 expressing T cells contact cells expressing its ligands, functional activities in response to antigenic stimuli, including proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxicity, are reduced. PD-1/PD-L1 or PD-L2 interactions down regulate immune responses during resolution of an infection or tumor, or during the development of self tolerance (Keir, M. E. et al., <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol., </i>26:Epub (2008)). Chronic antigen stimulation, such as that which occurs during tumor disease or chronic infections, results in T cells that express elevated levels of PD-1 and are dysfunctional with respect to activity towards the chronic antigen (reviewed in Kim et al., <i>Curr. Opin. Imm</i>. (2010)). This is termed “T cell exhaustion”. B cells also display PD-1/PD-ligand suppression and “exhaustion”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 ligation using antibodies to PD-L1 has been shown to restore and augment T cell activation in many systems. Patients with advanced cancer benefit from therapy with a monoclonal antibody to PD-L1 (Brahmer et al., <i>New Engl. J. Med</i>. (2012)). Preclinical animal models of tumors and chronic infections have shown that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by monoclonal antibodies can enhance the immune response and result in tumor rejection or control of infection. Antitumor immunotherapy via PD-1/PD-L1 blockade may augment therapeutic immune response to a number of histologically distinct tumors (Dong, H. et al., “B7-H1 pathway and its role in the evasion of tumor immunity”, <i>J. Mol. Med., </i>81(5):281-287 (2003); Dong, H. et al., “Tumor-associated B7-H1 promotes T-cell apoptosis: a potential mechanism of immune evasion”, <i>Nat. Med., </i>8(8):793-800 (2002)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Interference with the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction causes enhanced T cell activity in systems with chronic infection. Blockade of PD-L1 caused improved viral clearance and restored immunity in mice with chromoic lymphocytic chorio meningitis virus infection (Barber, D. L. et al., “Restoring function in exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic viral infection”, <i>Nature, </i>439(7077):682-687 (2006)). Humanized mice infected with HIV-1 show enhanced protection against viremia and viral depletion of CD4+ T cells (Palmer et al., <i>J. Immunol</i>. (2013)). Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 through monoclonal antibodies to PD-L1 can restore in vitro antigen-specific functionality to T cells from HIV patients (Day, <i>Nature </i>(2006); Petrovas, <i>J. Exp. Med</i>. (2006); Trautman, <i>Nature Med</i>. (2006); D'Souza, <i>J. Immunol</i>. (2007); Zhang, <i>Blood </i>(2007); Kaufmann, <i>Nature Imm</i>. (2007); Kasu, <i>J. Immunol</i>. (2010); Porichis, <i>Blood </i>(2011)), HCV patients (Golden-Mason, <i>J. Virol</i>. (2007); Jeung, <i>Leuk. Biol</i>. (2007); Urbani, <i>J. Hepatol</i>. (2008); Nakamoto, <i>PLoS Path</i>. (2009); Nakamoto, <i>Gastroenterology </i>(2008)) and HBV patients (Boni, <i>J. Virol</i>. (2007); Fisicaro, <i>Gastro</i>. (2010); Fisicaro et al., <i>Gastroenterology </i>(2012); Boni et al., <i>Gastro</i>. (2012); Penna et al., <i>J. Hep</i>. (2012); Raziorrough, <i>Hepatology </i>(2009); Liang, <i>World J. Gastro</i>. (2010); Zhang, <i>Gastro</i>. (2008)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Blockade of the PD-L1/CD80 interaction has also been shown to stimulate immunity (Yang J., et al., <i>J Immunol</i>. August 1; 187(3):1113-9 (2011)). Immune stimulation resulting from blockade of the PD-L1/CD80 interaction has been shown to be enhanced through combination with blockade of further PD-1/PD-L1 or PD-1/PD-L2 interactions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Alterations in immune cell phenotypes are hypothesized to be an important factor in septic shock (Hotchkiss, et al., <i>Nat Rev Immunol </i>(2013)). These include increased levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 (Guignant, et al, <i>Crit. Care </i>(2011)), Cells from septic shock patients with increased levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 exhibit an increased level of T cell apoptosis. Antibodies directed to PD-L1, can reduce the level of Immune cell apoptosis (Zhang et al, <i>Crit. Care </i>(2011)). Furthermore, mice lacking PD-1 expression are more resistant to septic shock symptoms than wildtype mice. Yang J., et al. <i>J Immunol</i>. August 1; 187(3):1113-9 (2011)). Studies have revealed that blockade of the interactions of PD-L1 using antibodies can suppress inappropriate immune responses and ameliorate disease signs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition to enhancing immunologic responses to chronic antigens, blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has also been shown to enhance responses to vaccination, including therapeutic vaccination in the context of chronic infection (Ha, S. J. et al., “Enhancing therapeutic vaccination by blocking PD-1-mediated inhibitory signals during chronic infection”, <i>J. Exp. Med., </i>205(3):543-555 (2008); Finnefrock, A. C. et al., “PD-1 blockade in rhesus macaques: impact on chronic infection and prophylactic vaccination”, <i>J. Immunol., </i>182(2):980-987 (2009); Song, M.-Y. et al., “Enhancement of vaccine-induced primary and memory CD8+t-cell responses by soluble PD-1<i>”, J. Immunother., </i>34(3):297-306 (2011)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The molecules described herein demonstrate the ability to block the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1, in both biochemical and cell-based experimental systems. These results are consistent with a potential for therapeutic administration to enhance immunity in cancer or chronic infection, including therapeutic vaccine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The macrocyclic peptides described herein are capable of inhibiting the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and with CD80. These compounds have demonstrated highly efficacious binding to PD-L1, blockade of the interaction of PD-L1 with either PD-1 or CD80, and are capable of promoting enhanced T cell functional activity, thus making them candidates for parenteral, oral, pulmonary, nasal, buccal and sustained release formulations.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">The terms “specific binding” or “specifically bind” refer to the interaction between a protein and a binding molecule, such as a compound or ligand. The interaction is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (i.e., an enzyme binding site, an antigenic determinant or epitope) of the protein that is recognized by the binding molecule. For example, if a compound has specific binding for protein binding site “A”, the presence of the compound in a reaction containing a protein including binding site A, and a labeled peptide that specifically binds to protein binding site A will reduce the amount of labeled peptide bound to the protein. In contrast, nonspecific binding of a compound to the protein does not result in a concentration-dependent displacement of the labeled peptide from the protein.</div>

Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium and tritium.

Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. Such compounds may have a variety of potential uses, for example as standards and reagents in determining biological activity. In the case of stable isotopes, such compounds may have the potential to favorably modify biological, pharmacological, or pharmacokinetic properties.</div>

J. Cancer Suppl., </i>7:28-32 (1992)). The complete CTLA-4 nucleic acid sequence can be found under GENBANK® Accession No. L15006.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">The term “immune response” refers to the action of, for example, lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells, phagocytic cells, granulocytes, and soluble macromolecules produced by the above cells or the liver (including macrocyclic peptides, cytokines, and complement) that results in selective damage to, destruction of, or elimination from the human body of invading pathogens, cells or tissues infected with pathogens, cancerous cells, or, in cases of autoimmunity or pathological inflammation, normal human cells or tissues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">An “adverse event” (AE) as used herein is any unfavorable and generally unintended, even undesirable, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment. For example, an adverse event may be associated with activation of the immune system or expansion of immune system cells (e.g., T cells) in response to a treatment. A medical treatment may have one or more associated AEs and each AE may have the same or different level of severity. Reference to methods capable of “altering adverse events” means a treatment regime that decreases the incidence and/or severity of one or more AEs associated with the use of a different treatment regime.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">As used herein, “hyperproliferative disease” refers to conditions wherein cell growth is increased over normal levels. For example, hyperproliferative diseases or disorders include malignant diseases (e.g., esophageal cancer, colon cancer, biliary cancer) and non-malignant diseases (e.g., atherosclerosis, benign hyperplasia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">As used herein, “about” or “comprising essentially of” mean within an acceptable error range for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in part on how the value is measured or determined, i.e., the limitations of the measurement system. For example, “about” or “comprising essentially of” can mean within one or more than one standard deviation per the practice in the art. Alternatively, “about” or “comprising essentially of” can mean a range of up to 20%. Furthermore, particularly with respect to biological systems or processes, the terms can mean up to an order of magnitude or up to 5-fold of a value. When particular values are provided in the application and claims, unless otherwise stated, the meaning of “about” or “comprising essentially of” should be assumed to be within an acceptable error range for that particular value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">As described herein, any concentration range, percentage range, ratio range or integer range is to be understood to include the value of any integer within the recited range and, when appropriate, fractions thereof (such as one tenth and one hundredth of an integer), unless otherwise indicated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">Competition Assays</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">The present disclosure is also directed to macrocyclic peptides that are capable of competing with the binding of a reference anti-PD-L1 antibody (MDX-1105) by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, and at least about 100%. Such macrocyclic peptides may share structural homology with one or more macrocyclic peptides disclosed herein, including mutant, conservative substitution, functional substitution, and deletion forms, provided they specific bind to PD-L1. For example, if a macrocyclic peptide binds substantially to the same region of PD-L1 as a reference anti-PD-L1 antibody, the macrocyclic peptide should bind to an epitope of PD-L1 that at least overlaps with the PD-L1 epitope that the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody binds to. The overlapping region can range from one amino acid residue to several hundred amino acid residues. The macrocyclic peptide should then compete with and/or block the binding of the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody to PD-L1 and thereby decrease the binding of the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody to PD-L1, preferably by at least about 50% in a competition assay.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">Anti-PD-L1 antibodies that may be used as reference antibodies for competition assay purposes are known in the art. For example, the following representative anti-PD-L1 antibodies may be used: MDX-1105 (BMS); LO1X-C (Serono), L1X3 (Serono), MSB-0010718C (Serono), and PD-L1 Probody (CytomX), and the PD-L1 antibodies disclosed in co-owned WO 2007/005874.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">Anti-PD-1 antibodies that may be used as reference antibodies for competition assay purposes are known in the art. For example, the following representative anti-PD-1 antibodies may be used: nivolumab (BMS); 17D8, 2D3, 4H1, 4A11, 7D3 and 5F4 each disclosed in co-owned U.S. Pat.

Such compositions may include one or a combination of (e.g., two or more different) macrocyclic peptides, or immunoconjugates or bispecific molecules of the disclosure. For example, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure can comprise a combination of macrocyclic peptides (or immunoconjugates or bispecifics) that bind to different epitopes on the target antigen or that have complementary activities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">Pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure also can be administered in combination therapy, i.e., combined with other agents. For example, the combination therapy can include a macrocyclic peptide combined with at least one other anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant agent. Examples of therapeutic agents that can be used in combination therapy are described in greater detail below in the section on uses of the macrocyclic peptides of the disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. Preferably, the carrier is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the active compound, i.e., a macrocyclic peptide, immunoconjugate, or bispecific molecule, may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">The pharmaceutical compounds of the disclosure may include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts. A “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” or “therapeutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt that retains the desired biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any undesired toxicological effects (see e.g., Berge, S. M. et al., <i>J. Pharm. Sci., </i>66:1-19 (1977)). Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic amines, such as N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">A pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure also may include a pharmaceutically acceptable anti-oxidant. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers that may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of presence of microorganisms may be ensured both by sterilization procedures, supra, and by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191">Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying (lyophilization) that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the subject being treated, and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the composition which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 0.01 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 0.1 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 1 percent to about 30 percent of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the disclosure are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">For administration of the macrocyclic peptide, the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 0.3 mg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 5 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration once per day, twice per day, bi-weekly, tri-weekly, weekly, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once every four weeks, once a month, once every 3 months or once every three to 6 months. Preferred dosage regimens for a macrocyclic peptide of the disclosure include 1 mg/kg body weight or 3 mg/kg body weight via intravenous administration, with the macrocycle being given using one of the following dosing schedules: (i) every four weeks for six dosages, then every three months; (ii) every three weeks; (iii) 3 mg/kg body weight once followed by 1 mg/kg body weight every three weeks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">In some methods, two or more macrocyclic peptides with different binding specificities are administered simultaneously, in which case the dosage of each compound administered falls within the ranges indicated. The compounds are usually administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be, for example, weekly, monthly, every three months or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of macrocyclic peptide to the target antigen in the patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma concentration of about 1-1000 .mu.g/ml and in some methods about 25-300 .mu.g/ml.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">Alternatively, the macrocyclic peptide can be administered as a sustained release formulation, in which case less frequent administration is required. The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications, a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present disclosure employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">A “therapeutically effective dosage” of a macrocyclic peptide of the disclosure preferably results in a decrease in severity of disease symptoms, an increase in frequency and duration of disease symptom-free periods, or a prevention of impairment or disability due to the disease affliction. For example, for the treatment of tumors, a “therapeutically effective dosage” preferably inhibits cell growth or tumor growth by at least about 20%, more preferably by at least about 40%, even more preferably by at least about 60%, and still more preferably by at least about 80% relative to untreated subjects. The ability of a compound to inhibit tumor growth and/or HIV can be evaluated in an animal model system predictive of efficacy in human tumors or viral efficacy. Alternatively, this property of a composition can be evaluated by examining the ability of the compound to inhibit, such inhibition in vitro by assays known to the skilled practitioner. A therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic compound can decrease tumor size, decrease viral load, or otherwise ameliorate symptoms in a subject. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on such factors as the subject's size, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the particular composition or route of administration selected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200">In another aspect, the instant disclosure provides a pharmaceutical kit of parts comprising a macrocyclic peptide and an another immumodulator, as described herein. The kit may also further comprise instructions for use in the treatment of a hyperproliferative disease (such as cancer as described herein) and/or anti-viral disease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">A composition of the present disclosure can be administered via one or more routes of administration using one or more of a variety of methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. Preferred routes of administration for macrocyclic peptides of the disclosure include intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, spinal or other parenteral routes of administration, for example by injection or infusion. The phrase “parenteral administration” as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">Alternatively, a macrocyclic peptide of the disclosure can be administered via a non-parenteral route, such as a topical, epidermal or mucosal route of administration, for example, intranasally, orally, vaginally, rectally, sublingually or topically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">The active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Robinson, J. R., ed., <i>Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems</i>, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1978).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">Therapeutic compositions can be administered with medical devices known in the art. For example, in a preferred embodiment, a therapeutic composition of the disclosure can be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device, such as the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,163, 5,383,851, 5,312,335, 5,064,413, 4,941,880, 4,790,824, or 4,596,556. Examples of well-known implants and modules useful in the present disclosure include: U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump for dispensing medication at a controlled rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,194, which discloses a therapeutic device for administering medication through the skin; U.S. Pat.

These patents are incorporated herein by reference. Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are known to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">In certain embodiments, the macrocyclic peptides of the disclosure can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that therapeutic compounds of the disclosure cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811, 5,374,548, and 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., Ranade, V. V., <i>J. Clin. Pharmacol., </i>29:685 (1989)). Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,016 to Low et al.); mannosides (Umezawa et al., Biochem. <i>Biophys. Res. Commun., </i>153:1038 (1988)); macrocyclic peptides (Bloeman, P. G. et al., <i>FEBS Lett., </i>357:140 (1995); Owais, M. et al., <i>Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., </i>39:180 (1995)); surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe et al., <i>Am. J. Physiol., </i>1233:134 (1995)); p 120 (Schreier et al., <i>J. Biol.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">Uses and Methods of the Disclosure</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">The macrocyclic peptides, compositions and methods of the present disclosure have numerous in vitro and in vivo utilities involving, for example, detection of PD-L1 or enhancement of immune response by blockade of PD-L1. For example, these molecules can be administered to cells in culture, in vitro or ex vivo, or to human subjects, e.g., in vivo, to enhance immunity in a variety of situations. Accordingly, in one aspect, the disclosure provides a method of modifying an immune response in a subject comprising administering to the subject the macrocyclic peptide of the disclosure such that the immune response in the subject is modified. Preferably, the response is enhanced, stimulated or up-regulated. In other respects, the macrocyclic peptide may have anti-cyno, anti-mouse, and/or anti-woodchuck binding and therapeutic activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">As used herein, the term “subject” is intended to include human and non-human animals. Non-human animals includes all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non-mammals, such as non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cats, cows, horses, chickens, woodchuck, amphibians, and reptiles, although mammals are preferred, such as non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cats, cows and horses. Preferred subjects include human patients in need of enhancement of an immune response. The methods are particularly suitable for treating human patients having a disorder that can be treated by augmenting the T-cell mediated immune response. In a particular embodiment, the methods are particularly suitable for treatment of cancer cells in vivo. To achieve antigen-specific enhancement of immunity, the macrocyclic peptides can be administered together with an antigen of interest. When macrocyclic peptides to PD-L1 are administered together with another agent, the two can be administered in either order or simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">The disclosure further provides methods for detecting the presence of human, woodchuck, cyno, and/or mouse PD-L1 antigen in a sample, or measuring the amount of human, woodchuck, cyno, and/or mouse PD-L1 antigen, comprising contacting the sample, and a control sample, with a reference macrocyclic peptide which specifically binds to human, woodchuck, cyno, and/or mouse PD-L1, under conditions that allow for formation of a complex between the macrocycle and human, woodchuck, cyno, and/or mouse PD-L1. The formation of a complex is then detected, wherein a difference complex formation between the sample compared to the control sample is indicative the presence of human, woodchuck, cyno, and/or mouse PD-L1 antigen in the sample.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">Given the specific binding of the macrocyclic peptides of the disclosure for PD-L1, compared to CD28, ICOS and CTLA-4, the macrocyclic peptides of the disclosure can be used to specifically detect PD-L1 expression on the surface of cells and, moreover, can be used to purify PD-L1 via immunoaffinity purification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">Cancer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">Blockade of PD-1 by macrocyclic peptides can enhance the immune response to cancerous cells in the patient. The ligand for PD-1, PD-L1, is not expressed in normal human cells, but is abundant in a variety of human cancers (Dong et al., <i>Nat. Med., </i>8:787-789 (2002)). The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 results in a decrease in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, a decrease in T-cell receptor mediated proliferation, and immune evasion by the cancerous cells (Dong et al., <i>J. Mol. Med., </i>81:281-287 (2003); Blank et al., <i>Cancer Immunol. Immunother., </i>54:307-314 (2005); Konishi et al., <i>Clin. Cancer Res., </i>10:5094-5100 (2004)). Immune suppression can be reversed by inhibiting the local interaction of PD-1 to PD-L1 and the effect is additive when the interaction of PD-1 to PD-L2 is blocked as well (Iwai et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., </i>99:12293-12297 (2002); Brown et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>170:1257-1266 (2003)). While previous studies have shown that T-cell proliferation can be restored by inhibiting the interaction of PD-1 to PD-L1, there have been no reports of a direct effect on cancer tumor growth in vivo by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to treatment of a subject in vivo using a macrocyclic peptide such that growth of cancerous tumors is inhibited. A macrocyclic peptide may be used alone to inhibit the growth of cancerous tumors. Alternatively, a macrocyclic peptide may be used in conjunction with other immunogenic agents, standard cancer treatments, or other macrocyclic peptides, as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">Accordingly, in one embodiment, the disclosure provides a method of inhibiting growth of tumor cells in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a macrocyclic peptide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">Preferred cancers whose growth may be inhibited using the macrocyclic peptides of the disclosure include cancers typically responsive to immunotherapy. Non-limiting examples of preferred cancers for treatment include melanoma (e.g., metastatic malignant melanoma), renal cell carcinoma (e.g., clear cell carcinoma), prostate cancer (e.g., hormone refractory prostate adenocarcinoma and castration-resistant prostate cancer), breast cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer (e.g., squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, the disclosure includes refractory or recurrent malignancies whose growth may be inhibited using the macrocyclic peptides of the disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">Examples of other cancers that may be treated using the methods of the disclosure include bone cancer, pancreatic cancer, skin cancer, cancer of the head or neck, cutaneous or intraocular malignant melanoma, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, cancer of the anal region, stomach/gastric cancer, testicular cancer, uterine cancer, carcinoma of the fallopian tubes, carcinoma of the endometrium, carcinoma of the cervix, carcinoma of the vagina, carcinoma of the vulva, Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the small intestine, cancer of the endocrine system, cancer of the thyroid gland, cancer of the parathyroid gland, cancer of the adrenal gland, sarcoma of soft tissue, cancer of the urethra, cancer of the penis, chronic or acute leukemias including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, solid tumors of childhood, lymphocytic lymphoma, cancer of the bladder, cancer of the kidney or ureter, carcinoma of the renal pelvis, neoplasm of the central nervous system (CNS), primary CNS lymphoma, tumor angiogenesis, spinal axis tumor, brain stem glioma, pituitary adenoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, epidermoid cancer, squamous cell cancer, T-cell lymphoma, environmentally induced cancers including those induced by asbestos, and combinations of said cancers. The present disclosure is also useful for treatment of metastatic cancers, especially metastatic cancers that express PD-L1 (Iwai et al., <i>Int. Immunol., </i>17:133-144 (2005)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">Optionally, macrocyclic peptides to PD-L1 can be combined with an immunogenic agent, such as cancerous cells, purified tumor antigens (including recombinant proteins, peptides, and carbohydrate molecules), cells, and cells transfected with genes encoding immune stimulating cytokines (He et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>173:4919-4928 (2004)). Non-limiting examples of tumor vaccines that can be used include peptides of melanoma antigens, such as peptides of gp100, MAGE antigens, Trp-2, MART1 and/or tyrosinase, or tumor cells transfected to express the cytokine GM-CSF (discussed further below).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">In humans, some tumors have been shown to be immunogenic such as melanomas. It is anticipated that by raising the threshold of T cell activation by PD-L1 blockade, we may expect to activate tumor responses in the host.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">PD-L1 blockade is likely to be most effective when combined with a vaccination protocol. Many experimental strategies for vaccination against tumors have been devised (see Rosenberg, S., Development of Cancer Vaccines, ASCO Educational Book Spring: 60-62 (2000); Logothetis, C., ASCO Educational Book Spring: 300-302 (2000); Khayat, D., ASCO Educational Book Spring: 414-428 (2000); Foon, K., ASCO Educational Book Spring: 730-738 (2000); see also Restifo, N. et al., Cancer Vaccines, Chapter 61, pp. 3023-3043, in DeVita, V. et al., eds., <i>Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology</i>, Fifth Edition (1997)). In one of these strategies, a vaccine is prepared using autologous or allogeneic tumor cells. These cellular vaccines have been shown to be most effective when the tumor cells are transduced to express GM-CSF. GM-CSF has been shown to be a potent activator of antigen presentation for tumor vaccination (Dranoff et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>90: 3539-3543 (1993)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">The study of gene expression and large scale gene expression patterns in various tumors has led to the definition of so called tumor specific antigens (Rosenberg, S. A., <i>Immunity, </i>10:281-287 (1999)). In many cases, these tumor specific antigens are differentiated antigens expressed in the tumors and in the cell from which the tumor arose, for example melanocyte antigens gp100, MAGE antigens, and Trp-2. More importantly, many of these antigens can be shown to be the targets of tumor specific T cells found in the host. PD-L1 blockade may be used in conjunction with a collection of recombinant proteins and/or peptides expressed in a tumor in order to generate an immune response to these proteins. These proteins are normally viewed by the immune system as self antigens and are therefore tolerant to them. The tumor antigen may also include the protein telomerase, which is required for the synthesis of telomeres of chromosomes and which is expressed in more than 85% of human cancers and in only a limited number of somatic tissues (Kim, N et al., <i>Science, </i>266:2011-2013 (1994)). (These somatic tissues may be protected from immune attack by various means). Tumor antigen may also be “neo-antigens” expressed in cancer cells because of somatic mutations that alter protein sequence or create fusion proteins between two unrelated sequences (i.e., bcr-abl in the Philadelphia chromosome), or idiotype from B cell tumors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">Other tumor vaccines may include the proteins from viruses implicated in human cancers such a Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV), Hepatitis Viruses (HBV and HCV) and Kaposi's Herpes Sarcoma Virus (KHSV). Another form of tumor specific antigen which may be used in conjunction with PD-L1 blockade is purified heat shock proteins (HSP) isolated from the tumor tissue itself. These heat shock proteins contain fragments of proteins from the tumor cells and these HSPs are highly efficient at delivery to antigen presenting cells for eliciting tumor immunity (Suot, R. et al., <i>Science, </i>269:1585-1588 (1995); Tamura, Y. et al., <i>Science, </i>278:117-120 (1997)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen presenting cells that can be used to prime antigen-specific responses. DC's can be produced ex vivo and loaded with various protein and peptide antigens as well as tumor cell extracts (Nestle, F. et al., <i>Nat. Med., </i>4:328-332 (1998)). DCs may also be transduced by genetic means to express these tumor antigens as well. DCs have also been fused directly to tumor cells for the purposes of immunization (Kugler, A. et al., <i>Nat. Med., </i>6:332-336 (2000)). As a method of vaccination, DC immunization may be effectively combined with PD-L1 blockade to activate more potent anti-tumor responses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0222">PD-L1 blockade may also be combined with standard cancer treatments. PD-L1 blockade may be effectively combined with chemotherapeutic regimes. In these instances, it may be possible to reduce the dose of chemotherapeutic reagent administered (Mokyr, M. et al., <i>Cancer Res., </i>58:5301-5304 (1998)). An example of such a combination is a macrocyclic peptide in combination with decarbazine for the treatment of melanoma. Another example of such a combination is a macrocyclic peptide in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for the treatment of melanoma. The scientific rationale behind the combined use of PD-L1 blockade and chemotherapy is that cell death, that is a consequence of the cytotoxic action of most chemotherapeutic compounds, should result in increased levels of tumor antigen in the antigen presentation pathway. Other combination therapies that may result in synergy with PD-L1 blockade through cell death are radiation, surgery, and hormone deprivation. Each of these protocols creates a source of tumor antigen in the host. Angiogenesis inhibitors may also be combined with PD-L1 blockade. Inhibition of angiogenesis leads to tumor cell death which may feed tumor antigen into host antigen presentation pathways.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0223">PD-L1 blocking macrocyclic peptides can also be used in combination with bispecific macrocyclic peptides that target Fc alpha or Fc gamma receptor-expressing effectors cells to tumor cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,922,845 and 5,837,243). Bispecific macrocyclic peptides can be used to target two separate antigens. For example anti-Fc receptor/anti tumor antigen (e.g., Her-2/neu) bispecific macrocyclic peptides have been used to target macrophages to sites of tumor. This targeting may more effectively activate tumor specific responses. The T cell arm of these responses would be augmented by the use of PD-L1 blockade. Alternatively, antigen may be delivered directly to DCs by the use of bispecific macrocyclic peptides which bind to tumor antigen and a dendritic cell specific cell surface marker.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0224">Tumors evade host immune surveillance by a large variety of mechanisms. Many of these mechanisms may be overcome by the inactivation of proteins which are expressed by the tumors and which are immunosuppressive. These include among others TGF-beta (Kehrl, J. et al., <i>J. Exp. Med., </i>163:1037-1050 (1986)), IL-10 (Howard, M. et al., <i>Immunology Today, </i>13:198-200 (1992)), and Fas ligand (Hahne, M. et al., <i>Science, </i>274:1363-1365 (1996)). Macrocyclic peptides to each of these entities may be used in combination with anti-PD-L1 to counteract the effects of the immunosuppressive agent and favor tumor immune responses by the host.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0225">Other macrocyclic peptides which may be used to activate host immune responsiveness can be used in combination with anti-PD-L1. These include molecules on the surface of dendritic cells which activate DC function and antigen presentation. Anti-CD40 macrocyclic peptides are able to substitute effectively for T cell helper activity (Ridge, J. et al., <i>Nature, </i>393:474-478 (1998)) and can be used in conjunction with PD-1 antibodies (Ito, N. et al., <i>Immunobiology, </i>201(5):527-540 (2000)). Activating macrocyclic peptides to T cell costimulatory molecules such as CTLA-4 (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,097), OX-40 (Weinberg, A. et al., <i>Immunol., </i>164:2160-2169 (2000)), 4-1BB (Melero, I. et al., <i>Nat. Med., </i>3:682-685 (1997), and ICOS (Hutloff, A. et al., <i>Nature, </i>397:262-266 (1999)) may also provide for increased levels of T cell activation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0226">Bone marrow transplantation is currently being used to treat a variety of tumors of hematopoietic origin. While graft versus host disease is a consequence of this treatment, therapeutic benefit may be obtained from graft vs. tumor responses. PD-L1 blockade can be used to increase the effectiveness of the donor engrafted tumor specific T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0227">There are also several experimental treatment protocols that involve ex vivo activation and expansion of antigen specific T cells and adoptive transfer of these cells into recipients in order to antigen-specific T cells against tumor (Greenberg, R. et al., <i>Science, </i>285:546-551 (1999)). These methods may also be used to activate T cell responses to infectious agents such as CMV. Ex vivo activation in the presence of macrocyclic peptides may be expected to increase the frequency and activity of the adoptively transferred T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0228">Infectious Diseases</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0229">Other methods of the disclosure are used to treat patients that have been exposed to particular toxins or pathogens. Accordingly, another aspect of the disclosure provides a method of treating an infectious disease in a subject comprising administering to the subject a macrocyclic peptide of the present disclosure such that the subject is treated for the infectious disease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0230">Similar to its application to tumors as discussed above, PD-L1 blockade can be used alone, or as an adjuvant, in combination with vaccines, to stimulate the immune response to pathogens, toxins, and self-antigens. Examples of pathogens for which this therapeutic approach may be particularly useful, include pathogens for which there is currently no effective vaccine, or pathogens for which conventional vaccines are less than completely effective. These include, but are not limited to HIV, Hepatitis (A, B, and C), Influenza, Herpes, Giardia, Malaria (Butler, N. S. et al., <i>Nature Immunology </i>13, 188-195 (2012); Hafalla, J. C. R., et al. <i>PLOS Pathogens</i>; Feb. 2, 2012)), <i>Leishmania, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa</i>. PD-L1 blockade is particularly useful against established infections by agents such as HIV that present altered antigens over the course of the infections. These novel epitopes are recognized as foreign at the time of anti-human PD-L1 administration, thus provoking a strong T cell response that is not dampened by negative signals through PD-L1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0231">Some examples of pathogenic viruses causing infections treatable by methods of the disclosure include HIV, hepatitis (A, B, or C), herpes virus (e.g., VZV, HSV-1, HAV-6, HSV-II, and CMV, Epstein Barr virus), adenovirus, influenza virus, flaviviruses, echovirus, rhinovirus, coxsackie virus, cornovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, mumps virus, rotavirus, measles virus, rubella virus, parvovirus, vaccinia virus, HTLV virus, dengue virus, papillomavirus, molluscum virus, poliovirus, rabies virus, JC virus and arboviral encephalitis virus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">Some examples of pathogenic bacteria causing infections treatable by methods of the disclosure include <i>chlamydia</i>, rickettsial bacteria, mycobacteria, staphylococci, streptococci, pneumonococci, meningococci and conococci, <i>klebsiella, proteus, serratia, pseudomonas, legionella</i>, diphtheria, <i>salmonella</i>, bacilli, cholera, tetanus, botulism, anthrax, plague, leptospirosis, and Lyme disease bacteria.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0233">Some examples of pathogenic fungi causing infections treatable by methods of the disclosure include <i>Candida </i>(<i>albicans, krusei, glabrata, tropicalis</i>, etc.), <i>Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus </i>(<i>fumigatus, niger</i>, etc.), Genus <i>Mucorales </i>(<i>mucor, absidia, rhizophus</i>), <i>Sporothrix schenkii, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Coccidioides immitis </i>and <i>Histoplasma capsulatum. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">Some examples of pathogenic parasites causing infections treatable by methods of the disclosure include <i>Entamoeba histolytica, Balantidium coli, Naegleriafowleri, Acanthamoeba </i>sp., <i>Giardia lambia, Cryptosporidium </i>sp., <i>Pneumocystis carinii, Plasmodium vivax, Babesia microti, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania donovani, Toxoplasma gondi</i>, and <i>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">In all of the above methods, PD-L1 blockade can be combined with other forms of immunotherapy such as cytokine treatment (e.g., interferons, agents targeting VEGF activity or VEGF-receptors, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-2), or bispecific antibody therapy, which provides for enhanced presentation of tumor antigens (see, e.g., Holliger, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>90:6444-6448 (1993); Poljak, <i>Structure, </i>2:1121-1123 (1994)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236">Autoimmune Reactions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0237">The macrocyclic peptides may provoke and amplify autoimmune responses. Indeed, induction of anti-tumor responses using tumor cell and peptide vaccines reveals that many anti-tumor responses involve anti-self reactivities (depigmentation observed in anti-CTLA-4+GM-CSF-modified B 16 melanoma in van Elsas et al. supra; depigmentation in Trp-2 vaccinated mice (Overwijk, W. et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>96:2982-2987 (1999)); autoimmune prostatitis evoked by TRAMP tumor cell vaccines (Hurwitz, A., supra (2000)), melanoma peptide antigen vaccination and vitiligo observed in human clinical trials (Rosenberg, S. A. et al., <i>J. Immunother. Emphasis Tumor Immunol., </i>19(1):81-84 (1996)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">Therefore, it is possible to consider using anti-PD-L1 blockade in conjunction with various self proteins in order to devise vaccination protocols to efficiently generate immune responses against these self proteins for disease treatment. For example, Alzheimer's disease involves inappropriate accumulation of A.beta. peptide in amyloid deposits in the brain; antibody responses against amyloid are able to clear these amyloid deposits (Schenk et al., <i>Nature, </i>400:173-177 (1999)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0239">Other self proteins may also be used as targets such as IgE for the treatment of allergy and asthma, and TNF.alpha for rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, antibody responses to various hormones may be induced by the use of the macrocycles disclosed herein. Neutralizing antibody responses to reproductive hormones may be used for contraception. Neutralizing antibody response to hormones and other soluble factors that are required for the growth of particular tumors may also be considered as possible vaccination targets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0240">Analogous methods as described above for the use of anti-PD-L1 macrocycles can be used for induction of therapeutic autoimmune responses to treat patients having an inappropriate accumulation of other self-antigens, such as amyloid deposits, including A.beta. in Alzheimer's disease, cytokines such as TNF.alpha., and IgE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0241">Vaccines</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0242">The macrocyclic peptides may be used to stimulate antigen-specific immune responses by coadministration of an anti-PD-1 macrocycle with an antigen of interest (e.g., a vaccine). Accordingly, in another aspect the disclosure provides a method of enhancing an immune response to an antigen in a subject, comprising administering to the subject: (i) the antigen; and (ii) an anti-PD-1 macrocycle such that an immune response to the antigen in the subject is enhanced. The antigen can be, for example, a tumor antigen, a viral antigen, a bacterial antigen or an antigen from a pathogen. Non-limiting examples of such antigens include those discussed in the sections above, such as the tumor antigens (or tumor vaccines) discussed above, or antigens from the viruses, bacteria or other pathogens described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">Suitable routes of administering the compositions (e.g., macrocyclic peptides, multispecific and bispecific molecules and immunoconjugates) of the disclosure in vivo and in vitro are well known in the art and can be selected by those of ordinary skill. For example, the compositions can be administered by injection (e.g., intravenous or subcutaneous). Suitable dosages of the molecules used will depend on the age and weight of the subject and the concentration and/or formulation of the composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">As previously described the macrocyclic peptides of the disclosure can be co-administered with one or other more therapeutic agents, e.g., a cytotoxic agent, a radiotoxic agent or an immunosuppressive agent. The peptide can be linked to the agent (as an immunocomplex) or can be administered separate from the agent. In the latter case (separate administration), the peptide can be administered before, after or concurrently with the agent or can be co-administered with other known therapies, e.g., an anti-cancer therapy, e.g., radiation. Such therapeutic agents include, among others, anti-neoplastic agents such as doxorubicin (adriamycin), cisplatin bleomycin sulfate, carmustine, chlorambucil, decarbazine and cyclophosphamide hydroxyurea which, by themselves, are only effective at levels which are toxic or subtoxic to a patient. Cisplatin is intravenously administered as a 100 mg/dose once every four weeks and adriamycin is intravenously administered as a 60-75 mg/ml dose once every 21 days. Co-administration of the macrocyclic peptides of the present disclosure with chemotherapeutic agents provides two anti-cancer agents which operate via different mechanisms which yield a cytotoxic effect to human tumor cells. Such co-administration can solve problems due to development of resistance to drugs or a change in the antigenicity of the tumor cells which would render them unreactive with the peptides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">Also within the scope of the present disclosure are kits comprising the compositions of the disclosure (e.g., macrocyclic peptides, bispecific or multispecific molecules, or immunoconjugates) and instructions for use. The kit can further contain at least one additional reagent, or one or more additional macrocyclic peptides of the disclosure (e.g., a human antibody having a complementary activity which binds to an epitope in PD-L1 antigen distinct from the macrocycle). Kits typically include a label indicating the intended use of the contents of the kit. The term label includes any writing, or recorded material supplied on or with the kit, or which otherwise accompanies the kit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">Combination Therapy</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">The combination of the macrocyclic peptides of the present disclosure with another PD-L1 antagonist and/or other immunomodulator is useful for enhancement of an immune response against a hyperproliferative disease. For example, these molecules can be administered to cells in culture, in vitro or ex vivo, or to human subjects, e.g., in vivo, to enhance immunity in a variety of situations. Accordingly, in one aspect, the disclosure provides a method of modifying an immune response in a subject comprising administering to the subject a macrocyclic peptide of the disclosure such that the immune response in the subject is modified. Preferably, the response is enhanced, stimulated or up-regulated. In another embodiment, the instant disclosure provides a method of altering adverse events associated with treatment of a hyperproliferative disease with an immunostimulatory therapeutic agent, comprising administering a macrocyclic peptide of the present disclosure and a subtherapeutic dose of another immunomodulator to a subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">Blockade of PD-L1 by macrocyclic peptides can enhance the immune response to cancerous cells in the patient. Cancers whose growth may be inhibited using the macrocyclic peptides of the instant disclosure include cancers typically responsive to immunotherapy. Representative examples of cancers for treatment with the combination therapy of the instant disclosure include melanoma (e.g., metastatic malignant melanoma), renal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer and lung cancer. Examples of other cancers that may be treated using the methods of the instant disclosure include bone cancer, pancreatic cancer, skin cancer, cancer of the head or neck, cutaneous or intraocular malignant melanoma, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, rectal cancer, cancer of the anal region, stomach cancer, testicular cancer, uterine cancer, carcinoma of the fallopian tubes, carcinoma of the endometrium, carcinoma of the cervix, carcinoma of the vagina, carcinoma of the vulva, Hodgkin's Disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the small intestine, cancer of the endocrine system, cancer of the thyroid gland, cancer of the parathyroid gland, cancer of the adrenal gland, sarcoma of soft tissue, cancer of the urethra, cancer of the penis, chronic or acute leukemias including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, solid tumors of childhood, lymphocytic lymphoma, cancer of the bladder, cancer of the kidney or ureter, carcinoma of the renal pelvis, neoplasm of the central nervous system (CNS), primary CNS lymphoma, tumor angiogenesis, spinal axis tumor, brain stem glioma, pituitary adenoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, epidermoid cancer, squamous cell cancer, T-cell lymphoma, environmentally induced cancers including those induced by asbestos, and combinations of said cancers. The present disclosure is also useful for treatment of metastatic cancers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">In certain embodiments, the combination of therapeutic agents containing at least one macrocyclic peptide discussed herein may be administered concurrently as a single composition in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, or concurrently as separate compositions wherein each agent can be administered sequentially. For example, a second immunomodulator and a macrocyclic peptide of the present disclosure can be administered sequentially, such as the second immunomodulator administered first and the macrocyclic peptide second, or the macrocyclic peptide being administered first and the second immunomodulator second. Furthermore, if more than one dose of the combination therapy is administered sequentially, the order of the sequential administration can be reversed or kept in the same order at each time point of administration, sequential administrations may be combined with concurrent administrations, or any combination thereof. For example, the first administration of a second immunomodulator and the macrocyclic peptide may be concurrent, the second administration may be sequential with the second immunomodulator first and the macrocyclic peptide second, and the third administration may be sequential with the macrocyclic peptide first and second immunomodulator second, etc. Another representative dosing scheme may involve a first administration that is sequential with the macrocyclic peptide first and the second immunomodulator second, and subsequent administrations may be concurrent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">Optionally, the combination of the macrocyclic peptide and a second immunomodulator can be further combined with an immunogenic agent, such as cancerous cells, purified tumor antigens (including recombinant proteins, peptides, and carbohydrate molecules), cells, and cells transfected with genes encoding immune stimulating cytokines (He et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>173:4919-4928 (2004)). Non-limiting examples of tumor vaccines that can be used include peptides of melanoma antigens, such as peptides of gp100, MAGE antigens, Trp-2, MART1 and/or tyrosinase, or tumor cells transfected to express the cytokine GM-CSF (discussed further below).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">A combined PD-L1 macrocyclic peptide and a second immunomodulator can be further combined with a vaccination protocol. Many experimental strategies for vaccination against tumors have been devised (see Rosenberg, S., Development of Cancer Vaccines, ASCO Educational Book Spring: 60-62 (2000); Logothetis, C., ASCO Educational Book Spring: 300-302 (2000); Khayat, D., ASCO Educational Book Spring: 414-428 (2000); Foon, K., ASCO Educational Book Spring: 730-738 (2000); see also Restifo et al., Cancer Vaccines, Chapter 61, pp. 3023-3043 in DeVita et al., eds., <i>Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology</i>, Fifth Edition (1997)). In one of these strategies, a vaccine is prepared using autologous or allogeneic tumor cells. These cellular vaccines have been shown to be most effective when the tumor cells are transduced to express GM-CSF. GM-CSF has been shown to be a potent activator of antigen presentation for tumor vaccination (Dranoff et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>90:3539-3543 (1993)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">The study of gene expression and large scale gene expression patterns in various tumors has led to the definition of so called tumor specific antigens (Rosenberg, <i>Immunity, </i>10:281-287 (1999)). In many cases, these tumor specific antigens are differentiation antigens expressed in the tumors and in the cell from which the tumor arose, for example melanocyte antigens gp100, MAGE antigens, and Trp-2. More importantly, many of these antigens can be shown to be the targets of tumor specific T cells found in the host. In certain embodiments, a combined PD-L1 macrocyclic peptide and a second immunomodulator may be used in conjunction with a collection of recombinant proteins and/or peptides expressed in a tumor in order to generate an immune response to these proteins. These proteins are normally viewed by the immune system as self-antigens and are, therefore, tolerant to them. The tumor antigen may also include the protein telomerase, which is required for the synthesis of telomeres of chromosomes and which is expressed in more than 85% of human cancers and in only a limited number of somatic tissues (Kim et al., <i>Science, </i>266:2011-2013 (1994)). (These somatic tissues may be protected from immune attack by various means). Tumor antigen may also be “neo-antigens” expressed in cancer cells because of somatic mutations that alter protein sequence or create fusion proteins between two unrelated sequences (i.e., bcr-abl in the Philadelphia chromosome), or idiotype from B cell tumors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">Other tumor vaccines may include the proteins from viruses implicated in human cancers such a Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV), Hepatitis Viruses (HBV and HCV) and Kaposi's Herpes Sarcoma Virus (KHSV). Another form of tumor specific antigen which may be used in conjunction with PD-L1 macrocyclic peptide blockade is purified heat shock proteins (HSP) isolated from the tumor tissue itself. These heat shock proteins contain fragments of proteins from the tumor cells and these HSPs are highly efficient at delivery to antigen presenting cells for eliciting tumor immunity (Suot et al., <i>Science, </i>269:1585-1588 (1995); Tamura et al., <i>Science, </i>278:117-120 (1997)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen presenting cells that can be used to prime antigen-specific responses. DC's can be produced ex vivo and loaded with various protein and peptide antigens as well as tumor cell extracts (Nestle et al., <i>Nat. Med., </i>4:328-332 (1998)). DCs may also be transduced by genetic means to express these tumor antigens as well. DCs have also been fused directly to tumor cells for the purposes of immunization (Kugler et al., <i>Nat. Med., </i>6:332-336 (2000)). As a method of vaccination, DC immunization may be effectively further combined with a combined anti-PD-L1 macrocyclic peptide and a second immunomodulator to activate more potent anti-tumor responses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">A combined anti-PD-L1 macrocyclic peptide and additional immunomodulator may also be further combined with standard cancer treatments. For example, a combination of a macrocyclic peptide and a second immunomodulator may be effectively combined with chemotherapeutic regimes. In these instances, as is observed with the combination of a macrocyclic peptide and a second immunomodulator, it may be possible to reduce the dose of other chemotherapeutic reagent administered with the combination of the instant disclosure (Mokyr et al., <i>Cancer Res., </i>58:5301-5304 (1998)). An example of such a combination is a combination of a macrocyclic peptide and a second immunomodulator further in combination with decarbazine for the treatment of melanoma. Another example is a combination of a macrocyclic peptide and a second immunomodulatory agent further in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for the treatment of melanoma. The scientific rationale behind the combined use of PD-L1 macrocyclic peptide and another immunomodulator with chemotherapy is that cell death, which is a consequence of the cytotoxic action of most chemotherapeutic compounds, should result in increased levels of tumor antigen in the antigen presentation pathway. Other combination therapies that may result in synergy with a combined anti-PD-L1 macrocyclic peptide and additional immunomodulator through cell death include radiation, surgery, or hormone deprivation. Each of these protocols creates a source of tumor antigen in the host. Angiogenesis inhibitors may also be combined with a combined PD-L1 and second immunomodulator. Inhibition of angiogenesis leads to tumor cell death, which may also be a source of tumor antigen to be fed into host antigen presentation pathways.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">A combination of PD-L1 and another immunomodulator can also be used in combination with bispecific macrocyclic peptides that target Fc.alpha. or Fc.gamma. receptor-expressing effector cells to tumor cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,922,845 and 5,837,243). Bispecific macrocyclic peptides can be used to target two separate antigens. For example anti-Fc receptor/anti tumor antigen (e.g., Her-2/neu) bispecific macrocyclic peptides have been used to target macrophages to sites of tumor. This targeting may more effectively activate tumor specific responses. The T cell arm of these responses would be augmented by the use of a combined PD-L1 and a second immunomodulator. Alternatively, antigen may be delivered directly to DCs by the use of bispecific macrocyclic peptides which bind to tumor antigen and a dendritic cell specific cell surface marker.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">In another example, a combination of a macrocyclic peptide and a second immunomodulator can be used in conjunction with anti-neoplastic macrocyclic agents, such as RITUXAN® (rituximab), HERCEPTIN® (trastuzumab), BEXXAR® (tositumomab), ZEVALIN® (ibritumomab), CAMPATH® (alemtuzumab), Lymphocide (eprtuzumab), AVASTIN® (bevacizumab), and TARCEVA® (erlotinib), and the like. By way of example and not wishing to be bound by theory, treatment with an anti-cancer antibody or an anti-cancer antibody conjugated to a toxin can lead to cancer cell death (e.g., tumor cells) which would potentiate an immune response mediated by the second immunomodulator target or PD-L1. In an exemplary embodiment, a treatment of a hyperproliferative disease (e.g., a cancer tumor) may include an anti-cancer antibody in combination with a macrocyclic peptide and a second immunomodulator concurrently or sequentially or any combination thereof, which may potentiate an anti-tumor immune responses by the host.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">Tumors evade host immune surveillance by a large variety of mechanisms. Many of these mechanisms may be overcome by the inactivation of proteins, which are expressed by the tumors and which are immunosuppressive. These include, among others, TGF-.beta. (Kehrl, J. et al., <i>J. Exp. Med., </i>163:1037-1050 (1986)), IL-10 (Howard, M. et al., <i>Immunology Today, </i>13:198-200 (1992)), and Fas ligand (Hahne, M. et al., <i>Science, </i>274:1363-1365 (1996)). In another example, antibodies to each of these entities may be further combined with a macrocyclic peptide and another immunomodulator to counteract the effects of immunosuppressive agents and favor anti-tumor immune responses by the host.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">Other agents that may be used to activate host immune responsiveness can be further used in combination with a macrocyclic peptide of the present disclosure. These include molecules on the surface of dendritic cells that activate DC function and antigen presentation. Anti-CD40 macrocyclic peptides are able to substitute effectively for T cell helper activity (Ridge, J. et al., <i>Nature, </i>393:474-478 (1998)) and can be used in conjunction with the macrocyclic peptides of the present disclosure, either alone or in combination with an anti-CTLA-4 combination (Ito, N. et al., <i>Immunobiology, </i>201(5):527-540 (2000)). Activating macrocyclic peptides to T cell costimulatory molecules, such as OX-40 (Weinberg, A. et al., <i>Immunol., </i>164:2160-2169 (2000)), 4-1BB (Melero, I. et al., <i>Nat. Med., </i>3:682-685 (1997), and ICOS (Hutloff, A. et al., <i>Nature, </i>397:262-266 (1999)) may also provide for increased levels of T cell activation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">Bone marrow transplantation is currently being used to treat a variety of tumors of hematopoietic origin. While graft versus host disease is a consequence of this treatment, therapeutic benefit may be obtained from graft vs. tumor responses. A macrocyclic peptide of the present disclosure, either alone or in combination with another immunomodulator, can be used to increase the effectiveness of the donor engrafted tumor specific T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">There are also several experimental treatment protocols that involve ex vivo activation and expansion of antigen specific T cells and adoptive transfer of these cells into recipients in order to antigen-specific T cells against tumor (Greenberg, R. et al., <i>Science, </i>285:546-551 (1999)). These methods may also be used to activate T cell responses to infectious agents such as CMV. Ex vivo activation in the presence a macrocyclic peptide of the present disclosure, either alone or in combination with another immunomodulator, may be expected to increase the frequency and activity of the adoptively transferred T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides a method for altering an adverse event associated with treatment of a hyperproliferative disease with an immunostimulatory agent, comprising administering a macrocyclic peptide of the present disclosure in combination with a subtherapeutic dose of another immunomodulator to a subject. For example, the methods of the present disclosure provide for a method of reducing the incidence of immunostimulatory therapeutic antibody-induced colitis or diarrhea by administering a non-absorbable steroid to the patient. Because any patient who will receive an immunostimulatory therapeutic antibody is at risk for developing colitis or diarrhea induced by such treatment, this entire patient population is suitable for therapy according to the methods of the present disclosure. Although steroids have been administered to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and prevent exacerbations of IBD, they have not been used to prevent (decrease the incidence of) IBD in patients who have not been diagnosed with IBD. The significant side effects associated with steroids, even non-absorbable steroids, have discouraged prophylactic use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">In further embodiments, a macrocyclic peptide of the present disclosure, either alone or in combination with another immunomodulator, can be further combined with the use of any non-absorbable steroid. As used herein, a “non-absorbable steroid” is a glucocorticoid that exhibits extensive first pass metabolism such that, following metabolism in the liver, the bioavailability of the steroid is low, i.e., less than about 20%. In one embodiment of the disclosure, the non-absorbable steroid is budesonide. Budesonide is a locally-acting glucocorticosteroid, which is extensively metabolized, primarily by the liver, following oral administration. ENTOCORT® EC (Astra-Zeneca) is a pH- and time-dependent oral formulation of budesonide developed to optimize drug delivery to the ileum and throughout the colon. ENTOCORT® EC is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of mild to moderate Crohn's disease involving the ileum and/or ascending colon. The usual oral dosage of ENTOCORT® EC for the treatment of Crohn's disease is 6 to 9 mg/day. ENTOCORT® EC is released in the intestines before being absorbed and retained in the gut mucosa. Once it passes through the gut mucosa target tissue, ENTOCORT® EC is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver to metabolites with negligible glucocorticoid activity. Therefore, the bioavailability is low (about 10%). The low bioavailability of budesonide results in an improved therapeutic ratio compared to other glucocorticoids with less extensive first-pass metabolism. Budesonide results in fewer adverse effects, including less hypothalamic-pituitary suppression, than systemically-acting corticosteroids. However, chronic administration of ENTOCORT® EC can result in systemic glucocorticoid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression. See <i>Physicians' Desk Reference Supplement, </i>58th Edition, 608-610 (2004).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">In still further embodiments, a combination PD-L1 and another immunomodulator in conjunction with a non-absorbable steroid can be further combined with a salicylate. Salicylates include 5-ASA agents such as, for example: sulfasalazine (AZULFIDINE®, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn); olsalazine (DIPENTUM®, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn); balsalazide (COLAZAL®, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.); and mesalamine (ASACOL®, Procter &amp; Gamble Pharmaceuticals; PENTASA®, Shire US; CANASA®, Axcan Scandipharm, Inc.; ROWASA®, Solvay).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">Dosage and Formulation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">A suitable peptide of Formula I, or more specifically a macrocyclic peptide described herein, can be administered to patients to treat diabetes and other related diseases as the compound alone and or mixed with an acceptable carrier in the form of pharmaceutical formulations.

It should be understood that the compounds encompassed by the present disclosure are those that are suitably stable for use as pharmaceutical agent.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0299" num="0298">Chemical synthesis of a macrocyclic peptide of the present disclosure can be carried out using a variety of art recognized methods, including stepwise solid phase synthesis, semi-synthesis through the conformationally-assisted re-ligation of peptide fragments, enzymatic ligation of cloned or synthetic peptide segments, and chemical ligation. A preferred method to synthesize the macrocyclic peptides and analogs thereof described herein is chemical synthesis using various solid-phase techniques such as those described in Chan, W. C. et al., eds., <i>Fmoc Solid Phase Synthesis</i>, Oxford University Press, Oxford (2000); Barany, G. et al., <i>The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology</i>, Vol. 2: “Special Methods in Peptide Synthesis, Part A”, pp. 3-284, Gross, E. et al., eds., Academic Press, New York (1980); and in Stewart, J. M. et al., <i>Solid</i>-<i>Phase Peptide Synthesis, </i>2nd Edition, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill. (1984). The preferred strategy is based on the Fmoc (9-Fluorenylmethyl methyl-oxycarbonyl) group for temporary protection of the α-amino group, in combination with the tert-butyl group for temporary protection of the amino acid side chains (see for example Atherton, E. et al., “The Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl Amino Protecting Group”, in <i>The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology</i>, Vol. 9: “Special Methods in Peptide Synthesis, Part C”, pp. 1-38, Undenfriend, S. et al., eds., Academic Press, San Diego (1987).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0300" num="0299">The peptides can be synthesized in a stepwise manner on an insoluble polymer support (also referred to as “resin”) starting from the C-terminus of the peptide. A synthesis is begun by appending the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide to the resin through formation of an amide or ester linkage. This allows the eventual release of the resulting peptide as a C-terminal amide or carboxylic acid, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0301" num="0300">The C-terminal amino acid and all other amino acids used in the synthesis are required to have their α-amino groups and side chain functionalities (if present) differentially protected such that the α-amino protecting group may be selectively removed during the synthesis. The coupling of an amino acid is performed by activation of its carboxyl group as an active ester and reaction thereof with the unblocked α-amino group of the N-terminal amino acid appended to the resin. The sequence of α-amino group deprotection and coupling is repeated until the entire peptide sequence is assembled. The peptide is then released from the resin with concomitant deprotection of the side chain functionalities, usually in the presence of appropriate scavengers to limit side reactions. The resulting peptide is finally purified by reverse phase HPLC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0302" num="0301">The synthesis of the peptidyl-resins required as precursors to the final peptides utilizes commercially available cross-linked polystyrene polymer resins (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). Preferred solid supports are: 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxyacetyl-p-methyl benzhydrylamine resin (Rink amide MBHA resin); 9-Fmoc-amino-xanthen-3-yloxy-Merrifield resin (Sieber amide resin); 4-(9-Fmoc)aminomethyl-3,5-dimethoxyphenoxy)valeryl-aminomethyl-Merrifield resin (PAL resin), for C-terminal carboxamides. Coupling of first and subsequent amino acids can be accomplished using HOBt, 6-Cl-HOBt or HOAt active esters produced from DIC/HOBt, HBTU/HOBt, BOP, PyBOP, or from DIC/6-Cl-HOBt, HCTU, DIC/HOAt or HATU, respectively. Preferred solid supports are: 2-Chlorotrityl chloride resin and 9-Fmoc-amino-xanthen-3-yloxy-Merrifield resin (Sieber amide resin) for protected peptide fragments. Loading of the first amino acid onto the 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin is best achieved by reacting the Fmoc-protected amino acid with the resin in dichloromethane and DIEA. If necessary, a small amount of DMF may be added to facilitate dissolution of the amino acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0303" num="0302">The syntheses of the peptide analogs described herein can be carried out by using a single or multi-channel peptide synthesizer, such as an CEM Liberty Microwave synthesizer, or a Protein Technologies, Inc. Prelude (6 channels) or Symphony (12 channels) synthesizer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0303">The peptidyl-resin precursors for their respective peptides may be cleaved and deprotected using any standard procedure (see, for example, King, D. S. et al., Int. <i>J. Peptide Protein Res., </i>36:255-266 (1990)). A desired method is the use of TFA in the presence of water and TIS as scavengers. Typically, the peptidyl-resin is stirred in TFA/water/TIS (94:3:3, v:v:v; 1 mL/100 mg of peptidyl resin) for 2-6 hrs at room temperature. The spent resin is then filtered off and the TFA solution is concentrated or dried under reduced pressure. The resulting crude peptide is either precipitated and washed with Et<sub>2</sub>O or is redissolved directly into DMSO or 50% aqueous acetic acid for purification by preparative HPLC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0304">Peptides with the desired purity can be obtained by purification using preparative HPLC, for example, on a Waters Model 4000 or a Shimadzu Model LC-8A liquid chromatograph. The solution of crude peptide is injected into a YMC S5 ODS (20×100 mm) column and eluted with a linear gradient of MeCN in water, both buffered with 0.1% TFA, using a flow rate of 14-20 mL/min with effluent monitoring by UV absorbance at 220 nm. The structures of the purified peptides can be confirmed by electro-spray MS analysis.</div>

The remaining reagents are added through the bottom of the tube and pass up through the frit to contact the resin. All solutions are removed through the bottom of the tube. “Periodic agitation” describes a brief pulse of N2 gas through the bottom frit; the pulse lasts approximately 5 seconds and occurs every 30 seconds.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0318">The procedures describe an experiment performed on a 0.100 mmol scale, where the scale is determined by the amount of 2-chlorotrityl linker bound to the resin. Commercial Fmoc-Gly-2-chlorotrityl resin was used, usually as a 0.92 meq/g loading. This scale corresponds to approximately 109 mg of the Fmoc-Gly-2-chlorotrityl resin described above. Prior to amino acid coupling, all peptide synthesis sequences began with a resin-swelling procedure, described below as “Resin-swelling procedure”. Coupling of amino acids to a primary amine N-terminus used the “Single-coupling procedure” described below. Coupling of amino acids to a secondary amine N-terminus used the “Double-coupling procedure” described below. Coupling of chloroacetylchloride to the N-terminus of the peptide is described by the “Chloroacetyl chloride coupling procedure” detailed below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0388" num="0387">The synthesis was conducted by the attached general method on a 0.20 mmol scale (2×0.1 mmol). Double-coupling (procedure B) was used when a secondary amine at the N-terminus was encountered (denoted with an underlined residue). The sequence was: ClAc-Tyr-mAla-Asn-Pro-Dap-Leu-Hyp-Trp-Gly-Trp-mNle-mNle-Leu-Cys-Sarc. The peptide was cleaved from the Rink resin following the TFA/phenol/water/iPr3SiH cocktail and precipitation/washing in ether procedures described above. The resulting material was cyclized by taking the material up in MeOH (˜20 mL) and adding 4-6 drops of Hunig's base (pH ˜11). After sitting at rt overnight, the crude material was obtained by removal of the solvent via rotary evaporation. The crude material was purified via preparative LC/MS with the following conditions: Column: XBridge C18, 19×200 mm, 5-μm particles; Mobile Phase A: 5:95 methanol: water with 10-mM ammonium acetate; Mobile Phase B: 95:5 methanol: water with 10-mM ammonium acetate; Gradient: 50-90% B over 30 minutes, then a 5-minute hold at 100% B; Flow: 20 mL/min.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0425" num="0424">The synthesis was conducted by the attached general method using 0.2 mmol Rink resin. Double-coupling (procedure B) was used when a secondary amine at the N-terminus was encountered (denoted with an underlined residue). The sequence was: ClAc-Tyr-mAla-Asn-Pro-Dap-Leu-Hyp-Trp-Gly-Trp-mNle-mNle-Leu-Cys-Sar. The peptide was cleaved from the resin following the TFA/phenol/water/iPr3SiH cocktail and precipitation/washing in ether procedures described above. The resulting material was cyclized by taking the material up in MeOH (˜20 mL) and adding 4-6 drops of Hunig's base (pH ˜11). After sitting at rt overnight, the crude material was obtained by removal of the solvent via rotary evaporation. The crude material was purified via preparative LC/MS with the following conditions: Column: XBridge C18, 19×200 mm, 5-μm particles; Mobile Phase A: 5:95 methanol: water with 10-mM ammonium acetate; Mobile Phase B: 95:5 methanol: water with 10-mM ammonium acetate; Gradient: 50-90% B over 30 minutes, then a 5-minute hold at 100% B; Flow: 20 mL/min. Fractions containing the desired product were combined and dried via centrifugal evaporation. The yield of the product was 36.4 mg, and its estimated purity by LCMS analysis was 95%.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0430" num="0429">Homogenous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) Assays of Binding of Soluble PD-1 to Soluble PD-L1. Soluble PD-1 and soluble PD-L1 refers to proteins with carboxyl-end truncations that remove the transmembrane-spanning regions and are fused to heterologous sequences, specifically the Fc portion of the human immunoglobuling G sequence (Ig) or the hexahistidine epitope tag (His). All binding studies were performed in an HTRF assay buffer consisting of dPBS supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20. For the PD-1-Ig/PD-L1-His binding assay, inhibitors were pre-incubated with PD-L1-His (10 nM final) for 15 m in 4 μl of assay buffer, followed by addition of PD-1-Ig (20 nM final) in 1 μl of assay buffer and further incubation for 15 m. PD-L1 fusion proteins from either human, cynomologous macaques, mouse, or other species were used. HTRF detection was achieved using europium crypate-labeled anti-Ig monoclonal antibody (1 nM final) and allophycocyanin (APC) labeled anti-His monoclonal antibody (20 nM final). Antibodies were diluted in HTRF detection buffer and 5 μl was dispensed on top of binding reaction. The reaction was allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes and signal (665 nm/620 nm ratio) was obtained using an EnVision fluorometer. Additional binding assays were established between PD-1-Ig/PD-L2-His (20 and 5 nM, respectively), CD80-His/PD-L1-Ig (100 and 10 nM, respectively) and CD80-His/CTLA4-Ig (10 and 5 nM, respectively). Binding/competition studies between biotinylated Compound No. 71 and human PD-L1-His were performed as follows. Macrocyclic peptide inhibitors were pre-incubated with PD-L1-His (10 nM final) for 60 minutes in 4 μl of assay buffer followed by addition of biotinylated Compound No. 71 (0.5 nM final) in 1 μl of assay buffer. Binding was allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes followed by addition of europium crypated labeled Streptavidin (2.5 pM final) and APC-labeled anti-His (20 nM final) in 5 μl of HTRF buffer. The reaction was allowed to equilibrate for 30 m and signal (665 nm/620 nm ratio) was obtained using an EnVision fluorometer.</div>
