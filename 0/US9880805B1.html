<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This is the first patent application filed for this invention.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present patent application relates to the field of music players and/or music streaming systems.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Playing music while doing an exercise or workout routine, such as jogging, cycling, skating, weight training and orbital trainers is common and can be very motivational.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">When selecting music for exercise in a music player known in the art, the beginning of many songs may have long, low volume, slower beat introduction portions or tempo which are not as suitable for exercising. The end portion of many songs also have slow fading out volume with a two second gap of silence. The change of tempo between songs may also be counterproductive to the progress of a workout routine. These disruptions between each new song in the playback creates an undesirable detrimental effect on the flow of the workout. Additionally, due to the differences in recording techniques, each song usually has a different level of audio volume, bass, and treble. While exercising, having first listened to a song playing clear sharp and loud, if the next song plays low volume and muffled, the beneficial effect of that song's playback is diminished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Some music players allow the user to manually set the start and stop positions of a song's playback, but, have no means of distributing and sharing the start and stop position settings for public use in an exercise environment. These players do not have the ability to deal with sophisticated loop sequences, or, handle multiple sets of settings for each song creating multiple alternate length playback times. Most users do not have the time or set of skills to do this themselves for every song in their workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need for a system to improve the enjoyment and beneficial effect of listening to music while exercising.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Applicant has discovered that the ability of music to motivate a user doing fitness training is improved when the choice of music recording titles is made by the user (either a direct choice of titles, or indirectly by a choice of genre), and the music has a duration and musical intensity level that correspond to a workout regime that involves variable exercise activities or burn levels. For a given workout regime, it may be possible to play selected original musical recordings together in a way that matches the workout regime, however, the possible selection of original musical recordings that will have the desirable characteristics of length and intensity is far too limited (if available at all).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Applicant has discovered that the duration of a musical recording in a stream of workout music may be lengthened or shortened without altering the tempo, the beats per minute, of the musical recording. The musical recording may be shortened or lengthened by selecting from a predefined set of song sequences, where each of these song sequences are composed of segments of an original musical recording with arranged, repeated or deleted portions of the given musical recording for providing lengthened or shortened sequences of the musical recording in the stream of workout music. This provides a shorter or longer version of the musical recording that would be abbreviated or would involve repetition of song segments, however, the sound of the musical recording title remains the same. The importance of length adjustment is to allow a given song to match a segment or phase of a workout regime.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">Overview</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">A workout lasts typically between 10 and 60 minutes, although different durations are possible. It is desirable that the music played during a workout is appreciated by the user and motivates the user to pursue the workout to its completion. Music can be very motivational, and as described above with reference to the prior art, music that is motivational for the person doing the workout (i.e. the user), can end or change tempo at times that are counter-productive for the given workout. Accordingly, in the embodiments described below, songs chosen to be played during the workout are edited to be of a length that is different from the original length of the songs so that the combined playtime of the edited songs matches or comes close to the desired workout time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">A workout typically involves a variation in intensity of the physical activity, and this is called herein burn and non-burn portions. “Burn” refers to an exertion period that cannot normally be maintained very long and a burn period should end before the user is exhausted from the exertion period. “Non-burn”, “Low Burn” or “Recovery” periods or portions are periods of exercise and effort, however, these effort levels may be maintained for a much longer period of time. At the end of a workout, a “cool down” period can also be provided, just as a “warm up” period can be provided at the beginning of a workout. For a jogging workout, the cool down and warm up periods can involve walking, for example. The sequence of variations in intensity is called the “exercise burn rate pattern”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the user selects a workout style and song titles corresponding to songs that should be played in accordance with the workout style. The workout duration is the sum of the playtimes of each song chosen for the workout. A choice is made regarding the length of each original musical recording of the songs to be played. The chosen original musical recordings are edited in length so that the total length of play of all songs corresponds exactly or closely to the user selected duration of the workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The burn rate can change over the course of the workout in a variety of workout styles. As an example of a workout style, the songs can be chosen to be burn songs or non-burn songs, and the equalization of the music is changed from song to song to reflect the burn rate. In other workout styles described below, equalization is changed within songs in accordance with the changes in the burn rate. While the workout style might suggest a change in burn rate at a specific point in time, the change in equalization of the music corresponding to the change in burn rate can be done at an appropriate time in the music. For example, this can be the change from refrain to verse (or vice versa). This can result in a lengthening or shortening of a particular burn rate portion of the workout music. If waiting for a refrain/verse transition would cause too significant a change in the length of the burn rate portion, the transition can be done between any suitable lyric line or change in the music itself (for example before a change in instrument being played, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In the embodiments described below, the song editing and/or the burn rate transition points can be predetermined for each predetermined duration of the edited song recording. Because the desired variations in duration and exercise burn rate patterns are many, the predetermined variations in song edit data can require a great number of specific sequences of song edit data that represent what song segments to play and in what order, with the associated equalization variations during the play of the edited version of the original musical recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Although, the presently preferred embodiments involve defining the specific sequence and equalization change data for each edited song duration and exercise burn rate pattern type, alternatively, all of the potential transition points for duration editing and exercise burn rate pattern variation can be defined for an original musical recording, along with the nature or type of each defined segment, where this information may be included in the song edit data. In this way, the computer can determine how to play in a determined order various segments of an original musical recording to provide an edited version of the original musical recording having at least approximately the desired duration along with suitable equalization variations corresponding to the desired exercise burn rate pattern. This approach employs, for instance, the song edit data, to provide dynamically generated potential transition points and song segment type data for the original musical recording corresponding to a song title.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In Table 1 below, there are 12 duration groups of song edit data for an original musical recording that has an original duration of 4 minutes and 48 seconds. The 12 durations span from 3:01.4 to 8:42.7. As can be seen, for each duration group of the original musical recording, the song edit data specifies the fade in range and the fade out range. These are intro and outro portions of the edited song recordings that can be trimmed at playback time to better fit the song length to the desired play time for the edited song recording within the workout. The song edit data specifies which portions of the original musical recording should be played and in what sequence. In Table 1, no time gap exists between the longest playtime of one duration group and the shortest playtime of the next duration group, as there is overlap. It will be understood that a small time gap between duration groups may be permitted.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, Sequence #3 involves playing only two segments, namely from 0:00.0 to 1:19.7 and 2:10.1 to 4:44.0. The edited song duration is now 3:53.1, shortened from the original 4:48.0. The fade in range for the edited song recording is specified as 0:00.0 to 0:27.0, and the fade out range from 3:44.1 to 3:53.1. This means that the play of the edited song recording (Sequence #3) can be delayed as late as 0:27 into the edited song recording, and can be ended as early as 3:44.1 into the edited song duration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in table 2, Sequence #5 also includes a set of equalization parameters for a number of workout styles. In the aerobic workout style, time ranges within the edited song recording are identified as belonging to one of four different classes. It will be appreciated that fewer or more classes can be used. The classes identified are (1) low burn, (2) medium burn, (3) high burn and (4) optimum time to end the workout, the latter being a marker that separates the final high burn and the outro or coda section that is classed as a low burn. The high burn class can also be split into high burn and final burn, the latter having a volume that is the greatest. These classes represent equalization presets that cause the edited song recording to have a variable volume, and possibly a variable treble, mid or bass level, for the interval of the edit song recording. The intervals shown in the table may correspond to chorus and verse portions of the edited song recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Sequence #5 also includes a set of equalization parameters for High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) workout style with 10 second intervals. In this style, the equalization is varied between medium and high burn in approximately 10 second intervals over the edited song recording. The same classes are identified as for the aerobic workout style, and of course, the classes could be greater or fewer in number. The transitions between the roughly 10 second intervals are chosen to coincide with suitable points in the music, such as lyrical phrase end/beginnings, changes in music rhythm or instrumentation, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the user selects a workout duration, a workout style and a selection of songs. The computer then uses song edit data, as for example the data in Table 1, to select the arrangements of song segments (i.e. the Sequences) that allow the selection of edited song recordings to fit within the workout duration. The workout style is then used to select the sets of equalization parameters for each of the edited song recordings, as well as appropriate exercise burn rate patterns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Table 2 is an example of information contained in exemplary song edit data relating to the equalization parameters over time position for possible workout styles that may be selected by the user. Each possible arrangement of song segments (such as sequences 1 to 12) of Table 1 may have corresponding equalization parameters song edit data for each possible workout style that may be selected by a user. The equalization parameters song edit data of Table 2A to 2L relate to Sequence 5 of the sequences described in Table 1, and Table 2M relates to a possible set of equalization parameters for an AEROBIC workout style of Sequence 3 (just like Sequence 5, there may be equalization parameters for each possible workout style and burn time for Sequence 3, and every other Sequence for a given original musical recording). The song edit data described in Tables 2A to 2M may also contain trainer sequence information for generating a trainer during a workout (indicating for example, the beginning of an edited song recording, the change in burn rate as a function of time the ending of an edited song recording) as further described herein.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The result of the selected song edit data, including the equalization parameters and exercise burn rate pattern for each song title, may be, for example, a compiled list of song play instructions for an audio player that defines Title, Burn Rate, Start Time, Volume, Bass, Mid, Treble, End Time for each song segment played throughout the workout. When an audio player responds to the series of instructions in the compiled list, the workout music is generated fluidly without any disturbance in the audio as the player transitions from one instruction to the next within an edited song recording. Specifying Burn Rate in the compiled instructions is optional, but can be useful for display purposes or relaying the data to the exercise equipment, rather than just for the audio player itself. The equalization data is given in the example as Volume, Bass, Mid and Treble. In other examples, it can be any one or more of these. Trainer sequence information provides instructions on playing the trainer video or trainer audio with respect to the song segments arranged into edited song recording played during the workout.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">A workout is defined herein as any form of physical activity performed for a designated period for physical fitness. A workout is, for example, but is not limited to, spinning on a stationary bicycle, jogging, walking, power walking, Zumba, palates, cross-country skiing, hiking, body building.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Workout music is a sequence of vocal and/or instrumental sounds combined over time and for playing during a workout. Workout music is also a combination of song sequences or song recordings arranged following the sequence of song titles selected by the user as user input.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">An original musical recording is an electrical or mechanical inscription of sound waves corresponding to a harmonious sequence of musical notes. An original musical recording may be composed of both lyrics and instrumental sounds, or it may be acapellavocal work without instrumental music, or entirely instrumental. Original musical recordings may be of different genres, such as for instance, pop songs, disco songs, dance tracks, house tracks, electronic tracks, drum and bass tracks, jungle tracks, swing songs, dub mixes, song edits and remixes. The original musical recording is the original audio file that serves as the source of song recording data for creating the arrangement of song segments for each song title as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Each original musical recording may be composed of song recording data which may be a digital audio file with a designated audio file format and may be compressed or uncompressed with a specific codec, as is known in the art. Examples of audio coding formats may be, for example, WAV, AIFF, FLAC, Monkey's Audio, WavPack, Opus, MP3, Musepack, WMA, AAC, .M4A, .M4B, .M4P. The song recording data contains bits of information translating into the original musical recording when structured or interpreted, where the song recording data may be stored in memory (e.g. the workout music playback device's memory). Song recording data also includes song identification data on the original musical recording (e.g. the artist of the original musical recording, the title of the original musical recording, the length of the original musical recording, the album or EP or extended play name) as song recording metadata. The song recording metadata may also include data on the nature of the original musical recording, such as the range and fluctuation of volume of the original musical recording as a function of frequency and time, and corresponding volume correction parameters and equalizer parameters. The song recording metadata may also provide information on the length of the original musical recording, the title of the original musical recording and the name of the artist associated with the original musical recording. It will be appreciated that the song recording metadata may provide other information on the original musical recording without departing from the present teachings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">The original musical recording may be the audio portion of a video file. For instance, the original musical recording may be the song played on or with a music video. The video file may consist of a container format (e.g. describing how the data in the video file coexist) containing video data in a video coding format (e.g. VP8, VP9, VP6, H.264, H.265) and audio data in an audio coding format (e.g. AC3, AAC, Vorbis, Opus, MP3, Nellymoser, FLAC etc.). Both the audio data and the video data may be compressed. The song recording data may be the video file with both the audio data and the video data. The workout music playback device may contain a codec for decoding the compressed audio data and video data contained in the video file. The workout music playback device may play segments of both the audio file and the corresponding portion of the video file as a function of the song edit data for that original musical recording. For instance, when the trainer for a song title is set of ‘Off’ or the trainer is an audio-only based trainer and the original musical recording is or is tied to a music video, the video of the music video may be displayed in a screen display instead of the video trainer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Each original musical recording has a specific designation, such as a name of the original musical recording, the name of the artist of the original musical recording, an album or EP name (this original designation stored, for instance, in the song recording metadata for each original musical recording). The artist is the creator of the original musical recording, such as the name of the singer, the group, the band or the disc-jockey. In the embodiments where the original musical recording may be a video file, the container format of the video file may contain the song recording metadata.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">The song title corresponds to at least portions of the specific designation of each original musical recording, where the song title of the original musical recording may be composed of the name of the original musical recording and/or the name of the artist of the original musical recording. The song title may also include the album or EP name. Song title information on an original musical recording may be stored in the song recording metadata of the original musical recording. The song title information stored in the song recording metadata may be accessed to identify the song recording data of the original musical recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Each original musical recording has a predetermined play duration. The predetermined play duration, with a start time and a finish time, is the length of the original musical recording when played from start to finish.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Each original musical recording can be considered to be composed of song segments. A song segment is a portion of the original musical recording that can be defined by a specific time duration of the original musical recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">There may be song edit data associated with each original musical recording. The song edit data may be a data file separate from the song recording data, providing information on arranging song segments of an original musical recording into different length song arrangements or edited song recordings of the original musical recording. The arrangement information may include the time intervals of the song segments to be arranged and the order of the song segments to be arranged for generating edited song recordings of the original musical recording. Each edited song recording of an original musical recording may be of the same beats per minute (i.e. the same tempo) as the original musical recording. The song edit data may also provide information on equalization parameters for each song segment in the arrangement of song segments. The equalization parameters can be the same for consecutive song segments. The equalization parameters defined in the song edit data may be provided as function of an exercise burn rate pattern, as explained herein, and/or a song recording structure. The song recording structure relates to the musical composition of the song recording, such as the start and finish of a verse in the song recording, the end of a melody, the beginning of a refrain, a change in the bass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">An edited song recording is defined as a song recording constituted from a specific arrangement of song segments of an original musical recording with specific equalization parameters, where the information on the arrangement of song segments and the equalization parameters are stored in the song edit data of its original musical recording. The edited song recording may be for playing in a stream of workout music. In some examples, the equalization parameters of the edited song recording may be dependent upon an exercise burn rate pattern. There may be multiple edited song recordings for a given original musical recording, each with a different length from the other, where each edited song recording may be composed of a different arrangement of song segments. As an example, the song edit data may contain information on arranging song segments from an original musical recording for producing different edited song recordings for a given original musical recording, where each of the edited song recordings of the original musical recording is of a different duration from the other edit song recordings of the original musical recording. The difference in duration between each of the edited song recordings of an original musical recording may be achieved by arranging the song segments differently for an original musical recording, where there is either repetition or removal of certain song segments of the original musical recording, this information on assembly stored in the song edit data. In some cases, it may be desirable to repeat or remove segments that correspond to what is a lyric verse or refrain of an original musical recording. For instance, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a visual representation of exemplary song edit data for arranging and outputting a plurality of different edited song recordings from an original musical recording. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, there are twelve different length song recordings that (i.e. Sequences) may be composed from the song segments of the exemplary original musical recording. Each of the possible edited song recording of the original musical recording is of a different duration and is composed of a different arrangement of song segments of the original musical recording when compared to the other possible edited song recordings of the original musical recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Each different edited song recording may have a defined intro and outro portion. The intro of the edited song recording is a passage that opens the edited song recording, before the verse, the chorus or the refrain (in the case of song having verses and a refrain). The outro of the edited song recording is the conclusive portion of the edited song recording, where there may be repetition of thematic material from the edited song recording. Information regarding the portion of the edited song recording corresponding to the intro and outro portion may be found in the song edit data for generating each of the arrangement of song segments for each edited song recording, as the length and timing of the intro and outro portions may vary between each of the possible edited song recording (e.g. time markers corresponding to specific times when playing respectively each of the edited song recordings, where each time marker may identify, for instance, the ending of the intro portion of the specific edited song recording, the beginning of the outro portion of the specific edited song recording).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">The song edit data may also provide cross-fade points for each of the possible edited song recordings that may be generated by the workout music playback device. In some other embodiments, the fade in time may be of 0.25 seconds, where the fade out time may between 0 seconds to 3 seconds. The person skilled in the art will understand that the fade in and fade out time may vary without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">The song edit data may also contain information for each of the edited song recordings on an optimal point in the edited song recording to end a workout. The optimal point to end a workout may be associated to a time marker stored in the song edit data, each of the arrangement of song segments generating an edited song recording, the time marker positioned in some instances before the ending of the edited song recording that may be aligned with the end of the main workout portion. The portion of the edited song recording following the time marker indicating the optimal point to end the workout may be played in the cooldown portion of the workout. In some examples, the equalization parameters of the portion of the edited song recording played in the cooldown portion may be adjusted, such as by lowering the volume of certain frequency ranges. The length of the edited song recordings selected for the cooldown portion of the workout may also be adjusted as a result of adding, to the cooldown portion, the portion of the edited song recording after the optimal point to end the workout, or the time of the portion of the edited song recording played in the cooldown portion may be added to the cooldown time and the total time of the workout. In alternative embodiments, the optimal point to end a workout may mark a time where the play time of the edited song recording may be stopped early before if the edited song recording is the last song to be played for a given workout. In these examples, the optimal point to end the workout may mark a point in an edited song recording corresponding to a climatic portion of the edited song recording, so that the workout ends at the climax point in the playing of the edited song recording. In an alternative embodiment, the time marker corresponding to the optimal point to end the workout may be automatically generated by the workout music playback device by analyzing the song recording data and the song edit data. The workout music playback device may analyze the volume of different frequency ranges of the original musical recording, and the song edit data for each of possible arrangements of song segments of the original musical recording, add a time marker corresponding to a given time interval following the point in the arrangement of song segments where the volume at each of the different frequency ranges reaches a peak, followed by a drop in volume of given frequency ranges occurring after a fixed lapse of time in the play duration of the edited song recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">The song edit data may also contain information relating to possible workout style selections for a given song title and original musical recording. The workout style information may vary for each of the edited song recordings, and there may be workout style information respective to each possible arrangement of song segments for a given original musical recording, so for each possible edited song recording, saved as part of the song edit data for the original musical recording. The song edit data on the workout styles may yield different exercise burn rate patterns for each of the workout styles, where there may be a different exercise burn rate pattern for each workout style, and for each of the possible edited song recordings. In some examples, the exercise burn rate pattern may also be generated from a generic exercise burn rate pattern for each workout style, where the generic exercise burn rate pattern is further tailed or adjusted as a function of song segmentation information contained in the song edit data. This tailoring may allow the exercise burn rate pattern, including the inflection and deflection of the associated equalization parameters, to follow the musical structure or composition of the edited song recordings or original song recordings, so that the equalization parameters do not change, for instance, in mid verse or mid stanza. The song edit data may contain information on the time markers corresponding to changes in the equalization parameters of the possible arrangement of song segments, as well as the equalization parameters between two time markers or for the different song segments of the arrangement of song segments. The different portions of the song edit data corresponding to the different workout styles may also contain song edit metadata, such as an identifier for extracting information relating to the workout style, such as the name of the workout style.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">The song edit data may also contain information on assembling a given virtual trainer for the workout, such as by providing time markers corresponding to a change in the workout as a function of the exercise burn rate pattern. Each time marker may also be associated with additional information on the nature of the change in the workout, such as if the workout is transitioning from one burn rate to another, if a new workout style or burn time is to begin, or if an edited song recording corresponding to a given workout style or burn time, is finished. The virtual trainer information provides information on which video segment to retrieve for a given virtual trainer from a video source (where there are video segments corresponding to different changes in the workout), the time during which the video segment is played and the nature of the change in the workout. This information may lead to the assembly of a virtual trainer tailored to specific exercise burn rate patterns, and to the workout parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">The song edit data may also contain additional song edit metadata on the portions of the song edit data with instructions on each of the different arrangements of song segments. For instance, the song edit metadata may identify the location in song edit data with instructions on assembling an edited song recording of a specific length from the original musical recording. For example, the song edit metadata may contain an identifier for each possible arrangement of song segments for generating each of the edited song recordings, or provide a series of play duration numerals, where each play duration numeral is associated to one of the arrangement of song segments for an original musical recording. In this example, when the workout music playback device seeks to add an arrangement of song segments of a given original musical recording closest to a specific length, the workout music playback device may access the song edit metadata corresponding to the original musical recording and identify the song edit data for producing the arrangement of song segments of the desired play duration. The song edit metadata may then indicate the location of the song edit data corresponding to the song segment arrangement information for creating the edited song recording with the specific play duration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">In alternative embodiments, a database of audio files with each of the possible edited song recordings of an original musical recording may be provided, where a workout music playback device may select from the audio files for each of the edited song recordings depending on the user input and the workout configuration. The digital audio files for the edited song recordings has a designated audio file format and may be compressed or uncompressed with a specific codec. Examples of audio coding formats may be, for example, WAV, AIFF, FLAC, Monkey's Audio, WavPack, Opus, MP3, Musepack, WMA, AAC, M4A, M4B, M4P. The digital audio file of each of the edited song recordings contains bits of information which may be translated into each of edited song recordings when structured or interpreted, where the audio files may be stored in memory (e.g. the workout music playback device's memory or an external memory drive, accessible wirelessly or through a wired connection by the workout music playback device).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">Master song edit metadata may also be provided for each portion of the song edit data corresponding to an original musical recording. The master song edit metadata may provide information with respect to the song edit data corresponding to an original musical recording. Such information may include equalization parameters for all of the possible edited song recordings of the original musical recording, the equalization parameters including volume parameters for a given range of frequencies of the original musical recording. The master song edit metadata may also include, for example, information on the tempo of the edited song recordings of the original musical recording and an identifier for the song edit data of an original musical recording (e.g. name of the artist, name of the album or EP, the song title information of the original musical recording).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Each original musical recording may have a different average treble level or bass level. Treble corresponds to the tones of the original musical recording at a higher frequency range where bass correspond to the tones of the original musical recording at a lower frequency range. Therefore, equalization between the original musical recordings involves adjusting the balance between the different frequency ranges within an electronic signal of the song segment, such as adjusting the frequency range of the bass of the original musical recording and the treble of the original musical recording by using linear filters. Equalization involves adjusting the amplitude of audio signals at different frequencies. Equalization may be used to adjust (i.e. increase or decrease) the prominence of different frequency ranges within an original musical recording, such as by adjusting the bass or the vocal component within the original musical recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Equalization parameters are settings regulating the balance and volume for different audio frequency ranges of song segments in an arrangement of song segments of an original musical recording. The equalization parameters of an edited song recording may vary as a function of the time in the edited song recording. The equalization parameters may include at least one time marker, where each time marker indicates a change in the equalization of the arrangement of song segments. The equalization parameters may be the global volume (for all of the audio frequencies) of each song segment of the arrangement of song segments yielding a given edited song recording. The equalization parameters may be adjusted in a stream of workout music by the workout music playback machine in accordance with the exercise burn rate pattern. For instance, when the burn rate is low, then the bass parameter of the original musical recording may be reduced. However, as the burn rate increases to medium or high, in accordance with exercise burn rate pattern, so may certain equalization parameters increase as a function of the burn rate. For instance, at a medium burn rate, the bass level of the equalization parameters, corresponding to, for example, that of the percussions, may also increase, therefore increasing the volume of the percussions in the song while maintain the treble, associated to, for example, the vocals, at the same level. In another example, at a higher burn rate, the treble level of the equalization parameters, corresponding to, for example, the vocals, may also increase, therefore increasing the volume of the vocals while maintaining the bass level associated to, for example, the percussions. In some other examples, both the treble and the bass level may be increased by adjusting the equalization parameters. Equalization parameter information may be specific to each song segment in a given arrangement of song segments. In other embodiments, the equalization parameters may be independent from the exercise burn rate pattern, where a change in the burn rate as a function of time may not entail a corresponding change in the equalization parameters of the arrangement of song segments at the same time markers indicating a change of burn rate. In some examples, the equalization parameters may provide that the volume of the arrangement of song segments increases steadily and gradually throughout the play duration of the arrangement of song segments, where the volume at the end of the arrangement of song segments is greater than the volume at the beginning of the arrangement of song segments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">A stream of workout music may be defined as a continuous stream of edited song recordings with a defined sequence (the sequence corresponding to a selection generated by user or auto-generated by, for example, the workout music playback device). The stream of workout music may correspond to a selection of song titles made by the user. A stream of workout music is also a stream of digital audio data associated with a designated length of workout music. The stream of workout music may be determined based on the parameters of the workout as part of the user input entered by the user into the user input interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">A sequence is defined as a specific order of edited song recordings for a specific workout upon, for instance, a selection of song titles made by a user, where each song title corresponds to an original musical recording. In some examples, a sequence may be composed of a single edited song recording corresponding to a single song title. In other embodiments, a sequence may be composed of multiple edited song recordings each corresponding to a given song title. An edited song recording or different edited song recordings corresponding to a single song title may appear more than once in a sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, the sequence may be composed of at least one sub-sequence of song titles. Each of the sub-sequences may be associated with a given core portion of the workout. The core portion of the workout is based on the phase of the workout and may be divided into the warm up, the main workout and the cooldown. Other exemplary workouts may have another core portion, such as a stretching core portion, or a second main workout portion following a rest period that comes after the first main workout core portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In an exemplary embodiment of a workout where there are three core portions as described herein, there may be three sub-sequences of song titles, where each of the three sub-sequences of song titles is associated with a given core portion of the workout. A first warm up sub-sequence corresponds to a sub-sequence of song titles for playing during a warm up in a workout. The warm up portion of the workout is a preparation for physical exertion by exercising gently beforehand. A second main workout sub-sequence is a sub-sequence of song titles for playing during the main portion of the workout, the principal exercise or training portion with usually the greatest energy output. A third cooldown sub-sequence is a sub-sequence of song titles for playing during a cooldown portion of the workout. The cooldown is the portion of the workout routine for allowing physiological activity to gradually return to normal after a more strenuous portion of a workout routine by engaging in less strenuous exercise. In some embodiments, the sequence may be composed of an additional sub-sequence of song titles for a stretching period following the workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">The song database is composed of a list of song titles, each of these song titles associated with an original musical recording that has corresponding song edit data. These song titles may be stored in the memory on the workout music playback device. The original musical recordings (as well, in some examples, as the song edit data) may also be stored and accessible via cloud storage (i.e. data storage where digital data is stored in logical pools). In an alternative embodiment, the song titles may also correspond to original musical recordings accessible via streaming, wherein for instance a music application software stored in the memory of the workout music playback device provides the user with a library of song titles, where each of the song titles corresponds to an original musical recording that may be streamed. The user may import the library of song titles, or portions thereof, or the library of song titles may be accessible via an interface on the workout music playback device, where the song titles may be selected by the user for producing a stream of workout music by providing a selection of song titles. In this example, the workout music playback device preferably has a wireless interface for establishing a wireless connection (e.g. WiFi connection) for streaming or downloading the original musical recordings via the music application software. In other embodiments, the user may switch, when selecting the user's song titles, between those of original musical recordings stored on the user's computing device, and those that are streamed wirelessly. For instance, the user may provide a selection of song titles A, B, C and D, where the original musical recordings of song titles A and C are retrieved from the user's smartphone's memory, and original musical recordings of song titles B and D can be streamed wirelessly from, for instance, a remote server.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">The user may be allowed, prompted or invited to specify a selection of song titles or other information for generating a workout configuration, thereby providing user input. By specifying a selection of song titles, the user is choosing a list of song titles associated with original musical recordings the user desires to listen to during a workout. In some embodiments, the specification of a selection of song titles also includes a designated order. In other embodiments, the order of song titles is not specified by the user. The user may specify a selection of song titles by scrolling through a list of song titles displayed on a display of the workout playback device and selecting the desired song titles. It will be appreciated that the specification of the selection of song titles may be performed by other means. Furthermore, in alternative embodiments, the user may also choose to input a random selection option available in the workout music playback device, where the workout playback device runs a set of instructions to automatically specify a selection of song titles. The workout music playback device may also provide the automatically generated list of song titles to the user for the user's approval, where the list of song titles may appear, for example, on the screen display of the workout playback device. The user may then choose to accept or dismiss the automatically generated selection of song titles. If the user dismisses the automatically generated selection of song titles, the user may then choose to request that the workout playback device generate a new automatically generated selection of song titles or the user may provide the user's own input to specify a selection of song titles. The user input may also specify a musical genre to be played during the workout. The musical genre input may, for instance, lead to sorting of the song titles listed in, for example, a scroll menu of song titles of the song database, leaving only the song titles sharing the designated musical genre available for further selection by the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The user input may also include the length of the workout as a measure of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The user may also select a workout style from, for instance, a workout style database. The user may select a workout style for a given song title. In an alternative embodiment, the user may select a workout style for an entire workout. A workout style relates to the nature of the training pattern and the fluctuations in intensity during the course of a specific period in the workout, such as a time interval in the workout. For example, workout styles may be used in interval training, where each interval marks at least one different period with a given burn rate. An example of a workout style is high intensity interval training, where the user may switch between periods of high intensity and medium intensity exercise over time. Another example of a workout style is a gradient interval training, where the burn rate gradually increases during the course of the time interval. Yet another example of workout style is an aerobic interval, where there is a fluctuation between low intensity, medium intensity and high intensity exercise during the course of a time interval. A skilled person will readily recognize that a workout style may be any pattern in the fluctuation of the burn rate over time in the workout. The workout style may be selected for a designated length of time during the workout. The user may associate a specific exercise workout style with each song title in the sequence of song titles. For instance, Table 3A provides a list of exemplary selection of workout styles that a user may select for different workout portions, each workout portion corresponding to a song title:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The burn rate is the level of exercise intensity for a given period. The burn rate may be tied, for instance, to calorie consumption of the user as a result of the exercise performed. For example, a low burn rate may be tied to a low calorie consumption rate or a low level of exertion, a medium burn rate associated to a medium calorie consumption rate or a medium level of exertion, and a high burn rate associated with a high calorie consumption rate or a high level of exertion. Therefore, the low burn rate is associated with low level of exercise intensity, such as that of a warm up portion, cool down portion, or recovery or relaxation period of a workout. The medium burn rate is tied to a higher level of exercise intensity than the low burn rate, and may be associated with the core workout portion. The high burn rate is tied to a higher level of exercise intensity than the medium burn rate, may be associated with the core portion of the workout. It will be appreciated that there may be other burn rates without departing from the present teachings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Each edited song recording in the workout may be associated to an exercise burn rate pattern. Each workout style may be associated with an exercise burn rate pattern. An exercise burn rate pattern is an overall pattern of the change in the burn rates at different time markers for a given edited song recording and a given workout style. For example, the exercise burn rate pattern may fluctuate as a function of at least three burn rates over a course of the portion of the workout with a specific workout style, and there may be an exercise burn rate pattern providing a specific sequence of intervals of different burn rates during intervals of designated lengths. Each possible workout style for each given arrangement of song segments may have its own distinct exercise burn rate patterns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">The exercise burn rate pattern may therefore depend on the workout style. As an example, if the workout style is a high intensity interval training interspersed every 10 seconds, the exercise burn rate pattern may correspond to 10 seconds of high intensity exercise followed by 10 seconds of medium intensity exercise, this sequence repeated during the course of the workout associated with the high intensity interval training workout style. As a song title may be associated with a given workout style as explained herein, so will each song title be associated with a given exercise burn rate pattern. Once a workout style, and also its corresponding exercise burn rate pattern, is associated with each song title in the sequence of song titles, the assembled set of exercise burn rate patterns for the sequence of song titles yields a global exercise burn rate pattern for the workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, the equalization parameters may vary as a function of the exercise burn rate pattern, where, for example, an increase in the burn rate may also increase the volume of certain frequency ranges of the equalization parameters. Similarly, a decrease in the burn rate may also decrease the volume of certain frequency ranges of the equalization parameters. In other embodiments, the equalization parameters may be independent from the exercise burn rate pattern, where a change in the exercise burn rate pattern may not entail a change in the equalization parameters. For instance, the equalization parameters may vary gradually during a high burn rate interval, where the volume increases gradually throughout the high burn rate interval. In some embodiments, a gradual decrease or increase in volume may be in 2, 4, 6, 8 or larger decibel steps for providing a non-smooth stepping ramp up or down in volume which can help cue and motivate the user instead of a subliminal smooth transition which goes unnoticed while exercising.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In some examples, the information on the exercise burn rate pattern may also include instructions that may be received and performed by certain exercise machines, these instructions permitting, for instance, for adjusting the exercise difficulty parameters of the exercise machine. For example, the instructions may pertain to increase or decrease the resistance of a stationary bike, the speed and/or inclination of a treadmill or the resistance of a stationary rowing machine. Instructions to increase or decrease the exercise difficulty parameters of the exercise machine may be transmitted from the workout music playback device as a function of the exercise burn rate pattern, where an increase in the burn rate at a specific time marker in the exercise burn rate pattern may prompt the workout music playback device to transmit instructions to increase the exercise difficulty parameters of the exercise machine, such as those described above tied to the intensity of the user's workout. Similarly, a decrease in the burn rate at a specific time marker in the exercise burn rate pattern may prompt the workout music playback device to transmit instructions to decrease the exercise difficulty parameters of the exercise machine, such as those described above tied to the intensity of the user's workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Once the user input is provided, the media output manager receives a workout configuration based upon the user input. The workout configuration is a set of parameters that may be stored in memory and are then processed, such as by using a processor of the media output manager, by the workout playback device to generate a given stream of workout music.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Workout Music Playback Device <b>100</b>:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Reference will now be made to the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a modular representation of an exemplary workout music playback device <b>100</b>. The music playback device <b>100</b> has a memory <b>125</b>. The memory <b>125</b> stores a song database <b>108</b> composed of song titles <b>112</b> where each of the song titles <b>112</b> is associated with an original musical recording <b>110</b> and song edit data <b>101</b>. The memory <b>125</b> also stores the song recording data, and song recording metadata of the original musical recordings <b>110</b> for each song title <b>112</b> in the song database <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the song recording data and song recording metadata may be stored on memory separate from the song edit data <b>101</b> and the song database <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The memory <b>125</b> also stores song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to each of the original musical recordings <b>110</b>. A workout style database <b>109</b> may be generated from the song edit data <b>101</b>, where the song edit data <b>101</b> may contain information relating to each of the possible workout styles that may be selected by a user. In another example, the memory <b>125</b> may store a separate list of workout styles and/or burn times, not generated from the song edit data <b>101</b> but containing the same workout styles and burn times as in the song edit data <b>101</b>, where the separate list of workout styles and/or burn times may be accessed by the user in the form of a workout style database <b>109</b>. The memory <b>125</b> may be, for instance, that of the workout music playback device <b>100</b>, an external memory drive, or a form of cloud storage. The memory <b>125</b> of the music playback device <b>100</b> may be any form of computer hardware for storing information in a computer. Memory <b>125</b> may be, for example, random-access memory or a hard drive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The workout music playback device <b>100</b> also has a media output manager <b>106</b>A, an instruction relay module <b>106</b>B, a screen display <b>102</b> an audio output interface <b>105</b>, a media output generator <b>120</b>, optionally an exercise machine interface <b>104</b> and, optionally, a video source <b>140</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">The media output manager <b>106</b>A receives user input <b>114</b> from the user input interface <b>107</b> in the form of data (received by the media output manager <b>106</b>A as a given workout configuration <b>103</b>). While processing the user input <b>114</b>, the media output manager <b>106</b>A retrieves from memory <b>125</b> the song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to the user input <b>114</b> and transmits information on the arrangements of song segments to be assembled to the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B which instructs the media output generator <b>120</b> to create the stream of workout music <b>111</b>. The information on the arrangement of song segments transmitted by the media output manager <b>106</b>A may include the song title <b>112</b> of the original musical recording <b>110</b> that is to be played, the song segment of the original musical recording <b>110</b> that is to be played at a given time marked by its starting time in the original musical recording <b>110</b>, the corresponding equalization parameters to be applied to the song segment, and the stop time (the period marking the end of a song segment).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">More specifically, when the user begins the workout, as the media output manager <b>106</b>A receives the workout configuration <b>103</b> from namely the user input interface <b>107</b>, the media output manager <b>106</b>A processes the workout configuration <b>103</b> and retrieves from memory the song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to the song titles <b>112</b> selected by the user as part of the workout configuration <b>103</b>. The media output manager <b>106</b>A determines the play duration of each song title <b>112</b> in the stream of workout music <b>111</b> as described herein. After calculating the play duration for each song title <b>112</b>, the media output manager <b>106</b>A retrieves the song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to that play duration for the given song title <b>112</b>. The retrieval of song edit data <b>101</b> may be achieved by the media output manager <b>106</b>A accessing first the master song edit metadata corresponding to the desired song title <b>112</b>, such as by comparing the identifier stored in the master song edit metadata with the song title <b>112</b> stored in the workout configuration <b>103</b> (e.g. such as by parsing the characters of the song title <b>112</b> and comparing the song title <b>112</b> with the identifier information of the master song edit metadata). The media output manager <b>106</b>A then may access the song edit metadata to identify the correct portion of song edit data providing instructions for yielding an arrangement of song segments for a given song title <b>112</b> closest to the sought after play duration for the song title <b>112</b> (by analyzing the time duration metadata existing for each possible arrangement of song segments).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The media output manager <b>106</b>A may also access from the song edit data <b>101</b> the corresponding workout style information corresponding to the workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>selected by the user for a given song title <b>112</b>. This retrieval may be achieved by accessing the song edit metadata with the identifiers and memory locations for each of the workout styles for a specific arrangement of song segments of an original musical recording <b>110</b>. Retrieval of the workout style information may include retrieval of an exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> for a given arrangement of song segments, providing information, for example, on the change in the burn rate for the duration of the arrangement of song segments as a function of time. The workout style information may also include equalization parameters for each song segment in the arrangement of song segments as well as time markers indicating a change in the equalization for the segments of the arrangement of song segments. In some examples, the exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> may set the burn rate for specific song segments and the volume equalization may also vary for the same song segments. In other examples, the change in burn rate may occur at different time markers of song segments than those indicating a change in the equalization parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The information regarding the exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> may be processed and converted into a visual representation of the exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> displayed on, for instance, a screen display <b>102</b> as explained herein. Furthermore, the media output manager <b>106</b>A may also provide instructions for generating an image on a screen display <b>102</b>, the image corresponding to a workout user interface <b>500</b> or a user input interface <b>107</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The media output manager <b>106</b>A sends the information retrieved from the song edit data <b>101</b> (e.g. song title <b>112</b>, the corresponding song segment of the original musical recording <b>110</b> to be played, e.g. the start and stop time for the given song segment) to the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B. The information transmitted by the media output manager <b>106</b>A may be sent punctually and continuously throughout the course of a playing workout and as a function of the current time data provided by the media output generator <b>120</b> to the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The instruction relay module <b>106</b>B is a module for receiving the information provided by the media output manager <b>106</b>A (e.g. the song title <b>112</b> of the song recording data that is to be accessed for retrieving song recording data, the song segment of the original musical recording <b>110</b> to be played, with the start and stop time markers for that song segment, the equalization parameters for that song segment, and in some cases the time marker corresponding to the optimal time to end a workout) and transmits the information in the form of audio output instructions to the media output generator <b>120</b>. The instruction relay module <b>106</b>B may also receive from the media output generator <b>120</b> the current time (e.g. timing data) in the streaming of the workout music <b>111</b> and may transmit the current time information to the media output manager <b>106</b>A. The current time may provide information on when audio output instructions regarding the next song segment is needed to be transmitted for generating a fluid stream of workout music <b>111</b> without delay between the song segments. As the media output generator <b>120</b> generates the stream of workout music <b>111</b>, the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B will continue to transmit the audio output instructions, provided by the media output manager <b>106</b>A, such as the next song segment to be added to the stream of workout music <b>111</b> (and its equalization parameters), to the media output generator <b>120</b> as a function of time (e.g. triggered by the current time information received by the media output manager <b>106</b>A from the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B, sent from the media output generator <b>120</b>, prompting for the transmission of the next audio output instructions). In some examples, the current time data received by the media output manager <b>106</b> allows for the audio output instructions to be transmitted for processing while the stream of workout music <b>111</b> is playing, without delay between the song segments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The media output generator <b>120</b> functions as a music streamer. The media output generator <b>120</b> receives audio output instructions from the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B, processes the audio output instructions, and retrieves from memory the song recording data, by for instance accessing the song recording metadata, for each of original musical recordings <b>110</b> corresponding to the song titles <b>112</b> identified in the audio output instructions, this information generated from the media output manager <b>106</b>A. For instance, the audio output instructions may provide the media output generator <b>120</b> information on which original musical recording <b>110</b> to be played using an identifier, the song segment of the original musical recording <b>110</b> to be played with a first time stamp indicating at which point the original musical recording <b>110</b> should start playing as well as a time during which the original musical recording <b>110</b> is to play, stopping once the time has lapsed (e.g. stop time). The media output generator <b>120</b> may then retrieve the song recording data corresponding to the song segment of the original musical recording <b>110</b> to be played. The media output generator <b>120</b> may have specific codecs for compressing/decompressing the song recording data. The media output generator <b>120</b> may also have a digital signal processor (DSP) for processing data, such as the song recording data to be played in the stream of workout music <b>111</b>, in real-time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">The audio output instructions may also include information on the equalization parameters for a given song segment of the original musical recording <b>110</b>, providing the player with instructions regarding the volume parameters to be set for the song segment for different frequency ranges. The media output generator <b>120</b> receives a stream of audio output instructions from the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B, where the media output generator <b>120</b> fluidly retrieves the song segments from the original musical recordings <b>110</b> in accordance with the instructions and plays the song segments, the arrangement of song segments yielding a continuous stream of workout music <b>111</b> with tailored equalization parameters corresponding to an exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">The stream of workout music <b>111</b> may then be sent in, for example, digital format by the media output generator <b>120</b> to the audio output interface <b>105</b> of the workout music playback device <b>100</b>. The audio output interface <b>105</b> of the workout music playback device <b>100</b> may be a speaker integrated into the music playback device <b>100</b>. The audio output interface <b>105</b> of the workout music playback device <b>100</b> may also be an audio port for plugging in an audio jack of, for example, headphones or an external speaker (or a wireless interface wireless connected to a pair of digital headphones). The digital signal may then be converted to an analog signal. In an alternative embodiment, the audio output interface <b>105</b> may be external to the workout music playback device <b>100</b>. For instance, the audio output interface <b>105</b> may be a set of external speakers, such as those of a television, a radio system, a computer, an exercise machine, or standalone speakers. The audio file data associated with the stream of workout music <b>111</b> may be sent wirelessly via, for instance, a WiFi connection, from the wireless interface of the workout music playback device <b>100</b> to the wireless interface of the external audio output interface. The digital audio file data, received may then be converted by the external audio output interface to an analog signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, showing a block diagram of an exemplary media output generator <b>120</b> configured for an Android-based computing device, such as an Android phone or Android tablet. The media output generator <b>120</b> retrieves from memory, such as memory <b>125</b>, the song recording data of an original musical recording <b>110</b> as a function of the audio output instructions, the audio output instructions providing instructions that are read and processed by the media output generator <b>120</b> on which song recording data to retrieve. The retrieval from memory may be done using the AndroidMediaExtractor <b>801</b> function, native to the Android OS, used, for example, to facilitate extraction of media data from a data source. The retrieved song recording data may be in a compressed format and may contain additional metadata relating to the song recording data, such as audio track information. The compressed song recording data is then decompressed using, for instance, AndroidMediaCodec <b>802</b>, a function native to the Android OS for encoding and decoding, used to access media codecs. Additional media codecs may be added to the AndroidMediaCodec <b>802</b>. AndroidMediaCodec <b>802</b> decompresses the compressed song recording data with a designated codec as a function of the compression format of the song recording data. The uncompressed song recording data may then be stored in an uncompressed source audio data memory buffer <b>803</b>, such a non-volatile memory (e.g. random access memory). As a function of the audio output instructions, song segments corresponding to designated play durations of the original musical recording are copied from the uncompressed song recording data stored in the uncompressed source audio data memory buffer <b>803</b> by a copy module <b>804</b>. Equalization parameters may also be applied by the copy module <b>804</b> (e.g. having optional audio equalization filter settings) as a function of the audio output instructions. In some embodiments, the equalization parameters may be applied using a linear filter. In some embodiments, a multiplier or modulator may be used to increase or decrease certain equalization parameters, such as the volume. In some embodiments, a discrete cosine transform to isolate frequency components that are subject to equalization may be used. In other embodiments, high and low pass filters may be used to attenuate certain frequency ranges that are allowed to pass by the filters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">The copied song segment is then stored in the edited song recording memory buffer <b>805</b>. The edited song recording memory buffer <b>805</b> may be non-volatile memory (e.g. random access memory). A second copied song segment may then be added in the edited song recording memory buffer <b>805</b> after the first copied song segment. A third copied song segment may then be added after the second copied song segment, and so forth. The result is a path in memory for storing an assembled sequence of media data of song segments for producing an edited song recording as a function of the audio output instructions. The media data of the edited song recording may then be extracted from the edited song recording memory buffer <b>805</b> and outputted as a stream of media data for playing workout music, or alternatively, extracted from the edited song recording memory buffer <b>805</b> and compressed using a specific codec for storing the audio file corresponding to the edited song recording in an audio file database, such as the audio file database <b>141</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The person of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the media output generator <b>120</b> of, for instance, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> may be adapted to other computer systems than that of an Android computing device without departing from the present teachings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The workout music playback device <b>100</b> may optionally have an exercise machine interface <b>104</b> for establishing a connection with an exercise machine. The connection between the exercise machine and the exercise machine interface <b>104</b> may be a wired connection or a wireless connection (e.g. WiFi, Bluetooth). The exercise machine interface <b>104</b> may be connected to the media output generator <b>120</b>, for receiving, for instance a stream of audio data which may be transmitted to, for example, at least one exercise machine. The exercise machine interface <b>104</b> may also be connected to the media output manager <b>106</b>A, where the exercise machine interface <b>104</b> may, for instance, transmit input provided from a user using an exercise machine to the media output manager <b>106</b>A, relaying the input data from the exercise machine to the media output manager <b>106</b>A. The media output manager <b>106</b>A may also transmit instructions to the exercise machine interface <b>104</b> such as input provided by the user using the user input interface <b>107</b> to manage certain features of the exercise machine. The exercise machine interface <b>104</b> may then transmit these instructions as data to the exercise machine, the exercise machine executing the instructions upon their receipt and processing. In some examples, the workout music playback device <b>100</b> may also allow the user to control remotely certain aspects of the workout machine, such as its difficulty adjustments. For instance, the user may adjust the incline or the speed of a treadmill, or the resistance of a stationary bike. In other examples, the user input may be to adjust the volume of the music being produced by the exercise machine, where the volume controls of the stream of workout music are provided on a console of the exercise machine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">The exercise machine interface <b>104</b> may have both a receiver and a transmitter. The transmitter of the exercise machine interface <b>104</b> may transmit to an exercise machine, for instance, input provided by the user via the workout music playback device <b>100</b>. The transmitter of the exercise machine interface <b>104</b> may also transmit the audio data stream corresponding to a stream of workout music <b>111</b> generated by the media output generator <b>120</b>. The receiver of the exercise machine interface <b>104</b> may receive input from a user using the exercise machine, such a volume control of the music, where this input may be sent as data to the media output manager <b>106</b>A.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Inputting in the User Input Interface:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">In one example, the user may input the time of the workout into the input user interface <b>107</b>A and select different song titles <b>112</b> from the song database <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">A user input interface <b>107</b>A may request that a user enter a total time <b>114</b> <i>a </i>for the workout such as by selecting a time using a workout time button <b>310</b> (with, for instance, buttons to increase or decrease the total time, or a keyboard interface, such as a touch keyboard appearing on the screen display <b>102</b> to enter a time). The total selected workout time <b>114</b> <i>a </i>of the workout may be shown in a time display <b>309</b>. The user may then begin selecting song titles <b>112</b> to fill in the workout time <b>114</b> <i>a </i>from the song database <b>108</b>. For instance, the user may choose to add a slot row <b>305</b> to correspond to a song title <b>112</b> for a workout by selecting an add song button <b>306</b> available in the user input interface <b>107</b> <i>a</i>. The user may then set the song title <b>112</b> corresponding to the slot row <b>305</b> by using song selection button <b>318</b> searching through the song database <b>108</b> for the desired song title <b>112</b>, such as, by using a scroll feature (i.e. allowing the user to scroll up or down through an alphabetical list of songs by completing, for instance, a swipe motion on the touch screen) or by typing in the name of the song title <b>112</b> or the name of the artist. For example, the workout music playback device <b>100</b> may then run instructions to parse the string of characters entered by the user and compare this string of characters with the names of the song titles <b>112</b> provided in the song database <b>108</b>. If the entered string of characters matches that of a song title <b>112</b> in the song database <b>108</b>, then the song title <b>112</b> corresponding to the original musical recording <b>110</b> may be added to a slot row <b>305</b>, forming part of the selection <b>114</b> <i>b </i>of song titles <b>112</b>. Once a song title <b>112</b> is selected and added to the workout, the song title <b>112</b> may be displayed in a song title slot row <b>305</b> along with other features associated with that portion of the workout tied to the song title <b>112</b>. The user may also decide to delete a slot row <b>305</b> corresponding to a song title <b>112</b> by selecting, for instance, a delete song button <b>307</b>. The delete song button <b>307</b>, once selected, may delete the last added slot row <b>305</b>. Alternatively, the user may select a given slot row <b>305</b>, and then the user may select the delete song button <b>307</b>, removing the selected slot row <b>305</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">In another embodiment, the user may instead scroll a menu listing the song titles <b>112</b> in the song database <b>108</b> and, when the user selects a song title <b>112</b>, a slot row <b>305</b> including the song title <b>112</b> is added. The workout music display device <b>100</b> may provide a mechanism for adjusting the time associated to each selected song title <b>112</b> to be played in the stream of workout music <b>111</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">The user may select the number of slot rows for each core portion of the workout. For instance, the user may add slot rows <b>322</b> (and song titles <b>112</b>) for the warm up portion (e.g. shown as portion <b>302</b> on the user input interface <b>107</b>A) of the workout. The user may add slot rows <b>305</b> (and song titles <b>112</b>) for the core portion (e.g. shown as portion <b>303</b> on the user input interface <b>107</b>A) of the workout. The user may add slot rows <b>323</b> (and song titles <b>112</b>) for the cool down portion (e.g. shown as portion <b>304</b> on the user input interface <b>107</b>A) of the workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">The user may also select, such as by using workout style buttons <b>313</b>, the workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>associated with each song title <b>112</b> in the selection <b>114</b> <i>b </i>of song titles <b>112</b>. The workout styles may be selected from a workout style database <b>109</b> appearing, for instance, as a drop down menu when the user selects the workout style button <b>313</b> for a given slot row. In this example, the workout music playback device <b>100</b> may provide the user with an auto-generated list of workout styles <b>114</b> <i>c</i>, this list appearing each time a user selects a workout style button <b>313</b> for a given slot row <b>305</b>. The user may select the workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>for the given slot row <b>305</b>, and the screen display <b>102</b> may display to the user the selected choice of workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>for the given slot row <b>305</b>. Table 3A provides a list of exemplary workout styles <b>114</b> <i>c </i>for an exemplary user input interface <b>107</b>A. The person skilled in the art will readily recognize that workout styles <b>114</b> <i>c </i>other than those provided in Table 3A may be used without departing from the present teachings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">In an alternative embodiment, the workout time may be generated as a function of the number and length of the song titles <b>112</b> selected by the user, not requiring the user to input a total workout time. In this example, the workout time will correspond to the total time required to play each of the selected different length song recordings of each of the original musical recordings <b>110</b> corresponding to the selected song titles <b>112</b> and their respective desired lengths, where the desired length for each song title <b>112</b> may be adjusted by using song title time button <b>312</b> as explained herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">In some embodiments, the user may either lengthen or shorten the play duration of an original musical recording <b>110</b> corresponding to a given song title <b>112</b> by selecting (e.g. by a tactile input, a button press or a mouse click) a song title time button <b>312</b> found on the user input interface <b>107</b> <i>a </i>to this effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">The volume associated to each song title <b>112</b> may also be adjusted by the user by selecting to increase or decrease the volume, the increase and decrease options available on the volume adjustment button <b>314</b>. The user input interface <b>107</b>A may also allow the user to manually adjust the volume of the entire selection <b>114</b> <i>b </i>of song titles <b>112</b> by selecting a global sound button.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">The user input interface <b>107</b>A may also provide a volume effect option by selecting volume effect buttons <b>320</b> for each song title <b>112</b> in the selection <b>114</b> <i>b </i>of song titles <b>112</b>. The volume effect option for each song title alters the volume associated to the given arrangement of song segments of an original musical recording <b>110</b> by, for instance, altering the volume of the edited song recording as a function of the exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> for that song title <b>112</b> or its equalization parameters for a given workout style. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary graphical depiction of audio volume for an edited song recording corresponding to a given song title <b>112</b> and the effect of the volume effect option upon the volume of the edited song recording. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the user may select in the user input interface <b>107</b> from five volume effect levels, 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Each volume effect option accordingly alters the equalization parameters of the edited song recording as a function of the exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> associated to a given selected workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>and/or the base equalization parameters for the edited song recording, as depicted by the staircases illustrating the audio volume level for each volume effect option for the edited song recording shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the volume effect option may not uniformly decrease or increase the volume of the edited song recording, but may alter the degree at which the equalization parameters affect the volume of an edited song recording. For example, the volume effect option allows a user to switch off the volume regulation performed by the equalization parameters, or alter the volume regulation performed by the equalization parameters. For instance, referring to volume effect option 4, the audio volume level, starting at a lower volume for the first portion of the song recording depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, increases gradually as the edited song recording plays. The amplitude corresponding to the increase in volume varies as a function of the volume effect level selected by the user. For instance, selecting volume effect option 3 lessens the difference amplitude for each volume increment as a function of the equalization parameters for that given workout style.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">In some examples, the equalization parameters may lower the decibel level or volume of the edited song recording for a given portion of the edited song recording. The volume effect option <b>320</b> may allow the user to set modulate the lowering of the volume performed by the equalization parameters. For instance, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the volume effect levels may correspond to:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0155">Volume effect level 4=100%. The music volume is changed by 100% of the set decibel values as a function of the equalization parameters.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0156">Volume effect level 3=75%. The music volume is changed by 75% of the set decibel values as a function of the equalization parameters.</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0157">Volume effect level 2=50%. The music volume is changed by 50% of the set decibel values as a function of the equalization parameters.</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0158">Volume effect level 1=25%. The music volume is changed by 25% of the set decibel values as a function of the equalization parameters.</li> <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0159">Volume effect level 0=0%. The music volume is changed by 0% of the set decibel values as a function of the equalization parameters. This means that the edited song recording will play at full volume and the equalization parameters do not affect the volume of the played edited song recording.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0160">The user input interface <b>107</b>A may also provide a feature for allowing the user to add a notification signalling the completion of a portion of the workout with a designated exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b>, these portions associated with a designated song title <b>112</b>, workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>and corresponding slot row <b>305</b>. In some embodiments, the notification may also signal the end of an interval with a given burn rate as provided in the exercise burn rate pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0161">In alternative embodiments, the user input interface <b>107</b>A may also provide a trainer option <b>308</b>. The trainer is a video and/or audio that may be played, for instance, on a screen display <b>102</b> and/or the audio output interface <b>105</b> of the workout music playback device <b>100</b> or the audio and/or video player of an exercise machine received from, for example, the exercise machine interface <b>104</b>. The video and/or audio may be a video and/or audio for providing the user with additional motivation during the workout. For instance, the trainer may be a video of an exercise class with a coach, or may be the video of a coach alone providing commentary to the user in accordance with the progress of the workout. In some examples, the trainer may be that of moving scenery, similar to when a person is moving when completing a workout outside (e.g. a moving scenery akin to a jogger running in the woods; a cyclist in a group of cyclists during a race). The trainer may also provide a means of notifying the user that the user is undergoing a change in the workout, where such changes may be in workout styles, burn times, burn rates or when the user has completed or is starting a new core portion of the workout. The notification may be an audio notification added to the video or audio track, announcing the change in the workout, such as by announcing “crank it up” for an increase in burn rate, “relax” for a decrease in burn rate, or “good job, time to cooldown” for when the core portion of the workout has come to term. The notification may also be a visual queue in a video, such as a message in a text box added to the video indicating to “push harder” when there is an increase in burn rate, “slow down” when the burn rate decreases or “cooldown” when the core portion of the workout is over. The visual queue may also be the trainer in the video indicating verbally to the user that there is a change in the workout, such as by the trainer saying “push harder” when there is an increase in burn rate, “slow down” when the burn rate decreases or “cooldown” when the core portion of the workout is over.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0162">The trainer option <b>308</b> may allow the user to select from multiple available trainers, by, for instance, scrolling down a menu with a list of the possible trainers. There may be a different trainer for different possible types of exercise activities that may be performed during the workout, such as jogging, biking, rowing, boxing, etc. There may also be male trainer or female trainer options, where the trainer displayed in the video, or the voice of the trainer played in the audio, may be that of a man or that of a woman depending on the user's selection. In some embodiments, the user may also be able to select a specific celebrity athlete as a trainer from the available options.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0163">The trainer may be strictly audio (e.g. where there is no background video but only notifications announcing a change in the workout), both audio and video, including, for example, the video stream and the audio notifications, or strictly video (e.g. a video with notifications included as text in, added to, or displayed on top of the video). Table 4 is an exemplary set of trainers that a user may select from for a given workout, including an option to turn off the trainer. For instance, when the trainer for a song title is set to ‘Off’ or the trainer is strictly an audio-based trainer (i.e. no video), and the original musical recording <b>110</b> is or is tied to a music video, the video of the music video may be displayed on the screen display <b>102</b>. The person skilled in the art will understand that the trainer options of Table 4 are examples and other trainer options are possible without departing from the present teachings.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0165">The exemplary videos for each of the possible video-based trainers may be video files stored in the video source <b>140</b>. The video source <b>140</b> may be stored in memory, such as memory <b>125</b> or another memory storage module (e.g. external memory storage, cloud storage, etc.). The video file may have a wrapper format, video data with a specific video format, and/or audio data with a specific audio format. The video data and/or audio data may be compressed. The audio-based trainers may be audio files stored in the memory <b>125</b> and may be compressed or decompressed. In some examples, there may be video segments for each possible video trainer option stored in the video source <b>140</b>. The video segments may correspond to each possible change in the workout, such as the beginning of the workout, a change in burn rate, the end of the core portion of the workout, the beginning of the cooldown portion, etc. For example, there may be a video segment for the “video-female running” trainer when the workout transitions from low burn rate to medium burn rate. Therefore, the video segments for a given trainer selection may be arranged into a stream of video segments tailored for a given workout as a function of the workout parameters, providing motivational queues for the user during the workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0166">This information indicating the change in workout may be stored in the song edit data <b>101</b> as shown in Tables 2A to 2M for possible arrangements of song segments. The change in video segments may correspond to the change in exercise burn rate pattern for a given edited song recording. The length of the video segments may be adjusted as a function of the length of the portion of the workout following a given change in workout, until the next change in the workout. The length of the video segment may be adjusted by looping certain designated segments of the video segments or cutting certain designated portions of the video segments (e.g. the video segments metadata may provide allowable positions in the video segment that may be adjusted, or alternatively, portions of the video segments that may not be adjusted).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0167">As shown in Table 2A to 2M, the song edit data <b>101</b> may provide trainer sequence information for each possible arrangement of song segments of a given original musical recording, and more specifically for each of the workout styles and/or burn times for each of the possible arrangements of segments. Trainer sequence information may generate time markers in the edited song recording created from an arrangement of song segments indicating changes in the exercise burn rate pattern as well as information on the nature of that change (e.g. a change from low to medium burn rate; from medium to high burn rate; from high to low burn rate). Trainer sequence information may be retrieved from memory <b>125</b> by the media output manager <b>106</b>A as part of the song edit data <b>101</b> for a given edited song recording and workout style (or burn time). The media output manager <b>106</b>A, via the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B, may transmit trainer output instructions, along with the audio output instructions, to the media output generator <b>120</b> to retrieve from memory <b>125</b> an audio file when the trainer selection is an audio-based trainer, or when the trainer selection involves superimposing audio notifications. The trainer output instructions, generated from the song edit data <b>101</b>, as a function of the current time feedback information sent by the media output generator <b>120</b> back to the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B regarding the time lapse of the workout and the play of the edited song recording, may then provide timely instructions for inserting into the video file and/or audio file, for example, specific sound files acting as a notification of a change in the workout, indicating the change in the workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0168">When the trainer selected by the user is a video trainer, the media output manager <b>106</b>A may retrieve from the song edit data <b>101</b> the trainer sequence information, and send instructions to the video source <b>140</b> to play a given video segment corresponding to the trainer sequence information, such as the video segment corresponding to a specific change in the workout (e.g. play the medium to high burn rate transition video segment for a certain time). The video segment data may then be transmitted as a stream by the video source <b>140</b> to the screen display <b>102</b>. The screen display <b>102</b> may receive the stream of video segment data, decompress the video segment data if the video file is encoded, and play the video corresponding to the video segment data in a designated window, as in the trainer window <b>521</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The screen display <b>102</b> may adjust the length of the video segment as a function of the instructions received by the media output manager <b>106</b>A and/or video source <b>140</b>, where these instructions correspond to the exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b>. The media output manager <b>106</b>A transmits instructions to play the next video segment to the video source <b>140</b> as a function of the song edit data <b>101</b> and the time information received from the media output generator <b>120</b> (via the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B). The screen display <b>102</b> plays then the next video segment as a function of the stream of video segment data received from the video source <b>140</b>. The result is an arrangement of video segments providing a virtual trainer for the user, notifying the user of changes in the workout, the arrangement of video segments tailored to the user's selected workout parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0169">The trainer output instructions may be generated as a function of the song edit data <b>101</b> (i.e. the trainer sequence information) or from the workout configuration <b>103</b> (e.g. the instructions relating to the end of a core portion of the workout, a change in the workout style or burn time, or the end of the workout).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0170">In the examples where the trainer includes an audio component, the audio notifications indicating the changes in the workout may be mixed or inserted into the stream of workout music <b>111</b> as a function of the audio output instructions and/or trainer output instructions, where the audio notification may be played at a specific decibel level, audible over the playing stream of workout music <b>111</b>, the media output generator <b>120</b> receiving the audio output instructions and/or trainer output instructions and retrieving and assembling the audio files accordingly. For instance, the media output generator <b>120</b> may receive instructions to play an audio notification 10 seconds into the play time of an edited song recording. The media output generator <b>120</b> may retrieve and play the song segment of an original musical recording <b>110</b> from 0 sec. to 20 sec., as a function of audio output instructions (generated from the song edit data <b>101</b> and the workout configuration <b>103</b>) and at 10 sec., retrieve from memory <b>125</b> (e.g. by analyzing the metadata of the audio files for the audio notifications) the audio file corresponding to the audio notification and overlay and play the audio file of the audio notification at 10 seconds into the playing of the song segment as a function of the trainer output instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0171">The user input interface <b>107</b>A may also provide the user with a trainer enabler option <b>321</b> for each of the slot rows. The user may use the trainer enabler option <b>321</b> to disable or enable the trainer for a given song title <b>112</b> in a given slot row (e.g. each of slot rows <b>322</b>, <b>205</b> and <b>323</b>), such as by selecting “on” to enable the trainer or “off” to disable the trainer. In some examples, where the trainer is a video stream, disabling the trainer may only disable the notifications (e.g. audio or in video) of the changes in the workout, but not the streaming of the video for that workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0172">In some embodiments, when the screen display <b>102</b> is not playing a video corresponding to a virtual trainer, the screen display <b>102</b> may instead play a video of a music video when the original musical recording <b>110</b> is the audio portion of a music video. The video may be arranged and assembled similarly to that of the song segments constituting the edited song recording based on the song edit data <b>101</b> and the audio output instructions. The media output generator <b>120</b> may be configured to retrieve video data corresponding to said song recording data as a function of the audio output instructions, assemble the video segments of the video data according to the audio output instructions and send the stream of the video data to the screen display <b>102</b> via a wireless or wired (e.g. omnibus) connection wherein said original musical recording <b>110</b> is the audio of a music video. The screen display <b>102</b> may process the received video data, may decompress the video data, and play the video data as a video stream. The screen display <b>102</b> may switch from the video of the virtual trainer to the assembled music video based on the user's preferences and input provided before or during the workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0173">The input user interface <b>107</b>A may also have sub-tables, each sub-table associated with a different core portion of the workout, such as the warm up, the main workout and the cooldown. For instance, the slot rows <b>322</b> for the warm-up portion may be shown in a first warm up sub-table <b>302</b>, the slot rows <b>305</b> for the main workout portion may be shown in a second main workout sub-table <b>303</b> and the slot rows <b>323</b> for the cooldown portion may be shown in a third cooldown sub-table <b>304</b>. Each of the sub-tables may also be associated with a given sub-sequence of song titles <b>112</b>. For instance, the first warm up sub-table <b>302</b> may display the song titles <b>112</b> for the warm up sub-sequence. The second main workout sub-table <b>303</b> may display the song titles <b>112</b> for the main workout sub-sequence. The third cooldown sub-table <b>304</b> may display the song titles <b>112</b> for the cooldown sub-sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0174">The user input interface <b>107</b>A may also function as a visual display, allowing, for instance, to view a visual depiction of total exercise burn rate pattern as a function of time of the workout <b>316</b>, showing for example the change in burn rates. The visual depiction of the total exercise burn rate pattern of the workout <b>316</b> may also show the sound audio volume as a function of time, define portions of the workout and the exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> corresponding to a given song title <b>112</b>, and show the total time <b>114</b> <i>a </i>of the workout. It will be appreciated that the visual depiction of total exercise burn rate pattern of the workout <b>316</b> may show other features of the workout without departing from the present teachings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0175">The user input interface <b>107</b>A may also share with the user, such as through displaying same on the visual display of the workout music playback device <b>100</b> the workout statistics of the workout <b>317</b>, such as the respective total times of the workout corresponding to low burn rate, medium burn rate and high burn rate. The workout statistics <b>317</b> may be compiled via instructions in the code of the application program to break the time attributed to each slot row <b>305</b> (may also include the time for the slots rows <b>322</b> and the slot rows <b>323</b>) into low, medium and high burn rates, where this breaking of the time may be undertaken as a function of the parameters for each exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> associated to each song title <b>112</b> and each slot row <b>305</b>, as well as the total workout time <b>114</b> <i>a</i>. The respective times for each low, medium and high burn rates for each slot row <b>305</b> are then added up and a total number is provided respectively for the low, medium and high burn rates for the entire workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0176">The user may also save into memory the settings of a given workout, these settings corresponding to the input provided by the user into the user input interface <b>107</b> as described herein. For instance, the user may designate the workout settings with a given name designation <b>300</b> and save a file under that name designation <b>300</b> in memory. The saved file may then be retrieved by searching for the saved file displayed, for instance, on a separate pull up menu (not shown) with a list of the save file name designations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0177">In some embodiments, the workout music playback device <b>100</b> may also provide a user input interface <b>107</b> for manually altering the volume parameters and equalization parameters of a given song title <b>112</b>. In some examples, the volume parameters and equalization parameters for each song title <b>112</b> may be stored in memory of the workout music playback device <b>100</b>, where workout music playback device <b>100</b> may store a user workout configuration <b>103</b>. The workout configuration <b>103</b> may also include the alternate user volume parameters and equalization parameters, as adjusted by the user, for the original musical recording <b>110</b> corresponding to a song title <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0178">The user input interface <b>107</b>A may also provide notification displays <b>315</b> to auto-generate and communicate messages to the user as a function of the user input <b>114</b>. For instance, the notification display <b>315</b> may notify the user that the user is to add more slot rows <b>305</b> and select more song titles <b>112</b> for a given selected workout time <b>309</b>. The notification display <b>315</b> may also notify the user to remove slot rows <b>305</b> corresponding to song titles <b>112</b> for a given workout time <b>309</b>. The notification display <b>315</b> may also notify the user at what time in the final edited song recording of the workout where the workout transitions to the cooldown core portion of the workout, and that the remaining duration of an edited song recording corresponding to a song title <b>112</b> selected by the user is played as the beginning of the cooldown core portion of the workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0179">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, illustrating another exemplary user input interface <b>107</b>B. Exemplary user input interface <b>107</b>B may allow the user to provide input <b>107</b> on the time in the workout associated to a given burn rate, such as a low, medium or high burn rate. The exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> may be adjusted as a function of the user input <b>114</b>. In some examples of the exemplary workout music playback device <b>100</b> with a user input interface <b>107</b>B, the user may only be available to select between a low and high burn rate, where a burn time button <b>324</b> allows the user to select the time for the higher burn rate portion of each interval and the lower burn rate portion of each interval.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0180">The user input interface <b>107</b>B provides a burn time button <b>324</b> for each slot row <b>305</b>. The burn time button <b>324</b> may allow the user to set a burn time for a given song title <b>112</b>, which is the duration of the burn rate intervals as a function of burn rate frequency at a given burn rate (time at a given burn rate before changing to another burn rate, where examples of burn rates are: high, medium or low burn rates; or high and low burn rates). The burn time button <b>324</b> may also allow the user to scroll through a set of burn times, each burn time providing a sequence of intervals, where each interval may be of a fixed duration corresponding respectively to a higher burn rate and a lower burn rate, where the change between the higher and lower burn rates is at a given frequency. Once the user selects the burn time button <b>324</b>, a menu may appear on, for instance, the screen display <b>102</b>, displaying a list of the available burn times. The user may select one of the burn times. The media output manager <b>106</b>A may retrieve from memory song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to burn time data with respect to a given arrangement of song segments for a given song title <b>112</b>. The burn time data contains information on each of the possible selectable burn times. The media output manager <b>106</b>A may retrieve from memory the song edit data <b>101</b> specific to the burn time selected by the user for a given song title <b>112</b>. The song edit data <b>101</b> for that burn time may provide equalization parameters and time markers, the time markers indicating a shift in the equalization parameters as a function of the burn time. The change in equalization parameters may be as a function of the change in the burn rate of that specific burn time, corresponding to an exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> or be independent from the change in the burn rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0181">In alternative embodiments, the song edit data <b>101</b> may not contain data on the burn times. In these alternative embodiments, once the user selects a burn time, the workout music playback device <b>100</b> may automatically generate a set of intervals for a portion of the workout with an interval frequency corresponding to the burn time, and, optionally, a series of time markers, indicative of a change in the equalization parameters which may vary as a function of the burn rate or be independent from the desired burn rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0182">With respect to the burn times, for instance, the user may select amongst an exemplary given number of burn times, providing an interval frequency (a given time for a higher burn rate and a given time for a lower burn rate), such as those found in Table 3B. For instance, if the user selects the “M/M” option, then exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b> will provide a first 2 minute portion corresponding to a higher burn rate, and a second 2 minute portion corresponding to a lower burn rate. The person of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that the possible burn times are not limited to those provided in Table 3B.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0188">Song Segmentation:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0189"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 11B</figref> are visual representations of sound waves of exemplary arrangements of song segments each with an exercise burn rate pattern. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a visual representation of sound waves of an exemplary edited song recording <b>600</b> composed from an arrangement of song segments of an original musical recording <b>110</b> associated with a given workout style <b>114</b> <i>c</i>. The edited song recording <b>600</b> has a specific exercise burn rate pattern <b>604</b> corresponding to a given workout style <b>114</b> <i>c</i>. The exemplary exercise burn rate pattern <b>604</b> is uniform throughout the arrangement of sound recording <b>600</b> and corresponds to a low burn rate. The audio volume level for the entire edited song recording <b>600</b> is also unaltered, remaining, in this example, at full volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0190"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates another exemplary edited sound recording <b>700</b> arranged from song segments of an original musical recording <b>110</b>, associated to a given workout style. In this example, the exemplary exercise burn rate pattern <b>704</b> corresponds to a burn rate that varies throughout the edited sound recording <b>700</b>. For instance, the intro portion <b>701</b> of the edited song recording <b>700</b> and the outro portion <b>703</b> of the edited song recording <b>700</b> correspond to a low burn rate. The verse 1 portion <b>705</b>, the verse 2 portion <b>707</b>, the verse 3 portion <b>709</b> correspond to a medium burn rate. The chorus <b>1</b> portion <b>706</b>, the chorus <b>2</b> portion <b>708</b>, the chorus <b>3</b> portion <b>710</b> and the final verse portion <b>711</b> correspond to a high burn rate. The audio volume level for different portions <b>702</b> of the edited sound recording <b>700</b> may be adjusted depending on the exercise burn rate pattern <b>704</b>. For example, the audio volume level of the intro portion <b>701</b>, corresponding to a low burn rate as a function of the exercise burn rate portion <b>704</b>, is lower than the audio volume level of the verse 1 portion <b>705</b>, corresponding to a medium burn rate as a function of the exercise burn rate pattern <b>704</b>, which is in turn lower than the chorus <b>1</b> portion <b>706</b> corresponding to a high burn rate as a function of the exercise burn rate pattern <b>704</b>. In some embodiments, the audio volume level of each portion <b>702</b> of the edited song recording <b>700</b> may be modulated by the media output generator <b>120</b> as a function of instructions received from the media output manager <b>106</b>A, such as by obtaining the burn rate for a specific portion <b>702</b> of the edited song recording <b>700</b> as a function of the exercise burn rate pattern <b>704</b>, and applying a volume modulation factor on the audio volume level parameter for the portion <b>702</b>, such as, for example, an audio volume level parameter or equalization parameter for the portion <b>702</b> stored in the song edit metadata for the edited song recording <b>700</b>, the portion of the song edit data <b>101</b> associated to the edited song recording <b>700</b> corresponding to the selected workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>with the given exercise burn rate pattern <b>704</b>. The equalization parameters may also alter the volume of the edited song recording <b>700</b> for a given portion corresponding to an interval with a same burn rate. For instance, without portions <b>710</b> and <b>711</b> of the edited song recording <b>700</b>, the burn rate is maintained at high. However, the volume increases from portions <b>710</b> to <b>711</b>, within an interval with a constant burn rate. In some embodiments, the volume may also decrease within a portion of an edited song recording with the same burn rate, such as when a cooldown portion of an edited song recording is set at a low burn rate and the decrease in volume contributes to the user cooling down.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0191">Methods for Arranging Song Segments:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0192">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an exemplary method <b>400</b> for producing audio output instructions transmitted to a media output generator <b>120</b> for producing a stream of workout music <b>111</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0193">The media output manager <b>106</b>A first obtains from, for instance, the workout configuration <b>103</b>, the total workout time such as the total workout time <b>114</b> <i>a </i>input by the user at step <b>401</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0194">Then the media output manager <b>106</b>A subtracts from the workout time <b>114</b> <i>a </i>the time value for each song title <b>112</b> of which the time of the song title <b>112</b> was preselected by the user at step <b>402</b> (e.g. when the user elects to use the song title time buttons <b>312</b> to set the time for a song title <b>112</b> to a preselected time). As the time of these song titles <b>112</b> have been preselected by the user, the time associated with each of these song titles <b>112</b> is fixed. Once the time value associated to the song titles <b>112</b> preselected by the user have been subtracted from the workout time value, this subtraction yields a net remaining time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0195">The time value of the net remaining time is then divided by the number of song titles <b>112</b> in the selection <b>114</b> <i>b </i>of song titles where the time for the song titles <b>112</b> have not been preselected by the user at step <b>403</b>. This operation provides the average time value for each of the song titles <b>112</b> where the time for these song titles <b>112</b> has not been preselected by the user (the “average time value”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0196">In some embodiments, the media output manager <b>106</b>A retrieves the master song edit metadata corresponding to each of the song titles <b>112</b> selected by the user for which the time for these song titles <b>112</b> has not been preselected by the user. The retrieval may be performed by parsing the characters of the song title <b>112</b> selected by the user and comparing this sequence of characters with those stored in memory in the identifier portion of each master song edit metadata of the song edit data <b>101</b> for each song title <b>112</b>. If the comparison yields a positive result, then song edit metadata for the song edit data <b>101</b> is analyzed. The information on play duration in the song edit data <b>101</b> for each possible arrangement of song segments for the song title <b>112</b> is then retrieved and compared to the average time value. In some embodiments, the media output manager <b>106</b>A identifies from the portion of the song edit data <b>101</b> with instructions for producing the edited song recording with the nearest yet higher play duration to that of the calculated average time value. In alternative embodiments, the media output manager <b>106</b>A may identify the data for producing the edited song recording corresponding to the song title <b>112</b> with the nearest play duration to that of the average time value, may it be lower or higher to the average time value, taking into account, for instance, the duration of the possible other edited song recordings for the other song titles <b>112</b> selected by the user for the workout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0197">In the case where the user has pre-selected a time duration for a given song title <b>112</b>, such as by using song title time button <b>312</b>, the media output manager <b>106</b>A compares the time duration values of the different arrangements of song segments of the song title <b>112</b> with a time pre-selected by the user. The media output manager <b>106</b>A may retain the song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to the arrangement of song segments for each song title <b>112</b> with a play duration closest to the time duration of the song title <b>112</b> as pre-selected by the user. In some embodiments, the media output manager <b>106</b>A may select the song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to the arrangement of song segments for each song title <b>112</b> corresponding to the nearest yet longer song duration such as when the time duration for the song title <b>112</b> is pre-selected by the user (e.g. the user chooses a song duration input using the song title time button <b>312</b>). The selected song edit data for producing an edited song recording of a desired length from an arrangement of song segments may have safe trimming portions (such as portion <b>18</b>C shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), corresponding to portions of the edited song recording which may be trimmed by, for instance, the media output generator <b>120</b> as a function of the audio output instructions received from the media output manager <b>106</b>A, to reach the desired duration as selected by the user. The locations in the edited song recording of the safe trimming portions may be identified and stored in the song edit data <b>101</b> for producing each possible arrangement of song segments for an original musical recording <b>110</b>. For instance, if the duration of the edited song recording is too long by a number of seconds when compared to the time duration for the song title <b>112</b> pre-selected by the user, then the media output manager <b>106</b>A may include instructions in the audio output instructions to trim the edited song recording by skipping a portion of the edited song recording, where the duration of the skipped portion is equal or near to the time needed to reach the time duration for the song title <b>112</b> pre-selected by the user (and/or by ending the edited song recording prematurely within the safe trimming portion found in the outro portion of the arrangement of song segments), as long as the edited song recording begins within what is identified as its safe trimming portion. The safe trimming portions of the edited song recording may correspond respectively to its intro and outro.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0198">In the embodiments where the arrangement of song segments selected by the media output manager <b>106</b>A has the nearest yet higher play duration to that of the average time value, if the selected arrangement of song segments does not have a play duration equal to the average time value, then the media output manager <b>106</b>A may adjust the play duration of the selected arrangement of song segments for constituting the edited song recording. For instance, the arrangement of song segments may have certain song segments identified as safe trimming portions. The safe trimming portions of the arrangement of song segments may be identified and stored as part of the song edit data <b>101</b> for generating the edited song recording. The safe trimming portions may be identified with time markers corresponding to the start and finish of the safe trimming portions, these time markers stored as information in the song edit data <b>101</b> for each arrangement of song segments of an original musical recording <b>110</b>, retrievable by the media output manager <b>106</b>A when obtaining information for producing the information sent by the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B as the audio output instructions. There may be one, or more than one safe trimming portion, for each arrangement of song segments of an original musical recording <b>110</b>. The duration and/or number of the safe trimming portions may vary between different arrangements of song segments for a same original musical recording <b>110</b>. The duration and/or number of safe trimming portions may also vary between different arrangements of song segments of original musical recordings <b>110</b>. In some exemplary embodiments, the safe trimming portions may correspond to the intro and outro portions of the selected edited song recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0199">In some embodiments, when the average time value is less than the play duration of the arrangement of song segments selected by the media output manager <b>106</b>A to form the edited song recording, then the media output manager <b>106</b>A may include instructions to trim a portion of the play duration of the arrangement of song segments (e.g. by not including in the edited song recording some of the song segments) to the extent necessary to match the average time value. For instance, the media output manager <b>106</b>A may transmit instructions (e.g. via the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B) to skip certain first song segments in the arrangement of song segments (e.g. starting with song segment corresponding to the 2 second time marker in the arrangement of song segments, and not the time marker at 0 seconds), the time of the skipped song segments corresponding to the difference between the original play duration of the arrangement of song segments and the average time value. In this example, the designated time for starting the arrangement of song segments is to fall within the safe trimming portion (e.g. in the case when the safe trimming portion corresponds to the intro of the selected edited song recording or is a designated portion at the beginning of the arrangement of song segments). In another example, the selected arrangement of song segments may end prematurely, skipping at least one segment towards the end of the arrangement of song segments, in order for the play duration of the edited song recording to match the average time value, as long as the ending falls within the safe trimming portion (e.g. in the case when the safe trimming portion corresponds to the outro of the arrangement of song segments). In other examples, in order for the play duration of the edited song recording to equal the average time value, the edited song recording may both start at a designated time within the intro safe trimming portion of the arrangement of song segments and end prematurely within the outro safe trimming portion of the arrangement of song segments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0200">The trimming of the play duration of the arrangement of song segments may be repeated for each song title <b>112</b> selected by the user and may apply to arrangements of song recordings corresponding to a song title <b>112</b> with a time value that has not been preselected by the user and with a time value that has been selected by a user. When calculating the trimming of each arrangement of song recordings, the media output manager <b>106</b> may consider the time marker of the optimal point to end the workout of the arrangement of song segments for the last song title <b>112</b> to be played in the selection of song titles <b>114</b> <i>b</i>. The optimal point to end the workout may be stored in the song edit data <b>101</b> for the edited song recording to be played last in the stream of workout music <b>111</b>, the identification in memory of the song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to the optimal point to end a workout provided by accessing the song edit metadata of the song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to the arrangement of song segments for constituting the edited song recording to be lastly played in the stream of workout music <b>111</b>. The media output manager <b>106</b>A may transmit audio output instructions via the instruction relay model <b>106</b>B to play the portion of the last edited song recording following the optimal point to end the workout after the core workout portion (e.g. the cooldown portion of the workout), by, for example, adding the time of the portion of the edited song recording following the optimal point to end a workout to the cooldown portion of the workout, and to the total time of the workout. The media output manager <b>106</b>A may also select song edit data <b>101</b> to create an edited song recording with a longer length to account for the loss resulting from applying the time marker for the optimal point to end the workout, and in order to match and equal the user's selected workout time for the core portion of the workout. For instance, if the optimal point to end a workout marker ends an edited song recording 10 seconds prematurely, then the edited song recording for arrangement selected by the media output manager <b>106</b>A may take into account the 10 seconds following the optimal point to end the workout and add this time to the cooldown portion of the workout. In some embodiments, when trimming the arrangement of song segments so as to fit the length of all of the edited song recordings corresponding to the selection of song titles <b>114</b> <i>b </i>into the total workout time, the trimming may be done to both the arrangement of song titles corresponding to song titles with a time that has been pre-selected by a user and with a time that has not been pre-selected by a user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0201">Once the adjustment of the arrangements of song segments is complete, the media output manager <b>106</b>A then compares the non-final total workout music time value with the total time of the workout selected by the user. If both values are equal, the media output manager <b>106</b>A may then proceed with sending the information to the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B for relaying the audio output instructions to the media output generator <b>120</b> for generating the audio data stream corresponding to the stream of workout music <b>111</b>. If both values do not equal, then the media output manager <b>106</b>A may further adjust the arrangement of song segments for producing the edited song recordings as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0202">The media output manager <b>106</b>A may be unable to assemble edited song recordings corresponding to the selection of song titles <b>112</b> with a total time value that matches the input time value of the workout time <b>114</b> <i>a </i>because, for example, the selected workout time may be too long or too short with regard to the number of song titles <b>112</b> (and the lengths of their possible edited song recordings). In these cases, the workout music playback device <b>100</b> may either notify the user to add or remove song titles <b>112</b> from the user's selection of song titles <b>112</b>, or to increase or decrease the input time value of the workout time value <b>114</b> <i>a </i>at step <b>406</b>. For example, the total time value of the shortest available edited song recording for a given original musical recording <b>110</b> for a selected song title <b>112</b>, following trimming of the safe trimming portions of each of its arrangements of song segments, may still be greater than the input time value of the workout time <b>114</b> <i>a</i>. In this example, the workout music playback device <b>100</b> may notify the user to either increase the input time value of the workout time <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, or remove song titles <b>112</b> from the user's selection of song titles <b>114</b> <i>b</i>. In another example, the total time value of all of the longest edited song recordings for an original musical recording <b>110</b> for a selected set of song titles <b>112</b>, without trimming any of the safe trimming portions of each of the edited song recordings, may still be less than the input time value of the workout time <b>114</b> <i>a</i>. In this example, the workout music playback device <b>100</b> may notify the user to either decrease the input time value of the workout time <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, or add song titles <b>112</b> from the user's selection of song titles <b>114</b> <i>b</i>. In these examples, the user may have to alter the user's selection <b>114</b> <i>b </i>of song titles <b>112</b>, or the time value of the workout time <b>114</b> <i>a </i>before reinitiating the creation of the stream of workout music <b>111</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0203">The method for arranging song segments described herein permits the lengthening or shortening of an original musical recording <b>110</b> without altering the beats per minute or the speed of the original musical recording <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0204">The media output manager <b>106</b>A may also provide information on the equalization parameters for the song segments in the arrangements of song segments, the change in equalization over time corresponding to the equalization parameters for each selected arrangement of song segments.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0205">The media output manager <b>106</b>A retrieves from the workout music playback device's memory <b>125</b> the song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to the arrangement of song segments to form the edited song recording with the desired play duration for a given song title <b>112</b>. This may be done by first identifying the master song edit metadata corresponding to song title <b>112</b> selected by the user by comparing, for instance, a string of characters of the song title with the identifier for the arrangements of song segments of the corresponding original musical recording <b>110</b> found in its master song edit metadata. Once the master song edit metadata has been identified, the corresponding song edit metadata for the selected arrangement of song segments with the desired play duration may be retrieved and analyzed. The song edit data corresponding to the selected workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>or burn time may be further identified by, for example, comparing the characters of the name of the selected workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>or burn time with that of the identifier in the song edit metadata portion for each workout style or burn time. Once the song edit data portion corresponding to the selected workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>or burn time has been identified, the media output manager <b>106</b>A may retrieve the song edit data <b>101</b> corresponding to the exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b>, such as the given burn rate intervals and time markers indicating a shift in the burn rate for the given workout style, and the equalization parameters as a function of play duration, the time markers of the arrangement of song segments identifying a change in the equalization of the arrangement of song segments and data to generate a visual representation of the change in burn rate as a function of time (and in some cases to generate a visual representation of the equalization parameters and volume as a function of time). The media output manager <b>106</b>A may then transmit to the instruction output relay <b>106</b>B, along with the song title <b>112</b> and the time markers for generating the arrangement of song segments for each of the song titles <b>112</b> in the selection of song titles, the corresponding equalization parameters and time markers indicating a change in the equalization parameters, and the burn rate (e.g. low, medium or high burn rate) over time for generating the exercise burn rate pattern <b>113</b>.</div>

The media output manager <b>106</b>A may then retrieve song edit data <b>101</b> of the arrangement of song segments for creating the edited song recording to be swapped in, where in some examples the workout style <b>114</b> <i>c </i>between the swapped out and swapped in edited song recordings remain the same. In accordance with the current time information received from the media output generator <b>120</b>, the media output manager <b>106</b>A, via the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B, may also provide audio output instructions to play the song segment corresponding to the time in the arrangement of song segments so that the newly selected edited song recording begins to play at a given point so that no additional time is added to the total workout time (e.g. at the same relative position where the edited song recording that has been swapped out stopped playing). Trimming of the new arrangement of song segments that has been swapped in may also be applied if necessary to match the play duration of the swapped inedited song recording with the desired total workout time. In some examples, the burn rate of the swapped in edited song recording is the same as the burn rate of the swapped out edited song recording. In some embodiments, the workout configuration received by the media output manager <b>106</b>A may be altered as a function of the received swap instructions, so as to replace the song title <b>112</b> being played (and part of the former workout configuration) with the newly selected song title <b>112</b> made by the user, where the changes are stored, for instance, as information in the workout configuration <b>103</b>.</div>

Once the media output manager <b>106</b>A receives the user input to swap a song, the media output manager <b>106</b>A may use a random number generator, as is known in the art, where the random number generator may output a fixed set of numbers, each of these number associated to a song title of the selection of the song title <b>114</b> <i>b</i>. The media output manager <b>106</b>A may then retrieve the song edit data <b>101</b> for the song title <b>112</b> corresponding to the number randomly generated by the random number generator. The media output manager <b>106</b>A, via the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B, may provide audio output instructions to stop playing the current song title <b>112</b> and play the edited song recording from the arrangement of song segments (information on the arrangement of song segments retrieved from the song edit data <b>101</b> of the song title <b>112</b> corresponding to the randomly generated number) of the song title <b>112</b> corresponding to the randomly generated number, starting with the song segment in the arrangement of song segments with a remaining play time that may correspond to that of the song title <b>112</b> that is being shuffled out, so as not to add any extra time to the total workout time. The play time of the song title <b>112</b> that is being shuffled out may be obtained from the current time information received from the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B, generated from the media output generator <b>120</b>. In some examples, the burn rate of the shuffled in edited song recording is the same as the burn rate of the shuffled out edited song recording.

For example, the random sequence of song titles <b>112</b> may be provided by using a random number generator, as is known in the art, processed by the workout music playback device <b>100</b>, where the random number generator may output a fixed set of numbers, where the number of numbers in the fixed set of numbers corresponds to the number of song titles <b>112</b> in the sequence of song titles <b>112</b> selected by the user for the workout. The sequence of numbers generated by the random number generator may correspond to the new sequence of song titles <b>112</b> when using the song swap option <b>513</b>, where each number is associated to a song title <b>112</b>. Deactivating the random shuffle song title <b>112</b> feature by, for instance, selecting the song swap option <b>513</b>, would return the stream of workout music <b>111</b> to the original sequence, as selected by the user and which may be saved as part of the workout configuration <b>103</b> for the given workout. The media output manager <b>106</b>A, via the instruction relay module <b>106</b>B, may transmit audio output instructions to the media output generator <b>120</b> to play the edited song recording corresponding to the song title <b>112</b> and the required play time, where the first song segment of the arrangement of song segments played as the edited song recording may be based on the current time lapse of the workout if the song swap button <b>513</b> and the random shuffle song title <b>112</b> feature was not selected by the user (e.g. not altering the total workout duration).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0244">In some embodiments, the user may access statistics pertaining to the user's workout statistics for each workout, with specific statistics relating to each song title <b>112</b> and configurations selected for that given song title, such as the workout style (and exercise burn rate pattern), burn time, volume pattern, volume effect options. The statistics may show the song titles selected for that workout, the workout style chosen and exercise burn rate pattern applied, and the user's performance for each portion of the workout corresponding to a given song title <b>112</b> as well as the overall performance of the user for that given workout. The user may also access statistics for a given song title <b>112</b>, such as the performance of the user each time the song title <b>112</b> is played during a workout, as well as an average performance for all the workouts when the song title <b>112</b> has been played. These statistics may allow the user to compare the user's performance, calorie consumption, heart rate, and so forth, as a function of the input workout parameters and the song title <b>112</b> selected. For instance, the user may realize that a certain song title <b>112</b> played towards the end of the workout yields a far better performance than another song title <b>112</b>. As another example, the statistics may share with the user that selecting a given song title <b>112</b> with a certain workout style leads to greater calorie consumption (e.g. as a result of exercise intensity as that particular song title <b>112</b> played) than when the user selects another song title <b>112</b> with that same workout style. Furthermore, another example is that the user may view the user's performance drop when the interval volume effect option <b>320</b> reduces the effect of the equalization parameters for a given workout style than when the equalization parameters are fully applied. These statistics may be transmitted wirelessly (or, in some cases, via a wired connection) by the exercise machine <b>1501</b> to the workout music playback device or to external memory storage, such as cloud storage, which may then be retrieved by the user via, for example, a webpage or a graphical interface of the workout music playback device, the computing device <b>1502</b> or the user's portable computer <b>1504</b>. The statistics feature may be available for a gym setup, for private home exercise equipment or when using mobile devices such as a GPS receiver or biometric reading devices.
