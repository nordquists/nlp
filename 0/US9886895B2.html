<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an OLED panel having an organic OLED (OLED: organic light emitting device) formed on a substrate, sealed between the substrate and a cover material. Moreover, it relates to an OLED module having an IC, or the like including a controller packaged on the OLED panel. In this specification, both the OLED panel and the OLED module are referred to as the light emitting device. Furthermore, the present invention relates to an electronic appliance using the light emitting device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The OLED itself emits a light so as to provide a high visibility so that backlighting necessary for a liquid crystal display device (LCD) is not required, and thus it is suitable for providing a thin shape as well as the view angle is not limited. Therefore, recently, a light emitting device using an OLED attracts the attention as the display device for replacing the CRT and the LCD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The OLED has a layer including an organic compound (organic light emitting material) for obtaining a luminescence (electroluminescence) to be generated by the application of the electric field (hereinafter referred to as an organic light emitting layer), an anode layer, and a cathode layer. The luminescence in an organic compound include the light emission (fluorescence) at the time of returning from the singlet excitation state to the ground state, and the light emission (phosphorescence) at the time of returning from the triplet excitation state to the ground state. In the light emitting device of the present invention, either one of the above-mentioned light emissions may be used, or both of the light emissions may be used as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In this specification, all the layers provided between the anode and the cathode of the OLED are defined to be an organic light emitting layer. Specifically, the organic light emitting layers include a light emitting layer, a positive hole injecting layer, an electron injecting layer, a positive hole transporting layer, an electron transporting layer, or the like. Basically, the OLED has a structure with the anode, the light emitting layer, and the cathode successively. In addition to the structure, it may have a structure with the anode, the positive hole injecting layer, the light emitting layer, and the cathode, or a structure with the anode, the positive hole injecting layer, the light emitting layer, the electron transporting layer, the cathode, or the like in this order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">It has been problematic at the time of putting the light emitting device into practice that the luminance of the OLED is lowered according to deterioration of the organic light emitting material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The organic light emitting material is weak with respect to the moisture content, the oxygen, the light, and the heat so that deterioration is promoted thereby. Specifically, the deterioration rate depends on the structure of the device for driving the light emitting device, the characteristics of the organic light emitting material, the material of the electrode, the condition in the production step, the driving method for the light emitting device, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Even in the case the voltage applied on the organic light emitting layer is constant, if the organic light emitting layer is deteriorated, the luminance of the OLED is lowered so that the displayed image is not sharp. In this specification, a voltage applied to the organic light emitting layer from a pair of electrodes is defined to be an OLED driving voltage (Vel).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, in a color display method using three kinds of the OLEDs corresponding to R (red), G (green), and B (blue), the organic light emitting material comprising the organic light emitting layer differs depending on the color corresponding to the OLED. Therefore, the organic light emitting layers may deteriorate by different rates according to the corresponding color. In this case, the luminance of the OLED differs per each color so that an image having a desired color cannot be displayed on the light emitting device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the temperature of the organic light emitting layer depends on the heat of the external atmosphere, temperature of the heat generated by the OLED panel itself, or the like. In general, the OLED has the flowing current value changed according to the temperature. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows the change of the voltage current characteristics of the OLED with the temperature of the organic light emitting layer changed. In the case the voltage is constant, if the temperature of the organic light emitting layer is raised, the OLED driving current is enlarged. Since the OLED driving current and the luminance of the OLED have a proportional relationship, the higher the OLED driving current is, the higher the luminance of the OLED is. Accordingly, since the luminance of the OLED is changed depending on the temperature of the organic light emitting layer, it is difficult to display a desired gradient so that the current consumption of the light emitting device is enlarged according to the temperature rise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, in general, since the degree of the change of the OLED driving current by the temperature change differs depending on the kind of the organic light emitting material, the luminance of the OLEDs of each color may change independently by the temperature in the color display. In the case the luminance of each color is not balanced, desired color cannot be displayed.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, in view of the above-mentioned circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a light emitting device capable of obtaining a constant luminance regardless of the organic light emitting layer deterioration or the temperature change, and further capable of providing a desired color display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The present inventor has paid attention to the fact that the OLED luminance decline by the deterioration is smaller in the latter case in comparison between the light emission with the OLED driving voltage maintained constantly (the former case) and the light emission with the current flowing in the OLED maintained constantly (the latter case). In this specification, the current flowing in the OLED is referred to as the OLED driving current (Iel). Then, it is considered that the change of the OLED luminance by the OLED deterioration can be prevented by controlling the OLED luminance not by the voltage but by the current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Specifically, in the present invention, a current mirror circuit comprising a transistor is provided in each pixel so that the OLED driving current is controlled using the current mirror circuit. Then, the first transistor and the second transistor of the current mirror circuit are connected such that the drain currents thereof can be maintained at the substantially equal value regardless of the load resistance value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In this specification, a size of a current is an absolute value of a current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The first transistor has the drain current thereof controlled by a signal line driving circuit. Since the size of the drain current I<sub>1 </sub>is provided always equal to the size of the drain current I<sub>2 </sub>of the second transistor regardless of the load resistance value, as a result, the drain current I<sub>2 </sub>of the second transistor is controlled by the signal line driving circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The second transistor is connected such that the drain current I<sub>2 </sub>thereof flows into the OLED. Therefore, the value of the OLED driving current flowing in the OLED is controlled not by the load resistance but by the signal driving circuit. In other words, the OLED driving current can be controlled at a desired value regardless of the difference of the transistor characteristics, deterioration of the OLED, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In the present invention, according to the above-mentioned configuration, decline of the luminance of the OLED can be restrained even in the case the organic light emitting layer is deteriorated, and as a result, a sharp image can be displayed. Moreover, in the case of a color display light emitting device using the OLED corresponding to each color, even in the case the organic light emitting layers of the OLED are deteriorated by different rates per each corresponding color, a desired color can be displayed by preventing deterioration of the balance of the luminance among the colors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, even in the case the temperature of the organic light emitting layer is influenced by the external atmosphere temperature, the heat generated by the OLED panel itself, or the like, the OLED driving current can be controlled at a desired value. Therefore, since the OLED driving current and the luminance of the OLED are proportional, change of the luminance of the OLED can be restrained, and further, increase of the current consumption according to the temperature rise can be prevented. Moreover, in the case of a color display light emitting device, since change of the luminance of the OLED of each color can be restrained regardless of the temperature change, deterioration of the balance of the luminance among the colors can be prevented so that a desired color can be displayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, in general, since the degree of the change of the OLED driving current in the temperature change differs depending on the kind of the organic light emitting material, the luminance of the OLED of each color can be changed independently in the color display. However, according to the light emitting device of the present invention, since a desired luminance can be obtained regardless of the temperature change, deterioration of the balance of the luminance among the colors can be prevented so that a desired color can be displayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Moreover, in an ordinary light emitting device, since the wiring for supplying the current to each pixel itself has a resistance, the potential thereof is slightly lowered depending on the length of the wiring. The potential decline differs largely depending also on the image to be displayed. In particular, in the case the ratio of pixels of a high gradient number is high in a plurality of pixels having the current supplied from the same wiring, the current flowing in the wiring is increased so that the potential decline becomes conspicuous. In the case the potential is lowered, since the voltage applied on the OLED Of each pixel becomes small, the current supplied to each pixel becomes small. Therefore, even in the case a constant gradient is to be displayed in a predetermined pixel, if the gradient number of the other pixel having the current supplied from the same wiring is changed, the current supplied to the predetermined pixel is changed thereby so that the gradient number is changed as a result. However, according to the light emitting device of the present invention, since the OLED current can be corrected by obtaining the measured value and the reference value for each image to be displayed, a desired gradient number can be displayed by the correction even in the case the image to be displayed is changed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In the light emitting device of the present invention, the transistor to be used for the pixel may be a transistor using a single crystal silicon, or a thin film transistor using a polycrystalline silicon or an amorphous silicon.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Since the transistor Tr<b>3</b> and the transistor Tr<b>4</b> are in the on state, in the case a constant current Ic is provided in the signal line Si, the constant current Ic flows between the drain area and the source area of the transistor TR<b>1</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In the formula 1, all of μ, C<sub>o</sub>, W/L, and V<sub>TH </sub>are a fixed value determined by each transistor.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The gate electrode of the transistor Tr<b>2</b> is connected with the gate electrode of the transistor Tr<b>1</b>. Moreover, the source area of the transistor Tr<b>2</b> is connected with the source area of the transistor Tr<b>1</b>. As a result, the gate voltage of the transistor Tr<b>1</b> becomes the gate voltage of the transistor Tr<b>2</b>. Therefore, the drain current I<sub>2 </sub>of the transistor Tr<b>2</b> is maintained in the same size as the drain current of the transistor Tr<b>1</b>. That is, I<sub>2</sub>=Ic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The drain current I<sub>2 </sub>of the transistor Tr<b>2</b> flows into the OLED <b>104</b>. Therefore, the OLED driving current has the same size as that of the constant current Ic determined in the constant current source <b>107</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">In the present invention, according to the above-mentioned configuration, decline of the luminance of the OLED can be restrained even in the case the organic light emitting layer is deteriorated, and as a result, a sharp image can be displayed. Moreover, in the case of a color display light emitting device using an OLED corresponding to each color, a desired color can be displayed by preventing collapse of the luminance balance of each color even in the case the organic light emitting layers of the OLED are deteriorated by different rates per each corresponding color.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Moreover, even in the case the temperature of the organic light emitting layer is influenced by the external atmosphere temperature, the heat generated by the OLED panel itself, or the like, the OLED driving current can be controlled at a desired value. Therefore, since the OLED driving current and the OLED luminance are proportional, change of the OLED luminance can be restrained as well as increase of the current consumption according to the temperature rise can be prevented. Moreover, in the case of the color display light emitting device, since the luminance change of the OLED of each color can be restrained without influence by the temperature change, collapse of the luminance balance of each color can be prevented, and thus a desired color can be displayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">Furthermore, since the OLED driving current change degree by the temperature in general differs depending on the kind of the organic light emitting material, the OLED luminance of each color in the color display may be changed independently by the temperature. However, according to the light emitting device of the present invention, since a desired luminance can be obtained without influence by the temperature change, collapse of the luminance balance of each color can be prevented so that a desired color can be displayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Moreover, since the wiring for supplying a current to each pixel itself has a resistance in a common light emitting device, the potential thereof is slightly lowered depending on the wiring length. The potential decline differs largely also by the image to be displayed. In particular, in the case the ratio of pixels with a high gradient number is large in a plurality of the pixels having a current supplied from the same wiring, the current flowing in the wiring becomes large so that the potential decline appears significantly. Since the voltage on each OLED of each pixel becomes small in the case of the potential decline, the current supplied to each pixel becomes small. Therefore, even if a constant gradient is to be displayed in a predetermined pixel, if the gradient number of the other pixel having the current supplied from the same wiring is changed, the current supplied to the predetermined pixel is changed accordingly, and consequently, the gradient number is changed as well. However, according to the light emitting device of the present invention, since the OLED current can be corrected by obtaining the measured value and the reference value for each image to be displayed, a desired gradient number can be displayed by correction even in the case the image to be displayed is changed.</div>

The semiconductor layers <b>902</b> to <b>905</b> are formed by a 25 to 80 nm (preferably 30 to 60 nm) thickness. The material for the crystalline semiconductor films is not particularly limited, but it is formed preferably with a silicon or a silicon germanium (Si<sub>X</sub>Ge<sub>1-X </sub>(X=0.0001 to 0.02)) alloy. In this example, after forming a 55 nm amorphous silicon film using the plasma CVD method, a solution containing a nickel is maintained on the amorphous silicon film. After executing dehydration (500° C., 1 hour) to the amorphous silicon film, a thermal crystallization (550° C., 4 hours) was executed, and further, a laser annealing process was executed for improving the crystallization was executed for forming a crystalline silicon film.

The heat resistant conductive layer contains an element selected from the group consisting of a Ta, a Ti, and a W, an alloy containing the elements as a component, or an alloy film as a combination of the elements. The heat resistant conductive layer is formed by a sputtering method or a CVD method. In order to achieve a low resistance, it is preferable to reduce the concentration of a contained impurity. In particular, it is preferable to have the oxygen concentration of 30 ppm or less. In this example, the W film was formed by a 300 nm thickness. The W film can be formed by a sputtering method with a W used as a target, or it can be formed also by a method using a tungsten hexafluoride (WF<sub>6</sub>). In either case, in order to use as a gate electrode, a low resistance should be achieved, and it is preferable to have the W film resistivity at 20 μΩcm or less. Although a low resistivity can be achieved in the W film by enlarging the crystal grains, in the case a large amount of an impurity element such as an oxygen is contained in the W, the crystallization is prohibited so as to have a high resistivity. Thereby, in the case of the sputtering method, by forming the W film using a W target of a 99.9999% purity with sufficient attention paid for avoiding inclusion of impurities from the gas phase at the time of film formation, a 9 to 20 μΩcm resistivity can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">In contrast, in the case a Ta film is used for the heat resistant conductive layer <b>907</b>, similarly, it can be formed by the sputtering method. For the Ta film, an Ar is used as the sputtering gas. Moreover, by adding an appropriate amount of a Xe or a Kr in the gas at the time of sputtering, peel off of the film can be prevented by alleviating the internal stress of the film to be formed. The resistivity of the Ta film of an a phase is about 20 μΩcm so that it can be used as the gate electrode, but the resistivity of the Ta film of a β phase is about 180 μΩcm so that it cannot be suitable for the gate electrode. Since a TaN film has a crystal structure close to the α phase, by forming the TaN film as the base for the Ta film, the Ta film of the α phase can be obtained easily. Moreover, although it is not shown in the figure, it is effective to form a silicon film with a phosphorus (P) doped by about a 2 to 20 nm thickness below the heat resistant conductive layer <b>907</b>. Thereby, improvement of the close contact property of the conductive film to be formed thereon and oxidation prevention can be achieved as well as diffusion of an alkaline metal element contained in the heat resistant conductive layer <b>907</b> by a slight amount to the gate insulated film <b>906</b> of the first shape can be prevented. In either case, it is preferable to have the resistivity of the heat resistant conductive layer <b>907</b> in a range of 10 to 50 μΩcm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Next, a mask <b>908</b> of a resist is formed using the photolithography technique. Then, the first etching process is executed.

By introducing the RF (13.56 MHz) power of 224 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>also to the substrate side (specimen stage), a substantially negative self bias voltage is applied. In this condition, the W film etching rate is about 100 nm/min. For the first etching process, the time needed for just etching the W film was estimated based on the etching rate, and the etching time increased by 20% therefrom was set to be the etching time.</div>

In order to etch without leaving a residue, an over etching of increasing the etching time by a ratio of about 10 to 20% was applied. Since the selection ratio of the silicon nitride oxide film (gate insulated film <b>906</b>) with respect to the W film is 2 to 4 (representatively 3), the surface with the silicon nitride oxide film exposed can be etched by about 20 to 50 nm by the over etching process (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Then, by executing the first doping process, the one conductive type impurity element is added to the semiconductor layer.

Thereby, conductive layers <b>918</b> to <b>921</b> having the second shape formed by the condition can be provided. A tapered part is formed on the end part thereof, with a tapered shape with the thickness increased from the end part to inward.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">Then, source wirings <b>940</b> to <b>943</b> and drain wirings <b>944</b> to <b>946</b> are formed by forming a conductive metal film by the sputtering method or the vacuum deposition method, patterning with a mask, and etching. Although it is not shown in the figure, in this specification, the connection wirings are formed as a laminated film of a Ti film of a 50 nm film thickness, and an alloy film (an alloy film of an Al and a Ti) of a 500 nm film thickness.</div>

Unlike the case of the example 1, since the organic light emitting layer formed on the third interlayer insulated film <b>982</b> is not divided, deterioration of the organic light emitting layer derived from a grade difference can involve a significant problem unless the side wall of the opening part is sufficiently smooth, attention should be paid thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">In this example, as the third interlayer insulated film <b>982</b>, in some cases, an organic resin film made of a polyimide, a polyamide, an acrylic, BCB (benzocyclo butene), or the like can be used as well.</div>

Although a copper is used in this example, the conductive layer <b>806</b> material is not limited thereto, and a known metal material having a resistance lower than that of the counter electrode can be used. Since the resistance of the counter electrode to be formed later can be lowered by forming the conductive layer <b>806</b> in this example, it is suitable for enlargement of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">Next, a counter electrode <b>804</b> comprising a transparent conductive film is formed covering the organic light emitting layers <b>803</b> <i>r</i>, <b>803</b> <i>g</i>, <b>803</b> <i>b </i>and the conductive layer <b>806</b>. In this example, an ITO is used as the transparent conductive film. The ITO can be formed by the deposition method. In this example, the case of forming by the ion plating method will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">The ion plating method is one of the gas phase surface treatment techniques classified in the deposition method. It is a method for adhering a deposition substance evaporated by some means to a substrate by ionizing or exciting the same by a high frequency plasma or vacuum discharge, and accelerating the ion by providing a negative potential to the substrate to be deposited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">As the specific condition for forming the counter electrode using the ion plating method, it is preferable to deposit with the substrate temperature maintained at 100 to 300° C. in a 0.01 to 1 Pa inert gas atmosphere. Furthermore, it is preferable to use the ITO as the evaporation source having a 70% or more sintering density. The optimum condition at the time of using the ion plating method can be selected optionally by the operator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">Moreover, since the ionizing ratio or exciting ratio of the deposition substance can be improved by ionizing or exciting the deposition substance using the high frequency plasma as well as the ionized or excited deposition substance is in a high energy state, it can be bonded with the oxygen sufficiently with a high evaporation rate still maintained. Therefore, a good quality film can be formed at a high speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">In this example, the counter electrode <b>804</b> comprising a transparent conductive film was formed by a 80 to 120 nm thickness using the above-mentioned ion plating method. In this example, an indium-tin oxide (ITO) film or a transparent conductive film having 2 to 20[%] of a zinc oxide (ZnO) added to an indium oxide is used as the transparent electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">The method for forming the counter electrode of this example is not limited to the above-mentioned ion plating method. However, since the film formed by the ion plating method has a high close contact property and it can form an ITO film with a high crystallization property even at a relatively low temperature, it can lower the resistance of the ITO as well as it can allow even film formation in a relatively wide area, and thus it is suitable for enlargement of the substrate.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0307" num="0306">However, in the case the light radiation direction from the OLED is toward the cover material side, the cover material should be transparent.

Then, in order to prevent scattering of the moisture absorbing substance or the substance capable of absorbing the oxygen <b>4207</b>, the moisture absorbing substance or the substance capable of absorbing the oxygen <b>4207</b> is kept in the recess part <b>4007</b> by a recess part cover material <b>4208</b>. The recess part cover material <b>4208</b> has a fine mesh-like shape such that passage of the air or the moisture content is allowed but passage of the moisture absorbing substance or the substance capable of absorbing the oxygen <b>4207</b> is not allowed.
