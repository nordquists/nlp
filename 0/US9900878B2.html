<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), and more particularly, to a method, apparatus, and software for dynamically allocating resources in a High Efficiency WLAN (HEW), and a recording medium that stores the software.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Discussion of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Along with the recent development of information and telecommunication technology, various wireless communication techniques have been developed. Among them, the WLAN enables a user to wirelessly access the Internet based on radio frequency technology in a home, an office, or a specific service area using a portable terminal such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a laptop computer, a Portable Multimedia Player (PMP), a smartphone, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">To overcome limitations in communication speed that the WLAN faces, the recent technical standards have introduced a system that increases the speed, reliability, and coverage of a wireless network. For example, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11n standard has introduced Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) that is implemented using multiple antennas at both a transmitter and a receiver in order to support High Throughput (HT) at a data processing rate of up to 540 Mbps, minimize transmission errors, and optimize data rates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent times, to support increased numbers of devices supporting WLAN, such as smartphones, more Access Points (APs) have been deployed. Despite increase in use of WLAN devices supporting the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 ac standard, that provide high performance relative to WLAN devices supporting the legacy IEEE 802.11g/n standard, a WLAN system supporting higher performance is required due to WLAN users' increased use of high volume content such as a ultra high definition video. Although a conventional WLAN system has aimed at increase of bandwidth and improvement of a peak transmission rate, actual users thereof could not feel drastic increase of such performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In a task group called IEEE 802.11 ax, High Efficiency WLAN (HEW) standardization is under discussion. The HEW aims at improving performance felt by users demanding high-capacity, high-rate services while supporting simultaneous access of numerous stations in an environment in which a plurality of APs is densely deployed and coverage areas of APs overlap.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">However, there is no specified method for dynamically allocating resources in a HEW.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In a WLAN system, Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) is a basic MAC access mechanism. The CSMA/CA mechanism is referred to as Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) of IEEE 802.11 MAC, shortly as a ‘listen before talk’ access mechanism. According to the CSMA/CA mechanism, an AP and/or a STA may sense a medium or a channel for a predetermined time before starting transmission, that is, may perform Clear Channel Assessment (CCA). If the AP or the STA determines that the medium or channel is idle, it may start to transmit a frame on the medium or channel. On the other hand, if the AP and/or the STA determines that the medium or channel is occupied or busy, it may set a delay period (e.g., a random backoff period), wait for the delay period without starting transmission, and then attempt to transmit a frame. By applying a random backoff period, a plurality of STAs are expected to attempt frame transmission after waiting for different time periods, resulting in minimizing collisions.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">WLAN devices may exchange data frames, control frames, and management frames with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">A data frame is used for transmission of data to be forwarded to a higher layer. After a Distributed Coordination Function IFS (DIFS) from a time when a medium gets idle, a WLAN device performs a backoff and then transmits a data frame. A management frame is used for exchanging management information which is not forwarded to the higher layer. After an IFS such as the DIFS or a Point Coordination Function IFS (PIFS), the WLAN device transmits the management frame. Subtype frames of the management frame include a beacon frame, an association request/response frame, a probe request/response frame, and an authentication request/response frame. A control frame is used for controlling access to the medium. Subtype frames of the control frame include a Request-To-Send (RTS) frame, a Clear-To-Send (CTS) frame, and an ACKnowledgement (ACK) frame. If the control frame is not a response frame to another frame, the WLAN device performs a backoff after the DIFS and then transmits the control frame; or if the control frame is a response frame to another frame, the WLAN device transmits the control frame after a Short IFS (SIFS) without a backoff. The type and subtype of a frame may be identified by a type field and a subtype field in a Frame Control (FC) field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">On the other hand, a Quality of Service (QoS) STA may perform a backoff after an Arbitration IFS (AIFS) for Access Category (AC), i.e., AIFS[i] (i is determined based on AC) and then transmit a frame. In this case, the AIFC[i] may be used for a data frame, a management frame, or a control frame that is not a response frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, upon generation of a frame to be transmitted, a STA may transmit the frame immediately, if it determines that the medium is idle for the DIFS or AIFS[i] or longer. The medium is busy for a time period during which the STA transmits the frame. During the time period, upon generation of a frame to be transmitted, another STA may defer access by confirming that the medium is busy. If the medium gets idle, the STA that intends to transmit the frame may perform a backoff operation after a predetermined IFS in order to minimize collision with any other STA. Specifically, the STA that intends to transmit the frame selects a random backoff count, waits for a slot time corresponding to the selected random backoff count, and then attempt transmission. The random backoff count is determined based on a Contention Window (CW) parameter and the medium is monitored continuously during count-down of backoff slots (i.e. decrement a backoff count-down) according to the determined backoff count. If the STA monitors the medium as busy, the STA discontinues the count-down and waits, and then, if the medium gets idle, the STA resumes the count-down. If the backoff slot count reaches 0, the STA may transmit the next frame.</div>

Upon receipt of the CTS frame, STA<b>3</b> may set the NAV timer for a transmission duration of following frames (e.g., a SIFS time+a data frame duration+a SIFS time+an ACK frame duration), based on duration information included in the CTS frame. Upon receipt of a new frame before the NAV timer expires, STA<b>3</b> may update the NAV timer based on duration information included in the new frame.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">PHY layer may prepare a transmission MAC PDU (MPDU) in response to an instruction (or a primitive, which is a set of instructions or a set of parameters) by the MAC layer. For example, upon receipt of an instruction requesting transmission start from the MAC layer, the PHY layer may switch to a transmission mode, construct a frame with information (e.g., data) received from the MAC layer, and transmit the frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Upon detection of a valid preamble in a received frame, the PHY layer monitors a header of the preamble and transmits an instruction indicating reception start of the PHY layer to the MAC layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Information is transmitted and received in frames in the WLAN system. For this purpose, a Physical layer Protocol Data Unit (PPDU) frame format is defined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">A PPDU frame may include a Short Training Field (STF) field, a Long Training Field (LTF) field, a SIGNAL (SIG) field, and a Data field. The most basic (e.g., a non-High Throughput (non-HT)) PPDU frame may include only a Legacy-STF (L-STF) field, a Legacy-LTF (L-LTF) field, a SIG field, and a Data field. Additional (or other types of) STF, LTF, and SIG fields may be included between the SIG field and the Data field according to the type of a PPDU frame format (e.g., an HT-mixed format PPDU, an HT-greenfield format PPDU, a Very High Throughput (VHT) PPDU, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">The STF is used for signal detection, Automatic Gain Control (AGC), diversity selection, fine time synchronization, etc. The LTF field is used for channel estimation, frequency error estimation, etc. The STF and the LTF fields may be referred to as signals for OFDM PHY layer synchronization and channel estimation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">The SIG field may include a RATE field and a LENGTH field. The RATE field may include information about a modulation scheme and coding rate of data. The LENGTH field may include information about the length of the data. The SIG field may further include parity bits, SIG TAIL bits, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">The Data field may include a SERVICE field, a Physical layer Service Data Unit (PSDU), and PPDU TAIL bits. When needed, the Data field may further include padding bits. A part of the bits of the SERVICE field may be used for synchronization at a descrambler of a receiver. The PSDU corresponds to a MAC PDU defined at the MAC layer and may include data generated/used in a higher layer. The PPDU TAIL bits may be used to return an encoder to a zero state. The padding bits may be used to match the length of the Data filed in predetermined units.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">A MAC PDU is defined according to various MAC frame formats. A basic MAC frame includes a MAC header, a frame body, and a Frame Check Sequence (FCS). The MAC frame includes a MAC PDU and may be transmitted and received in the PSDU of the data part in the PPDU frame format.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">The MAC header includes a Frame Control field, a Duration/Identifier (ID) field, an Address field, etc. The Frame Control field may include control information required for frame transmission/reception. The Duration/ID field may be set to a time for transmitting the frame. For details of Sequence Control, QoS Control, and HT Control subfields of the MAC header, refer to the IEEE 802.11-2012 technical specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">The Frame Control field of the MAC header may include Protocol Version, Type, Subtype, To DS, From DS, More Fragment, Retry, Power Management, More Data, Protected Frame, and Order subfields.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The above description of the fields included in the HE PPDU frame format may be combined with exemplary HE PPDU frame formats described below. For example, characteristics of fields exemplarily described below may be applied while a transmission order of the fields of the HE PPDU frame format of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is maintained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts an exemplary HE PPDU frame format according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the vertical axis represents frequency and the horizontal axis represents time. It is assumed that frequency and time increase in the upward direction and the right direction, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, one channel includes four subchannels. An L-STF, an L-LTF, an L-SIG, and an HE-SIG-A may be transmitted per channel (e.g., 20 MHz), a HE-STF and a HE-LTF may be transmitted on each subchannel being a basic subchannel unit (e.g., 5 MHz), and a HE-SIG-B and a PSDU may be transmitted on each of subchannels allocated to a STA. A subchannel allocated to a STA may have a size required for PSDU transmission to the STA. The size of the subchannel allocated to the STA may be N (N=1, 2, 3, . . . ) times as large as the size of basic subchannel unit (i.e., a subchannel having a minimum size). In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the size of a subchannel allocated to each STA is equal to the size of the basic subchannel unit. For example, a first subchannel may be allocated for PSDU transmission from an AP to STA<b>1</b> and STA<b>2</b>, a second subchannel may be allocated for PSDU transmission from the AP to STA<b>3</b> and STA<b>4</b>, a third subchannel may be allocated for PSDU transmission from the AP to STA<b>5</b>, and a fourth subchannel may be allocated for PSDU transmission from the AP to STA<b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">While the term subchannel is used in the present disclosure, the term subchannel may be referred to as Resource Unit (RU) or subband. In particular, the terms like OFDMA subchannel, OFDMA RU, OFDMA subband can be used in embodiments for OFDMA in the present disclosure. Terms like a bandwidth of a subchannel, a number of tones (or subcarriers) allocated to a subchannel, a number of data tones (or data subcarriers) allocated to a subchannel can be used to express a size of a subchannel. A subchannel refers to a frequency band allocated to a STA and a basic subchannel unit refers to a basic unit used to represent the size of a subchannel. While the size of the basic subchannel unit is 5 MHz in the above example, this is purely exemplary. Thus, the basic subchannel unit may have a size of 2.5 MHz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a plurality of HE-LTF elements are distinguished in the time and frequency domains. One HE-LTF element may correspond to one OFDM symbol in time domain and one subchannel unit (i.e., a subchannel bandwidth allocated to a STA) in frequency domain. The HE-LTF elements are logical units, and the PHY layer does not necessarily operate in units of an HE-LTF element. In the following description, a HE-LTF element may be referred to shortly as a HE-LTF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">A HE-LTF symbol may correspond to a set of HE-LTF elements in one OFDM symbol in time domain and in one channel unit (e.g., 20 MHz) in frequency domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">A HE-LTF section may correspond to a set of HE-LTF elements in one or more OFDM symbols in time domain and in one subchannel unit (i.e., a subchannel bandwidth allocated to a STA) in frequency domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">A HE-LTF field may be a set of HE-LTF elements, HE-LTF symbols, or HE-LTF sections for a plurality of stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The L-STF field is used for frequency offset estimation and phase offset estimation, for preamble decoding at a legacy STA (i.e., a STA operating in a system such as IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac). The L-LTF field is used for channel estimation, for the preamble decoding at the legacy STA. The L-SIG field is used for the preamble decoding at the legacy STA and provides a protection function for PPDU transmission of a third-party STA (e.g., setting a NAV based on the value of a LENGTH field included in the L-SIG field).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">HE-SIG-A (or HEW SIG-A) represents High Efficiency Signal A (or High Efficiency WLAN Signal A), and includes HE PPDU (or HEW PPDU) modulation parameters, etc. for HE preamble (or HEW preamble) decoding at a HE STA (or HEW STA). The parameters set included in the HEW SIG-A field may include one or more of Very High Throughput (VHT) PPDU modulation parameters transmitted by IEEE 802.11 ac stations, as listed in [Table 2] below, to ensure backward compatibility with legacy STAs (e.g., IEEE 802.11ac stations).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">[Table 2] illustrates fields, bit positions, numbers of bits, and descriptions included in each of two parts, VHT-SIG-A1 and VHT-SIG-A2, of the VHT-SIG-A field defined by the IEEE 802.11ac standard. For example, a BW (BandWidth) field occupies two Least Significant Bits (LSBs), B0 and B1 of the VHT-SIG-A1 field and has a size of 2 bits. If the 2 bits are set to 0, 1, 2, or 3, the BW field indicates 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, or 160 and 80+80 MHz. For details of the fields included in the VHT-SIG-A field, refer to the IEEE 802.11 ac-2013 technical specification. In the HE PPDU frame format of the present invention, the HE-SIG-A field may include one or more of the fields included in the VHT-SIG-A field, and it may provide backward compatibility with IEEE 802.11ac stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts subchannel allocation in the HE PPDU frame format according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it is assumed that information indicating subchannels allocated to STAs in HE PPDU indicates that 0 MHz subchannel is allocated to STA<b>1</b> (i.e., no subchannel is allocated), a 5-MHz subchannel is allocated to each of STA<b>2</b> and STA<b>3</b>, and a 10-MHz subchannel is allocated to STA<b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an L-STF, an L-LTF, an L-SIG, and a HE-SIG-A may be transmitted per channel (e.g., 20 MHz), a HE-STF and a HE-LTF may be transmitted on each of subchannels being basic subchannel units (e.g., 5 MHz), and a HE-SIG-B and a PSDU may be transmitted on each of subchannels allocated to STAs. A subchannel allocated to a STA has a size required for PSDU transmission to the STA. The size of the subchannel allocated to the STA may be an N (N=1, 2, 3, . . . ) multiple of the size of the basic subchannel unit (i.e., a minimum-size subchannel unit). In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the size of a subchannel allocated to STA<b>2</b> is equal to that of the basic subchannel unit, the size of a subchannel allocated to STA<b>3</b> is equal to that of the basic subchannel unit, and the size of a subchannel allocated to STA<b>4</b> is twice larger than that of the basic subchannel unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a plurality of HE-LTF elements and a plurality of HE-LTF subelements which are distinguished in the time and frequency domains. One HE-LTF element may correspond to one OFDM symbol in the time domain and one subchannel unit (i.e., the bandwidth of a subchannel allocated to a STA) in the frequency domain. One HE-LTF subelement may correspond to one OFDM symbol in the time domain and one basic subchannel unit (e.g. 5 MHz) in the frequency domain. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, one HE-LTF element includes one HE-LTF subelement in the 5-MHz subchannel allocated to STA<b>2</b> or STA<b>3</b>. On the other hand, one HE-LTF element includes two HE-LTF subelements in the third subchannel, i.e., 10-MHz subchannel, allocated to STA<b>4</b>. A HE-LTF element and a HE-LTF subelement are logical units and the PHY layer does not always operate in units of a HE-LTF element or HE-LTF subelement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">A HE-LTF symbol may correspond to a set of HE-LTF elements in one OFDM symbol in the time domain and one channel unit (e.g. 20 MHz) in the frequency domain. That is, one HE-LTF symbol may be divided into HE-LTF elements by a subchannel width allocated to a STA and into HE-LTF subelements by the width of the basic subchannel unit in the frequency domain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">A HE-LTF section may correspond to a set of HE-LTF elements in one or more OFDM symbols in the time domain and one subchannel unit (i.e. the bandwidth of a subchannel allocated to a STA) in the frequency domain. A HE-LTF subsection may correspond to a set of HE-LTF elements in one or more OFDM symbols in the time domain and one basic subchannel unit (e.g., 5 MHz) in the frequency domain. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, one HE-LTF section includes one HE-LTF subsection in the 5-MHz subchannel allocated to STA<b>2</b> or STA<b>3</b>. On the other hand, one HE-LTF section includes two HE-LTF subsections in the third subchannel, i.e., 10-MHz subchannel, allocated to STA<b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">A HE-LTF field may correspond to a set of HE-LTF elements (or subelements), HE-LTF symbols, or HE-LTF sections (or subsections) for a plurality of stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">For the afore-described HE PPDU transmission, subchannels allocated to a plurality of HE STAs may be contiguous in the frequency domain. In other words, for HE PPDU transmission, the subchannels allocated to the HE STAs may be sequential and any intermediate one of the subchannels of one channel (e.g., 20 MHz) may not be allowed to be unallocated or empty. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if one channel includes four subchannels, it may not be allowed to keep the third subchannel unallocated and empty, while the first, second, and fourth subchannels are allocated to STAs. However, the present invention does not exclude non-allocation of an intermediate subchannel of one channel to a STA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts a subchannel allocation method according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a plurality of contiguous channels (e.g., 20-MHz-bandwidth channels) and boundaries of the plurality of contiguous channels are shown. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a preamble may correspond to an L-STF, an L-LTF, an L-SIG, and a HE-SIG-A as illustrated in the examples of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">A subchannel for each HE STA may be allocated only within one channel, and may not be allocated with partially overlapping between a plurality of channels. That is, if there are two contiguous 20-MHz channels CH<b>1</b> and CH<b>2</b>, subchannels for STAs paired for MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission may be allocated either within CH<b>1</b> or within CH<b>2</b>, and it may be prohibited that one part of a subchannel exists in CH<b>1</b> and another part of the subchannel exists in CH<b>2</b>. This means that one subchannel may not be allocated with crossing a channel boundary. From the perspective of RUs supporting the MU-MIMO or OFDMA mode, a bandwidth of 20 MHz may be divided into one or more RUs, and a bandwidth of 40 MHz may be divided into one or more RUs in each of two contiguous 20-MHz bandwidths, and no RU is allocated with crossing the boundary between two contiguous 20-MHz bandwidths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">As described above, it is not allowed that one subchannel belongs to two or more 20-MHz channels. Particularly, a 2.4-GHz OFDMA mode may support a 20-MHz OFDMA mode and a 40-MHz OFDMA mode. In the 2.4-GHz OFDMA mode, it may not be allowed that one subchannel belongs to two or more 20-MHz channels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is based on the assumption that subchannels each having the size of a basic subchannel unit (e.g., 5 MHz) in CH<b>1</b> and CH<b>2</b> are allocated to STA<b>1</b> to STA<b>7</b>, and subchannels each having double the size (e.g., 10 MHz) of the basic subchannel unit in CH<b>4</b> and CH<b>5</b> are allocated to STA<b>8</b>, STA<b>9</b>, and STA<b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">As illustrated in the lower part of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, although a subchannel allocated to STA<b>1</b>, STA<b>2</b>, STA<b>3</b>, STA<b>5</b>, STA<b>6</b>, or STA<b>7</b> is fully overlapped only with one channel (i.e., without crossing the channel boundary, or belonging only to one channel), a subchannel allocated to STA<b>4</b> is partially overlapped with the two channels (i.e., crossing the channel boundary, or belonging to the two channels). In the forgoing example of the present invention, the subchannel allocation to STA<b>4</b> is not allowed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">As illustrated in the upper part of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, although a subchannel allocated to STA<b>8</b> or STA<b>10</b> is fully overlapped only with one channel (i.e., crossing the channel boundary, or belonging only to one channel), a subchannel allocated to STA<b>9</b> is partially overlapped with two channels (i.e., crossing the channel boundary, or belonging to the two channels). In the forgoing example of the present invention, the subchannel allocation to STA<b>9</b> is not allowed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">On the other hand, it may be allowed to allocate a subchannel partially overlapped between a plurality of channels (i.e., crossing the channel boundary, or belonging to two channels). For example, in SU-MIMO mode transmission, a plurality of contiguous channels may be allocated to a STA and any of one or more subchannels allocated to the STA may cross the boundary between two contiguous channels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">While the following description is given with an assumption that one subchannel has a channel bandwidth of 5 MHz in one channel having a channel bandwidth of 20 MHz, this is provided to simplify the description of the principle of the present invention and thus should not be construed as limiting the present invention. For example, the bandwidths of a channel and a subchannel may be defined or allocated as values other than the above examples. In addition, a plurality of subchannels in one channel may have the same or different channel widths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts the starting and ending points of a HE-LTF field in the HE PPDU frame format according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">To support the MU-MIMO mode and the OFDMA mode, the HE PPDU frame format according to the present invention may include, in the HE-SIG-A field, information about the number of spatial streams to be transmitted to a HE STA allocated to each subchannel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">If MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission is performed to a plurality of HE STAs on one subchannel, the number of spatial streams to be transmitted to each of the HE STAs may be provided in the HE-SIG-A or HE-SIG-B field, which will be described later in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is based on the assumption that a first 5-MHz subchannel is allocated to STA<b>1</b> and STA<b>2</b> and two spatial streams are transmitted to each STA in a DL MU-MIMO or OFDMA mode (i.e., a total of four spatial streams are transmitted on one subchannel). For this purpose, a HE-STF, a HE-LTF, a HE-LTF, a HE-LTF, a HE-LTF, and a HE-SIG-B follow the HE-SIG-A field on the subchannel. The HE-STF is used for frequency offset estimation and phase offset estimation for the 5-MHz subchannel. The HE-LTFs are used for channel estimation for the 5-MHz subchannel. Since the subchannel carries four spatial streams, as many HE-LTFs (i.e., HE-LTF symbols or HE-LTF elements in a HE-LTF section) as the number of the spatial streams, that is, four HE-LTFs are required to support MU-MIMO transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">According to an example of the present invention, relationship between a total number of spatial streams transmitted on one subchannel and a number of HE-LTFs is listed in [Table 3].</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Referring to [Table 3], if one spatial stream is transmitted on one subchannel, at least one HE-LTF needs to be transmitted on the subchannel. If an even number of spatial streams are transmitted on one subchannel, at least as many HE-LTFs as the number of the spatial streams need to be transmitted. If an odd number of spatial streams greater than one are transmitted on one subchannel, at least as many HE-LTFs as a number of adding 1 to the number of the spatial streams need to be transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> again, it is assumed that the second 5-MHz subchannel is allocated to STA<b>3</b> and STA<b>4</b> and one spatial streams per STA is transmitted in the DL MU-MIMO or OFDMA mode (i.e., a total of two spatial streams are transmitted on one subchannel). In this case, two HE-LTFs need to be transmitted on the second subchannel, however, in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a HE-STF, a HE-LTF, a HE-LTF, a HE-LTF, a HE-LTF, and a HE-SIG-B follow the HE-SIG-A field on the subchannel (i.e., four HE-LTFs are transmitted). This is for setting the same starting time of PSDU transmission for subchannels allocated to other STAs paired with STA<b>3</b> and STA<b>4</b> for MU-MIMO transmission. If only two HE-LTFs are transmitted on the second subchannel, PSDUs are transmitted at different time points on the first and second subchannels. PSDU transmission on each subchannel at a different time point results in discrepancy between OFDM symbol timings of subchannels, thereby no orthogonality is maintained. To overcome this problem, an additional constraint need to be imposed for HE-LTF transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">Basically, transmission of as many HE-LTFs as required is sufficient in an SU-MIMO or non-OFDMA mode. However, timing synchronization (or alignment) with fields transmitted on subchannels for other paired STAs is required in the MU-MIMO or OFDMA mode. Accordingly, the numbers of HE-LTFs may be determined for all other subchannels based on a subchannel having the maximum number of streams in MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Specifically, the numbers of HE-LTFs may be determined for all subchannels according to the maximum of the numbers of HE-LTFs (HE-LTF symbols or HE-LTF elements in a HE-LTF section) required according to the total numbers of spatial streams transmitted on each subchannel, for a set of HE STAs allocated to each subchannel. A “set of HE STAs allocated to each subchannel” is one HE STA in the SU-MIMO mode, and a set of HE STAs paired across a plurality of subchannels in the MU-MIMO mode. The ‘number of spatial streams transmitted on each subchannel’ is the number of spatial streams transmitted to one HE STA in the SU-MIMO mode, and the number of spatial streams transmitted to a plurality of HE STAs paired on the subchannel in the MU-MIMO mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">That is, it may be said that a HE-LTF field starts at the same time point and ends at the same time point in a HE PPDU for all users (i.e. HE STAs) in MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission. Or it may be said that the lengths of HE-LTF sections are equal on a plurality of subchannels for all users (i.e. HE STAs) in MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission. Or it may be said that the number of HE-LTF elements included in each HE-LTF section is equal on a plurality of subchannels for all users (i.e. HE STAs) in MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission. Accordingly, PSDU transmission timings may be synchronized among a plurality of subchannels for all HE STAs in MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">As described above, the number of HE-LTF symbols (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) may be 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 in HE PPDU transmission in the MU-MIMO or OFDMA mode, determined according to the maximum of the numbers of spatial streams on each of a plurality of subchannels. A different number of spatial streams may be allocated to each of a plurality of subchannels, and the number of spatial streams allocated to one subchannel is the number of total spatial streams for all users allocated to the subchannel. That is, the number of HE-LTF symbols may be determined according to the number of spatial streams allocated to a subchannel having a maximum number of spatial streams by comparing the number of total spatial streams for all users allocated to one of a plurality of subchannels with the number of total spatial streams for all users allocated to another subchannel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">Specifically, in HE PPDU transmission in the OFDMA mode, the number of HE-LTF symbols may be 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8, determined based on the number of spatial streams transmitted in a subchannel having a maximum number of spatial streams across a plurality of subchannels. Further, in HE PPDU transmission in the OFDMA mode, the number of HE-LTF symbols may be determined based on whether the number of spatial streams transmitted in a subchannel having a maximum number of spatial streams across a plurality of subchannels is odd or even (refer to [Table 3]). That is, in HE PPDU transmission in the OFDMA mode, when the number (e.g., K) of spatial streams transmitted in a subchannel having a maximum number of spatial streams across a plurality of subchannels is an even number, the number of HE-LTF symbols may be equal to K. In HE PPDU transmission in the OFDMA mode, when the number, K, of spatial streams transmitted in a subchannel having a maximum number of spatial streams across a plurality of subchannels is an odd number greater than one, the number of HE-LTF symbols may be equal to K+1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">When only one STA is allocated to one subchannel in OFDMA mode (i.e., OFDMA mode without using MU-MIMO), a subchannel having a maximum number of spatial streams across a plurality of subchannels may be determined by the number of spatial streams for a STA allocated to each subchannel. When more than one STA is allocated to one subchannel in OFDMA mode (i.e., OFDMA mode using MU-MIMO), a subchannel having a maximum number of spatial streams across a plurality of subchannels may be determined by the number of STAs allocated to each subchannel and the number of spatial streams for each STA allocated to each subchannel (e.g., if STA<b>1</b> and STA<b>2</b> are allocated to one subchannel, sum of the number of spatial streams for STA<b>1</b> and the number of spatial streams for STA<b>2</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">When transmitting a HE PPDU frame in the MU-MIMO or OFDMA mode, a transmitter may generate P (P is an integer equal to or larger than 1) HE-LTF symbols (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and transmit a HE PPDU frame including at least the P HE-LTF symbols and a Data field to a receiver. The HE PPDU frame may be divided into Q subchannels in the frequency domain (Q is an integer equal to or larger than 2). Each of the P HE-LTF symbols may be divided into Q HE-LTF elements corresponding to the Q subchannels in the frequency domain. That is, the HE PPDU may include P HE-LTF elements on one subchannel (herein, the P HE-LTF elements may belong to one HE-LTF section on the subchannel).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">As described above, the number of HE-LTF elements (i.e., P) in one of the Q subchannels may be equal to the number of HE-LTF elements (i.e. P) of another subchannel. Also, the number of HE-LTF elements (i.e., P) included in a HE-LTF section in one of the Q subchannels may be equal to the number of HE-LTF elements (i.e. P) included in a HE-LTF section in another subchannel. The HE-LTF section of one of the Q subchannels may start and end at the same time points as the HE-LTF section of another subchannel. Also, the HE-LTF sections may start and end at the same time points across the Q subchannels (i.e., across all users or stations).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> again, the third 5-MHz subchannel is allocated to STA<b>5</b> and one spatial stream is transmitted on the subchannel in SU-MIMO (considering all subchannels, a plurality of spatial streams are transmitted to STA<b>1</b> to STA<b>6</b> in MU-MIMO or OFDMA mode). In this case, although transmission of one HE-LTF is sufficient for the subchannel, as many HE-LTFs as the maximum of the numbers of HE-LTFs on the other subchannels, that is, four HE-LTFs are transmitted on the subchannel in order to align the starting points and ending points of the HE-LTF fields of the subchannels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">The fourth 5-MHz subchannel is allocated to STA<b>6</b> and one spatial stream is transmitted on the subchannel in SU-MIMO (considering all other subchannels, a plurality of spatial streams are transmitted to STA<b>1</b> to STA<b>6</b> in MU-MIMO or OFDMA mode). In this case, although transmission of one HE-LTF is sufficient for the subchannel, as many HE-LTFs as the maximum of the numbers of HE-LTFs on the other subchannels, that is, four HE-LTFs are transmitted on the subchannel in order to align the starting points and ending points of the HE-LTF fields of the subchannels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the remaining two HE-LTFs except two HE-LTFs required for channel estimation of STA<b>3</b> and STA<b>4</b> on the second subchannel, the remaining three HE-LTFs except one HE-LTF required for channel estimation of STA<b>5</b> on the third subchannel, and the remaining three HE-LTFs except one HE-LTF required for channel estimation of STA<b>6</b> on the fourth subchannel may be said to be placeholders that are actually not used for channel estimation at the STAs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> depicts a HE-SIG-B field and a HE-SIG-C field in the HE PPDU frame format according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">To effectively support MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission in the HE PPDU frame format according to the present invention, independent signaling information may be transmitted on each subchannel. Specifically, a different number of spatial streams may be transmitted to each of a plurality of HE STAs that receive an MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission simultaneously. Therefore, information about the number of spatial streams to be transmitted should be indicated to each HE STA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">Information about the number of spatial streams on one channel may be included in, for example, a HE-SIG-A field. A HE-SIG-B field may include spatial stream allocation information about one subchannel. Also, a HE-SIG-C field may be transmitted after transmission of HE-LTFs, including Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) information about a PSDU and information about the length of the PSDU, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">With reference to the foregoing examples of the present invention, mainly the features of a HE PPDU frame structure applicable to a DL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission that an AP transmits simultaneously to a plurality of STAs have been described. Now, a description will be given of the features of a HE PPDU frame structure applicable to a UL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission that a plurality of STAs transmits simultaneously to an AP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">The above-described various examples of structures of the HE PPDU frame format supporting MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission should not be understood as applicable only to DL without applicable UL. Rather, the examples should be understood as also applicable to UL. For example, the above-described exemplary HE PPDU frame formats may also be used for a UL HE PPDU transmission that a plurality of STAs simultaneously transmits to a single AP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">However, in the case of a DL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode HE PPDU transmission that an AP simultaneously transmits to a plurality of STAs, the transmission entity, AP has knowledge of the number of spatial streams transmitted to a HE STA allocated to each of a plurality of subchannels. Therefore, the AP may include, in a HE-SIG-A field or a HE-SIG-B field, information about the total number of spatial streams transmitted across a channel, a maximum number of spatial streams (i.e., information being a basis of the number of HE-LTF elements (or the starting point and ending point of a HE-LTF section) on each subchannel), and the number of spatial streams transmitted on each subchannel. In contrast, in the case of a UL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode HE PPDU transmission that a plurality of STAs simultaneously transmits to an AP, each STA being a transmission entity may be aware only of the number of spatial streams in a HE PSDU that it will transmit, without knowledge of the number of spatial streams in a HE PSDU transmitted by another STA paired with the STA. Accordingly, the STA may determine neither the total number of spatial streams transmitted across a channel nor a maximum number of spatial streams.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">To solve this problem, a common parameter (i.e., a parameter applied commonly to STAs) and an individual parameter (a separate parameter applied to an individual STA) may be configured as follows in relation to a UL HE PPDU transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">For simultaneous UL HE PPDU transmissions from a plurality of STAs to an AP, a protocol may be designed in such a manner that the AP sets a common parameter or individual parameters (common/individual parameters) for the STAs for the UL HE PPDU transmissions and each STA operates according to the common/individual parameters. For example, the AP may transmit a trigger frame (or polling frame) for a UL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission to a plurality of STAs. The trigger frame may include a common parameter (e.g., the number of spatial streams across a channel or a maximum number of spatial streams) and individual parameters (e.g., the number of spatial streams allocated to each subchannel), for the UL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission. As a consequence, a HE PPDU frame format applicable to a UL MU-MIMO or OFDMA mode may be configured without a modification to an exemplary HE PPDU frame format applied to a DL MU-MIMO or OFDMA mode. For example, each STA may configure a HE PPDU frame format by including information about the number of spatial streams across a channel in a HE-SIG-A field, determining the number of HE-LTF elements (or the starting point and ending point of a HE-LTE section) on each subchannel according to the maximum number of spatial streams, and including information about the number of spatial streams for the individual STA in a HE-SIG-B field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Alternatively, if the STAs operate always according to the common/individual parameters received in the trigger frame from the AP, each STA does not need to indicate the common/individual parameters to the AP during a HE PPDU transmission. Therefore, this information may not be included in a HE PPDU. For example, each STA may have only to determine the total number of spatial streams, the maximum number of spatial streams, and the number of spatial streams allocated to individual STA, as indicated by the AP, and configure a HE PPDU according to the determined numbers, without including information about the total number of spatial streams or the number of spatial streams allocated to the STA in the HE PPDU.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">On the other hand, if the AP does not provide common/individual parameters in a trigger frame, for a UL MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode HE PPDU transmission, the following operation may be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">Common transmission parameters (e.g., channel BandWidth (BW) information, etc.) for simultaneously transmitted HE PSDUs may be included in HE-SIG-A field, but parameters that may be different for individual STAs (e.g., the number of spatial streams, an MCS, and whether STBC is used or not, for each individual STA) may not be included in HE-SIG-A field. Although the individual parameters may be included in HE-SIG-B field, information about the number of spatial streams and information indicating whether STBC is used or not, need to be transmitted before a HE-LTF field because the number of spatial streams and the information indicating whether STBC is used or not are significant to determination of configuration information about a preamble and a PSDU in a HE PPDU frame format (e.g., the number of HE-LTF elements is determined according to a combination of the number of spatial streams and the information indicating whether STBC is used or not). For this purpose, a HE PPDU frame format as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> may be used for a UL HE PPDU transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts another exemplary HE PPDU frame format according to the present invention. The HE PPDU frame format illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is characterized in that a structure of HE-SIG-A, HE-SIG-B, and HE-SIG-C fields similar to in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is used for a UL PPDU transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">As described before, if a UL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission is performed by triggering of an AP (according to common/individual parameters provided by the AP), an individual STA may not need to report an individual parameter to the AP. In this case, one or more of a HE-SIG-B field, a HE-SIG-C field, and a first HE-LTF element (i.e., a HE-LTF between a HE-STF field and a HE-SIG-B field) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> may not exist. In this case, a description of each field given below may be applied only in the presence of the field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a HE-SIG-A field is transmitted per channel (i.e., per 20-MHz channel) and may include transmission parameters common to simultaneously transmitted HE PSDUs. Since the same information is transmitted in up to HE-SIG-A fields in UL PPDUs transmitted by HE STAs allocated to subchannels, the AP may receive the same signals from the plurality of STAs successfully.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">A HE-SIG-B field is transmitted per subchannel in one channel. The HE-SIG-B field may have an independent parameter value according to the transmission characteristics of a HE PSDU transmitted on each subchannel. The HE-SIG-B field may include spatial stream allocation information and information indicating whether STBC is used or not, for each subchannel. If MU-MIMO is applied to a subchannel (i.e., if a plurality of STAs perform transmission on a subchannel), the HE-SIG-B field may include a common parameter for the plurality of STAs paired on the subchannel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">A HE-SIG-C field is transmitted on the same subchannel as the HE-SIG-B field and may include information about an MCS and a packet length. If MU-MIMO is applied to a subchannel (i.e., if a plurality of STAs perform transmission on a subchannel), the HE-SIG-C field may include respective individual parameters for each of the plurality of STAs paired on the subchannel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">Similarly to DL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode HE PPDU transmission, transmissions of PSDUs may start at different time points on subchannels in UL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode HE PPDU transmission, and if OFDM symbols are not aligned accordingly, then the implementation complexity of an AP that receives a plurality of PSDUs increased. To solve this problem, ‘the number of HE-LTFs may be determined for all subchannels according to the maximum of the numbers of HE LTFs required according to the total numbers of spatial streams transmitted on each subchannel for a set of HE STAs allocated to each of subchannels’ as described with reference to the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">This feature may mean that the HE-LTF field start at the same time point and end at the same time point across all users (i.e., HE STAs) in UL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission. Or it may be said that the HE-LTF sections of a plurality of subchannels have the same length across all HE STAs in UL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission. Or it may be said that each of the HE-LTF sections of a plurality of subchannels includes the same number of HE-LTF elements across all HE STAs in UL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission. Therefore, PSDU transmission timings are synchronized between a plurality of subchannels across all HE STAs in UL MU-MIMO-mode or OFDMA-mode transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">As described before, a plurality of STAs may simultaneously transmit PSDUs in a HE PPDU frame format on their allocated subchannels or on their allocated spatial streams to an AP (i.e., referred to as UL MU-MIMO or OFDMA transmission or “UL MU transmission”) and may simultaneously receive PSDUs in the HE PPDU frame format on their allocated subchannels on their allocated spatial streams from the AP (i.e., referred to as DL MU-MIMO or OFDMA transmission or “DL MU transmission”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> depict operating channels in a WLAN system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">Basically, the WLAN system may support a single channel having a bandwidth of 20 MHz as a BSS operating channel. The WLAN system may also support a BSS operating channel having a bandwidth of 40 MHz, 80 MHz, or 160 MHz by bonding a plurality of contiguous 20-MHz channels (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Further, the WLAN system may support a BSS operating channel having a bandwidth of 160 MHz including non-contiguous 80-MHz channels (called a bandwidth of 80+80 MHz) (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, one 40-MHz channel may include a primary 20-MHz channel and a secondary 20-MHz channel which are contiguous. One 80-MHz channel may include a primary 40-MHz channel and a secondary 40-MHz channel which are contiguous. One 160-MHz channel may include a primary 80-MHz channel and a secondary 80-MHz channel which are contiguous. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, one 80+80-MHz channel may include a primary 80-MHz channel and a secondary 80-MHz channel which are non-contiguous.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">A primary channel is defined as a common channel for all STAs within a BSS. The primary channel may be used for transmission of a basic signal such as a beacon. The primary channel may also be a basic channel used for transmission of a data unit (e.g., a PPDU). If an STA uses a channel width larger than the channel width of the primary channel, for data transmission, the STA may use another channel within a corresponding channel, in addition to the primary channel. This additional channel is referred to as a secondary channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0191"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> depicts transmission of a HE PPDU frame on a plurality of channels according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">While <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates an exemplary case in which PSDUs are transmitted at different transmission timings on subchannels of each of a plurality of channels (i.e., the lengths of HE-LTF sections are different on the subchannels) in a DL HE PPDU format, a HE PPDU format in which PSDUs are transmitted at the same transmission timing on subchannels (i.e., the lengths of HE-LTF sections are the same on the subchannels), or a UL HE PPDU format may be applied as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11, 12, and 13</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a channel access operation in Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA), when a DL or UL HE PPDU is transmitted on a plurality of channels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">The example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is based on the assumption that a low-frequency channel is a primary channel and a high-frequency channel is a secondary channel among a plurality of channels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">Upon generation of a transmission frame, an STA (e.g., an AP or a non-AP STA) may perform a back-off procedure on a primary channel in order to acquire a Transmission Opportunity (TXOP). For this purpose, the STA may sense the primary channel during a DIFS or AIFS[i]. If the primary channel is idle, the STA may attempt to transmit the frame. The STA may select a random back-off count, wait for a slot time corresponding to the selected random back-off count, and then attempt to transmit the frame. The random back-off count may be determined to be a value ranging from 0 to CW (CW is a value of a contention window parameter).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">When the random back-off procedure starts, the STA may activate a back-off timer according to the determined back-off count and decrement the back-off count by 1 each time. If the medium of the corresponding channel is monitored as busy, the STA discontinues the count-down and waits. If the medium is idle, the STA resumes the count-down. If the back-off timer reaches 0, the STA may determine a transmission bandwidth by checking whether the secondary channel is idle or busy at the corresponding time point.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">In the case where subchannels are allocated to STAs, for DL/UL MU transmission, STAs having small operating channel widths relative to other STAs are highly competitive for allocation of subchannels distinguished within limited resources. Thus, fairness may not be maintained between the STAs and the other STAs. For example, if an operating channel width of 20 MHz is configured for 10 STAs and an operating channel width lager than 20 MHz is configured for one STA among STAs supporting OFDMA in a HE BSS, all of the 10 STAs having the operating channel width of 20 MHz share the primary 20-MHz channel and thus they may be allocated subchannels distinguished within the limited primary 20-MHz channel in a contention-based manner, whereas the single STA having the operating channel width larger than 20 MHz may be allocated a subchannel within the secondary 20-MHz channel without contention. That is, an STA having a larger operating channel width may have a larger OFDMA gain than STAs having a smaller operating channel width.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">To solve the fairness problem, dynamic channel switching (or dynamic subchannel switching) may be applied. Dynamic channel/subchannel switching (or dynamic channel/subchannel selection) refers to immediate switching from a current established channel/subchannel (e.g., a first channel/a first subchannel) to another channel/subchannel (e.g., a second channel/a second subchannel) for an STA during a frame exchange sequence between the STA and an AP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">If dynamic channel/subchannel switching (or dynamic channel/subchannel selection) is applied, the STA may change current configured channel information in the middle of one PPDU or during one TXOP. For example, an STA supporting dynamic channel/subchannel switching may change a receiving center frequency among current configured PHY setting vector parameters to the receiving center frequency of another channel in the middle of one PPDU or during one TXOP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">To support dynamic channel/subchannel switching in the middle of a PPDU, the AP may signal channel/subchannel allocation information to the STA before transmitting a HE-STF or a HE-LTF. For example, the AP may include subchannel allocation information (e.g., changed subchannel allocation information different from current configured subchannel allocation information) in a HE-SIG-A or a HE-SIG-B transmitted before a HE-STF or a HE-LTF transmitted on a subchannel in a PPDU. Accordingly, the STA may change the current receiving center frequency to the receiving center frequency of another channel during PPDU reception. For example, the STA may receive up to the HE-SIG-A or the HE-SIG-B of the PPDU on the primary 20-MHz channel and then receive the remaining part of the PPDU, starting from the HE-STF or the HE-LTF on a subchannel allocated in the secondary 20-MHz channel. In another example, an STA having an operating channel width of 40 MHz may receive up to a HE-SIG-A or a HE-SIG-B of a PPDU on a 40-MHz channel (i.e., across both the primary 20-MHz channel and the secondary 20-MHz channel) and then receive the remaining part of the PPDU, starting from a HE-STF or a HE-LTF on the primary 20-MHz channel (or the secondary 20-MHz channel).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">To support dynamic channel/subchannel switching during a TXOP, the AP may signal information about a channel to be changed to an STA before a PPDU. For example, the information about the channel to be changed may be transmitted in a frame directed to the STA before transmission of the next OFDMA PPDU within the TXOP. Therefore, the STA may switch the current receiving center frequency to the receiving center frequency of another channel during the TXOP. For example, the STA may receive a first frame on the primary 20-MHz channel and a second frame on the secondary 20-MHz channel during a TXOP. In another example, an STA having an operating channel width of 40 MHz may receive a first frame on a 40-MHz channel (i.e., across both the primary 20-MHz channel and the secondary 20-MHz channel) and then receive a second frame on the primary 20-MHz channel (or the secondary 20-MHz channel).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">Herein, one TXOP may include both DL MU transmission and UL MU transmission. For example, a UL MU PPDU transmission may be performed after a DL MU PPDU transmission during the same TXOP. That is, one or more of DL MU PPDU and UL MU PPDU sequences may be included within one TXOP. In this case, if a first frame is a DL PPDU and a second frame is a UL PPDU within one TXOP, the STA may receive the first frame on the primary 20-MHz channel and then transmit the second frame on the secondary 2-MHz channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">Further, the AP may include information about a channel that the AP requests the STA to change in an RTS frame, a data frame, or a block ACK request frame. If the information about the channel (or subchannel) that the AP requests the STA to change corresponds to information that allocates a channel (or subchannel) on which an individual STA will perform UL transmission, this may be unicast trigger information (or a unicast trigger frame) for a single user. The unicast trigger information for the individual STA may be included in data (e.g., an MPDU or APDU) for the STA and may include information about the channel (or subchannel) allocated (i.e., dynamically switched) to the STA for UL MU transmission (e.g., UL OFDMA PPDU transmission) following the DL MU MIMO PPDU. For example, information that allocates a channel (or subchannel) on which a specific STA will transmit a block ACK may be included in a data frame or a block ACK request frame. Upon receipt of the information, the STA may transmit a block ACK frame on the allocated channel (or subchannel).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">For dynamic channel/subchannel switching, the STA may transmit information about a channel (or subchannel) that it will change or has changed to the AP to receive the next PPDU. The information about a channel (or subchannel) that it will change or has changed, which is transmitted to the AP may be included in a feedback frame (or response frame) for a frame transmitted to the STA by the AP. The AP may determine a channel (or subchannel) to be allocated to the STA based on the information about a channel (or subchannel) that the STA will change (or has changed).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">Further, the STA may notify the AP whether it supports dynamic channel/subchannel switching. Information indicating the STA's support or non-support of dynamic channel/subchannel switching may be included in a Capability element and may be included in an Association Request frame, a Reassociation Request frame, etc. Information indicating the AP's support or non-support of dynamic channel/subchannel switching may be included in a Capability element and may be included in an Association Response frame, a Reassociation Response frame, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">When the AP allocates a subchannel to an STA supporting dynamic subchannel switching, the AP may dynamically allocate a subchannel of a channel other than a current operating channel of the STA. For example, it is assumed that an operating channel width is set to 20 MHz, STA<b>1</b> and STA<b>2</b> support OFDMA, STA<b>1</b> does not support dynamic subchannel allocation, and STA<b>2</b> supports dynamic subchannel allocation. In this case, the AP may allocate a subchannel only within the primary 20-MHz channel to STA<b>1</b>. On the other hand, the AP may allocate a subchannel within the primary or secondary 20-MHz channel to STA<b>2</b>. However, it may be required that when the AP allocates a subchannel to STA<b>2</b>, the channel width of the subchannel (e.g., a TXVECTOR parameter, SUBCH_BANDWIDTH) is based on one or more of information about an operating channel width of STA<b>2</b>, information about a support channel of STA<b>2</b>, or information about a supported channel width set of STA<b>2</b>. That is, the AP may not allocate STA<b>2</b> a subchannel that is not supported based on the information about an operating channel width of STA<b>2</b>, the information about a support channel of STA<b>2</b>, and the information about a supported channel width set of STA<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">It is assumed that the operating channel width of STA<b>1</b> is 40 MHz and the operating channel width of each of STA<b>2</b>, STA<b>3</b>, and STA<b>4</b> is 20 MHz in an exemplary frame exchange sequence of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. It is also assumed that STA<b>2</b> supports dynamic channel/subchannel switching and STA<b>3</b> and STA<b>4</b> do not support dynamic channel/subchannel switching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">To start a TXOP on a 40-MHz channel, the AP may transmit an RTS frame to STA<b>1</b> in duplicated PPDUs on the primary 20-MHz channel (i.e., a low-frequency 20-MHz channel) and the secondary 20-MHz channel (i.e., a high-frequency 20-MHz channel). A destination STA of the RTS frame may be an STA having an operating channel width supporting the channel width (i.e. 40 MHz) of the TXOP. In other words, since STA<b>2</b>, STA<b>3</b>, and STA<b>4</b> have an operating channel width of 20 MHz, STA<b>2</b>, STA<b>3</b>, and STA<b>4</b> may not receive the RTS frame transmitted on the 40-MHz channel having the channel width of the TXOP and transmit a CTS frame on the 40-MHz channel. Therefore, STA<b>1</b> supporting the 40-MHz operating channel width may be the destination STA of the RTS frame, and thus may transmit a CTS frame to the AP in duplicated PPDUs on the primary 20-MHz channel and the secondary 20-MHz channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">Although the destination STA of the RTS frame and the transmitting STA of the CTS frame are STA<b>1</b>, STA<b>2</b>, STA<b>3</b>, STA<b>4</b>, and other STAs that operate on the channels carrying the RTS/CTS frame may receive the RTS/CTS frame and acquire information included in the RTS/CTS frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">Meanwhile, since STA<b>2</b>, STA<b>3</b>, and STA<b>4</b> support the 20-MHz operating channel width, they may be configured to operate basically on the primary 20-MHz channel. In contrast, STA<b>1</b> supports the 40-MHz operating channel width and thus may operate on the primary or secondary 20-MHz channel. In this case, while STA<b>2</b>, STA<b>3</b>, and STA<b>4</b> compete for subchannel allocation on the primary 20-MHz channel, STA<b>1</b> may be allocated a subchannel on the secondary 20-MHz channel without contention with other STAs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">The operating channel of STA<b>2</b> supporting dynamic channel/subchannel switching may be switched from the current operating channel, i.e., the primary 20-MHz channel to the secondary 20-MHz channel. For this purpose, the RTS frame may include signaling information requesting STA<b>2</b> to switch (or move) the operating channel to the secondary 20-MHz channel. Therefore, STA<b>3</b> and STA<b>4</b> that do not support dynamic channel/subchannel switching may be allocated subchannels on the primary channel, and STA<b>1</b> and STA<b>2</b> may be allocated subchannels on the secondary channel. As a consequence, each of STA<b>1</b>, STA<b>2</b>, STA<b>3</b>, and STA<b>4</b> may be allocated a 10-MHz channel and simultaneously receive a DL OFDMA PPDU on the 10-MHz channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0267">Among STAs that have received the DL OFDMA PPDU on the 40-MHz channel, STA<b>1</b> may transmit a block ACK PPDU to the AP on the primary 20-MHz channel and, at the same time, STA<b>3</b> may transmit a block ACK PPDU to the AP on the secondary 20-MHz channel. Subsequently, the AP may transmit a block ACK request PPDU to STA<b>4</b> on the primary 20-MHz channel and, at the same time, a block ACK request PPDU to STA<b>2</b> on the secondary 20-MHz channel. STA<b>4</b> may transmit a block ACK PPDU to the AP on the primary 20-MHz channel and, at the same time, STA<b>2</b> may transmit a block ACK PPDU to the AP on the secondary 20-MHz channel, in response to the received block ACK request PPDUs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">In the absence of any more data to be transmitted to STA<b>4</b>, the AP may request STA<b>2</b> to switch (or move) the operating channel of STA<b>2</b> to the primary 20-MHz channel again. For this purpose, the AP may include information indicating dynamic channel/subchannel switching to STA<b>2</b> in a data PPDU or a block ACK request PPDU. For example, the AP may include information about a channel to which STA<b>2</b> is requested to switch in a data PPDU or a block ACK request PPDU. For example, the AP may include information about a channel to which STA<b>2</b> is requested to switch in a block ACK request PPDU transmitted to STA<b>2</b> on the secondary 20-MHz channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">Therefore, the AP allocates a 10-MHz subchannel of the primary 20-MHz channel to each of STA<b>2</b> and STA<b>3</b>, and the secondary 20-MHz channel to STA<b>1</b> so that the AP may transmit a DL OFDMA PPDU simultaneously to STA<b>1</b>, STA<b>2</b>, and STA<b>3</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0273">Specifically, the ACK Policy of a DATA PPDU transmitted on one subchannel among DATA PPDUs transmitted on a plurality of subchannels of one 20-MHz channel may be set to Implicit Block Ack Request, and the ACK Policies of the DATA PPDUs transmitted on the other subchannels may be set to Block Ack Request in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0282" num="0281">For example, if STA<b>1</b> and STA<b>5</b> simultaneously transmit control response frames (e.g., block ACK PPDUs) as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, a transmission spectrum mask may be determined for use in transmission of the control response frames based on the total channel width of the DL OFDMA PPDU eliciting the transmission of the control response frames (e.g., an RXVECTOR parameter, CH_BANDWIDTH). Also, if STA<b>2</b> and STA<b>6</b> simultaneously transmit control response frames, a transmission spectrum mask may be determined for use in transmission of the control response frames based on the total channel widths of block ACK request PPDU frames eliciting the transmission of the control response frames.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0282">That is, the total channel width of a first frame with an X-MHz channel width that a plurality of STAs receive (e.g., an RXVECTOR parameter, CH_BANDWIDTH) may be set to CBW X and an X-MHz transmission spectrum mask may be used for a second frame elicited by the first frame and transmitted by each of the plurality of STAs. If the channel width of the second frame is Y MHz, the second frame may be transmitted with the X-MHz transmission spectrum mask in both cases that X=Y and X&gt;Y (or irrespective of the value of Y).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0283">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, although the channel widths of the block ACK PPDUs that STA<b>1</b> and STA<b>5</b> simultaneously transmit an SIFS after receiving the 40-MHz OFDMA PPDU (or the RXVECTOR parameter, CH_BANDWIDTH set to CBW <b>40</b>) are 20 MHz, STA<b>1</b> and STA<b>5</b> may transmit block ACK PPDUs having a 20-MHz channel width using the same 40-MHz transmission spectrum mask. Also, although the channel widths of the block ACK PPDUs that STA<b>2</b> and STA<b>6</b> simultaneously transmit after receiving a 40-MHz block ACK request PPDU (or the RXVECTOR parameter, CH_BANDWIDTH set to CBW <b>40</b>) are 20 MHz, STA<b>2</b> and STA<b>6</b> may transmit block ACK PPDUs with a 20-MHz channel width using the same 40-MHz transmission spectrum mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0284">Similarly, upon receipt of an MU PPDU with a channel width of 160 MHz (or with the RXVECTOR parameter, CH_BANDWIDTH set to CBW160), an STA may transmit a frame (e.g., a frame with a channel width equal to or smaller than 160 MHz) using a 160-MHz transmission spectrum mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0285">Also, upon receipt of an MU PPDU with a channel width of 80 MHz (or with the RXVECTOR parameter, CH_BANDWIDTH set to CBW80), an STA may transmit a frame (e.g., a frame with a channel width equal to or smaller than 80 MHz) using an 80-MHz transmission spectrum mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0287" num="0286">Also, upon receipt of an MU PPDU with a channel width of 20 MHz (or with the RXVECTOR parameter, CH_BANDWIDTH set to CBW20), an STA may transmit a frame (e.g., a frame with a channel width equal to or smaller than 20 MHz) using a 20-MHz transmission spectrum mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0287">When dynamic channel/subchannel switching is applied, the same transmission spectrum mask may also be applied to simultaneously transmitted frames. For example, if another STA transmits a UL frame at the same time point when an STA transmits a UL frame on a dynamically switched channel/subchannel, the same transmission spectrum mask may be applied to the UL frames transmitted by the plurality of STAs. The transmission spectrum mask applied to the UL MU transmission may be determined based on a frame eliciting the UL MU transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0288">Transmission parameters applied to a plurality of data units that a plurality of STAs allocated a plurality of subchannels simultaneously transmit in UL MU transmission may include transmission parameters commonly applied to the plurality of data units and transmission parameters applied to the individual data units. Although a HE-SIG-A field of a HE PPDU may include a common transmission parameter for a plurality of data units simultaneously transmitted on a plurality of subchannels by a plurality of STAs, the HE-SIG-A field may not include transmission parameters applied to the individual data units.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0289">Accordingly, for UL MU PPDU transmission from a plurality of STAs, the AP may indicate individual transmission parameters for application to a subchannel allocated to each of the STAs (e.g., the number of SSs, use or non-used of STBC, etc.) and regulate the STAs to follow scheduling information configured by the AP without fail. For this purpose, a trigger frame eliciting UL MU transmission may be used, as described before.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0290"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> depicts an exemplary format of a trigger frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0291">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a trigger frame eliciting UL MU transmission may include a Common Info field and a Per-User Info field.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0303" num="0302">An RU Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) subfield indicates whether the STA will use STBC for the UL HE PPDU transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0303">As described before, when the AP allocates subchannels for DL MU transmission or UL MU transmission to a plurality of STAs, the AP may take into account information about available resources for the plurality of STAs (e.g., information about an operating channel width (e.g., information included in an Operating Mode Notification field), information about a supported channel (e.g., information included in a Supported Channel element), and information about a supported channel width set (e.g., information included in a Supported Channel Width Set field)). The AP may also configure information about its available resources (e.g., information about an operating channel width (e.g., information included in an Operating Mode Notification field), information about a supported channel (e.g., information included in a Supported Channel element), and information about a supported channel width set (e.g., information included in a Supported Channel Width Set field)). In this case, resource allocation information about a trigger frame requesting HE UL PPDU transmission may be configured so as to satisfy the UL/DL available resource information about the STAs and the UL/DL available resource information about the AP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0304">For example, it is assumed that the AP sets its receivable channel width to 40 MHz and the number of its receivable SSs to 4 and indicates the channel width and the number of SSs to a plurality of STAs. It is also assumed that the AP receives information indicating that a transmittable channel width of an STA (i.e. a maximum channel width of a UL PPDU transmittable by the STA as requested by the AP) is 80 MHz and the maximum number of SSs transmittable by the STA (i.e. the maximum number of SSs transmittable by the STA as requested by the AP) is 2. In this case, if the AP requests (or triggers) UL PPDU transmission to the STA, the AP may set resource allocation information (e.g., RU subchannel) to 40 MHz or below satisfying the AP's receivable channel width 40 MHz and the STA's transmittable channel width 80 MHz, in the trigger frame eliciting UL PPDU transmission. The AP may set SS allocation information (e.g., RU STS) to 2 or below satisfying the number of the AP's receivable SSs, 4 and the number of the STA's transmittable SSs, 2 in the trigger frame eliciting UL PPDU transmission.</div>

Or the resource allocation information may be included in a first frame (e.g., a DL data frame, a block ACK request frame, or a trigger frame eliciting UL transmission). If resource allocation information for UL MU transmission or DL MU transmission is transmitted to the STA, resource allocation information for one or more other STAs may be transmitted to the one or more other STAs.
