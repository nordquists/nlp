<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates in general to flexible containers, and in particular, to flexible containers having with inflated elements with puckered corners.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Fluent products include liquid products and/or pourable solid products. In various embodiments, a container can be used to receive, contain, and dispense one or more fluent products. And, in various embodiments, a container can be used to receive, contain, and/or dispense individual articles or separately packaged portions of a product. A container can include one or more product spaces. A product space can be configured to be filled with one or more fluent products. A container receives a fluent product when its product space is filled. Once filled to a desired volume, a container can be configured to contain the fluent product in its product space, until the fluent product is dispensed. A container contains a fluent product by providing a barrier around the fluent product. The barrier prevents the fluent product from escaping the product space. The barrier can also protect the fluent product from the environment outside of the container. A filled product space is typically closed off by a cap or a seal. A container can be configured to dispense one or more fluent products contained in its product space(s). Once dispensed, an end user can consume, apply, or otherwise use the fluent product(s), as appropriate. In various embodiments, a container may be configured to be refilled and reused or a container may be configured to be disposed of after a single fill or even after a single use. A container should be configured with sufficient structural integrity, such that it can receive, contain, and dispense its fluent product(s), as intended, without failure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A container for fluent product(s) can be handled, displayed for sale, and put into use. A container can be handled in many different ways as it is made, filled, decorated, packaged, shipped, and unpacked. A container can experience a wide range of external forces and environmental conditions as it is handled by machines and people, moved by equipment and vehicles, and contacted by other containers and various packaging materials. A container for fluent product(s) should be configured with sufficient structural integrity, such that it can be handled in any of these ways, or in any other way known in the art, as intended, without failure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A container can also be displayed for sale in many different ways as it is offered for purchase. A container can be offered for sale as an individual article of commerce or packaged with one or more other containers or products, which together form an article of commerce. A container can be offered for sale as a primary package with or without a secondary package. A container can be decorated to display characters, graphics, branding, and/or other visual elements when the container is displayed for sale. A container can be configured to be displayed for sale while laying down or standing up on a store shelf, while presented in a merchandising display, while hanging on a display hanger, or while loaded into a display rack or a vending machine. A container for fluent product(s) should be configured with a structure that allows it to be displayed in any of these ways, or in any other way known in the art, as intended, without failure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A container can also be put into use in many different ways, by its end user. A container can be configured to be held and/or gripped by an end user, so a container should be appropriately sized and shaped for human hands; and for this purpose, a container can include useful structural features such as a handle and/or a gripping surface. A container can be stored while laying down or standing up on a support surface, while hanging on or from a projection such as a hook or a clip, or while supported by a product holder, or (for refillable or rechargeable containers) positioned in a refilling or recharging station. A container can be configured to dispense fluent product(s) while in any of these storage positions or while being held by the user. A container can be configured to dispense fluent product(s) through the use of gravity, and/or pressure, and/or a dispensing mechanism, such as a pump, or a straw, or through the use of other kinds of dispensers known in the art. Some containers can be configured to be filled and/or refilled by a seller (e.g. a merchant or retailer) or by an end user. A container for fluent product(s) should be configured with a structure that allows it to be put to use in any of these ways, or in any other way known in the art, as intended, without failure. A container can also be configured to be disposed of by the end user, as waste and/or recyclable material, in various ways.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">One conventional type of container for fluent products is a rigid container made from solid material(s). Examples of conventional rigid containers include molded plastic bottles, glass jars, metal cans, cardboard boxes, etc. These conventional rigid containers are well-known and generally useful; however their designs do present several notable difficulties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">First, some conventional rigid containers for fluent products can be expensive to make. Some rigid containers are made by a process shaping one or more solid materials. Other rigid containers are made with a phase change process, where container materials are heated (to soften/melt), then shaped, then cooled (to harden/solidify). Both kinds of making are energy intensive processes, which can require complex equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Second, some conventional rigid containers for fluent products can require significant amounts of material. Rigid containers that are designed to stand up on a support surface require solid walls that are thick enough to support the containers when they are filled. This can require significant amounts of material, which adds to the cost of the containers and can contribute to difficulties with their disposal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Third, some conventional rigid containers for fluent products can be difficult to decorate. The sizes, shapes, (e.g. curved surfaces) and/or materials of some rigid containers, make it difficult to print directly on their outside surfaces. Labeling requires additional materials and processing, and limits the size and shape of the decoration. Overwrapping provides larger decoration areas, but also requires additional materials and processing, often at significant expense.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Fourth, some conventional rigid containers for fluent products can be prone to certain kinds of damage. If a rigid container is pushed against a rough surface, then the container can become scuffed, which may obscure printing on the container. If a rigid container is pressed against a hard object, then the container can become dented, which may look unsightly. And if a rigid container is dropped, then the container can rupture, which may cause its fluent product to be lost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Fifth, some fluent products in conventional rigid containers can be difficult to dispense. When an end user squeezes a rigid container to dispense its fluent product, the end user must overcome the resistance of the rigid sides, to deform the container. Some users may lack the hand strength to easily overcome that resistance; these users may dispense less than their desired amount of fluent product. Other users may need to apply so much of their hand strength, that they cannot easily control how much they deform the container; these users may dispense more than their desired amount of fluent product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Sixth, when using conventional rigid containers, it can be difficult for a manufacturer to change such containers from one product size to another product size. When a product manufacturer offers a fluent product in a conventional rigid container, and the manufacturer needs to change the size of the product, the change usually requires the manufacturer to make and use a new size of container for the new amount. Unfortunately, making a new size of that container can be costly, time-consuming, and challenging to coordinate.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure describes various embodiments of containers made from flexible material. Because these containers are made from flexible material, these containers offer a number of advantages, when compared with conventional rigid containers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">First, these containers can be less expensive to make, because the conversion of flexible materials (from sheet form to finished goods) generally requires less energy and complexity, than formation of rigid materials (from bulk form to finished goods). Second, these containers can use less material, because they are configured with novel support structures that do not require the use of the thick solid walls used in conventional rigid containers. Third, these flexible containers can be easier to print and/or decorate, because they are made from flexible materials, and flexible materials can be printed and/or decorated as conformable webs, before they are formed into containers. Fourth, these flexible containers can be less prone to scuffing, denting, and rupture, because flexible materials allow their outer surfaces to deform when contacting surfaces and objects, and then to bounce back. Fifth, fluent products in these flexible containers can be more readily and carefully dispensed, because the sides of flexible containers can be more easily and controllably squeezed by human hands. Even though the containers of the present disclosure are made from flexible material, they can be configured with sufficient structural integrity, such that they can receive, contain, and dispense fluent product(s), as intended, without failure. Also, these containers can be configured with sufficient structural integrity, such that they can withstand external forces and environmental conditions from handling, without failure. Further, these containers can be configured with structures that allow them to be displayed and put into use, as intended, without failure. Sixth, these flexible containers can be configured with easily variable sizing, allowing a product manufacturer to change a product's size with less expense, in less time, and with less coordination, when compared with conventional rigid containers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In various embodiments, a hand-held disposable stand-up flexible container, configured for retail sale, wherein the container comprises: a multiple dose product volume that directly contains a fluent product, wherein about all of the product volume is made from one or more films; a structural support frame that supports the product volume, wherein the structural support frame includes a plurality of expanded structural support volumes, including a first expanded structural support volume, which: is made from one or more films formed into a first folded gusset; includes a portion that is substantially cylindrical with an overall lateral orientation, and a horizontal reference plane that intersects a longitudinally outermost portion of the first expanded structural support; and includes a first end, having a first seal that is puckered, such that a first corner of the first seal is offset from the horizontal reference plane when the container is standing up.</div>

For any of the embodiments of flexible containers, disclosed herein, any disclosure of a particular value, can, in various alternate embodiments, also be understood as a disclosure of a range equal to about that particular value (i.e. +/−20%).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">As used herein, the term “actual amount” refers to a measured amount of the fluent product(s) present in a product space of a container when the container is configured for retail sale.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">As used herein, the term “ambient conditions” refers to a temperature of 19-21 degrees Celsius and a relative humidity of 45-55%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">As used herein, the term “approximately” modifies a particular value, by referring to a range equal to the particular value, plus or minus fifteen percent (+/−15%). For any of the embodiments of flexible containers, disclosed herein, any disclosure of a particular value, can, in various alternate embodiments, also be understood as a disclosure of a range equal to approximately that particular value (i.e. +/−15%).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">As used herein, the term “atmospheric pressure” refers to an absolute pressure of 1 atmosphere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">As used herein, when referring to a sheet of material, the term “basis weight” refers to a measure of mass per area, in units of grams per square meter (gsm). For any of the embodiments of flexible containers, disclosed herein, in various embodiments, any of the flexible materials can be configured to have a basis weight of 10-1000 gsm, or any integer value for gsm from 10-1000, or within any range formed by any of these values, such as 20-800 gsm, 30-600 gsm, 40-400 gsm, or 50-200, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">As used herein, when referring to a flexible container, the term “bottom” refers to the portion of the container that is located in the lowermost 30% of the overall height of the container, that is, from 0-30% of the overall height of the container. As used herein, the term bottom can be further limited by modifying the term bottom with a particular percentage value, which is less than 30%. For any of the embodiments of flexible containers, disclosed herein, a reference to the bottom of the container can, in various alternate embodiments, refer to the bottom 25% (i.e. from 0-25% of the overall height), the bottom 20% (i.e. from 0-20% of the overall height), the bottom 15% (i.e. from 0-15% of the overall height), the bottom 10% (i.e. from 0-10% of the overall height), or the bottom 5% (i.e. from 0-5% of the overall height), or any integer value for percentage between 0% and 30%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">As used herein, the term “branding” refers to a visual element intended to distinguish a product from other products. Examples of branding include one of more of any of the following: trademarks, trade dress, logos, icons, and the like. For any of the embodiments of flexible containers, disclosed herein, in various embodiments, any surface of the flexible container can include one or more brandings of any size, shape, or configuration, disclosed herein or known in the art, in any combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">As used herein, the term “character” refers to a visual element intended to convey information. Examples of characters include one or more of any of the following: letters, numbers, symbols, and the like. For any of the embodiments of flexible containers, disclosed herein, in various embodiments, any surface of the flexible container can include one or more characters of any size, shape, or configuration, disclosed herein or known in the art, in any combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">As used herein, the term “closed” refers to a state of a product space, wherein fluent products within the product space are prevented from escaping the product space (e.g. by one or more materials that form a barrier), but the product space is not necessarily hermetically sealed. For example, a closed container can include a vent, which allows a head space in the container to be in fluid communication with air in the environment outside of the container.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">As used herein, the term “closed fill height” refers to a distance that is measured when the container is configured for retail sale and while the container is standing upright on a horizontal support surface, the distance measured vertically from the upper side of the support surface to a fill line in a product space of the container. If a container does not have a standing upright orientation but does have a hanging orientation, then the term closed fill height refers to a distance that is measured when the container is configured for retail sale and while the container is hanging down from a support, the distance measured vertically from the lowest point on the container to a fill line in a product space of the container. If a container does not have a standing upright orientation or a hanging orientation, then the term closed fill height does not apply to the container.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">As used herein, the term “deflation feature” refers to one or more structural features provided with a flexible container for use in deflating some or all of the expanded structural support volume(s) of the flexible container, by allowing expansion material(s) inside of the structural support volume to escape into the environment, so that the structural support volume is no longer expanded. A deflation feature can be used when the flexible container is ready to be disposed of (i.e. as waste, compost, and/or recyclable material). Any of the flexible containers disclosed herein can be configured with any number of any kind of deflation feature, configured in any way disclosed herein or known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">One kind of deflation feature is a cutting device, which is a rigid element that includes a point or edge configured to cut and/or pierce through flexible material(s) that form at least part of a structural support volume. As an example, a cutting device can be included with a flexible container by attaching the device to any portion of the outside (e.g. top, middle, side, bottom, etc.) of the container with adhesive, or under a label, or any other way known in the art, for externally attaching rigid elements to a container. As another example, a cutting device can be included with a flexible container by including the device with other packaging material, such as attached to an outer carton, inside of an overwrap layer, in between containers provided together, etc. As still another example, a cutting device can be included with a flexible container by including the device inside of any portion of the container, such as in a product space, in a structural support volume, in a mixing chamber, in a dedicated space for the device, in a base structure, or any other way known in the art, for internally including rigid elements within a container. As yet another example, a cutting device can be included with a flexible container, by making the cutting device integral with or detachable from another rigid element that is part of the container, such as a rigid base structure, cap, dispenser, fitment, connecting element, reinforcing element, or any other rigid element for containers disclosed herein or known in the art. A cutting device can be configured to be any convenient size and any workable shape and can be used manually or through use of a tool. In addition to rigid elements, flexible materials that can be turned into a rigid cutting device through rolling up or folding flexible materials are also envisioned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Another kind of deflation feature is an exit channel, which can be configured to be opened in material(s) that border or define at least a portion of the fillable space of a structural support volume. An exit channel can be an existing connection (e.g. seam, seal, or joint) in the container, which is configured to fail (e.g. separate and at least partially open) when exposed to opening forces. An exit channel can also be formed with one or more points, lines, and/or areas of weakness (e.g. thinned, scored, perforated, frangible seal, etc.), which are configured to fail or to otherwise be breached, when exposed to opening forces. An exit channel can be protected by another material, such as an adhesive label, to ensure the exit channel remains closed until the user wishes to deflate. An exit channel can further be formed by configuring the container with one or more tear initiation sites (such as a notch in an edge, a pull-tab, etc.) such that a tear propagating from the site(s) can open the flexible material. An exit channel can be configured to be any convenient size and any workable shape and can be opened manually (by grasping and pulling, by poking with a finger or fingernail, or any other way) or through use of a tool or by overpressurizing a structural support volume (through application of compressive force or controlled environmental conditions) such that the structural support volume fails when its expansion material(s) burst out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Still another kind of deflation feature is a valve, connected to the fillable space of a structural support volume, wherein the valve can be opened to the container's environment. Embodiments of the present disclosure can use as a deflation feature, any and all embodiments of valves (including materials, structures, and/or features for valves, as well as any and all methods of making and/or using such valves), as disclosed in the following patent documents: U.S. nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 13/379,655 filed Jun. 21, 2010, entitled “Collapsible Bottle, Method Of Manufacturing a Blank For Such Bottle and Beverage-Filled Bottle Dispensing System” in the name of Reidl, published as US2012/0097634; U.S. nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 10/246,893 filed Sep. 19, 2002, entitled “Bubble-Seal Apparatus for Easily Opening a Sealed Package” in the name of Perell, et al., published as 20040057638; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,585,528 filed Dec. 16, 2002, entitled “Package having an inflated frame” in the name of Ferri, et al., granted on Sep. 8, 2009; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">As used herein, the term “directly connected” refers to a configuration wherein elements are attached to each other without any intermediate elements therebetween, except for any means of attachment (e.g. adhesive).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">As used herein, when referring to a flexible container, the term “dispenser” refers to a structure configured to dispense fluent product(s) from a product space and/or from a mixing volume to the environment outside of the container. For any of the flexible containers disclosed herein, any dispenser can be configured in any way disclosed herein or known in the art, including any suitable size, shape, and flow rate. For example, a dispenser can be a push-pull type dispenser, a dispenser with a flip-top cap, a dispenser with a screw-on cap, a rotatable type dispenser, dispenser with a cap, a pump type dispenser, a pump spray type dispenser, a trigger spray type dispenser, a straw dispenser, a flip up straw dispenser, a straw dispenser with bite valve, a dosing dispenser, etc. A dispenser can be a parallel dispenser, providing multiple flow channels in fluid communication with multiple product spaces, wherein those flow channels remain separate until the point of dispensing, thus allowing fluent products from multiple product spaces to be dispensed as separate fluent products, dispensed together at the same time. A dispenser can be a mixing dispenser, providing one or more flow channels in fluid communication with multiple product spaces, with multiple flow channels combined before the point of dispensing, thus allowing fluent products from multiple product spaces to be dispensed as the fluent products mixed together. As another example, a dispenser can be formed by a frangible opening. As further examples, a dispenser can utilize one or more valves and/or dispensing mechanisms disclosed in the art, such as those disclosed in: published US patent application 2003/0096068, entitled “One-way valve for inflatable package”; U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,016 entitled “Self-sealing container”; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,207,717, entitled “Package having a fluid actuated closure”; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Still further, any of the dispensers disclosed herein, may be incorporated into a flexible container either directly, or in combination with one or more other materials or structures (such as a fitment), or in any way known in the art. In some alternate embodiments, dispensers disclosed herein can be configured for both dispensing and filling, to allow filling of product space(s) through one or more dispensers. In other alternate embodiments, a product space can include one or more filling structure(s) (e.g. for adding water to a mixing volume) in addition to or instead of one or more dispenser(s). Any location for a dispenser, disclosed herein can alternatively be used as a location for a filling structure. In some embodiments, a product space can include one or more filling structures in addition to any dispenser(s). And, any location for a dispenser, disclosed herein can alternatively be used as a location for an opening, through which product can be filled and/or dispensed, wherein the opening may be reclosable or non-reclosable, and can be configured in any way known in the art of packaging. For example, an opening can be: a line of weakness, which can be torn open; a zipper seal, which can be pulled open and pressed closed (e.g. a press seal), or opened and closed with a slider; openings with adhesive-based closures; openings with cohesive-based closures; openings with closures having fasteners (e.g. snaps, tin tie, etc.), openings with closures having micro-sized fasteners (e.g. with opposing arrays of interlocking fastening elements, such as hook, loops, and/or other mating elements, etc.), and any other kind of opening for packages or containers, with or without a closure, known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">As used herein, when referring to a flexible container, the term “disposable” refers to a container which, after dispensing a product to an end user, is not configured to be refilled with an additional amount of the product, but is configured to be disposed of (i.e. as waste, compost, and/or recyclable material). Part, parts, or all of any of the embodiments of flexible containers, disclosed herein, can be configured to be disposable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">As used herein, when referring to a flexible container, the term “durable” refers to a container that is reusable more than non-durable containers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">As used herein, when referring to a flexible container, the term “effective base contact area” refers to a particular area defined by a portion of the bottom of the container, when the container is configured for retail sale and is standing upright and its bottom is resting on a horizontal support surface, determined as described below. The effective base contact area lies in a plane defined by the horizontal support surface. The effective base contact area is a continuous area bounded on all sides by an outer periphery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">The outer periphery is formed from an actual contact area and from a series of projected areas from defined cross-sections taken at the bottom of the container. The actual contact area is the one or more portions of the bottom of the container that contact the horizontal support surface, when the effective base contact area is defined. The effective base contact area includes all of the actual contact area. However, in some embodiments, the effective base contact area may extend beyond the actual contact area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">The series of projected area are formed from five horizontal cross-sections, taken at the bottom of the flexible container. These cross-sections are taken at 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% of the overall height. The outer extent of each of these cross-sections is projected vertically downward onto the horizontal support surface to form five (overlapping) projected areas, which, together with the actual contact area, form a single combined area. This is not a summing up of the values for these areas, but is the formation of a single combined area that includes all of these (projected and actual) areas, overlapping each other, wherein any overlapping portion makes only one contribution to the single combined area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">The outer periphery of the effective base contact area is formed as described below. In the following description, the terms convex, protruding, concave, and recessed are understood from the perspective of points outside of and around the combined area. The outer periphery is formed by a combination of the outer extent of the combined area and any chords, which are straight line segments constructed as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">For each continuous portion of the combined area that has an outer perimeter with a shape that is concave or recessed, a chord is constructed across that portion. This chord is the shortest straight line segment that can be drawn tangent to the combined area on both sides of the concave/recessed portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">For a combined area that is discontinuous (formed by two or more separate portions), one or more chords are constructed around the outer perimeter of the combined area, across the one or more discontinuities (open spaces disposed between the portions). These chords are straight line segments drawn tangent to the outermost separate portions of the combined area. These chords are drawn to create the largest possible effective base contact area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">Thus, the outer periphery is formed by a combination of the outer extent of the combined area and any chords, constructed as described above, which all together enclose the effective base area.

In various embodiments, the indicium can be a particular value in various units of measurement (e.g. milliliters and/or fluid ounces for a fluent product that is a liquid; grams and/or ounces of weight for a fluent product that is a pourable solid). In various embodiments, the indicium can be for a particular product size that is associated with a particular amount of fluent product being offered for sale. The indicium can be provided on a label or as printing or in any other form described herein or known in the art. The indicium can be joined to an outside of the container or joined to an inside of the container (and visible through a transparent portion of the container), or on secondary packaging connected to the container. Alternatively, instead of being joined to the container, the indicium can be presented as part of a merchandising display for the container or can be communicated via advertising materials. An external amount indicium is typically applied to a container by the manufacturer of the product or by a retailer of the product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Although a manufacturer may earnestly endeavor to make products that are properly filled and accurately labeled, there may be some limited instances, in which a container may contain an actual amount of fluent product that is not exactly equal to the listed amount of fluent product indicated by its external amount indicium. As a first example, a manufacturer may intentionally overfill containers, in an attempt to make up for projected losses of fluent product (from evaporation) during their shelf life. As a second example, a manufacturer may experience variability in the filling of containers, resulting in a few containers having actual amounts of fluent product that vary somewhat from a targeted amount of fill. As a third example, a retailer may unintentionally sell a product that has passed its expected shelf life, and has experienced a larger than projected loss of fluent product (from evaporation). Despite these limited instances, a container offered for retail sale typically contains an actual amount of fluent product that is nearly equal to the listed amount of fluent product indicated by its external amount indicium.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199">As used herein, the term “overall external displacement” refers to a total volume of a flexible container that is configured for retail sale, when measured according to the following test method for displacement. The test method for displacement is used on one flexible container at a time. Before the testing begins, all secondary packaging is removed from the flexible container; however, the flexible container is neither opened nor unsealed before the testing. The test method for displacement is performed under ambient conditions and at atmospheric pressure. The flexible container is fully submerged in a rigid open container of distilled water that has a temperature of 19-21 degrees Celsius. While the flexible container is submerged, the size and shape of the flexible container must not be artificially distorted by any part of the testing equipment. Before the displacement is measured, any air pockets trapped beneath the flexible container must be removed; also any large bubbles (having diameter greater than 1 centimeter) in the water must be removed. When the displacement is measured, the flexible container is fully submerged, in a standing orientation on a bottom of the rigid open container, and submerged to a depth such that an uppermost portion of the flexible container is 1-5 centimeters beneath the surface of the water. The overall external displacement of the flexible container is measured by determining how much water is displaced by the flexible container when the flexible container is fully submerged, as described above.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0385" num="0384">Making the flexible container <b>2000</b> includes sealing the layers of film with the seal pattern <b>2020</b> and also folding the web; the folding includes folding the web with a fold line <b>2022</b>-<b>5</b>.
