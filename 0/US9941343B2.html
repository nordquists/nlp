<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an area sensor (semiconductor device) having an image sensor function and a display function. In particular, the present invention relates to an area sensor (semiconductor device) that has EL (electroluminescence) elements as a light source and is composed of photoelectric conversion devices provided on a flat surface (insulating surface) and a plurality of thin film transistors (TFTs) arranged in a matrix.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, a solid-state image sensing device is being used, which has diodes, CCDs, or the like for reading an electric signal having image information from a light signal having textural/graphic information, video information, and the like on a sheet of paper. Such a solid-state image sensing device is used for a scanner, a digital camera, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The solid-state image sensing device having photoelectric conversion devices are classified into a line sensor and an area sensor. In the line sensor, photoelectric conversion devices provided in a line shape are scanned with respect to a subject, whereby image information is captured as an electric signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The area sensor is also called a contact-type area sensor, in which photoelectric conversion devices provided on a flat surface are disposed on a subject, and image information is captured as an electric signal. Unlike the line sensor, it is not required to scan photoelectric conversion devices in the area sensor, so that a motor and the like for scanning are not necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref> show a configuration of a conventional area sensor. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> is a perspective view of the area sensor, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref> is a cross-sectional view thereof. A sensor substrate <b>2501</b> with photoelectric conversion devices formed thereon, a backlight <b>2502</b>, and a light scattering plate <b>2503</b> are provided as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Light from the backlight <b>2502</b> (light source) is refracted in the light scattering plate <b>2503</b>, and is radiated to a subject <b>2504</b>. The radiated light is reflected from the subject <b>2504</b>, and radiated to the photoelectric conversion devices provided on the sensor substrate <b>2501</b>. When the photoelectric conversion devices are irradiated with light, a current with a magnitude in accordance with the brightness of light is generated in the photoelectric conversion devices, and image information of the subject <b>2504</b> is captured in the area sensor as an electric signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In the above-mentioned area sensor, when light is not radiated uniformly to the subject from the backlight <b>2502</b>, a read image may partially become light or dark, resulting in inconsistencies of the image. This makes it necessary to design the light scattering plate <b>2503</b> so that light is radiated uniformly to the subject <b>2504</b>, and to precisely adjust the position of the backlight <b>2502</b>, the light scattering plate <b>2503</b>, the sensor substrate <b>2501</b>, and the subject <b>2504</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">It is also difficult to minimize the size of the backlight <b>2502</b> and the light scattering plate <b>2503</b>, which prevents the area sensor from becoming small, thin, and light-weight.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, with the foregoing in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide an area sensor that is small, thin, and light-weight, and in which a read image has no inconsistencies in lightness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">An area sensor of the present invention uses a photodiode as a photoelectric conversion device. The area sensor also uses an electroluminescense (EL) element as a light source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In the present specification, a photodiode (photoelectric conversion device) includes an N-type semiconductor layer, a P-type semiconductor layer, and a photoelectric conversion device provided so as to come into contact with a part of the N-type semiconductor layer and the P-type semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">When a photodiode is irradiated with light, the voltage thereof is decreased due to carriers generated by the light. At this time, as light intensity is higher, the amount of a decrease in voltage becomes larger. Furthermore, by comparing a voltage in the case where a photodiode is irradiated with light, with a voltage in the case where the photodiode is not irradiated with light, a signal is input to a sensor signal line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">An EL element (light-emitting element) is a spontaneous light-emitting element, and is mainly used for an EL display. An EL display is also called an organic EL display (OELD) or an organic light-emitting diode (OLED).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">An EL element has a configuration in which an EL layer (organic compound layer) is interposed between a pair of electrodes (positive electrode and negative electrode), and the EL layer usually has a multi-layer configuration. Typically, there is a multi-layer configuration “hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer” proposed by Tang of Eastman Kodak. This configuration has a very high light-emitting efficiency, and most of the EL display apparatuses that are being studied and developed adopt this configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Alternatively, an EL layer may have a configuration in which a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light-emitting layer, and an electron transport layer are stacked in this order on an electrode or a configuration in which a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light-emitting layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injection layer are stacked in this order on an electrode. A light-emitting layer may be doped with a fluorescent colorant or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In the present specification, all the layers provided between a pair of electrodes are collectively referred to as an “EL layer (organic compound layer)”. Therefore, the above-mentioned hole injection layer, hole transport layer, light-emitting layer, electron transport layer, electron injection layer, etc. are all included in the EL layer. A predetermined voltage is applied to an EL layer with the above-mentioned configuration through a pair of electrodes, whereby carriers are recombined in a light-emitting layer to emit light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present specification, an EL element (light-emitting element) has a configuration in which an organic compound layer is interposed between a pair of electrodes (positive electrode and negative electrode). The organic compound layer can be made of a known light-emitting material. Furthermore, the organic compound layer can have a single-layer configuration and a multi-layer configuration. According to the present invention the organic compound layer may have either configuration. As luminescence in the organic compound layer, there are light emission (fluorescence) occurring when a singlet excited state is changed to a ground state and light emission (phosphorescence) occurring when a triplet excited state is changed to a ground state. According to the present invention, either light emission may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Photodiodes and EL elements are provided on the same sensor substrate in a matrix. The photodiodes and the EL elements are controlled for operation, respectively, using thin film transistors (TFTs) similarly provided on the substrate in a matrix.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Light emitted from the EL elements is reflected from a subject and radiated to the photodiodes. A current is generated by the light radiated to the photodiodes, and an electric signal (image signal) having image information of the subject is captured by an area sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the present invention, due to the above-mentioned configuration, light is radiated uniformly to a subject, so that no inconsistencies in lightness are caused in a read image. Furthermore, it is not required to provide a backlight and a light scattering plate separately from a sensor substrate. Therefore, unlike a conventional example, an area sensor can be made small, thin, and light-weight without precisely adjusting the position of a backlight, a light scattering plate, a sensor substrate, and a subject. Furthermore, the mechanical strength of an area sensor is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The area sensor of the present invention is also capable of displaying an image, using the EL elements. The EL elements in the present invention have a function as a light source for reading an image and a function as a light source for displaying an image. Therefore, even when an electronic display is not provided separately on the area sensor, an image can be displayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Examples of a film made of silicon include a single crystal silicon film, a polycrystalline silicon film (polysilicon film), an amorphous silicon film (amorphous silicon film), etc. In the photodiode according to the present invention, a photoelectric conversion layer is made of an amorphous silicon film (amorphous silicon film), an N-type semiconductor layer is made of an N-type polycrystalline silicon film (polysilicon film), and a P-type semiconductor layer is made of a polycrystalline silicon film (polysilicon film). The amorphous silicon film is thicker than the polycrystalline silicon film, and the ratio in thickness therebetween is preferably (1 to 10):1. In the photodiode used in the present invention, a photoelectric conversion layer can receive more light when the thickness of the amorphous silicon film is larger than that of the polycrystalline silicon film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the present invention, a photoelectric conversion layer is made of an amorphous silicon film due to its high light absorptivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In a photodiode, a dark current (i.e., current flowing at a light intensity of 0) may flow even when light is not radiated to the photodiode. However, due to a high resistance of an amorphous silicon film, a current does not flow even under the condition of dark light, whereby a dark current can be decreased. More specifically, when a dark current is small, a range of lightness and darkness of light which a photodiode can receive is enlarged in the case of dark light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a metal film <b>280</b> can also be formed so as to cover a first interlayer insulating film <b>250</b> provided on a photoelectric conversion layer <b>248</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Light is radiated to a subject <b>270</b> from an EL element, and light reflected form the subject <b>270</b> is radiated to a photodiode <b>306</b>. However, in this case, among light passing through the photodiode <b>306</b>, there exists light that is not radiated to the photoelectric conversion layer <b>248</b>. If the metal film <b>280</b> is present as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, such light is reflected from the metal film <b>280</b>, whereby the photoelectric conversion layer <b>248</b> can receive it. Because of this, the photoelectric conversion layer <b>248</b> can receive more light.</div>

Note that the structure of the sensor portion is the same as that of the embodiment mode, and therefore <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are referenced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a top view of an area sensor of Embodiment 1. Reference numeral <b>120</b> denotes a source signal line driving circuit, reference numeral <b>122</b> denotes a gate signal line driving circuit, and both control the driving of the switching TFT <b>104</b> and the EL driving TFT <b>105</b>. Further, reference numeral <b>121</b> denotes a sensor source signal line driving circuit, reference numeral <b>123</b> denotes a sensor gate signal line driving circuit, and both control the driving of the reset TFT <b>110</b>, the buffer TFT <b>111</b>, and the selection TFT <b>112</b>. Note that the source signal line driving circuit <b>120</b>, the gate signal line driving circuit <b>122</b>, the sensor source signal line driving circuit <b>121</b>, and the sensor gate signal line driving circuit <b>123</b> are referred to as a driving portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">The source signal line driving circuit <b>120</b> has a shift register <b>120</b> <i>a</i>, a latch (A) <b>120</b> <i>b</i>, and a latch (B) <b>120</b> <i>c</i>. A clock signal (CLK) and a start pulse (SP) are inputted to the shift register <b>120</b> <i>a </i>in the source signal line driving circuit <b>120</b>. The shift register <b>120</b> <i>a </i>generates timing signals in order based upon the clock signal (CLK) and the start pulse (SP), and the timing signals are supplied one after another to downstream circuits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">Note that the timing signals from the shift register <b>120</b> <i>a </i>may be buffer-amplified by a circuit such as a buffer (not shown in the figure) and then supplied one after another to the downstream circuits as the buffer-amplified timing signals. The load capacitance (parasitic capacitance) of a wiring to which the timing signals are supplied is large because many of the circuits and elements are connected to the wiring. The buffer is formed in order to prevent dullness in the rise and fall of the timing signal, generated due to the large load capacitance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">The timing signals from the shift register <b>120</b> <i>a </i>are supplied to the latch (A) <b>120</b> <i>b</i>. The latch (A) <b>120</b> <i>b </i>has a plurality of latch stages for processing a digital signal. The latch (A) <b>120</b> <i>b </i>writes in and maintains digital signals in order simultaneously with the input of the timing signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">Note that the digital signals may be sequentially inputted to the plurality of latch stages of the latch (A) <b>120</b> <i>b </i>when the digital signals are taken in by the latch (A) <b>120</b> <i>b</i>. However, the present invention is not limited to this structure. A so-called division drive may be performed, that is, the plurality of latch stages of the latch (A) <b>120</b> <i>b </i>is divided into a number of groups, and then the digital signals are parallel inputted to the respective groups at the same time. Note that the number of groups at this point is called a division number. For example, if the latch circuits are grouped into 4 stages each, then it is called a 4-branch division drive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">The time necessary to complete writing of the digital signals into all the latch stages of the latch (A) <b>120</b> <i>b </i>is called a line period. In other words, the line period is defined as a time interval from the start of writing the digital data signals into the latch circuit of the leftmost stage to the end of writing the digital signals into the latch of the rightmost stage in the latch (A) <b>120</b> <i>b</i>. In effect, the above-defined line period added with the horizontal retrace period may also be referred to as the line period.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">After the completion of one line period, a latch signal is supplied to the latch (B) <b>120</b> <i>c</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">Sequential writing-in of digital signals on the basis of the timing signals from the shift register <b>120</b> <i>a </i>is again carried out to the latch (A) <b>120</b> <i>b </i>after it has completed sending the digital signals to the latch (B) <b>120</b> <i>c. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">During this second time one line period, the digital signals written in and held by the latch (B) <b>120</b> <i>c </i>are inputted to the source signal lines S<b>1</b> to Sx.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">On the other hand, the gate signal line driving circuit <b>122</b> is composed of a shift register and a buffer (both not shown in the figure). Depending on the situation, the gate signal line driving circuit <b>122</b> may have a level shifter in addition to the shift register and the buffer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">In the gate signal line driving circuit <b>122</b>, the gate signal is supplied to the buffer (not shown in the figure) from the shift register (also not shown in the figure), and this is supplied to a corresponding gate signal line. Gate electrodes of the switching TFTs <b>104</b> of one line portion of pixels are connected to each of the gate signal lines G<b>1</b> to Gy. All of the switching TFTs <b>104</b> of the one line portion of pixels must be placed in an ON state simultaneously, and therefore a buffer in which a large electric current can flow is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">Note that the number of source signal line driving circuits and gate signal line driving circuits, their structure, and their operation are not limited to the structure shown by Embodiment 1.

The frame period is divided into an address period Ta and a sustain period Ts. The address period is a period in which a digital signal is inputted to all of the pixels during one frame period. The sustain period (also referred to as a turn-on period) denotes a period in which the EL elements emit light or not in accordance with the digital signal inputted to the pixels in the address period and display is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">The electric potential of the electric power source supply lines V<b>1</b> to Vx is maintained at a predetermined electric potential (electric power source potential).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0270">The above operations are repeated through the gate signal line Gy, the digital signal is inputted to the gate electrodes of the EL driving TFTs <b>105</b> of all the pixels <b>102</b>, and the address period is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0271">The sustain period begins simultaneously to the end of the address period Ta. All of the switching TFTs <b>104</b> are placed in an OFF state in the sustain period.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0272">Then, at the same time as the sustain period begins, the electric potential of the opposing electrodes of all the EL elements has a height of the electric potential difference between the electric power source potential to the level at which the EL elements will emit light when the electric potential of the electric power source is applied to the pixel electrodes. Note that the electric potential difference between the pixel electrode and the opposing electrode is referred to as an EL driving voltage in this specification. Further, the EL driving TFTs <b>105</b> are placed in an ON state in accordance with the digital signal inputted to the gate electrode of the EL driving TFTs <b>105</b> of each pixel. Therefore, the electric power source potential is applied to the pixel electrodes of the EL elements, and the EL elements of all pixels emit light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0273">One frame period is completed at the same time as the sustain period is completed. It is necessary that the pixels emit light in all of the sampling periods ST<b>1</b> to STy with the present invention. Therefore, it is very important that the sensor frame period SF be included within the sustain period when using the digital driving method of Embodiment 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0274">Note that an explanation of a method of driving the area sensor for reading in a single color image is explained in Embodiment 1, but a case of reading in a color image is similar. However, for the case of an area sensor which reads in a color image, one frame period is divided into three subframe periods corresponding to RGB, and an address period and a sustain period are formed in each subframe period. A digital signal is inputted to all of the pixels such that only the EL elements of pixels corresponding to R will emit light, and only the EL elements for the color R perform light emission in the sustain period. The subframe periods for G and B are similar, and only EL elements of pixels corresponding to the respective colors perform light emission in each sustain period.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">For the case of an area sensor which reads in a color image, it is important that each sustain period of the three subframe periods corresponding to RGB contains a sensor frame period for R, G, and B (SFr, SFg, SFb), respectively.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0279">It is preferable that 60 or more frame periods be provided each second for the case of Embodiment 2. By setting the number of images displayed each second to 60 or greater, it becomes possible to visually suppress image flicker.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0280">The subframe period is divided into an address period Ta and a sustain period Ts.

An analog signal is then input to all of the pixels such that only the EL elements of pixels corresponding to R will emit light in an R subframe period, and only the EL elements for the color R perform light emission. The subframe periods for G and B are similar, and only EL elements of pixels corresponding to the respective color perform light emission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0319" num="0318">For the case of an area sensor which reads in a color image, it is important that each sustain period of the three subframe periods corresponding to RGB contain a sensor frame period for R, G, and B (SFr, SFg, SFb), respectively.</div>

In any case, the W film needs to have a low resistance so as to be used as a gate electrode, and the resistance of the W film is desirably 20 μΩcm or less. By enlarging crystal particles, the W film is allowed to have a low resistance. However, in the case where a number of impurity elements such as oxygen are present in the W film, crystallization of the W film is inhibited to have a high resistance. Thus, in this embodiment, the W film is formed by sputtering using W with a high purity (99.9999%) as a target in such a manner that impurities are not mixed from a vapor phase during film formation, whereby the resistance of 9 to 20 μΩcm of the W film can be realized.</div>

It may also be possible that a laser beam is radiated to the peeling layer <b>3102</b> from the device forming substrate <b>3101</b> side to vaporize the peeling layer <b>3102</b>, whereby the device forming substrate <b>3101</b> is peeled off. In this case, it is required to appropriately select the kind of a laser beam and the material for the device forming substrate <b>3101</b> so that a laser beam passes through the device forming substrate <b>3101</b>. For example, when a quartz substrate is used as the device forming substrate <b>3101</b>, a YAG laser (fundamental (1064 nm), second harmonic (532 nm), third harmonic (355 nm), fourth harmonic (266 nm)) or an excimer laser (wavelength: 308 nm) is used to form a line-shaped beam and the line-shaped beam may be allowed to pass through the quartz substrate. An excimer laser does not pass through a glass substrate. Therefore, if a glass substrate is used as the device forming substrate <b>3101</b>, a fundamental, a second harmonic, and a third harmonic of the YAG laser (preferably, the second harmonic (wavelength: 532 nm)) is used to form a line-shaped beam, and the line-shaped beam may be allowed to pass through a glass substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0423" num="0422">In the case of conducting peeling by using a laser beam, the peeling layer <b>3102</b> that is vaporized with a laser beam to be radiated is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0424" num="0423">In addition to the method of using a laser beam, it may also be possible that the device forming substrate <b>3101</b> is peeled off by dissolving the peeling layer <b>3102</b> in a solution. In this case, it is preferable to use a solution that allows the peeling layer <b>3102</b> to be selectively dissolved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0425" num="0424">When the TFTs and the EL elements are transferred to the sealing member <b>3113</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, a second adhesive <b>3114</b> is formed, and a second device forming substrate <b>3115</b> is attached. As the second adhesive <b>3114</b>, an insulating film made of resin (typically, polyimide, acrylic resin, polyamide, or epoxy resin) may be used. Alternatively, an inorganic insulating film (typically, a silicon oxide film) may be used. In the case where the second adhesive <b>3114</b> is positioned on an observer side, seen from the EL elements, a material transmitting light needs to be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0426" num="0425">As described above, the TFTs and the EL elements are transferred from the device forming substrate <b>3101</b> to the second device forming substrate <b>3115</b>. Consequently, an EL display apparatus interposed between the sealing member <b>3113</b> and the second device forming substrate <b>3115</b> can be obtained. If the sealing member <b>3113</b> and the second device forming substrate <b>3115</b> are made of the same material, thermal expansion coefficients thereof become equal to each other. Therefore, the apparatus becomes unlikely to be influenced by stress distortion due to a change in temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0427" num="0426">In the EL display apparatus produced in this embodiment, the material for the sealing member <b>3113</b> and the second device forming substrate <b>3115</b> can be selected without being influenced by heat resistance during a process of TFTs. For example, a plastic substrate can be used as the sealing member <b>3113</b> and the second device forming substrate <b>3115</b>, whereby a flexible EL display apparatus can be created.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0475" num="0474">According to the present invention, due to the above-mentioned configuration, light is radiated uniformly to a subject, so that no inconsistencies in lightness are caused in a read image. Furthermore, unlike a conventional example, it is not required to provide a backlight and a light scattering plate separately from a sensor substrate. Therefore, the mechanical strength of an area sensor is increased without requiring precise adjustment of the position of a backlight, a light scattering plate, a sensor substrate, and a subject. As a result, an area sensor can be made small, thin, and light-weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0476" num="0475">The area sensor of the present invention is also capable of displaying an image on a sensor portion, using EL elements.

The amorphous silicon film is thicker than the polycrystalline silicon film, and the ratio in thickness therebetween is preferably (1 to 10):1. Since the amorphous silicon film is thicker than the polycrystalline silicon film, the photoelectric conversion layer can receive more light. According to the present invention, the amorphous silicon film has a light absorptivity higher than that of the polycrystalline silicon film and the like, so that an amorphous silicon film is used for the photoelectric conversion layer.</div>
