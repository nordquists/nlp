<heading id="h-0003">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention relates generally to heterojunction structures, and more particularly a gate-tunable diode including a vertical stacked heterojunction of two ultrathin semiconductors, and fabrication method and applications of the same.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the present invention. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The p-n junction diode and field-effect transistor (FET) are the two most ubiquitous building blocks of modern electronics and optoelectronics. In recent years, the emergence of reduced dimensionality materials has suggested that these components can be scaled down to atomic thicknesses [1, 2]. Although high performance field-effect devices have been achieved from monolayered materials [3, 4] and their heterostructures [5-10], a p-n heterojunction diode derived from ultrathin materials is notably absent and constrains the fabrication of complex electronic and optoelectronic circuits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In bulk semiconductor p-n junctions, the doping level is primarily controlled via diffusion or implantation of substitutional impurities, which implies minimal control over the doping profile following device fabrication. In contrast, atomically thin semiconductors can be electrostatically doped by applying a bias to a capacitively coupled gate electrode. The atomically thin structure of these materials also enables doping modulation of the overlying layers in a vertically stacked heterostructure [6]. For example, this strategy allows gapless graphene to be used in field-effect tunneling devices in combination with other layered materials [6, 8]. Vertical 2D heterostructures have also been used to create high performance MOSFETs [5], tunneling FETs [6], barristors [15], inverters [7], and memory devices [9, 10] in addition to facilitating the study of novel physical phenomena in layered materials [16, 17]. Similarly, in-plane graphene heterostructures have served as the basis of unique 2D devices [18-20]. Although the nearly perfect 2D structure and low density of states in graphene provide advantages in some heterostructure devices, its gapless nature prevents the formation of a large potential barrier for charge separation and current rectification. In particular, the lack of monolayer semiconductors with complementary (p and n) polarities has precluded the realization of a gate-tunable heterojunction p-n diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the art to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.</div>

Also, it will be understood that when an element is referred to as being “on” another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on” another element, there are no intervening elements present. As used herein, the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms.

In accordance with the purposes of this disclosure, as embodied and broadly described herein, this disclosure, in one aspect, relates to a gate-tunable p-n heterojunction diode including a vertical stacked heterojunction of two ultrathin semiconductors, and fabrication method and applications of the same. According to the invention, among other things, the key innovations are fabrication of a p-n heterojunction from atomically thin materials, and a p-n heterojunction whose electrical properties and photoresponse can be tuned by a gate voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a gate-tunable diode including a vertical stacked heterojunction of two ultrathin semiconductors is schematically shown according to one embodiment of the invention.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In one embodiment, one of the first semiconductor layer <b>20</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>30</b> is formed of an n-type semiconductor, and the other of the first semiconductor layer <b>20</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>30</b> is formed of a p-type semiconductor. The n-type semiconductor has a band gap that is larger than that of the p-type semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, the diode includes a first electrode <b>50</b> and a second electrode <b>60</b> formed on the substrate <b>10</b>, which are in contact with the first portion <b>21</b> of the first semiconductor layer <b>20</b> and the first portion <b>31</b> of the second semiconductor layer <b>30</b>, respectively.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">According to the invention, the first semiconductor layer <b>20</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>30</b> are of ultrathin layers having a monolayer thickness. The ultrathin nature of the heterojunction allows the gate tunability of the diode electrical characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">The diode can be characterized with a ratio of a forward current to a reverse current. According to the invention, the forward-to-reverse current ratio varies as a function of a gate voltage applied to the gate layer. The electrical characteristics of the diode are tunable with the applied gate voltage over a wide range of charge transport behavior ranging from insulating to rectifying with the forward-to-reverse bias current ratio exceeding 10<sup>4</sup>. As a result, the diode is capable of functioning as an insulator, a linear-response resistor, or a highly rectifying diode, in response to the applied gate voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, the diode has an optical response to optical illumination of light at a wavelength ranging from near-infrared wavelength to a visible wavelength. The diode has a photoresponse time that is less than about 15 μs, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) that is greater than about 25%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">In one embodiment, the gate-tunable p-n heterojunction diode uses semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) and single-layer molybdenum disulphide (SL-MoS<sub>2</sub>) as p-type and n-type semiconductors, respectively. In particular, SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>which is n-type semiconductor is stacked below p-type semiconducting s-SWCNTs with each of them connected to gold electrodes to form a p-n heterojunction. The vertical stacking of these two direct band gap [11-13] semiconductors forms a heterojunction with electrical characteristics that can be tuned with an applied gate bias over a wide range of charge transport behavior ranging from insulating to rectifying with forward-to-reverse bias current ratios exceeding 10<sup>4</sup>. The gate tunability also allows spectral control over the photoresponse. In addition, the band gaps of the carbon nanotubes (about 0.5 eV) and MoS<sub>2 </sub>(about 1.8 eV) allow concurrent optical response at near-infrared and visible wavelengths. This heterojunction diode also responds strongly to optical irradiation with an EQE of about 25% and fast photoresponse being less than 15 μs. Since SWCNTs have a diverse range of electrical properties as a function of chirality and an increasing number of atomically thin 2D nanomaterials are being isolated [14], the gate-tunable p-n heterojunction should be widely generalizable to realize diverse ultrathin, high performance electronics and optoelectronics.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Semiconducting SWCNTs with about 99% semiconductor purity were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation following the procedure discussed in a previous report [22]. SWCNT thin films were prepared by vacuum filtration and transferred onto pre-patterned Au electrodes by the acetone bath transfer method as outlined in the literature [22, 30]. The semiconducting purity of the sorted SWCNTs was estimated using the optical absorbance characterization and analysis protocol developed earlier [23, 30]. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the optical absorbance spectra for as-purchased arc-discharge SWCNTs (P2, Carbon Solutions Inc.) and sorted about 99% semiconductor purity SWCNTs. The average diameter of the semiconducting SWCNTs is 1.4 nm. The unsorted SWCNTs <b>611</b> possess a mixture of metallic and semiconducting species as evidenced by the presence of both semiconducting (S<sub>22 </sub>and S<sub>33</sub>) and metallic (M<sub>11</sub>) peaks, while the spectrum of the sorted semiconducting SWCNTs <b>612</b> shows strong semiconducting peaks and negligible metallic peaks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">Device Fabrication</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">All devices were fabricated on 300 nm thick SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrates. The Si &lt;100&gt; wafers were purchased from Silicon Quest International. The wafers were doped n-type with As (resistivity=0.001-0.005 Ω-cm). The MoS<sub>2 </sub>FETs were fabricated using previously reported techniques [32]. Specifically, bulk MoS<sub>2 </sub>crystals were purchased from SPI Supplies and mechanically exfoliated using scotch tape. The MoS<sub>2 </sub>flakes were identified using an optical microscope (Olympus BX 51M) and then subjected to electron-beam lithography (EBL). A two-step EBL process was adopted to fabricate Au contacts with no adhesion layer. The patterns in the first step were designed to be just short of touching the MoS<sub>2 </sub>flakes. Au (75 nm thick) is the metal in contact with the MoS<sub>2 </sub>flake. Following liftoff in acetone, the devices were further cleaned with remover PG (Microchem) at about 60° C. for about 1 hour.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">A portion of the MoS<sub>2 </sub>FET including both the contacts and channel was exposed in a subsequent step of EBL. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) (Cambridge Nanotech, Savannah S100) was used to grow about 30 nm alumina at about 100° C. to insulate the MoS<sub>2 </sub>channel and contacts, thus prevent shorting following subsequent SWCNT deposition. Trimethyl aluminum (TMA) (Aldrich, 99%) was used as the precursor for ALD growth of alumina, and ultrahigh purity nitrogen (Airgas) was used as the purging gas. A single ALD cycle included a TMA pulse for about 0.015 s and a 30 s purge, followed by a H<sub>2</sub>O pulse for 0.015 s and a second 30 s purge. The growth rate was determined to be about 0.75 Å/cycle. A total of about 400 cycles was performed to achieve about 30 nm thickness. The oxide was lifted off in warm acetone at about 50° C. for about 1 hour. A cellulose membrane containing the semiconducting SWCNT film was then stamped onto the entire substrate and dissolved under acetone vapor as outlined in previous reports [22]. The SWCNT film was annealed in vacuum (50 mTorr) at about 200° C. for about 1 hour and then patterned with EBL using a ZEP 150 (Nippon Zeon) resist. Reactive ion etching (Samco RIE-10 NR) in an oxygen plasma atmosphere (100 mW, 15 sec, 20 sccm) was then used to etch the nanotubes. The resist was subsequently dissolved in heated (80 C) N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone for about 6 hours. The SWCNT film morphology close to the heterojunction region was characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, where (A) topographic image and (B) amplitude error show the random network morphology and uniform coverage of SWCNTs (scale bar=1.5 μm).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">The ultrathin nature of the heterojunction allows the gate tunability of the diode electrical characteristics. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the output plots <b>211</b>-<b>215</b> of the p-n heterojunction diode under different gate biases V<sub>G</sub>=70 V, 40 V, 0 V, −40 V, and −80 V, respectively. The p-n heterojunction diode transitions from a nearly insulating behavior at V<sub>G</sub>=70 V to a poorly rectifying state (r<sup>2</sup>&lt;60% for fits to the Shockley diode equation) at V<sub>G</sub>=40 V to a highly rectifying diode for V<sub>G</sub>≤0 V (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;99%). The transfer plot further demonstrates the gate tunability of the current through the p-n heterojunction, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, where the gate voltage V<sub>G </sub>was swept at 10 V/sec in steps of 1 V in the transfer and output plots. The transfer characteristics <b>223</b> of the heterojunction can be qualitatively viewed as a superposition of the transfer plots of the p-type s-SWCNT FET <b>222</b> and n-type SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>FET <b>221</b>. However, the net current through the heterojunction is smaller than the SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>and s-SWCNT FET transfer characteristics due to the additional resistance at the heterojunction. The transfer characteristics <b>223</b> of the heterojunction shows an unusual gate voltage dependence, which refers to as ‘anti-ambipolar’ behavior. In particular, the maximum conductance occurs near V<sub>G</sub>=0, which is the opposite of conventional ambipolar behavior that shows a minimum conductance near V<sub>G</sub>=0.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">An important parameter in characterizing the diode characteristics is the ratio of the forward current, |I<sub>f</sub>|, to the reverse current, |I<sub>r</sub>|, at the same bias magnitude. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows that |I<sub>f</sub>|/|I<sub>r</sub>| varies by over five orders of magnitude as a function of gate voltage. Between the two gate bias extremes, the s-SWCNT/SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>heterojunction transitions from an n-n<sup>+</sup> junction at V<sub>G</sub>=80 V to a p-n junction at V<sub>G</sub>=−80 V. The large band gap of SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>(greater than 1.8 eV) [13] compared to the s-SWCNTs (about 0.7 eV) allows electrostatic depletion of SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>to a lightly n doped (n<sup>−</sup>) or nearly intrinsic insulating state, thereby leading to |I<sub>f</sub>|/|I<sub>r</sub>| values exceeding 10<sup>4 </sup>at V<sub>G</sub>=−80 V. On the other hand, the small band gap of the s-SWCNTs allows electrostatic inversion from p-doping to n-doping at large positive V<sub>G</sub>, resulting in poor |I<sub>f</sub>|/|I<sub>r</sub>| values for V<sub>G</sub>&gt;60 V.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The gate dependence of the diode behavior enables gate-tunable rectifier circuits, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, which is a unique feature of the s-SWCNT/SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>heterojunction diode that has not been observed in conventional bulk semiconductor diodes.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">A scanning confocal microscope (100× objective with NA=0.9, WiTec system) coupled to a tunable coherent white light source (NKT Photonics) was used to generate the spatially resolved photocurrent, which was converted into a voltage by a current preamplifier and recorded by either a lock-in amplifier (for imaging) or a digital sampling oscilloscope (for temporally resolved measurements). The heterojunction area was subjected to global illumination using the same apparatus with a 20× objective. The I-V characteristics under the global illumination were acquired using the same Keithley 2400 source meters and custom Lab View programs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>and s-SWCNTs both have direct band gaps [11, 12] and show signatures of bound excitonic states in their absorption spectra [2, 12]. Therefore, photocurrent is expected upon optical irradiation of the p-n heterojunctions based on these materials. Towards that end, scanning photocurrent microscopy is employed to spatially map the local photoresponse of the s-SWCNT/SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>heterojunction device, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. The regions of high photocurrent intensity <b>341</b> lie in the heterojunction area <b>340</b> outlined by the SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>flake <b>323</b> overlapping with the patterned s-SWCNT film <b>333</b>. The patterned alumina is indicated by a dashed line <b>325</b> while electrodes are indicated by dashed lines <b>321</b>, <b>322</b> and <b>331</b>, respectively. No measurable photocurrent is observed from the non-overlapping regions of either the s-SWCNT film, SL-MoS<sub>2</sub>, or the electrical contacts, indicating that the photocurrent is generated by the vertical heterojunction <b>340</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">Spatial Raman and photoluminescence (PL) mapping was performed on the heterojunction device. A spatial map of the Raman 2G peak (3100-3250 cm<sup>−1</sup>) from SWCNTs and photoluminescence from SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>at 3700-3900 cm<sup>−1 </sup>(A peak) shows that the photocurrent arises only from the heterojunction region. It was also observed that that the PL signal was uniform in the heterojunction area of the MoS<sub>2 </sub>flake as compared to the protected/masked area as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> is an optical micrograph of the heterojunction device showing a SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>FET <b>1020</b> and s-SWCNT FET <b>1030</b>, where the white dotted outline <b>1033</b> indicates the extent of the patterned SWCNT film (scale bar=10 μm). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is a zoom-in of the optical micrograph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> representing the area scanned for spatial photocurrent mapping in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The spectral dependence of the photocurrent, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, correspond to the absorption peaks of SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>[13] and S<sub>22 </sub>[23] peaks of s-SWCNTs, which demonstrates that this novel heterointerface can induce carrier separation following exciton and/or free carrier generation in either material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">To further illustrate the photoresponse of the s-SWCNT/SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>heterojunction, both output curve (I-V) and transfer curve (I-V<sub>g</sub>) were acquired under global illumination at a series of wavelengths. A representative comparison of the dark (<b>361</b>) and illuminated (<b>362</b>) I-V curves at V<sub>G</sub>=−40 V reveals that the photocurrent increases by 4 orders of magnitude at a heterojunction reverse bias of −5 V, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> also shows the gate voltage dependent photocurrent values at a heterojunction reverse bias of −10 V. As the gate voltage becomes more negative, the relative contribution from the s-SWCNT portion of the spectrum decreases, which is consistent with the s-SWCNT/SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>heterojunction becoming a p<sup>+</sup>-n<sup>−</sup> junction. This decrease could be due to a reduction in the rate of charge transfer due to changes in Fermi level differences across the heterojunction or a decrease in the depletion of the s-SWCNTs adjacent to the heterojunction leading to reduced efficiency of electron extraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">With a strong photoresponse, the s-SWCNT/SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>heterojunction can be exploited as a photodetector. Diode-based photodetectors are known for their fast photoresponse times compared to phototransistors since the photoexcited carriers must only traverse a distance equal to the depletion width of the junction. Indeed, a fast photoresponse, less than about 15 μs, was observed from the s-SWCNT/SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>heterojunction, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. Importantly, this photoresponse time is orders of magnitude smaller than recently reported heterojunction phototransistors based on graphene [24]. Furthermore, the s-SWCNT/SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>heterojunction photoresponse time observed here is limited by the rise time of the preamplifier used in the experiment, and thus 15 μs represents an upper bound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">Responsivity and Quantum Efficiency</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the s-SWCNT/SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>heterojunction photodetector is also noteworthy (about 25% at V<sub>D</sub>=−10 V) and compares favorably to other recently reported 2D nanomaterial heterostructures, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> [24-26].</div>

where I<sub>ph</sub>, e, P, and hv represent the photocurrent, electronic charge, incident optical power, and photon energy, respectively. The photocurrent was extracted by subtracting the dark I-V curves from the illuminated I-V curves. The responsivity (R) was calculated using R=EQEx1.24/λ, where λ is in μm.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The linear rise in EQE at low reverse biases shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> is similar to the behavior of quantum dot (QD) based photodiodes [27], which was related to changes in the depletion region. Here, given the negligible thickness of SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>compared to the expected depletion width [28], the increasing EQE is attributed to an increase in the rate of charge transfer across the heterojunction interface due to the change in band alignment, rather than an increase in the depletion width. The spectral responsivity (R) of the heterojunction photodetector is presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. The highest R exceeds 0.1 A/W at a wavelength of 650 nm, which is comparable to other nanostructured diode-based photodetectors in the literature [29]. The combination of high R and fast photoresponse time presents advantages over currently available organic and QD photodiodes [27].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">Power Dependence of Photocurrent</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The power dependence of the photocurrent was measured under zero bias using the same illumination system. The power dependence is sub-linear which is consistent with bimolecular recombination of electrons and holes, further implying that the concentration of photogenerated carriers is similar to or greater than the intrinsic carrier concentration [33]. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows power dependence of the photocurrent under zero applied bias. The line <b>1110</b> is a linear fit to the data showing a slope of 0.73.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In sum, the present invention recites, among other things, a gate-tunable p-n heterojunction diode through the integration of p-type s-SWCNTs and n-type SL-MoS<sub>2</sub>. The ultrathin nature of the constituent materials implies that both components can be modulated by a capacitively coupled gate bias, thereby enabling wide tunability of charge transport from a nearly insulating state to a highly rectifying condition with forward-to-reverse bias current ratios exceeding 10<sup>4</sup>. When operated as a three-terminal device, the p-n heterojunction diode also shows ‘anti-ambipolar’ behavior with current on/off ratios greater than 10<sup>4</sup>, suggesting its utility in advanced logic applications. Furthermore, since s-SWCNTs and SL-MoS<sub>2 </sub>are direct band gap semiconductors, the p-n heterojunction diode serves as an effective photodetector with fast photoresponse less than about 15 μs. By combining other chirality-resolved s-SWCNTs [30] with the growing list of 2D semiconductor nanomaterials [14], the p-n heterojunction diode can be generalized to a wide range of electronic and optoelectronic applications.</div>
