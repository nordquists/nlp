<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an integrated system of programming communication and involves the fields of computer processing, computer communications, television, radio, and other electronic communications; the fields of automating the handling, recording, and retransmitting of television, radio, computer, and other electronically transmitted programming; and the fields of regulating, metering, and monitoring the availability, use, and usage of such programming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">For years, television has been recognized as a most powerful medium for communicating ideas. And television is so-called “user-friendly”; that is, despite technical complexity, television is easy for subscribers to use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Radio and electronic print services such as stock brokers' so-called “tickers” and “broad tapes” are also powerful, user friendly mass media. (Hereinafter, the electronic print mass medium is called, “broadcast print.”)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">But television, radio, and broadcast print are only mass media. Program content is the same for every viewer. Occasionally one viewer may see, hear, or read information of specific relevance to him (as happens when a guest on a television talk show turns to the camera and says, “Hi, Mom”), but such electronic media have no capacity for conveying user specific information simultaneously to each user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">For years, computers have been recognized as having unsurpassed capacity for processing and displaying user specific information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">But computer processing is not a mass medium. Computers operate under the control of computer programs that are inputted by specific users for specific purposes, not programs that are broadcast to and executed simultaneously at the stations of mass user audiences. And computer processing is far less user friendly than, for example, television.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Today great potential exists for combining the capacity of broadcast communications media to convey ideas with the capacity of computers to process and output user specific information. One such combination would provide a new radio-based or broadcast print medium with the capacity for conveying general information to large audiences—e.g., “Stock prices rose today in heavy trading,”—with information of specific relevance to each particular user in the audience—e.g., “but the value of your stock portfolio went down.” (Hereinafter, the new media that result from such combinations are called “combined” media.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Unlocking this potential is desirable because these new media will add substantial richness and variety to the communication of ideas, information and entertainment. Understanding complex subjects and making informed decisions will become easier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">To unlock this potential fully requires means and methods for combining and controlling receiver systems that are now separate—television and computers, radio and computers, broadcast print and computers, television and computers and broadcast print, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">But it requires much more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">To unlock this potential fully requires a system with efficient capacity for satisfying the demands of subscribers who have little receiver apparatus and simple information demands as well as subscribers who have extensive apparatus and complex demands. It requires capacity for transmitting and organizing vastly more information and programming than any one-channel transmission system can possibly convey at one time. It requires capacity for controlling intermediate transmission stations that receive information and programming from many sources and for organizing the information and programming and retransmitting the information and programming so as to make the use of the information and programming at ultimate receiver stations as efficient as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">To unlock this potential also requires efficient capacity for providing reliable audit information to (1) advertisers and others who pay for the transmission and performance of programming and (2) copyright holders, pay service operators, and others such as talent who demand, instead, to be paid. This requires capacity for identifying and recording (1) what television, radio, data, and other programming and what instruction signals are transmitted at each transmission station and (2) what is received at each receiver station as well as (3) what received programming is combined or otherwise used at each receiver station and (4) how it is received, combined, and/or otherwise used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, this system must have the capacity to ensure that programming supplied for pay or for other conditional use is used only in accordance with those conditions. For example, subscriber station apparatus must display the commercials that are transmitted in transmissions that advertisers pay for. The system must have capacity for decrypting, in many varying ways, programming and instruction signals that are encrypted and for identifying those who pirate programming and inhibiting piracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">It is the object of this invention to unlock this great potential in the fullest measure by means of an integrated system of programming communication that joins together all these capacities most efficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Computer systems generate user specific information, but in any given computer system, any given set of program instructions that causes and controls the generation of user specific information is inputted to only one computer at a time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Computer communications systems do transmit data point-to-multipoint. The Dataspeed Corporation division of Lotus Development Corporation of Cambridge, Mass. transmits real-time financial data over radio frequencies to microcomputers equipped with devices called “modios” that combine the features of radio receivers, modems, and decryptors. The Equatorial Communications Company of Mountain View, Calif. transmits to similarly equipped receiver systems by satellite. At each receiver station, apparatus receive the particular transmission and convert its data content into unencrypted digital signals that computers can process. Each subscriber programs his subscriber station apparatus to select particular data of interest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">This prior art is limited. It only transmits data; it does not control data processing. No system is preprogrammed to simultaneously control a plurality of central processor units, operating systems, and pluralities of computer peripheral units. None has capacity to cause simultaneous generation of user specific information at a plurality of receiver stations. None has any capacity to cause subscriber station computers to process received data, let alone in ways that are not inputted by the subscribers. None has any capacity to explain automatically why any given information might be of particular interest to any subscriber or why any subscriber might wish to select information that is not selected or how any subscriber might wish to change the way selected information is processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">As regards broadcast media, systems in the prior art have capacity for receiving and displaying multiple images on television receivers simultaneously. One such system for superimposing printed characters transmitted incrementally during the vertical blanking interval of the television scanning format is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,891,792 to Kimura. U.S. Pat. No. 4,310,854 to Baer describes a second system for continuously displaying readable alphanumeric captions that are transmitted as digital data superimposed on a normal FM sound signal and that relate in program content to the conventional television information upon which they are displayed. These systems permit a viewer to view a primary program and a secondary program.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">This prior art, too, is limited. It has no capacity to overlay any information other than information transmitted to all receiver stations simultaneously. It has no capacity to overlay any such information except in the order in which it is received. It has no capacity to cause receiver station computers to generate any information whatsoever, let alone user specific information. It has no capacity to cause overlays to commence or cease appearing at receiver stations, let alone commence and cease appearing periodically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">As regards the automation of intermediate transmission stations, various so-called “cueing” systems in the prior art operate in conjunction with network broadcast transmissions to automate the so-called “cut-in” at local television and radio stations of locally originated programming such as so-called “local spot” advertisements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Also in the prior art, U.S. Pat. No. 4,381,522 to Lambert describes a cable television system controlled by a minicomputer that responds to signals transmitted from viewers by telephone. In response to viewers' input preferences, the computer generates a schedule which determines what prerecorded, so-called local origination programs will be transmitted, when, and over what channels. The computer generates a video image of this schedule which it transmits over one cable channel to viewers which permits them to see when they can view the programs they request and over what channels. Then, in accordance with the schedule, it actuates preloaded video tape, disc or film players and transmits the programming transmissions from these players to the designated cable channels by means of a controlled video switch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">This prior art, too, is limited. It has no capacity to schedule automatically or transmit any programming other than that loaded immediately at the play heads of the controlled video players. It has no capacity to load the video players or identify what programming is loaded on the players or verify that scheduled programs are played correctly. It has no capacity to cause the video players to record programming from any source. It has no capacity to receive programming transmissions or process received transmissions in any way. It has no capacity to operate under the control of instructions transmitted by broadcasters. It has no capacity to insert signals that convey information to or control, in any way, the automatic operation of ultimate receiver station apparatus other than television receivers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">As regards the automation of ultimate receiver stations, in the prior art, U.S. Pat. No. 4,337,480 to Bourassin et al. describes a dynamic interconnection system for connecting at least one television receiver to a plurality of television peripheral units. By means of a single remote keyboard, a viewer can automatically connect and disconnect any of the peripheral units without the need manually to switch systems or fasten and unfasten cabling each time. In addition, using a so-called “image-within-image” capacity, the viewer can superimpose a secondary image from a second peripheral unit upon the primary image on the television display. In this fashion, two peripheral units can be viewed simultaneously on one television receiver. U.S. Pat. No. 4,264,925 to Freeman et. al. describes a multi-channel programming transmission system wherein subscribers may select manually among related programming alternatives transmitted simultaneously on separate channels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">This prior art, too, is limited. It has no capacity for interconnecting or operating a system at any time other than the time when the order to do so is entered manually at the system or remote keyboard. It has no capacity for acting on instructions transmitted by broadcasters to interconnect, actuate or tune systems peripheral to a television receiver or to actuate a television receiver or automatically change channels received by a receiver. It has no capacity for coordinating the programming content transmitted by any given peripheral system with any other programming transmitted to a television receiver. It has no capacity for controlling two separate systems such as, for example, an automatic radio and television stereo simulcast. It has no capacity for selectively connecting radio receivers to radio peripherals such as computers or printers or speakers or for connecting computers to computer peripherals (except perhaps a television set). It has no capacity for controlling the operation of decryptors or selectively inputting transmissions to decryptors or outputting transmissions from decryptors to other apparatus. It has no capacity for monitoring and maintaining records regarding what programming is selected or played on any apparatus or what apparatus is connected or how connected apparatus operate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The prior art includes a variety of systems for monitoring programming and generating so-called “ratings.” One system that monitors by means of embedded digital signals is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,025,851 to Haselwood, et al. Another that monitors by means of audio codes that are only “substantially inaudible” is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,845,391 to Crosby. A third that automatically monitors a plurality of channels by switching sequentially among them and that includes capacity to monitor audio and visual quality is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,547,804 to Greenberg.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">This prior art, too, is limited. It has capacity to monitor only single broadcast stations, channels or units and lacks capacity to monitor more than one channel at a time or to monitor the combining of media. At any given monitor station, it has had capacity to monitor either what is transmitted over one or more channels or what is received on one or more receivers but not both. It has assumed monitored signals of particular format in particular transmission locations and has lacked capacity to vary formats or locations or to distinguish and act on the absence of signals or to interpret and process in any fashion signals that appear in monitored locations that are not monitored signals. It has lacked capacity to identify encrypted signals then decrypt them. It has lacked capacity to record and also transfer information to a remote geographic location simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">As regards recorder/player systems, many means and methods exist in the prior art for recording television or audio programming and/or data on magnetic, optical or other recording media and for retransmitting prerecorded programming. Video tape recorders have capacity for automatic delayed recording of television transmissions on the basis of instructions input manually by viewers. So-called “interactive video” systems have capacity for locating prerecorded television programming on a given disc and transmitting it to television receivers and locating prerecorded digital data on the same disc and transmitting them to computers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">This prior art, too, is limited. It has no capacity for automatically embedding signals in and/or removing embedded signals from a television transmission then recording the transmission. It has no capacity for controlling the connection or actuation or tuning of external apparatus. It has no capacity for retransmitting prerecorded programming and controlling the decryption of said programming, let alone doing so on the basis of signals that are embedded in said programming that contain keys for the decryption of said programming. It has no capacity for operating on the basis of control signals transmitted to recorder/players at a plurality of subscriber stations, let alone operating on the basis of such signals to record user specific information at each subscriber station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">As regards decoders and decryptors, many different systems exist, at present, that enable programming suppliers to restrict the use of transmitted programming to only duly authorized subscribers. The prior art includes so-called “addressable” systems that have capacity for controlling specific individual subscriber station apparatus by means of control instructions transmitted in broadcasts. Such systems enable broadcasters to turn off subscriber station decoder/decryptor apparatus of subscribers who do not pay their bills and turn them back on when the bills are paid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">This prior art, too, is limited. It has no capacity for decrypting combined media programming. It has no capacity for identifying then selectively decrypting control instructions embedded in unencrypted programming transmissions. It has no capacity for identifying programming transmissions or control instructions selectively, and transferring them to a decryptor for decryption. It has no capacity for transferring the output of a decryptor selectively to one of a plurality of output apparatus. It has no capacity for automatically identifying decryption keys and inputting them to a decryptor to serve as the key for any step of decryption. It has no capacity for identifying and recording the identity of what is input to or output from a decryptor. It has no capacity for decrypting a transmission then embedding a signal in the transmission—let alone for simultaneously embedding user specific signals at a plurality of subscriber stations. It has no capacity for distinguishing the absence of an expected signal or controlling any operation when such absence occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Further significant limitations arise out of the failure to reconcile aspects of these individual areas of art—monitoring programming, automating ultimate receiver stations, decrypting programming, generating the programming itself, etc.—into an integrated system. These limitations are both technical and commercial.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, the commercial objective of the aforementioned monitoring systems of Crosby, Haselwood et. al., and Greenberg is to provide independent audits to advertisers and others who pay for programming transmissions. All require embedding signals in programming that are used only to identify programming. Greenberg, for example, requires that a digital signal be transmitted at a particular place on a select line of each frame of a television program. But television has only so much capacity for transmitting signals outside the visible image; it is inefficient for such signals to serve only one function; and broadcasters can foresee alternate potential for this capacity that may be more profitable to them. Furthermore, advertisers recognize that if the systems of Crosby, Haselwood and Greenberg distinguish TV advertisements by means of single purpose signals, television receivers and video tape recorders can include capacity for identifying said signals and suppressing the associated advertisements. Accordingly, no independent automatic comprehensive so-called “proof-of-performance” audit service has yet proven commercially viable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">As a second example, because of the lack of a viable independent audit system, each service that broadcasts encrypted programming controls and services at each subscriber station one or more receiver/decryptors dedicated to its service alone. Lacking a viable audit system, services do not transmit to shared, common receiver/decryptors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">These are just two examples of limitations that arise in the absence of an integrated system of programming communication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">It is an object of the present invention to overcome these and other limitations of the prior art.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The present invention consists of an integrated system of methods and apparatus for communicating programming. The term “programming” refers to everything that is transmitted electronically to entertain, instruct or inform, including television, radio, broadcast print, and computer programming as well as combined medium programming. The system includes capacity for automatically organizing multi-channel communications. Like television, radio, broadcast print, and other electronic media, the present invention has capacity for transmitting to standardized programming that is very simple for subscribers to play and understand. Like computer systems, the present invention has capacity for transmitting data and control instructions in the same information stream to many different apparatus at a given subscriber station, for causing computers to generate and transmit programming, and for causing receiver apparatus to operate on the basis of programming and information received at widely separated times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">It is the further purpose of this invention to provide means and methods whereby a simplex point-to-multipoint transmission (such as a television or radio broadcast) can cause simultaneous generation of user specific information at a plurality of subscriber stations. One advantage of the present invention is great ease of use. For example, as will be seen, a subscriber can cause his own information to be processed in highly complex ways by merely turning his television receiver on and tuning to a particular channel. Another advantage of the present invention is its so-called “transparency”—subscribers see none of the complex processing taking place. Another advantage is privacy. No private information is required at transmitting stations, and no subscriber's information is available at any other subscriber's station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">It is the further purpose of this invention to provide means and methods whereby a simplex broadcast transmission can cause periodic combining of relevant user specific information and conventional broadcast programming simultaneously at a plurality of subscriber stations, thereby integrating the broadcast information with each user's own information. One advantage of the present invention is its use of powerful communication media such as television to reveal the meaning of the results of complex processing in ways that appear clear and simple. Another advantage is that receiver stations that lack said capacity for combining user specific information into television or radio programming can continue, without modification, to receive and display the conventional television or radio and without the appearance of any signals or change in the conventional programming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">It is the further purpose of this invention to provide means and methods for the automation of intermediate transmission stations that receive and retransmit programming. The programming may be delivered by any means including over-the-air, hard-wire, and manual means. The stations may transmit programming over-the-air (hereinafter, “broadcast”) or over hard-wire (hereinafter, “cablecast”). They may transmit single channels or multiple channels. The present invention includes capacity for automatically constructing records for each transmitted channel that duplicate the logs that the Federal Communications Commission requires broadcast station operators to maintain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">It is the further purpose of this invention to provide means and methods for the automation of ultimate receiver stations, especially the automation of combined medium and multi-channel presentations. Such ultimate receiver stations may be private homes or offices or commercial establishments such as theaters, hotels, or brokerage offices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">It is the further purpose of this invention to provide means and methods for identifying and recording what television, radio, data, and other programming is transmitted at each transmission station, what programming is received at each receiver station, and how programming is used. In the present invention, certain monitored signals may be encrypted, and certain data collected from such monitoring may be automatically transferred from subscriber stations to one or more remote geographic stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">It is a further purpose of this invention to provide means and methods for recording combined media and/or multi-channel programming and for playing back prerecorded programming of such types.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">It is a further purpose of this invention to provide a variety of means and methods for restricting the use of transmitted communications to only duly authorized subscribers. Such means and methods include techniques for encrypting programming and/or instructions and decrypting them at subscriber stations. They also include techniques whereby the pattern of the composition, timing, and location of embedded signals may vary in such fashions that only receiving apparatus that are preinformed regarding the patterns that obtain at any given time will be able to process the signals correctly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The present invention employs signals embedded in programming. Embedded signals provide several advantages. They cannot become separated inadvertently from the programming and, thereby, inhibit automatic processing. They occur at precise times in programming and can synchronize the operation of receiver station apparatus to the timing of programming transmissions. They can be conveniently monitored.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present invention, the embedded signals contain digital information that may include addresses of specific receiver apparatus controlled by the signals and instructions that identify particular functions the signals cause addressed apparatus to perform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In programming transmissions, given signals may run and repeat, for periods of time, continuously or at regular intervals. Or they may run only occasionally or only once. They may appear in various and varying locations. In television they may appear on one line in the video portion of the transmission such as line <b>20</b> of the vertical interval, or on a portion of one line, or on more than one line, and they will probably lie outside the range of the television picture displayed on a normally tuned television set. In television and radio they may appear in a portion of the audio range that is not normally rendered in a form audible to the human ear. In television audio, they are likely to lie between eight and fifteen kilohertz. In broadcast print and data communications transmissions, the signals may accompany conventional print or data programming in the conventional transmission stream but will include instructions that receiver station apparatus are preprogrammed to process that instruct receiver apparatus to separate the signals from the conventional programming and process them differently. In all cases, signals may convey information in discrete words, transmitted at separate times or in separate locations, that receiver apparatus must assemble in order to receive one complete instruction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">(The term “signal unit” hereinafter means one complete signal instruction or information message unit. Examples of signal units are a unique code identifying a programming unit, or a unique purchase order number identifying the proper use of a programming unit, or a general instruction identifying whether a programming unit is to be retransmitted immediately or recorded for delayed transmission. The term “signal word” hereinafter means one full discrete appearance of a signal as embedded at one time in one location on a transmission. Examples of signal words are a string of one or more digital data bits encoded together on a single line of video or sequentially in audio. Such strings may or may not have predetermined data bits to identify the beginnings and ends of words. Signal words may contain parts of signal units, whole signal units, or groups of partial or whole signal units or combinations.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present invention, particular signal processing apparatus (hereinafter called the “signal processor”) detect signals and, in accordance with instructions in the signals and preprogramming in the signal processor, decrypt and/or record and/or control station apparatus by means of the signals and/or discard the signals. The apparatus include one or more devices that can selectively scan transmission frequencies as directed and, separately, capacity to receive signals from one or more devices that continuously monitor selected frequencies. The frequencies may convey television, radio, or other programming transmissions. The input transmissions may be received, by means of antennas or from hard-wire connections. The scanners/switches, working in parallel or series or combinations, transfer the transmissions to receiver/decoder/detectors that identify signals encoded in programming transmissions and convert the encoded signals to digital information; decryptors that may convert the received information, in part or in whole, to other digital information according to preset methods or patterns; and one or more processor/monitors and/or buffer/comparators that organize and transfer the information stream. The processors and buffers can have inputs from each of the receiver/detector lines and evaluate information continuously. From the processors and buffers, the signals may be transferred to external equipment such as computers, videotape recorders and players, etc. And/or they may be transferred to one or more internal digital recorders that receive and store in memory the recorded information and have connections to one or more remote sites for further transmission of the recorded information. The apparatus has means for external communication and an automatic dialer and can contact remote sites and transfer stored information as required in a predetermined fashion or fashions. The apparatus has a clock for determining and recording time as required. It has a read only memory for recording permanent operating instructions and other information and a programmable random access memory controller (“PRAM controller”) that permits revision of operating patterns and instructions. The PRAM controller may be connected to all internal operating units for full flexibility of operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Signal processing apparatus that are employed in specific situations that require fewer functions than those provided by the signal processor described above may omit one or more of the specific operating elements described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">A central objective of the present invention is to provide flexibility in regard to installed station apparatus. At any given time, the system must have capacity for wide variation in individual station apparatus in order to provide individual subscribers the widest range of information options at the least cost in terms of installed equipment. Flexibility must exist for expanding the capacity of installed systems by means of transmitted software and for altering installed systems in a modular fashion by adding or removing components. Flexibility must exist for varying techniques that restrict programming to duly authorized subscribers in order to identify and deter pirates of programming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Other objects, features, and advantages of this invention will appear in the following descriptions and the appended claims.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">One Combined Medium</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a video/computer combined medium subscriber station. Via conventional antenna, the station receives a conventional television broadcast transmission at television tuner, <b>215</b>. The Model CV510 Electronic TV Tuner of the Zenith Radio Corporation of Chicago, Ill., which is a component of the Zenith Video Hi-Tech Component TV system, is one such tuner. This tuner outputs conventional audio and composite video transmissions. The audio transmission is inputted to TV monitor, <b>202</b>M. The video transmission is inputted to video transmission divider, <b>4</b>, which is a conventional divider that splits the transmission into two paths. One is inputted continuously to TV signal decoder, <b>203</b>, and the other to microcomputer, <b>205</b>. TV signal decoder, <b>203</b>, which is described more fully below, has capacity for receiving a composite video transmission; detecting digital information embedded therein; correcting errors in the received information by means of forward error checking techniques, well known in the art; converting the received information, as may be required, by means of input protocol techniques, well known in the art, into digital signals that microcomputer, <b>205</b>, can receive and process and that can control the operation of microcomputer, <b>205</b>; and transferring said signals to microcomputer, <b>205</b>. Microcomputer, <b>205</b>, is a conventional microcomputer system with disk drives that is adapted to have capacity for receiving signals from decoder, <b>203</b>; for generating computer graphic information; for receiving a composite video transmission; for combining said graphic information onto the video information of said transmission by graphic overlay techniques, well known in the art; and for outputting the resulting combined information to a TV monitor, <b>202</b>M, in a composite video transmission. One such system is the IBM Personal Computer of International Business Machines Corporation of Armonk, N.Y. with an IBM Asynchronous Communications Adapter installed in one expansion slot and a PC-MicroKey Model 1300 System with Techmar Graphics Master Card, as supplied together by Video Associates Labs of Austin, Tex., installed in two other slots. Microcomputer, <b>205</b>, receives digital signals from decoder, <b>203</b>, at its asynchronous communications adapter and the video transmission from divider, <b>4</b>, at its PC-MicroKey 1300 System. It outputs the composite video transmission at its PC-MicroKey System. Microcomputer, <b>205</b>, has all required operating system capacity—eg., the MS/DOS Version 2.0 Disk Operating System of Microsoft, Inc. of Bellvue, Wash. with installed device drivers. TV monitor, <b>202</b>M, has capacity for receiving composite video and audio transmissions and for presenting a conventional television video image and audio sound. One such monitor is the Model CV1950 Color Monitor of the Zenith Radio Corporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In the example, the subscriber station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is in New York City and is tuned to the conventional broadcast television transmission frequency of channel 13 at 8:30 PM on a Friday evening when the broadcast station of said frequency, WNET, commences transmitting a television program about stock market investing, “Wall Street Week.” Said WNET station is an intermediate transmission station for said program which actually originates at a remote television studio in Owings Mills, Md. (Hereinafter, a studio or station that originates the broadcast transmission of programming is called the “program originating studio.”) From said program originating studio said program is transmitted by conventional television network feed transmission means, well known in the art, to a large number of geographically dispersed intermediate transmission stations that retransmit said program to millions of subscriber stations where subscribers view said program. Said network transmission means may include so-called landlines, microwave transmissions, a satellite transponder, or other means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">At said subscriber station, microprocessor, <b>205</b>, contains a conventional 5¼″ floppy disk at a designated one of its disk drives that holds a data file recorded in a fashion well known in the art. Said file contains information on the portfolio of financial instruments owned by the subscriber that identifies the particular stocks in the portfolio, the number of shares of each stock owned at the close of business of each business day from the end of the previous week, and the closing share prices applicable each day. Decoder, <b>203</b>, is preprogrammed to detect digital information on a particular line or lines (such as line <b>20</b>) of the vertical interval of its video transmission input; to correct errors in said information; to convert said corrected information into digital signals usable by microcomputer, <b>205</b>; and to input said signals to microcomputer, <b>205</b>, at its asynchronous communications adapter. Microcomputer, <b>205</b>, is preprogrammed to receive said input of signals at its asynchronous communications adapter and to respond in a predetermined fashion to instruction signals embedded in the “Wall Street Week” programming transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Other similarly configured and preprogrammed subscriber stations also tune to the transmission of said “Wall Street Week” program by given intermediate transmission stations. At each subscriber station, the records in the contained financial portfolio file hold, in identical format, information on the particular investments of that station's subscriber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">At the start of the transmission of said “Wall Street Week” program, all subscriber station apparatus is on and fully operational.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">At said program originating studio, at the outset of said program transmission, a first series of control instructions is generated, embedded sequentially on said line or lines of the vertical interval, and transmitted on the first and each successive frame of said television program transmission, signal unit by signal unit and word by word, until said series has been transmitted in full. The instructions of said series are addressed to and control the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of each subscriber station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In said series in full—and in any one or more subsequent series of instructions—particular instructions are separated, as may be required, by time periods when no instruction that controls the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of any station is transmitted which periods allow sufficient time for the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of each and every subscriber station to complete functions controlled by previously transmitted instructions and commence waiting for a subsequent instruction, in a waiting fashion well known in the art, before receiving a subsequent instruction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Tuner, <b>215</b>, receives this television transmission, converts the received television information into audio and composite video transmissions, and transmits the audio to monitor, <b>202</b>M, and the video via divider, <b>4</b>, to microcomputer, <b>205</b>, and decoder, <b>203</b>. Decoder, <b>203</b>, detects the embedded instruction information, corrects it as required, converts it into digital signals usable by microcomputer, <b>205</b>, and transmits said signals to microcomputer, <b>205</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">With each step occurring in a predetermined fashion or fashions, well known in the art, this first set of instructions commands microcomputer, <b>205</b>, (and all other subscriber station microcomputers simultaneously) to interrupt the operation of its central processor unit (hereinafter, “CPU”) and any designated other processors; then to record the contents of the registers of its CPU and any other designated processors either at a designated place in random access memory (hereinafter, “RAM”) or on the contained disk; then to set its PC-MicroKey 1300 to the “GRAPHICS OFF” operating mode in which mode it transmits all received composite video information to monitor, <b>202</b>M, without modification; then to record all information in RAM with all register information in an appropriately named file such as “INTERUPT.BAK” at a designated place on the contained disk; then to clear all RAM (except for that portion of RAM containing the so-called “operating system” of said microcomputer, <b>205</b>) and all registers of said CPU and any other designated processors; then to wait for further instructions from decoder, <b>203</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Operating in said preprogrammed fashion under control of said first set of instructions, microcomputer, <b>205</b>, reaches a stage at which the subscriber can input information only under control of signals embedded in the broadcast transmission and can reassume control of microcomputer, <b>205</b>, (so long as microcomputer, <b>205</b>, remains on and continues, in a predetermined fashion, to receive said embedded transmitted signals) only by executing a system reset (or so-called “warm boot”) which on an IBM PC is accomplished by depressing simultaneously the “Ctrl”, “Alt” and “Del” keys on the console keyboard.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">(Hereinafter, this first set of instructions is called the “control invoking instructions,” and the associated steps are called “invoking broadcast control.”)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">After completing all steps of invoking broadcast control, the microcomputer at each subscriber station (including microcomputer, <b>205</b>) is preprogrammed (1) to evaluate particular initial instructions in each distinct series of received input instructions to ascertain how to process the information of said series and (2) to operate in a predetermined fashion or fashions in response to said initial instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">Subsequently, a second series of instructions is embedded and transmitted at said program originating studio. Said second series is detected and converted into usable digital signals by decoder, <b>203</b>, and inputted to microcomputer, <b>205</b>, in the same fashion as the first series. Microcomputer, <b>205</b>, evaluates the initial signal word or words which instruct it to load at RAM (from the input buffer to which decoder, <b>203</b>, inputs) and run the information of a particular set of instructions that follows said word or words just as the information of a file named FILE.EXE, recorded on the contained floppy disk, would be loaded at RAM (from the input buffer to which the disk drive of said disk inputs) and run were the command “FILE” entered from the console keyboard to the system level of the installed disk operating system. (Hereinafter, such a set of instructions that is loaded and run is called a “program instruction set.”) In a fashion well known in the art, microcomputer, <b>205</b>, loads the received binary information of said set at a designated place in RAM until, in a predetermined fashion, it detects the end of said set, and it executes said set as an assembled, machine language program in a fashion well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Under control of said program instruction set and accessing the subscriber's contained portfolio data file for information in a fashion well known in the art, microcomputer, <b>205</b>, calculates the performance of the subscriber's stock portfolio and constructs a graphic image of that performance at the installed graphics card. The instructions cause the computer, first, to determine the aggregate value of the portfolio at each day's close of business by accumulating, for each day, the sum of the products of the number of shares of each stock held times that stock's closing price. The instructions then cause microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to calculate the percentage change in the portfolio's aggregate value for each business day of the week in respect to the final business day of the prior week. Then in a fashion well known in the art, the instructions cause microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to enter digital bit information at the video RAM of the graphics card in a particular pattern that depicts the said percentage change as it would be graphed on a particular graph with a particular origin and set of scaled graph axes. Upon completion of these steps, the instructions cause microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to commence waiting for a subsequent instruction from decoder, <b>203</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">If the information at video RAM at the end of these steps were to be transmitted alone to the video screen of a TV monitor, it would appear as a line of a designated color, such as red, on a background color that is transparent when overlaid on a separate video image. Black is such a background color, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows one such line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">As each subscriber station completes the steps of calculation and graphic imaging performed under control of said program instruction set, information of such a line exists at video RAM at said station which information reflects the specific portfolio performance of the user of said station. Said information results from much computation, but the meaning of said information is hardly clear. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows just a line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">While microcomputer, <b>205</b>, performs these steps, TV monitor, <b>202</b>M, displays the conventional television image and the sound of the transmitted “Wall Street Week” program. During this time the program may show the so-called “talking head” of the host as he describes the behavior of the stock market over the course of the week. Then the host says, “Now as we turn to the graphs, here is what the Dow Jones Industrials did in the week just past,” and a studio generated graphic is transmitted. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the image of said graphic as it appears on the video screen of TV monitor, <b>202</b>M. Then the host says, “And here is what your portfolio did.” At this point, an instruction signal is generated at said program originating studio, embedded in the programming transmission, and transmitted. Said signal is identified by decoder, <b>203</b>; transferred to microcomputer, <b>205</b>; and executed by microcomputer, <b>205</b>, at the system level as the statement, “GRAPHICS ON”. Said signal instructs microcomputer, <b>205</b>, at the PC-MicroKey 1300 to overlay the graphic information in its graphics card onto the received composite video information and transmit the combined information to TV monitor, <b>202</b>M. TV monitor, <b>202</b>M, then displays the image shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> which is the microcomputer generated graphic of the subscriber's own portfolio performance overlaid on the studio generated graphic. And microcomputer, <b>205</b>, commences waiting for another instruction from decoder, <b>203</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">By itself, the meaning of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is hardly clear. But when <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is combined and displayed at the proper time with the conventional television information, its meaning becomes readily apparent. Simultaneously, each subscriber in a large audience of subscribers sees his own specific performance information as it relates to the performance information of the market as a whole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">(Hereinafter, an instruction such as the above signal of “GRAPHICS ON” that causes subscriber station apparatus to execute a combining operation in synchronization is called a “combining synch command.” Said initial signal word or words that preceded the above program instruction set provide another example of a combining synch command in that said word or words synchronized all subscriber station computers in commencing loading and running information for a particular combining.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">While the TV monitor at this particular subscriber station displays this particular subscriber's own overlay information, each other subscriber station displays the specific overlay information applicable at that station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">As the program proceeds, in the same fashion a further instruction signal is generated at said studio; transmitted; detected; inputted from decoder, <b>203</b>, to microcomputer, <b>205</b>; and executed as “GRAPHICS OFF.” Then said studio ceases transmitting the graphic image, and transmits another image such as the host's talking head. Simultaneously, the GRAPHICS OFF command causes microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to cease overlaying the graphic information onto the received composite video and to commence transmitting the received composite video transmission unmodified. Thereafter the “Wall Street Week” program proceeds, and microcomputer, <b>205</b>, continues to operate under control of received instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">This combined medium example is of a television based medium. Like conventional television, said combined medium transmits the same signals to all subscriber stations. But unlike conventional television where each subscriber views only programming viewed by every other subscriber and where said programming is known to and available at the program originating studio, each subscriber of said combined medium views programming that is personalized and private. The programming he views is his own—in the example, his own portfolio performance—and his programming is not viewed by any other subscriber nor is it available at the program originating studio. In addition, personalized programming is displayed only when it is of specific relevance to the conventional television programming of said combined medium. In the example, each subscriber views a graphic presentation of his own portfolio performance information as soon as it becomes specifically relevant to graphic information of the performance of the market as a whole. Prior to its time of specific relevance, no personalized information is displayed (despite the fact that said graphic information of the performance of the market as a whole is displayed). And said personalized information is displayed only for so long as it remains specifically relevant. As soon as its specific relevance terminates, its display terminates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">This “Wall Street Week” portfolio performance example provides but one of many examples of television based combined medium programming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">This television based combined medium is but one example of many combined media.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">The Signal Processor</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">In the present invention, the signal processor—<b>26</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>; <b>26</b> in the signal processor system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>; in the signal processor system, <b>71</b>, of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>; <b>200</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>; and elsewhere—is focal means for the controlling and monitoring subscriber station operations. It meters communications and enables owners of information to offer their information to subscribers in many fashions on condition of payment. It has capacity for regulating communications consumption by selectively decrypting or not decrypting encrypted programming and/or control signals and capacity for assembling and retaining meter records at each subscriber station that document the consumption of specific programming and information at said station. It has capacity for identifying the subject matter of each specific unit of programming available on each of many transmission channels at each subscriber station as said unit becomes available for use and/or viewing which enables subscriber station apparatus to determine automatically whether the subject matter of said unit is of interest and, if so, to tune automatically to said programming. It has capacity, at each station, for receiving monitor information that identifies what programming is available, what programming is used, and how said programming is used and capacity for assembling and retaining monitor records that document said availability and usage. It has capacity for transferring said meter records automatically to one or more remote automated billing stations that account for programming and information consumption and bill subscribers and said monitor records automatically to one or more remote so-called “ratings” stations that collect statistical data on programming availability and usage. It has capacities for processing information in many other fashions that will become apparent in this full specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one embodiment of a signal processor. Said processor, <b>26</b>, is configured for simultaneous use with a cablecast input that conveys both television and radio programming and a broadcast television input.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">At switch, <b>1</b>, and mixers, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, signal processor, <b>26</b>, monitors all frequencies or channels available for reception at the subscriber station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to identify available programming. The inputted information is the entire range of frequencies or channels transmitted on the cable and the entire range of broadcast television transmissions available to a local television antenna of conventional design. The cable transmission is inputted simultaneously to switch, <b>1</b>, and mixer, <b>2</b>. The broadcast transmission is inputted to switch, <b>1</b>. Switch, <b>1</b>, and mixers, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, are all controlled by local oscillator and switch control, <b>6</b>. The oscillator, <b>6</b>, is controlled to provide a number of discrete specified frequencies for the particular radio and television channels required. The switch, <b>1</b>, acts to select the broadcast input or the cablecast input and passes transmissions to mixer, <b>3</b>, which, with the controlled oscillator, <b>6</b>, acts to select a television frequency of interest that is passed at a fixed frequency to a TV signal decoder, <b>30</b>. Simultaneously, mixer, <b>2</b>, and the controlled oscillator, <b>6</b>, act to select a radio frequency of interest which is inputted to a radio signal decoder, <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">At decoders, <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>, signal processor, <b>26</b>, identifies specific programming and its subject matter as said programming becomes available for use and/or viewing. Decoder, <b>30</b>, which is shown in detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and decoder, <b>40</b>, which is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, detect signal information embedded in the respective inputted television and radio frequencies, render said information into digital signals that subscriber station apparatus can process, modify particular ones of said signals through the addition and/or deletion of particular information, and output said signals and said modified signals to buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>. Said decoders are considered more fully below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">Buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, receives said signals from said decoders and other signals from other inputs and organizes the received information in a predetermined fashion. Buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, has capacity for comparing a particular portions or portions of inputted information to particular preprogrammed information and for operating in preprogrammed fashions on the basis of the results of said comparing. It has capacity for detecting particular end of file signals in inputted information and for operating in preprogrammed fashions whenever said information is detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">The process of communication metering commences at buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>. In a predetermined fashion, buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, determines whether a given instance of received signal information requires decryption, either in whole or in part. In a fashion described more fully below, buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, and a controller, <b>20</b>, which, too, is described more fully below, determine whether signal processor, <b>26</b>, is enabled to decrypt said information. If signal processor, <b>26</b>, is so enabled, buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, transfers said information to decryptor, <b>10</b>. If signal processor, <b>26</b>, is not so enabled, buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, discards said information in a predetermined fashion.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">Introduction to the Signals of the Integrated System</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">The signals of the present invention are the modalities whereby stations that originate programming transmissions control the handling, generating, and displaying of programming at subscriber stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">(The term, “SPAM,” is used, hereinafter, to refer to signal processing apparatus and methods of the present invention.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">SPAM signals control and coordinate a wide variety of subscriber stations. Said stations include so-called “local affiliate” broadcast stations that receive and retransmit single network transmissions; so-called “cable system headends” that receive and retransmit multiple network and local broadcast station transmissions; and so-called “media centers” in homes, offices, theaters, etc. where subscribers view programming. (Hereinafter, stations that originate broadcast transmissions are called “original transmission stations,” stations that receive and retransmit broadcast transmissions are called “intermediate transmission stations”, and stations where subscribers view programming are called “ultimate receiver stations.”)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">At said stations, SPAM signals address, control, and coordinate diverse apparatus, and the nature and extent of the apparatus installed at any given station can vary greatly. SPAM signals control not only various kinds of receivers and tuners; transmission switches and channel selectors; computers; printers and video and audio display apparatus; and video, audio, and digital communications transmission recorders but also signal processor system apparatus including decoders; decryptors; control signal switching apparatus; and the communications meters, called signal processors, of the present invention. Besides apparatus for communicating programming to viewers, SPAM signals also address and control subscriber station control apparatus such as, for example, furnace control units whose operations are automatic and are improved with improved information and subscriber station meter apparatus such as, for example, utilities meters that collect and transmit meter information to remote metering stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">The information of SPAM signals includes data, computer program instructions, and commands. Data and program instructions are often recorded in computer memories at subscriber stations for deferred execution. Commands are generally for immediate execution and often execute computer programs or control steps in programs already in process. Often said data, programs, and commands control subscriber station apparatus that automatically handle, decrypt, transmit, and/or present program units of conventional television, radio, and other media.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In combined medium communications, SPAM signals also control subscriber station apparatus in the generating and combining of combined medium programming. At ultimate receiver stations, particular combined medium commands and computer programs cause computers to generate user specific programming and display said programming at television sets, speaker systems, printers, and other apparatus. (Hereinafter, instances of computer program information that cause ultimate receiver station apparatus to generate and display user specific information are called “program instruction sets.”) At intermediate transmission stations, other commands and computer programs cause computers to generate and transmit program instruction sets. (Hereinafter, instances of computer program information that cause intermediate transmission station apparatus to generate program instruction set information and/or command information are called “intermediate generation sets.”)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">In combined medium communications, particular SPAM commands control the execution of intermediate generation sets and program instruction sets and the transmission and display of information generated by said sets. Whether said commands control apparatus at intermediate transmission stations, ultimate receiver stations, or both, the function of said commands is to control and synchronize disparate apparatus efficiently in the display of combined medium programming at ultimate receiver stations. (Accordingly, all said commands are called “combining synch commands” in this specification.) Most often, combining synch commands synchronize steps of simultaneous generating of station specific information at pluralities of stations and/or steps of simultaneous combining at pluralities of stations (which steps of combining are, more specifically, steps of simultaneous transmitting at each station of said pluralities of separate information into combined transmissions), all of which steps are timed to control simultaneous display of user specific combined medium information at each station of pluralities of ultimate receiver stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">The present invention provides a unified signal system for addressing, controlling, and coordinating all said stations and apparatus. One objective of said system is to control diverse apparatus in the speediest and most efficient fashions. A second objective is to communicate control information in forms that have great flexibility as regards information content capacity. A third objective is to communicate information in compact forms, thereby maximizing the capacity of any given transmission means to communicate signal information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Yet another objective is expandability. As the operating capacities of computer hardware have grown in recent decades, increasingly sophisticated software systems have been developed to operate computers. Often incompatibilities have existed between newly developed operating system software and older generations of computer hardware. It is the objective of the system of signal composition of the present invention to have capacity for expanding to accommodate newly developed subscriber station hardware while still serving older hardware generations. In practice this means that the unified system of signals does not consist, at any one time, of one fixed and immutable version of signal composition. Rather it is a family of compatible versions. At any given time, some versions communicate signal information to only the newest or most sophisticated subscriber station apparatus while at least one version communicates to all apparatus. Accordingly, this specification speaks of “simple preferred embodiments” and “the simplest preferred embodiment” rather than just one preferred embodiment. How the various versions and embodiments relate to and are compatible with one another is made clear below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">The Composition of Signal Information . . . Commands, Information Segments, and Padding Bits</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">SPAM signals contain binary information of the sort well know in the art including bit information required for error correction using forward error correction techniques, well known in the art, in point to multi-point communications; request retransmission techniques, well known in the art, in point to point communications; and/or other error correction techniques, as appropriate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> shows one example of the composition of signal information (excluding bit information required for error detection and correction). The information in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> commences with a header which is particular binary information that synchronizes all subscriber station apparatus in the analysis of the information pattern that follows. Following said header are three segments: an execution segment, a meter-monitor segment, and an information segment. As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> shows, the header and execution and meter-monitor segments constitute a command.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">A command is an instance of signal information that is addressed to particular subscriber station apparatus and that causes said apparatus to perform a particular function or functions. A command is always constituted of at least a header and an execution segment. With respect to any given command, its execution segment contains information that specifies the apparatus that said command addresses and specifies a particular function or functions that said command causes said apparatus to perform. (Hereinafter, functions that execution segment information causes subscriber station apparatus to perform are called “controlled functions.”)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Commands often contain meter-monitor segments. Said segments contain meter information and/or monitor information, and the information of said segments causes subscriber station signal processor systems to assemble, record, and transmit meter records to remote billing stations and monitor records to remote ratings stations in fashions that are described more fully below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">Particular commands (called, hereinafter, “specified condition commands”) always contain meter-monitor segments. Said commands cause addressed apparatus to perform controlled functions only when specified conditions exist, and meter-monitor information of said commands specifies the conditions that must exist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">In simple preferred embodiments, at any given time the number of binary information bits in any given instance of header information is a particular constant number. In other words, every header contains the same number of bits. In the simplest preferred embodiment, said constant number is two, all headers consist of two bits binary information, and commands are identified by one of three binary headers:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0147">10—a command with an execution segment alone;</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0148">00—a command with execution and meter-monitor segments; and</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0149">01—a command with execution and meter-monitor segments that is followed by an information segment.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0150">Execution segment information includes the subscriber station apparatus that the command of said segment addresses and the controlled functions said apparatus is to perform. (“ITS” refers, hereinafter, to intermediate transmission station apparatus, and “URS” refers to ultimate receiver station apparatus.) Examples of addressed apparatus include:

Examples of controlled functions include:

<br/>
Commands can address many apparatus and execute many controlled functions. The apparatus and functions listed here are only examples. Other addressable apparatus and controlled functions will become apparent in this full specification.
</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0164">Execution segment information operates by invoking preprogrammed operating instructions that exist at each subscriber station apparatus that is addressed. For example, a command to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, to load and run the contents of the information segment following said command causes each URS microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to commence processing particular instructions for loading and running that are preprogrammed at each URS microcomputer, <b>205</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0165">For each appropriate addressed apparatus and controlled function combination a unique execution segment binary information value is assigned. Said command to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, to load and run is, for example, one appropriate combination and is assigned one particular binary value that differs from all other execution segment information values. In the assignment process, no values are assigned to inappropriate combinations. For example, URS signal processors, <b>200</b>, have no capacity to overlay, and no execution segment information value exists to cause URS signal processors, <b>200</b>, to overlay.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0166">For any given command, the execution segment information of said command invokes, at each relevant subscriber station apparatus, the preprogrammed operating instructions uniquely associated with its particular binary value in particular comparing and matching fashions that are described more fully below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0167">The determination of appropriate addressed apparatus and controlled function combinations takes into account the facts that different apparatus, at any given subscriber station, can be preprogrammed to interpret any given instance of execution segment information differently and that subscriber station apparatus can be preprogrammed to automatically alter execution segment information. For example, if signal processors, <b>200</b>, are preprogrammed to process commands received at controller, <b>12</b>, differently from commands received at buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, the assignment system can reduce the number of required binary values. As a more specific example, buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, receives a hypothetical command with a particular execution segment (e.g., “101110”) which means “URS signal processors, <b>200</b>, decrypt the execution and meter-monitor segments using decryption key J.” After being decrypted and transferred to controller, <b>12</b>, the particular execution segment information that controller, <b>12</b>, receives (e.g., “011011”) means “URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, commence overlay designated in meter-monitor segment.” The controlled functions that signal processor, <b>200</b>, performs are the same as those listed above in the example that begins, “Modify the . . . ,” and no separate binary value is necessary for invoking these controlled functions at URS microcomputers, <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0168">The preferred embodiment includes one appropriate command (hereinafter called the “pseudo command”) that is addressed to no apparatus and one command that is addressed to URS signal processors, <b>200</b>, (hereinafter, the “meter command”) but does not instruct said processors, <b>200</b>, to perform any controlled function. These commands are always transmitted with meter-monitor segment data that receiver station apparatus automatically process and record. By transmitting pseudo command and meter command signals, transmission stations cause receiver station apparatus to record meter-monitor segment information without executing controlled functions. The pseudo command enables a so-called ratings service to use the same system for gathering ratings on conventional programming transmissions that it uses for combined media without causing combined media apparatus to execute controlled functions at inappropriate times (eg., combine overlays onto displays of conventional television programming). The meter command causes apparatus such as controller, <b>12</b>, of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> to transmit meter information to buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>, without performing any controlled function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0169">In the preferred embodiment, at any given time the number of binary information bits in any given instance of execution segment information is a particular constant number. In other words, every execution segment contains the same number of bits. Said constant number is the smallest number of bits capable of representing the binary value of the total number of appropriate addressed apparatus and controlled function combinations. And each appropriate combination is assigned a unique binary value within the range of binary numbers thus defined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0170">Meter-monitor segments contain meter information and/or monitor information. Examples of categories of such information include:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0171">meter instructions that instruct subscriber station meter apparatus to record particular meter-monitor segment information and maintain meter records of said information;</li> <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0172">origins of transmissions (eg., network source stations, broadcast stations, cable head end stations);</li> <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0173">dates and times;</li> <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0174">unique identifier codes for each program unit (including commercials);</li> <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0175">codes that identify uniquely each combining in a given combined medium program unit;</li> <li id="ul0006-0006" num="0176">codes that identify the subject matter of a program unit;</li> <li id="ul0006-0007" num="0177">unique codes for programming (other than programming identified by program unit codes) whose use obligates users to make payments (eg., royalties and residuals); and</li> <li id="ul0006-0008" num="0178">unique codes that identify the sources and suppliers of computer data.
<br/>
The categories listed here provide only examples. Other types of information can exist in meter information and/or in monitor information, as will become apparent in this full specification.
</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0179">For each category of information, a series of binary bits (hereinafter, a “field” or “meter-monitor field”) exists in the meter-monitor segment to contain the information. In any given category such as origins of transmissions, each distinct item such as each network source, broadcast, or cable head end station has a unique binary information code. In the preferred embodiment, the number of information bits in that category's meter-monitor field is the smallest number of bits capable of representing the binary value of the total number of distinct items. And the information code of each distinct item is within the range of binary numbers thus defined. In the preferred embodiment, date and time fields have sixteen bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0180">Few commands require meter-monitor information of every information category. Often commands require no more than the identification codes of a specific combined medium program unit and of a specific combined medium combining within said program unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0181">Because the amount of information in meter-monitor segments varies from command to command, in the preferred embodiment more than one format exists at any given time for meter-monitor segment information. For example, one meter-monitor segment may contain origin of transmission, transmission date and time, and program unit information. A second may contain program unit and combining identification information. The first is transmitted in a format of three specific fields. The second is transmitted in a different format. It is even possible for different formats to exist for the same meter-monitor field. For example, one instance of date and time information designates a particular day in a particular one hundred year period. Another designates a particular hour in a particular ninety day period.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0182">Because the number of categories of meter-monitor information varies from one command to the next, the length of meter-monitor segments varies. Unlike execution segments which, at any given time, all contain the same number of information bits, the bit length of meter-monitor segments varies. One segment may contain five fields, totaling 275 bits in length. Another may contain two fields and 63 bits. A third may contain three fields and 63 bits. Bit length is not necessarily tied to the number of fields. And at any given time, a number of different meter-monitor segment bit length alternatives exists.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0183">In the preferred embodiment, each instance of a meter-monitor segment includes a format field that contains information that specifies the particular format of the meter-monitor segment of said instance. Within said field is a particular group of binary information bits (hereinafter, the “length token”) that identifies the number of bits in a meter-monitor segment of said format. Each alternate length token has a unique binary information code. The number of information bits in each instance of a length token is the smallest number of bits capable of representing the binary value of the total number of meter-monitor segment bit length alternatives. And the unique code of each different alternative is within the range of binary numbers thus defined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0184">In the preferred embodiment, each distinct meter-monitor segment format (including each distinct field format) also has a unique binary information code. In cases where a given format is the only format that contains a given length token, the unique code of said token is sufficient to identify said format uniquely. For example, if a particular format is the only format that is 197 binary bits long, information that said format is 197 bits long is sufficient information to identify said format uniquely. But two or more formats that contain the same length token information require additional binary information to distinguish them uniquely. Thus the number of information bits in any given instance of a format field is the total of the number of bits in the length token plus the smallest number of bits capable of representing the number of formats that share in common the one particular length token datum that occurs most frequently in different formats. And the format code of each distinct format is within the range of binary numbers thus defined except that only length token information exists in the bits of the length token.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0185"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref> illustrates one instance of a meter-monitor segment (excluding bit information required for error detection and correction). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref> shows three fields totaling thirty sequential bits. The format field is transmitted first followed by two fields of nine and sixteen bits respectively, and the bits of the length token are the first bits of said format field. The SPAM system that uses said format field has capacity for no more than eight alternate meter-monitor segment lengths and thirty-two formats. A three bit length token can specify no more than eight length alternatives, and a five bit format field can specify no more than thirty-two. Said SPAM system has no fewer than five alternate lengths because four or fewer length alternatives would be represented in a length token of two or fewer bits. In said system, three or four formats share in common the particular length token that occurs most frequently in different formats. Two formats sharing the most commonly shared length token datum would be specified in one bit; five or more sharing said datum would be represented in three or more bits. Accordingly, the format field of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref> must represent at least eight alternate formats.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0186">In the preferred embodiment, the bits of the length token are the first bits in each meter-monitor segment. In any given command containing meter-monitor information, said bits follow immediately after the last bit of the execution segment. The remaining bits of the format field are included in each meter-monitor segment in particular locations that lie within the format of the shortest meter-monitor segment (excluding bit information required for error detection and correction). Thus if the shortest meter-monitor segment (including the format field of said segment) is thirty two bits, the bits of the format field in every instance of a meter-monitor segment lie among the first thirty two bits of said segment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0187">Information segments follow commands and can be of any length. Program instruction sets, intermediate generation sets, other computer program information, and data (all of which are organized in a fashion or fashions well known in the art) are transmitted in information segments. An information segment can transmit any information that a processor can process. It can transmit compiled machine language code or assembly language code or higher level language programs, all of which are well known in the art. Commands can execute such program information and cause compiling prior to execution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0188">A command with a “01” header is followed by an information segment. But a command with an “01” header is not the only instance of signal information that contains an information segment. In the simplest preferred embodiment, a fourth type of header is:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0189">11—an additional information segment transmission following a “01” header command and one or more information segments which additional segment is addressed to the same apparatus and invokes the same controlled functions as said “01” command.
<br/>
An instance of signal information with a “11” header contains no execution segment or meter-monitor segment information. Said instance is processed, in fashions described more fully below, by subscriber station apparatus that receive said instance as if said instance contained the execution segment information of the last “01” header command received at said apparatus prior to the receipt of said instance.
</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0190">In determining the composition of signal information in the preferred embodiment, the present invention must take into account the fact that most computer systems communicate information in signal words that are of a constant binary length that exceeds one bit. At present, most computer information is communicated in so-called “bytes,” each of which consists of eight digital bits. Failure to recognize this fact could result in incomplete signals and/or in erroneous processing in signal information. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> shows a command with a header, an execution segment, and a meter-monitor segment, each of which is of particular bit length. However, the command of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> is only twenty-one bits long. As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> shows, said command constitutes two bytes of eight bits each with five bits are left over. In a system that communicates information only in words that are multiples of eight, a signal whose information is represented in twenty-one information bits is incomplete. To constitute a complete communication, said signal must be transmitted in twenty-four bits. To the command of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, three bits must be added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0191">In the preferred embodiment, at the original transmission station of any given signal transmission, particular bits are added at the end of any command that is not already a multiple of the particular signal word bit length that applies in signal processor system communications at the subscriber stations to which said transmission is transmitted. (Hereinafter, said bits are called “padding bits.”) Padding bits communicate no command information nor are padding bits part of any information segment. The sole purpose of padding bits is to render the information of any given SPAM command into a bit length that is, by itself, complete for signal processor system communication. Padding bits are added to command information prior to the transmission of said information at said station, and all subscriber station apparatus are preprogrammed to process padding bits. The particular number of padding bits that are added to any given command is the smallest number of bits required to render the bit length of said command into a multiple of said signal word bit length. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref> shows three padding bits added at the end of the twenty-one command information bits of the command of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>. to render the information of said command into a form that can be communicated in three eight-bit bytes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0192">In the preferred embodiment, the information of each information segment is composed and transmitted in a bit length that is, itself, exactly a multiple of the particular signal word bit length that applies in computer communications at said subscriber stations. The information of each information segment commences at the first information bit location of the first signal word of said segment and ends at the last information bit location of the last signal word. Each information segments follow a command or “11” header. More precisely, the first signal word of each information segment is the first complete signal word that follows the last information bit of said command or “11” header or the last padding bit following said command or “11” header if one or more padding bits follow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0193">As one example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> shows the information of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> organized in eight-bit bytes. While the information of the execution segment in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> follows immediately after the header and the information of the meter-monitor segment follows immediately after the execution segment, the information of the information segment does not follow immediately after the meter-monitor segment. Rather three padding bits are inserted following the command information of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> to complete the signal word in which the last bit of command information occurs, and the information of the information segment begins at the first bit of the first complete byte following said meter-monitor segment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0194">The method of the preferred embodiment for composing the information of SPAM signals has significant advantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0195">In signal processing, speed of execution is often of critical importance, and the preferred embodiment has significant speed advantages. Most commands require the fastest possible processing. By minimizing the bit length of headers, execution segments, and meter-monitor segments, the preferred embodiment provides compact information and control messages that are transmitted, detected, and executed, in general, in the fastest possible fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0196">In signal processing, flexibility of message structure is also of critical importance. The single, unified system of the present invention must have capacity for communicating to many different apparatus messages that vary greatly in complexity, length, and priority for speed of processing. By providing first priority segment capacity—in the simplest preferred embodiment, execution segments—that is short, rigid in format, and can communicate information to many different addressed apparatus, the preferred embodiment provides capacity to communicate a select number of high priority control messages to many alternate apparatus in the fastest possible time. By providing intermediate priority segment capacity—in the simplest preferred embodiment, meter-monitor segments—that is flexible in length, format, and information content, the preferred embodiment provides more flexible capacity to communicate control messages of slightly lower priority. By providing lowest priority segment capacity—in the simplest preferred embodiment, information segments—that can contain any binary information and be any length, the preferred embodiment provides complete flexibility to communicate any message that can be represented in digital information to any apparatus at the lowest processing priority. By transmitting message components in their order of priority—in the simplest preferred embodiment, headers and execution segments then meter-monitor segments then information segments—the preferred embodiment enables priority message instructions to affect subscriber station operations in the fastest possible fashion. By providing capacity for alternating the structure of individual messages—here alternate header capacity—so that individual control messages can be constituted only of the highest priority information or high and intermediate priority information or can be focused on the lowest priority, the preferred embodiment provides additional valuable flexibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0197">Speed and flexibility are essential considerations not only in the composition of individual messages but also in the composition of message streams. In this regard, the use of “11” headers in the preferred embodiment brings valuable benefits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0198">Often in the course of a combined medium presentation, a series of control messages is transmitted each of which contains an information segment, addresses the same apparatus (for example, URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>), and causes said apparatus to invoke the same controlled function or functions (for example, “load and run the contents of the information segment”). Often, interspersed in said series, are other control messages that address said apparatus, contain no information segments, and cause said apparatus to invoke other controlled functions (for example, “commence the video overlay combining designated in the meter-monitor segment”). By including capacity whereby, without containing execution or meter-monitor information, a given message can cause information segment information to be processed at subscriber station apparatus just as preceding information segment information was processed, the present invention increases processing efficiency. Because no execution or meter-monitor segment is transmitted, more information segment information can be transmitted in a given period of time. Because no execution or meter-monitor segment is received and processed at subscriber stations, information segment information can be received and processed faster.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0199">In signal processing, efficiency in the control of subscriber station apparatus is yet another factor of critical importance. By composing lowest priority segment information—in the simplest preferred embodiment, information of information segments—to commence at a bit location that subscriber station apparatus are preprogrammed to define as the first location of a signal word of the form that control said apparatus in processing and to continue to a bit location that is the last location of a signal word of said form, the present invention communicates said information to said apparatus in a form that can commence the control functions communicated in said information immediately. Were information segment information communicated in any form other than that of the preferred embodiment—more specifically, were said information to be in a length other than a whole number of signal words or to commence immediately after the command or header preceding said segment rather than at the first bit of a signal word—subscriber station apparatus would need to process said information into information of a form that could control said apparatus before the information of said segment could commence the particular control functions communicated in said information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">The Organization of Message Streams . . . Messages, Cadence Information, and End of File Signals</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0200">All of the information transmitted with a given header is called a “message.” Each header begins a message, and each message begins with a header. More specifically, a message consists of all the SPAM information, transmitted in a given transmission, from the first bit of one header to the last bit transmitted before the first bit of the next header.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0201">A SPAM message is the modality whereby the original transmission station that originates said message controls specific addressed apparatus at subscriber stations. The information of any given SPAM transmission consists of a series or stream of sequentially transmitted SPAM messages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0202">Each instance of a header synchronizes all subscriber station apparatus in the analysis of the internal structure of the message that follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0203">However, for the unified system of the present invention to work, subscriber station apparatus must have capacity for distinguishing more than the internal structure of individual messages. Said apparatus must also have capacity for processing streams of SPAM messages and distinguishing the individual messages in said streams from one another. More precisely, said apparatus must have capacity for processing streams of binary information that consist only of “0” and “1” bits and distinguishing which information, among said bits, is header information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0204">Cadence information which consists of headers, certain length tokens, and signals that are called “end of file signals” enables subscriber station apparatus to distinguish each instance of header information in any given message stream and, hence, to distinguish the individual messages of said stream. In the present invention, subscriber station apparatus are preprogrammed to process cadence information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0205">SPAM messages are composed of elements—headers, execution segments, meter-monitor segments, and information segments—whose bit lengths vary. SPAM apparatus determine the bit length of said elements in different fashions, and the particular fashion that applies to any given element relates to the priority of said element for subscriber station speed of processing. First priority segment information has the highest priority for speedy processing and is of fixed binary bit length. A SPAM header is one example of a first priority segment. An execution segment is another example. Intermediate priority segment information has lower priority, varies in bit length, but contains internal length information. A Meter-monitor segment is one example of an intermediate priority segment. Lowest priority segment information has the lowest priority, varies in length, and contains no internal information for determining segment length. Each information segment is an example of a lowest priority segment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0206">For a message that is constituted only of first priority segments, the information of the header is sufficient to distinguish not only the structure of the message but also the location of the next header. In the simplest preferred embodiment, a message with a “10” header is one example of a message constituted only of first priority segments. Commands with “10” headers consist of header information and execution segment information. At any given time, all instances of header information are of one constant length, and all instances of execution segment information are of a second constant length. Thus all “10” commands are, themselves, of a particular header+exec constant length, said header+exec constant being the sum of said one constant plus said second constant. Because “10” messages have constant length and header information always occurs at a specific location in every instance of message information, by preprogramming subscriber station apparatus with information of said header+exec constant, the unified system of the present invention enables subscriber station apparatus to automatically identify the last command information bit of “10” messages. Said bit is always the bit that is located a particular quantity of bits after the first header bit which particular quantity equals said header+exec constant minus one. Being able to locate said last bit, said apparatus can automatically locate the next instance of header information in a fashion described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0207">For messages whose elements include intermediate priority segment information but no lowest priority segment information, the information of said messages is also sufficient to distinguish message structure and the location of the next header. In the simplest preferred embodiment, each message associated with an “00” header is one such message. Messages with “00” headers consist of header and execution segment information that are, together, of said header+exec constant length plus meter-monitor segment information that contains length token information. By preprogramming subscriber station apparatus with information for processing length token information, the present invention enables said apparatus to determine the particular information bit, following any instance of a “00” header, that is the last bit of the command of said header. Said bit is always the bit that is located a particular quantity of bits after the first header bit which quantity equals said header+exec constant minus one plus the particular preprogrammed quantity that said apparatus associates, in a preprogrammed fashion described more fully below, with the particular length token of said instance. By locating said last bit, said apparatus can automatically locate the next instance of header information in the fashion described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0208">For messages whose elements include lowest priority segment information, particular end of lowest priority segment information is required to distinguish full message structure and the location of the next header. In the simplest preferred embodiment, each message associated with a “01” or a “11” contains an information segment header and is one such message. Information segments vary in length, and no internal information of a command or information segment enables subscriber station apparatus to determine the length of an information segment. Thus distinctive end of file signals are required to communicate the locations of the ends of information segments to subscriber station apparatus. In the present invention, each end of file signal is transmitted immediately after the end of an information segment; said signal is part of the information of the message in which said segment occurs; and said signal is located at the end of said message. By preprogramming subscriber station apparatus to detect and process end of file signals in a fashion described more fully below, the present invention enables said apparatus to determine not only the particular information bit, following any instance of a “01” or “11” header, that is the last bit of the information segment of the message of said header but also the particular information bit, following said header, that is the last bit of said message. By locating said last bit of said message, said apparatus can automatically locate the next instance of header information in the fashion described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0209">At any given time, subscriber station apparatus are preprogrammed to process only one distinct signal as an end of file signal. In order for said apparatus to distinguish an instance of said signal from all other signal information, an end of file signal must differ distinctly from all other information. Signal information, especially information transmitted in an information segment, can vary greatly in composition. Accordingly, to be distinctive, an end of file signal must be long and complex to detect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0210">An end of file signal consists of a particular sequence of bits of binary information. In the preferred embodiment each bit is identical to every other bit; that is, disregarding error correction information, an end of file signal consists of a sequence of “1” bits (eg. “11111111”) or “0” bits (eg. “00000000”). In the preferred embodiment, end of file signals are composed of “1” bits rather than “0” bits. Zero is a value that occurs frequently in data and in mathematics, and however many bits may occur in a binary data word that consists of a series of “0” bits, the numeric value of said word remains zero. Numeric values that are represented in binary form by a sequence of “1” bits, especially a sequence that is long, occur in data and mathematics far less frequently than zero. Thus the preferred composition bit is “1” because the chance of data being joined in a given signal in such a way that two or more instance of information combine inadvertently and create the appearance of an end of file signal is far smaller if the preferred bit is “1” than if it is “0”. (Hereinafter, the preferred binary end of file signal composition bit, “1”, is called an “EOFS bit,” and for reasons that are explained below, the alternate binary bit, “0”, is called a “MOVE bit.”)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0211">In the preferred embodiment, the length of said sequence (disregarding error correction information) is the minimum reasonable length necessary to distinguish said sequence from all other sequences of transmitted signal information of said length. In the preferred embodiment, the number of bits in said sequence is greater than the number of information bits in the data words that subscriber station computers use to process data. At present, most computers are so-called “thirty-two bit machines” that process information in four-byte data words, and some high precision microprocessors such as the 8087 mathematics coprocessor distributed by the Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., U.S.A. process information internally in eighty bit registers which means that they process in 10-byte data words. Thus said sequence may be greater than eighty bits long and is probably greater than thirty-two bits. Also in the preferred embodiment, said sequence uses the full information capacity of the signal words used to communicate said sequence at subscriber stations. In computer systems that communicate information in eight-bit bytes, forty bits is the number of bits in the sequence next larger than thirty-two bits that uses the full communication capacity of the signal words in which it is communicated, and eighty-eight is the number of bits in the sequence next larger than eighty bits. In the preferred embodiment, at any given time alternate end of file signal lengths exist. One potential end of file signal length can be forty (40) bits which is five bytes of EOFS bits. Another can be eighty-eight (88) bits which is eleven bytes of EOFS bits. Which end of file signal is used for any given transmission depends on the nature of the information of the transmission in which said signal occurs and the apparatus to which said transmission is transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0212">Being the minimum “reasonable” length means that an instance of said sequence may actually be generated, in the system of the preferred embodiment, which instance is generated as information of a command or an information segment rather than an end of file signal. Were the information of said instance to be embedded in a SPAM transmission of said system and transmitted, said instance would cause erroneously processing at subscriber station apparatus by causing itself to be detected as an end of file signal and information transmitted subsequent to said instance to be interpreted as a new SPAM message. To prevent such erroneous processing, in the preferred embodiment, after the initial generation of any given instance of SPAM message information (not including end of file signal information) and before the embedding and transmitting of said instance, said information is transmitted through an apparatus, called an “EOFS valve,” that detects end of file signals and is described below. If said valve detects in said information particular information that constitutes an end of file signal, before being embedded and transmitted, the binary information of said instance is rewritten, in a fashion well known in the art that may be manual, to cause substantively the same information processing at subscriber stations without containing an instance of information that is identical to the information of an end of file signal. (Hereinafter, such pre-transmission processing of a message is called a “pre-transmission evaluation.”)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0213"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> shows a series of connected rectangles and depicts one instance of a stream of SPAM messages. Each rectangle represents one signal word of binary information. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> shows a series of three messages. Each message is composed in a whole number of signal words. The first message consists of a command followed by padding bits followed by an information segment followed by an end of file signal. The form of the command, padding bits, and the first information segment bits of said message is identical to the form of the information of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, given eight-bit bytes as the signal words of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>. The second message consists of a command followed by padding bits. The form of said second message is identical to the form of the information of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, given eight-bit bytes as the signal words of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>. The third message consists of a command alone. The form of said third message is identical to the form of the information of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>, given eight-bit bytes as the signal words of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref> shows a message that is composed just of a “10” header and an execution segment. Said execution segment contains the same number of binary bits that the executions segments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E and 2H</figref> contain. Said header and execution segment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref> fill one byte of binary information precisely, and given the signal word of an eight-bit byte, no padding bits are required in the message of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref> does not show an instance of a message that starts with a “11” header. Were it to do so, said message would be comprised of said header followed by six padding bits, given eight-bit bytes as the signal words of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>, followed by an information segment, like the information segment of the first message of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, followed by an end of file signal, like the end of file signal of said first message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0214">As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> shows, in any given SPAM transmission, no binary information separates the binary information of one SPAM message from the next message. As soon as the information of one SPAM message ends (including all error correction information associated with said information), the next received binary information is information of the next message. Because the first information bits (as distinct from error correction bits) of any given SPAM message constitute the header information of said message, subscriber station apparatus locate the next instance of header information after any given message by locating the last information bit of the last signal word of said message. Automatically the first information bits that follow said last bit and total in number the particular number of bits in an instance of header information constitute the next instance of header information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0215">Subscriber station apparatus locate the last information bit of any given SPAM message in one of two fashions. One fashion applies to messages that do not end with end of file signals. The other applies to messages that do. The header information of any given message determines which fashion applies for said message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0216">Messages that are constituted only of first priority segment elements and messages whose elements include intermediate priority segment information but no lowest priority segment information do not end with end of file signals. In the preferred embodiment, the header information of any given one of said messages cause subscriber station apparatus to execute particular preprogrammed locate-last-message-bit instructions at a particular time. In the simplest preferred embodiment, such messages begin with “10” or “00” headers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0217">Receiving any given instance of said header information causes subscriber stations processing message information of said instance to execute said locate-last-message-bit instructions after locating the last segment information bit of said instance and upon completing the processing of the segment information of said instance. (The fashions whereby subscriber station apparatus locate the last command information bit of any given instance of a message with a “10” or a “00” header are described above.) In a fashion that is described more fully below, said locate-last-message-bit instructions cause said apparatus to determine whether the signal word in which said last segment information bit occurs contains one or more MOVE bits. If said signal word contains MOVE bit information, the last information bit of said signal word is the last information bit of said message. If said signal word does not contain MOVE bit information, the last information bit of said message is last information bit of the next signal word immediately following said signal word in which said last segment information bit occurs. (For reasons that relate to detecting end of file signals and are discussed more fully below, in the preferred embodiment a complete signal word of padding bits is transmitted after any given instance of a signal word that contains no MOVE bit information and in which occurs the last bit of command information of the message of said instance.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0218">Messages that contain lowest priority segment information end with end of file signals, and the header information of said messages do not cause subscriber station apparatus to execute particular preprogrammed locate-last-message-bit instructions. End of file signals define the ends of messages that contain lowest priority segment information. In the simplest preferred embodiment, such messages begin with “10” or “00” headers. The last information bit of the end of file signal immediately following any given “10” or “00” header information message is the last information bit of the message of said “10” or “00” header, and subscriber station apparatus are preprogrammed to locate said bit in a fashion that is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0219">After locating any given instance of a last information bit of a message, subscriber station apparatus are preprogrammed to process automatically as header information the first information bits, following said bit, that are in number the particular number of bits in an instance of header information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0220">In this fashion, cadence information—header information, the length tokens of messages that contain intermediate priority segment information but no lowest priority segment information, and end of file signals—enables subscriber station apparatus to distinguish each instance of header information—and, hence, each message—in any given stream of SPAM messages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">Detecting End of File Signals</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0221">In the present invention, any microprocessor, buffer/comparator, or buffer can be adapted and preprogrammed to detect end of file signals. At any given SPAM apparatus that is so adapted and preprogrammed, particular dedicated capacity exists for said detecting. Said capacity includes standard register memory or RAM capacity, well known in the art, including three particular memory locations for comparison purposes, one particular memory location to serve as a counter, and three so-called “flag bit” locations to hold particular true/false information. (Hereinafter, said three particular memory locations, said one particular memory location, and said three flag bit locations are called the “EOFS Word Evaluation Location,” “EOFS Standard Word Location,” and “EOFS Standard Length Location”; the “EOFS WORD Counter”; and the “EOFS WORD Flag,” “EOFS Empty Flag,” and “EOFS Complete Flag” all respectively.) All operating instructions required to control said memory or RAM capacity in detecting end of file signals are preprogrammed as so-called “firmware” at said apparatus. (In this specification, said dedicated capacity is called an “EOFS valve” because, in addition to detecting end of file signals, said capacity also regulates the flow of SPAM information in fashions that are described more fully below.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0222">At any given EOFS valve, the EOFS Word Evaluation Location and EOFS Standard Word Location are conventional dynamic memory locations each capable of holding one full signal word of binary information. The EOFS Standard Length Location and the EOFS WORD Counter are each conventional dynamic memory locations capable of holding, at a minimum, eight binary bits—that is, one byte—of information. The EOFS WORD Flag, EOFS Empty Flag, and EOFS Complete Flag are each conventional dynamic memory locations capable of holding, at a minimum, one bit of binary information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0223">At any given time, said valve holds particular information. At said EOFS Word Evaluation Location is one signal word of received SPAM information. At said EOFS Standard Word Location is one signal word of EOFS bits. (Hereinafter, one signal word of EOFS bits is called an “EOFS WORD.”) At said EOFS Standard Length Location is information of the total number of EOFS WORDs in the particular end of file signal that applies at said time on the particular transmission received at said valve. Information of the decimal value, eleven, is at said Standard Length Location unless information of a number is placed at said Location in a fashion described below. At the EOFS WORD Counter is information of the number of EOFS WORDs that said valve has received in uninterrupted sequence. And all said Flag locations contain binary “0” or “1” information to reflect true or false conditions in relation to particular comparisons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0224">At any given time, any given EOFS valve receives inputted binary information of one selected SPAM transmission from one particular external transferring apparatus that is external to said valve. Said information consists of a series of discrete signal words. And said valve outputs information to one particular external receiving apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0225">Receiving any given signal word of said transmission, causes said EOFS valve to commence, in respect to said given signal word, a particular word evaluation sequence that is fully automatic. Automatically said valve places information of said word at said EOFS Word Evaluation Location and compares the information at said Location to the EOFS WORD information at said EOFS Standard Word Location. Whenever said comparison is made, resulting in a match causes said valve automatically to set the information of said EOFS WORD Flag to “0”. (Resulting in a match means that said given signal word is an EOFS WORD and may be a part of an end of file signal.) Not resulting in a match causes said valve automatically to set the information of said EOFS WORD Flag to “1”. Then automatically said valve determines the value of said information at said EOFS WORD Flag, in a fashion well known in the art, and executes one of two sets of word evaluation sequence instructions on the basis of the outcome of said determining.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0226">One set, the process-EOFS-WORD instructions, is executed whenever the information at said EOFS WORD Flag indicates that said given signal word is an EOFS WORD. Determining a value of “0” at said EOFS WORD Flag causes said valve to execute said set. Automatically the instructions of said set cause said valve to retain count information of said given signal word by increasing the value of the information at said EOFS WORD Counter by an increment of one. (Incrementing said Counter by one documents the fact that, in receiving said given signal word, said valve has received, in uninterrupted sequence, one signal word that may be part of an end of file signal more than it had received before it received said given signal word.) Then automatically said valve compares the information at said EOFS WORD Counter to the information at said EOFS Standard Length Location. Resulting in a match causes said valve automatically to set the information of said EOFS Complete Flag to “0”. (A match of the information at said Counter with the information at said Location means that said given signal word is the last EOFS WORD in an uninterrupted sequence of EOFS WORDS that equals in length the length of an end of file signal; in other words, said match means that an end of file signal has been detected.) Not resulting in a match causes said valve automatically to set the information of said EOFS Complete Flag to “1”. (Not resulting in a match means said EOFS WORD is not the last EOFS WORD of an end of file signal and that insufficient information has been received to determine whether or not said given signal word is part of an end of file signal.) Then automatically said valve determines the value of said information at said EOFS Complete Flag. Determining a value of “0” at said Flag, which means that an end of file signal has been detected, causes said valve to operate in a fashion described more fully below. Determining a value of “1” at said Flag causes said valve, in a fashion described more fully below, to complete said word evaluation sequence, in respect to said given signal word, without transferring any information of said given signal word to said external receiving apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0227">The other set, the transfer-all-word-information instructions, is executed whenever the information at said EOFS WORD Flag indicates that said given signal word is not an EOFS WORD. Whenever said valve detects a signal word that is not an EOFS WORD, detecting said word means not only that said word is not part of an end of file signal but also that any EOFS WORDs retained in an uninterrupted sequence immediately prior to said word are also not part of an end of file signal. Determining a value of “1” at said EOFS WORD Flag causes said valve to execute said other set. Automatically the instructions of said other set cause said valve to compare the information at said EOFS WORD Counter to particular zero information that is among the preprogrammed information of said valve. (Not having been incremented by one under control of said process-EOFS-WORD instructions, said Counter contains information of the number of EOFS WORDs received in an uninterrupted sequence and retained at said valve at the time when said given signal word is received.) Resulting in a match causes said valve automatically to set the information of said EOFS Empty Flag to “0”. (Resulting in a match means that said valve is empty of retained EOFS WORD information.) Not resulting in a match causes said valve automatically to set the information of said EOFS Empty Flag to “1”. (Not resulting in a match means that said valve contains information of EOFS WORDs that have not been transferred to said external receiving apparatus.) Then automatically said valve determines the value of said information at said EOFS Empty Flag. A determining of “1” causes said valve to execute particular transfer-counted-information instructions that are not executed if the information at said Flag is “0”. Under control of said instructions, said valve automatically outputs one instance of said EOFS WORD information at said EOFS Standard Word Location a particular number of times which particular number is the numerical value of the information at said EOFS WORD Counter. (In so doing, said valve transfers information of all of the signal words received before said given signal word and not transferred to said external receiving apparatus.) Then said transfer-counted-information instructions cause said valve to set the value at said EOFS WORD Counter to zero (to reflect that said valve is now empty of information of untransferred signal words). Then, whether or not said valve has executed said transfer-counted-information instructions, said valve outputs information of said given signal word at said EOFS Word Evaluation Location and completes said word evaluation sequence, in respect to said given signal word.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0228">Whenever said valve completes said word evaluation sequence, in respect to any given signal word, said valve informs said external transferring apparatus (in a so-called “handshaking” fashion, well known in the art, or in such other flow control fashion as may be appropriate) that said valve is ready to receive next signal word information. Whenever, after transferring a given signal word, said apparatus is so informed, said apparatus transfers to said decoder the next signal word of said transmission immediately following said given signal word. Receiving said next signal word causes said valve to commence said word evaluation sequence, in respect to said next signal word. Automatically said valve places information of said next signal word at said EOFS Word Evaluation Location, and in so doing, overwrites and obliterates information of said given word at said EOFS Word Evaluation Location.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0229">In this fashion, said valve processes each successive signal word to detect those particular uninterrupted series of EOFS WORDs that constitute end of file signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0230">As described above, determining, under control of said process-EOFS-WORD instructions, that the value of the information at said EOFS Complete Flag is “0” means that an end of file signal has been detected. Determining, under control of said instructions, that said value is “0” causes said valve to execute particular complete-signal-detected instructions. Said instructions cause said valve to inform said external receiving apparatus of the presence of an end of file signal in a fashion that is the preprogrammed fashion of the microprocessor, buffer/comparator, or buffer of which said valve is an adapted component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0231">As one example of said fashion, for a buffer or buffer/comparator apparatus that operates under control of a controller to process received signal words and transfer signal information to a microprocessor (which may be a component of said controller), said instructions cause said valve to cause said apparatus to transmit particular EOFS-signal-detected information to said controller then to wait, in a waiting fashion well known in the art, for a control instruction from said controller. Said EOFS-signal-detected information causes said controller to determine, in a preprogrammed fashion, how to process the particular EOFS information at said valve and to transmit either a particular transmit-and-wait instruction or a particular discard-and-wait instruction to said valve. (Examples of controller operations are presented below.) Said transmit-and-wait instruction causes said valve to transfer one complete end of file signal. More precisely, said instruction causes said valve automatically to output one instance of said EOFS WORD information at said EOFS Standard Word Location a particular number of times which particular number is the numerical value of the information at said EOFS Standard Length Location. Then automatically said valve sets the information at said EOFS WORD Counter to zero (thereby signifying that no EOFS WORDs are retained), completes said word evaluation sequence, in respect to the signal word of the information at said EOFS Word Evaluation Location, and transmits particular complete-and-waiting information to said controller. Alternatively, said discard-and-wait instruction causes said valve merely to set the information at said EOFS WORD Counter to zero (thereby discarding information of said end of file signal), to complete said word evaluation sequence, in respect to said signal word of the information at said EOFS Word Evaluation Location, and to transmit said complete-and-waiting information to said controller. Subsequently, said complete-and-waiting information causes said controller to transmit further instructions that control said apparatus and said valve in the processing of further information and the detecting of further end of file signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0232">In the preferred embodiment, said EOFS-signal-detected information and said complete-and-waiting information are control signals that are transmitted by said valve and said apparatus to said controller as interrupts to the CPU of said controller.</div>

Automatically said valve compares the information at said EOFS WORD Counter, “00000010”, to said zero information, “00000000”, that is among the preprogrammed information of said valve. No match results which causes said valve to set the information of said EOFS Empty Flag to “1”. Automatically said valve determines that the information at said EOFS Empty Flag is “1” which causes said valve to execute said transfer-counted-information instructions. Said instructions cause said valve automatically to transfer one instance of said EOFS WORD information at said EOFS Standard Word Location, “11111111”, to said receiving apparatus then decrease the value of the information at said EOFS WORD Counter by a decrement of one—that is, from “00000010” to “00000001”—then compare the information at said EOFS WORD Counter to said zero information, “00000000”. Because no match occurs, said valve automatically transfers one more instance of said EOFS WORD information, “11111111”, to said receiving apparatus then decreases the value of the information at said EOFS WORD Counter by an additional decrement of one—that is, from “00000001” to “00000000”—then compares said information to said zero information, “00000000”. A match occurs. In a fashion well known in the art, the fact of said match causes said valve automatically to continue executing transfer-all-word-information instructions. Automatically said valve transfers information of said fifth byte at said EOFS word evaluation location—which information is “00000000”—to said receiving apparatus; completes said word evaluation sequence, in respect to said fifth and last byte of the message of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref>; and informs said transferring apparatus that said valve is ready to receive next signal word information which causes said apparatus to transfer to said valve the next byte of said message as soon as said apparatus receives and is prepared to transfer said byte.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0242">The example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref> illustrates how receiving each signal word causes an EOFS valve to evaluate the information content of said word; to transfer words that are not EOFS WORDs; to retain count information of words that are EOFS WORDs so long as said words occur in uninterrupted sequences of EOFS WORDs which sequences are shorter than the number of EOFS WORDs in an instance of end of file signal information; and when receiving any given signal word that is not an EOFS WORD interrupts such a sequence, to transfer information of each retained EOFS WORD before transferring information of said given signal word. The example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref> does not illustrate the detecting of an end of file signal; however, an example of such detecting is provided below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0243">In this specification, MOVE bits are called “MOVE” bits because MOVE bit information in any given signal word causes each EOFS valve that processes the information of said word to “move”—that is, to transfer—information of said word to receiving apparatus external to said valve during the word evaluation sequence of said word rather than retaining said information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0244">Reasons should now be clear why padding bits are always MOVE bits and why, in a SPAM message, a full signal word of padding bits follows a signal word that is the last signal word in which command information occurs and that contains no MOVE bits. The command of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref> is such a command, and the fourth byte is such a word. In its automatic fashion for identifying end of file signals, no EOFS valve that receives said fourth byte transfers said byte until it receives a subsequent signal word that contains a MOVE bit. In the present invention there is no assurance that every EOFS valve immediately receives a next signal word as soon as it completes the word evaluation sequence, in respect to any given signal word. Thus to ensure that all apparatus to which messages are addressed process message information in the fastest possible fashion, all messages that do not end with end of file signals do end with signal words that contain at least one MOVE bit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0245">One final rule of message composition remains. In order to define end of file signals precisely, a signal word that contains at least one MOVE bit is always transmitted immediately before the uninterrupted sequence of EOFS WORDs of any given end of file signal. Were a given signal word that contained no MOVE bits to be transmitted immediately before the uninterrupted sequence of a given end of file signal, said word would contain only EOFS bits and would be an EOFS WORD. Any EOFS valve processing said word and said signal would process said word as one of the EOFS WORDs of said uninterrupted sequence. Said valve would count said word erroneously as part of said sequence rather than as part of the information preceding said sequence and would count at least the last EOFS WORD of said sequence erroneously as part of the message following said signal rather than as part of said signal. In order to avoid such erroneous processing, any given instance of the uninterrupted sequence of EOFS WORDs of an end of file signal is preceded by signal word that is not an EOFS WORD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0246">This final rule may be satisfied in a number of different ways. For example, end of file signals could include the signal word preceding said uninterrupted sequence. Rather than being an uninterrupted sequence of eleven EOFS WORDs, an end of file signal could be twelve words long with the first word containing MOVE bit information. And subscriber station apparatus could be adapted and preprogrammed for detecting such signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0247">As related above, in the preferred embodiment, end of file signals are composed just of the uninterrupted sequence of EOFS WORDs described above, and the signal words that precede said sequences are part of the last segment information preceding said signals. To prevent erroneous processing while satisfying the final rule of message composition, in any given pre-transmission evaluation of an instance of SPAM message information, if the EOFS valve of said evaluation retains information the last signal word of said information in the course of the word evaluation sequence of said word rather than transferring information of said word, the binary information of said instance is rewritten, in a fashion well known in the art that may be manual, before being embedded and transmitted. Said binary information is rewritten to end with a final signal word that contains MOVE bit information and still cause substantively the same information processing at subscriber stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0248">In this fashion, the signal information of any given end of file signal is distinctive, and EOFS detectors detect end of file signals precisely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0249">Despite the fact that the use of end of file signals involves time consuming processing, the preferred embodiment's system for distinguishing individual messages from one another in message streams has significant advantages over alternate techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0250">By comparison with systems that process fixed length and/or fixed format messages, the use of end of file signals permits great flexibility. Messages can be of any length and can contain any information that digital receiver station apparatus can process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0251">By comparison with systems that distinguish messages from one another by means of distinctive signals that separate the end of each message from the beginning of the next, end of file signals are used in the preferred embodiment only with some messages. Many messages, such as the second and third messages of the message stream of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>, do not require end of file signals. Furthermore, as will become more apparent in the course of this specification, messages that consist of commands alone often have higher priority for processing speed than do the messages that contain last segment information. Since only messages that contain last segment information require end of file signals, end of file signals are often transmitted and processed at times when speed of processing is of relative unimportance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0252">Finally, because long cadence signals are processed at ends of messages rather than at beginnings, the preferred embodiment reduces the relative importance of the processing speed associated with such signals even further. In the preferred embodiment, subscriber station apparatus have capacity for commencing to process received command and information segment information before receiving the end of file signal associated with said information. The commencement of processing of the command and information segment information of any given message need never be delayed until after an end of file signal, associated with said message, is detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0253">The preferred embodiment has the advantage of requiring that long cadence signals that require time consuming processing be transmitted only with some messages and then only at times when processing speed is of relatively low priority. In so doing, the preferred embodiment makes it possible to transmit in the shortest, simplest formats messages that have high priority for processing speed and to process said messages the fastest fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">The Normal Transmission Location</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0254">SPAM signals are generated at original transmission stations or intermediate transmission stations and embedded in television or radio or other programming transmissions by conventional generating and embedding means, well known in the art. Said signals may be embedded in transmissions at said stations immediately prior to transmitting said transmissions via conventional broadcast or cablecast means, well known in the art. Alternatively, said signals may be embedded in transmissions that are then recorded, in a fashion well known in the art, on an appropriate conventional video, audio or other record media. Playing back said media on appropriate player apparatus will cause said apparatus to retransmit said transmissions with said SPAM signals embedded precisely as they were embedded when said transmissions were recorded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0255">SPAM signals can be embedded in many different locations in electronic transmissions. In television, SPAM signals can be embedded in the video portion or in the audio portion of the transmission. In the video portion, SPAM signals can be embedded in each frame on one line such as line <b>20</b> of the vertical interval, or on a portion of one line, or on more than one line, and they will probably lie outside the range of the television picture displayed on a normally tuned television set. SPAM signals can be embedded in radio audio transmissions. In the audio of television and radio transmissions, SPAM signals will probably be embedded in a portion of the audio range that is not normally rendered in a form audible to the human ear. In television audio, they are likely to lie between eight and fifteen kilohertz. In broadcast print and data communications transmissions, SPAM signals can accompany conventional print or data programming in the conventional transmission stream.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0256">In television, the normal transmission location of the preferred embodiment is in the vertical interval of each frame of the television video transmission. Said location begins at the first detectable part of line <b>20</b> of the vertical interval and continues to the last detectable part of the last line of the vertical interval that is not visible on a normally tuned television set.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0257">In radio, the preferred normal transmission location is in the audio above the range of the radio transmission that is normally audible to the human ear.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0258">In broadcast print or data communications, the preferred normal transmission location for SPAM signals is in the same location as the conventional information. More precisely, conventional print of data information is transmitted in SPAM transmissions. Any given instance of conventional print or data information is transmitted in a SPAM information segment that is preceded by a “01” header SPAM command or a “11” header, which command or header addresses conventional print or data processing apparatus at subscriber stations and causes said apparatus to process said conventional information in the conventional fashion. In said transmissions, other SPAM commands and information address and control subscriber station apparatus in other SPAM functioning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0259">(Hereinafter, the preferred normal location for transmitting signals in any given communication medium is called, the “normal transmission location”.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0260">In the preferred embodiment, while receiver station decoder apparatus may be controlled, in fashions described below, to detect information segment information outside the normal transmission locations, SPAM commands and cadence information are always transmitted in normal transmission locations. In the present invention, the object of many decoders is to detect only command information such as meter-monitor segment information. Having one unchanging location for the transmission of command information in any given television, radio, broadcast print, or data transmission permits decoder apparatus to search just one unchanging portion of said transmission to detect commands. Having the same fixed location for cadence information enables said decoder apparatus to distinguish all command information in said transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">Operating Signal Processor Systems . . . Introduction</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0261">Five examples illustrate methods of operating signal processing system apparatus. Each focuses on subscriber stations where the signal processor system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> and the combined medium apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> share apparatus and operate in common.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0262"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows one such subscriber station. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the decoder, <b>203</b>, of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is also an external decoder of the signal processor system of signal processor, <b>200</b>. Like decoders, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>29</b>, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, decoder, <b>203</b>, has capacity for transferring SPAM information to buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>, and to buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>. In addition, signal processor, <b>200</b>, has capacity for transferring SPAM signals from a particular jack port of controller, <b>12</b>, to microcomputer, <b>205</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0263"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also shows SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, to which signals that are addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, are transferred from decoder, <b>203</b>, and from signal processor, <b>200</b>. SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, is a control unit like controller, <b>39</b>, of decoder, <b>203</b>, with buffer capacity for receiving multiple inputs; RAM and ROM for holding operating instructions and other information; EOFS valve capacity for detecting end of file signals and regulating the flow of SPAM signals; microprocessor capacity for processing; capacity for transferring information to and receiving information from the central processor unit (hereinafter, “CPU”) of microcomputer, <b>205</b>; and capacity for transferring information to one or more input buffers of microcomputer, <b>205</b>. SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, operates independently of said CPU although said CPU has capacity to interrupt SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, in an interrupt fashion well known in the art. SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, also has capacity to control directly to the aforementioned PC-MicroKey 1300 System without affecting the operation of said CPU.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0264">All five examples describe signal processing variations that relate to the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> combining of “One Combined Medium.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0265">The first focuses on the basic operation, in “One Combined Medium,” of decoder, <b>203</b>; SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C; and microcomputer, <b>205</b>. No signals require decryption. No meter information is collected. No monitor information is processed. Combined information is displayed at each subscriber station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0266">In the second example, the combining of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> occurs only at selected subscriber stations. The second combining synch command is partially encrypted, and said stations are preprogrammed with particular information that is necessary to decrypt said command. At said stations, said command causes its own decryption and the combining of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. In addition, said command causes signal processor apparatus at said stations to retain meter information that a remote billing agency can use as a basis for charging the subscribers of said stations for displaying the combined information of said combining. At all other stations, no information is decrypted, no combining occurs, and no meter information is collected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0267">In the third example, combined information is displayed at each subscriber station just as in the first example. In addition, monitor information is processed at selected stations for one or more so-called “ratings” agencies (such as the A. C. Nielsen Company) that collect statistics on viewership and programming usage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0268">The fourth example provides a second illustration of restricting the combining of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> to selected subscriber stations through the use of encryption/decryption techniques and metering. In addition, the fourth example shows how monitor information is collected at selected ones of said selected stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0269">The fifth example adds program unit identification signals identified at decoders, <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0270">In the last three examples, the first combining synch command causes selected subscriber stations to transfer recorded meter information and monitor information to one or more remote computer stations of said billing agencies and ratings agencies and causes computers at said remote agencies to receive and process said transferred information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0271">Each example focuses on the processing of the three signal messages of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> combining. The information of said messages include three combining synch commands and one program instruction set.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0272">The first message is of the information associated with the first combining synch command. Said first command has a “01” header, an execution segment, and a meter-monitor segment of six fields. Said command is followed by an information segment that contains said program instruction set, and said information segment is followed by an end of file signal. Said first command addresses URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, and causes said computers, <b>205</b>, to load and run the program instruction set transmitted in the information segment. Each meter-monitor segment field of said command contains information that identifies one of the following:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0273">the origin of said “Wall Street Week” transmission,</li> <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0274">the subject matter of said “Wall Street Week” program,</li> <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0275">the program unit of said program,</li> <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0276">the day of said transmission within a particular one hundred year period,</li> <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0277">the supplier of the program instruction set in the information segment following said first combining synch command, and</li> <li id="ul0010-0006" num="0278">the format of said meter-monitor segment information.
<br/>
(Hereinafter, meter-monitor information that identifies the program unit of a given program may also be called the “program unit identification code”.)
</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0279">The second message is of the information associated with the second combining synch command. Said second command has a “00” header, an execution segment, and a meter-monitor segment of five fields and addresses URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>. Said second command causes said computers, <b>205</b>, to combine the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> information of each microcomputer, <b>205</b>, with the information of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> and transmit the combined information to monitors, <b>202</b>M. Each meter-monitor segment field of the second command contains information of one of the following:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0280">the subject matter of said “Wall Street Week” program,</li> <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0281">the program unit of said program,</li> <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0282">the unique code of said overlay given said program unit information,</li> <li id="ul0012-0004" num="0283">the minute of said transmission within a particular one month period, and</li> <li id="ul0012-0005" num="0284">the format of said meter-monitor segment information.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0285">The third message is of the information associated with the third combining synch command. Said third command has only a “10” header and an execution segment and addresses URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>. Said command causes said computers, <b>205</b>, to cease combining and transmit only the received composite video transmission to monitors, <b>202</b>M, and to continue processing in a predetermined fashion (which fashion may be determined by the aforementioned program instruction set).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0286">In those examples that focus on encrypted commands, the meter-monitor segments of each encrypted command includes an additional meter-monitor field:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0287">meter instructions.
<br/>
In said examples, the meter-monitor format field information of said commands reflects the presence of said additional field.
</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0288">As described above, said signals are of binary information with error correcting bit information and are embedded, transmitted, and received in the normal transmission pattern of the “Wall Street Week” television transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0289">All subscriber station apparatus are fully preprogrammed to perform automatically each step of each example. No manual step is required at any station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0290">In each example, the apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are preprogrammed to detect embedded signal information, to transfer said information to addressed apparatus, and to operate under control of said information.

Apparatus of signal processor, <b>200</b>, are preprogrammed to decrypt information upon instruction and to transfer information to its addressed apparatus. For one or more remote services that meter and charge subscribers for the use of information or that audit such remote metering services, apparatus of signal processor, <b>200</b>, are preprogrammed to select, process, and record meter information and to transfer recorded meter information to one or more remote station computers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0291">In each example, the EOFS valves located at controller, <b>39</b>, of decoder, <b>203</b>; at buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>; and at SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, are preprogrammed to detect end of file signals that consist of eleven sequentially transmitted EOFS WORDs. Thus the binary information of eleven—“00001011”—is at the EOFS Standard Length Location of each of said EOFS valves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0292">In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, appropriate apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are also preprogrammed to assemble, record, and transmit to one or more remote locations monitor information for one or more services that sample selected subscriber stations (said stations being preprogrammed for this purpose) to collect statistical data on programming and information usage and/or to audit selectively the customer accounting of remote meter services.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0293">In each example, receiving SPAM signal information at each apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> causes subscriber station apparatus automatically to process said information in the preprogrammed fashions of said apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0294">At the outset of each example, particular meter record information of prior programming exists at a particular location at buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>. Said record information documents the fact that before receiving the “Wall Street Week” program, tuner, <b>215</b>, transmitted to monitor, <b>202</b>M, particular programming that contained embedded SPAM commands and information with particular meter instructions. Information of said commands and information caused buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>, to retain said meter record information. In the third and subsequent examples, monitor record information of said prior programming also exists at a particular location at said buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>, associated with the source mark of decoder, <b>203</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0295">In each example, the recorder, <b>16</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>, has reached a level of fullness where the recording of the next signal record received from the buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>, will cause the quantity of signal records recorded at recorder, <b>16</b>, to equal or exceed the particular fullness information of said recorder, <b>16</b>.

<heading id="h-0016">Operating Signal Processor Systems</heading>
<heading id="h-0017">Example #1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0297">The first example elaborates on the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> combining described above in “One Combined Medium” and focuses on the operation of decoder, <b>203</b>, SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, and microcomputer, <b>205</b>, on the execution of controlled functions, and on the use of cadence information to organize signal processing. The example begins as divider, <b>4</b>, starts to transfer to decoder, <b>203</b>, in its outputted composite video transmission, the embedded binary information of the first message. At the outset of example #1, controller, <b>39</b>, of decoder, <b>203</b>, and SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, have each identified an end of file signal and await header information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0298">Receiving said embedded binary information at decoder, <b>203</b>, (which does not include a filter, <b>31</b>, or a demodulator, <b>32</b>, because its input is a composite video transmission) causes line receiver, <b>33</b>, automatically to detect and transfer said embedded information to digital detector, <b>34</b>, which automatically detects the binary information with correcting information in said embedded information and transfers said binary information with correcting information to controller, <b>39</b>. Using forward error correction techniques, well known in the art, and employing particular correcting information, controller, <b>39</b>, automatically checks said information, as it is received, and corrects it as necessary then discards said particular correcting information retaining only the corrected information. Using conversion protocol techniques, well known in the art, controller, <b>39</b>, then automatically converts said corrected information into binary information that receiver station apparatus can receive and process. In this fashion, the binary information of the first message—more precisely, the first combining synch command and its associated program instruction set and end of file signal—are received and converted at decoder, <b>203</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0299">Once the information of any given point-to-multipoint SPAM transmission has been checked, corrected, and converted in the foregoing fashion, subscriber station apparatus communicate said information point-to-point using flow control and error correction techniques, well known in the art, that include handshaking and requesting retransmission. Thereafter, any given transmission of SPAM information, so corrected and converted, contains not only bits of communicated SPAM information but also so-called “parity bits” that convey error correcting information. At present, the conventional practice is for every ninth bit to be a parity bit that is used, in a fashion well known in the art, to check the correctness of the preceding eight bits, or “byte,” of communicated data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0300">Frequently in this disclosure, specific quantities of bits and bit locations are cited. Said bits are often specified as being “sequential” and “in their order after conversion,” and said bit locations are often “contiguous.” Unless otherwise stated, said quantities refer only to bits of communicated SPAM information and bit locations that hold communicated SPAM information. No attempt is made to account for the presence of parity bits among transmitted bits of SPAM information or at particular memory locations because techniques for distinguishing bits of communicated data from parity bits and for processing bits of communicated information separately from parity bits are well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0301">Automatically, after said binary information is converted, said information is inputted to the EOFS valve of controller, <b>39</b>, which processes said information in the fashion described above, comparing each signal word of said information to EOFS WORD information and transferring said binary information, signal word by signal word, until an end of file signal is detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0302">Receiving the header and execution segment of said first message causes controller, <b>39</b>, to determine that said message is addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, and to transfer said message to microcomputer, <b>205</b>. So transferring said message is the controlled function that the information said header and execution segment cause controller, <b>39</b>, to perform. Automatically, as said EOFS valve transfers converted binary information of said first message, controller, <b>39</b>, selects and records at particular SPAM-header register memory a particular preprogrammed constant number of the first converted bits of said binary information. Said constant number is the number of bits in a SPAM command header. (Hereinafter, said constant number is called “H”.) From the first bit of said binary information, H bits are selected and recorded, in their order after conversion, at said SPAM-header memory. Then, automatically, controller, <b>39</b>, determines that said information at SPAM-header memory (which is the “01” header of the first combining synch command and designates a SPAM command that is followed by an information segment) does not match particular 11-header-invoking information that is “11”. (In other words, the header of said message does not designate a SPAM message that consists of a header followed immediately by an information segment.) Not resulting in a match causes controller, <b>39</b>, automatically to select a second preprogrammed constant number of next bits and record said bits, in their order after conversion, at particular SPAM-exec register memory. Said second constant number is the particular number of bits in a SPAM execution segment. (Hereinafter, said second constant number is called “X”.) Beginning with the next bit of said binary information immediately after said H bits, controller, <b>39</b>, selects X bits and records said bits, in their order after conversion, at said SPAM-exec memory. Then, automatically, by comparing the information at said SPAM-exec memory (which information is the execution segment of the first combining synch command) with preprogrammed controlled-function-invoking information, controller, <b>39</b>, determines that said information at memory matches particular this-message-addressed-to-205 information that causes controller, <b>39</b>, to execute particular preprogrammed transfer-to-205 instructions. Said instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to transfer to SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, the SPAM message associated with the particular information at SPAM-header memory. Automatically, said instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to activate the output port that outputs to SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, then compare said information at SPAM-header memory to preprogrammed header-identification information. Automatically, controller, <b>39</b>, determines that said information matches particular “01” information. Said match causes controller, <b>39</b>, automatically to execute particular transfer-a-01-or-an-11-header-message instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0303">A “01” header distinguishes a message that contains lowest priority information.

Accordingly, said instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to transfer, from the start of said message, all information received from said valve until said valve detects and transfers the information of an end of file signal. Automatically controller, <b>39</b>, commences transferring said binary information, starting with said first H bits and transferring said information in its order after conversion, signal word by signal word. as said binary information is outputted by said EOFS valve. In due course, the EOFS valve of controller, <b>39</b>, receives the last signal word of the information segment of said first message. To satisfy the final rule of message composition cited above, said word, being an instance of a final signal word preceding an end of file signal, contains MOVE bit information and is not an EOFS WORD. Said valve transfers said word which causes controller, <b>39</b>, to transfer said word to SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C. (When said valve receives information of the next signal word after said word, the information of the EOFS WORD Counter of said valve is “00000000” because said word contained MOVE bit information.)</div>

A match results, causing said valve, in the fashion described above, to increase the value of the information at said EOFS WORD Counter by an increment of one from “00000000” to “00000001”. Automatically said valve determines, in the fashion described above, that the “00000001” at said EOFS WORD Counter does not match the “00001011” at said EOFS Standard Length Location which causes said valve to cause the apparatus that inputs signal words to said valve to transfer to said valve the next signal word of said message.</div>

Automatically said valve determines that said “00001011” matches the “00001011” at said EOFS Standard Length Location which causes said valve to execute the complete-signal-detected instructions described above in “Detecting End of File Signals.” Said instructions cause said valve to initiate the transmission of the aforementioned EOFS-signal-detected information to the CPU of controller, <b>39</b>, as an interrupt signal then to wait for a control instruction from controller, <b>39</b>, before processing inputted information further.</div>

Then controller, <b>39</b>, compares the information at said working memory to the information at said SPAM-length-info memory. (For the information of said largest integer to equal the information of said quotient means that said quotient is an integer, that said command information fills a whole number of signal words exactly, and that the possibility exists that a full signal word of padding bits does follow the last signal word in which command information occurs.) If the information at said working memory is equal to the information at said SPAM-length-info memory, said instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to place “0” information at particular SPAM-Flag-working register memory.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0333">Then said transfer-a-00-header-message instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to execute particular preprogrammed calculate-number-of-words-to-transfer instructions.

(If the information at said SPAM-Flag-working memory is “0”, said command information fills a whole number of signal words exactly; said whole number is the integer information at said working memory; but the last signal word of command information must be evaluated to ascertain whether it contains MOVE bit information.) Under control of said instructions, resulting in a match with said “0” information causes controller, <b>39</b>, to subtract one (1) from the numeric value of the integer information at said working memory. (On the other hand, if the information at said SPAM-Flag-working memory is “1”, said command information only partially fills the last of a whole number of signal words exactly; MOVE bits fill the remainder of the last of said words; and said whole number is one greater than said largest integer information that is at said working memory.) Under control of said instructions, not resulting in a match with said “0” information causes controller, <b>39</b>, to add one to the numeric value of the integer information at said working memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0298" num="0334">Next said transfer-a-00-header-message instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to execute particular preprogrammed commence-transfer instructions.

Said instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to compare said last word to particular preprogrammed end?-EOFS-WORD information that is the information of one EOFS WORD. If no match results, said word is the last word of said message. Otherwise, one full signal word of padding bits follows said word and ends said message.

In so doing, controller, <b>39</b>, transfers the complete binary information of the message of the instance of header information at said SPAM-header memory and completes said transfer-a-00-header-message instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0302" num="0338">Two specific cases illustrate the operation of said transfer-a-00-header-message instructions.

In both cases, when said instructions are invoked, information of the first H (that is, the first two) bits of the message being processed has been recorded at SPAM-header memory and information of the next X (that is the next six, the third through the eight bits) has been recorded at SPAM-exec memory. Thus said instructions process binary information that commences at the bit that is located immediately after the eighth bit of said message which eighth bit is the last of said X bits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0303" num="0339"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref> shows one instance of a message that contains command information that fills a whole number of signal words plus a decimal fraction.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0339" num="0375">In the same fashion that applied to the first and second messages, receiving said embedded information causes decoder, <b>203</b>, automatically to detect, check, correct as necessary, convert said information into binary information of said third message; to process and transfer said binary information at the EOFS valve of controller, <b>39</b>; and then to process the header and execution segment information in said binary information at controller, <b>39</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0340" num="0376">Receiving said header and execution segment information causes controller, <b>39</b>, to determine that said message is addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, and to transfer said message accordingly. Receiving the first H converted bits of said binary information from said valve causes controller, <b>39</b>, to select and record said H bits (the “10” header of the third combining synch command which designates a SPAM command with only an execution segment) at said SPAM-header register memory then determine that the information at said SPAM-header memory does not match said “11” information. Not resulting in a match causes controller, <b>39</b>, to process the next X received bits as the execution segment of a SPAM command. Receiving the next X bits of said binary information from said valve causes controller, <b>39</b>, to select and record said next X bits (the execution segment of the third combining synch command) at said SPAM-exec register memory, compare the information at said SPAM-exec memory to said controlled-function-invoking information, determine that said information at memory matches particular preprogrammed this-message-addressed-to-205 information that invokes the aforementioned transfer-to-205 instructions, and execute said instructions. Automatically controller, <b>39</b>, activates the output port that outputs to SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C; compares said information at SPAM-header memory to said header-identification information; and determines that said information at memory matches particular “10” information.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0341" num="0377">A “10” header distinguishes a message that is constituted only of first priority segments. At any given time, any given instance of “10” header message command information is of one constant binary length—the aforementioned header+exec constant length.

No length token information is processed, but it may be necessary to execute the aforementioned assess-padding-bit instructions to determine whether a full signal word of padding follows the last signal word in which command information occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0342" num="0378">Said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions transfer a “10” header message by executing many of the preprogrammed instructions executed by the aforementioned transfer-a-00-header-message instructions that controlled the transferring of the “00” header second message of example #1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0343" num="0379">Because length token information is not processed, said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions do not cause execution of said process-length-token instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0344" num="0380">Because each instance of “10” header message command information is of said one constant binary length, H+X, said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions do not cause execution of said determine-command-information-word-length instructions.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0345" num="0381">Just as with “00” header messages, the possibility can exist that a full signal word of padding bits may follow the last signal word of command information of a “10” header message. If H+X bits of binary information fill a whole number of signal words plus a decimal fraction, the last signal word of command information of any given instance of a “10” header message is not completely filled by command information bits. Padding bits that are MOVE bits fill out said word, and no possibility exists that a full word of padding bits follows said word. But if H+X bits fill a whole number of signal words exactly, the last signal word of command information is completely filled by command information bits. Said word may contain no MOVE bit information, and a full signal word of padding bits may follow said word.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0346" num="0382">Because each instance of “10” header message command information is of said one length, said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions do not cause execution of said evaluate-end-condition instructions to determine whether said possibility exists.

At those times when H+X bits of binary information fill a whole number of signal words exactly, said information is the binary value of zero. At all other times, said information is the binary value of one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0347" num="0383">Likewise, because each instance of “10” header message command information is of said one length, said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions do not cause execution of said calculate-number-of-words-to-transfer instructions. Instead, at any given time said 10-header-word-length information is preprogrammed number information that applies to every instance of “10” header message information. At those times when H+X bits of binary information fill an integer number of signal words exactly and a full signal word of padding bits may follow the last signal word in which command information occurs, said 10-header-word-length information is, itself, and integer that equals said integer number minus one. In the preferred embodiment where signal words are eight-bit bytes said 10-header-word-length information equals (H+X/8)−1. At those times when H+X bits of binary information do not fill a whole number of signal words exactly and the quotient of H+X divided by the number of bits in a signal word is a whole number plus a decimal fraction, said 10-header-word-length information equals the smallest integer larger than said quotient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0348" num="0384">The first set of preprogrammed instructions that said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions and said transfer-a-00-header-message instructions have in common are said commence-transfer instructions. But before said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions can execute said commence-transfer instructions, said 10-header-word-length information and said 10-header-end-condition information must be at particular locations. Accordingly, when executed said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to place information of said 10-header-word-length information at the aforementioned particular working register memory and information of said 10-header-end-condition information at the aforementioned SPAM-Flag-working register memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0349" num="0385">Next said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to execute said commence-transfer instructions. Said instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to transfer a particular number of signal words of said command information, starting with the signal word in which the first of said first H bits occurs and transferring said information in its order after conversion, signal word by signal word. Said number is the numeric value of the integer information at said working memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0386">Finally, said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to execute said evaluate-padding-bits-? instructions that cause controller, <b>39</b>, to compare the information at said SPAM-Flag-working memory to said continue-? information that is “0”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0351" num="0387">Not resulting in a match means that the last signal word in which command information occurs contains at least one MOVE bit of padding and that said 10-header-word-length information is the length of every instance of a “10” header message. Accordingly, not resulting in a match causes controller, <b>39</b>, to end execution of said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0352" num="0388">On the other hand, resulting in a match means that controller, <b>39</b>, has transferred all but the last signal word of command information, and said word must be evaluated to ascertain whether it contains MOVE bit information.

Said instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to compare said last word to said end-?-EOFS-WORD information. If no match results, said word is the last word of said message. Otherwise, one full signal word of padding bits follows said word and ends said message. Accordingly, not resulting in a match causes controller, <b>39</b>, to transfer just said last signal word, but resulting in a match causes controller, <b>39</b>, to transfer said last signal word then the signal word, in said binary information, that is immediately after said signal word. In so doing, controller, <b>39</b>, transfers the complete binary information of the message of the instance of header information at said SPAM-header memory and completes said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0353" num="0389">The case of the “10” message of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref> illustrates the operation of said transfer-a-10-header-message instructions.

Hence, H+X equals eight. Accordingly, controller, <b>39</b>, is preprogrammed with 10-header-word-length information that is integer information of (8/8)−1. More precisely, said 10-header-word-length information is integer information of zero. And because H+X bits of binary information fill a whole number of signal words exactly, controller, <b>39</b>, is preprogrammed with 10-header-end-condition information that is the binary value of zero.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0400" num="0436">In example #2, the first and third messages of the “Wall Street Week” combining are transmitted just as in example #1, but the second message is partially encrypted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0401" num="0437">The second message conveys the second combining synch command. In example #2, before said message is embedded at the program originating studio and transmitted, the execution segment of said command and all of the meter-monitor segment except for the length-token are encrypted, using standard encryption techniques, well known in the art, that encrypt binary information without altering the number of bits in said information. Partially encrypting the second message in this fashion leaves the cadence information of said message unencrypted. In other words, the “00” header, the length-token, and any padding bits added at the end of said message remain unencrypted. Said message is only partially encrypted in order to enable subscriber stations that lack capacity to decrypt said message to process the cadence information of said message accurately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0402" num="0438">In example #2, the encryption of said execution segment is done in such a fashion that, after encryption, said segment is identical to a particular execution segment that addresses URS signal processors, <b>200</b>, and instructs said processors, <b>200</b>, to use a particular decryption key J and decrypt the message in which said segment occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0403" num="0439">Because said message is encrypted, its meter-monitor segment contains a sixth field, a meter instruction field. Accordingly, the length of the second message, the number of bits in its meter-monitor segment and the numeric value of MMS-L is greater in example #2 than in example #1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0404" num="0440">As described above in “One Combined Medium,” before any messages of the “Wall Street Week” programming are transmitted, control invoking instructions are embedded at said program originating studio and transmitted to all subscriber stations. Among said instructions are particular ones that command URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, to set their PC-MicroKey Model 1300 Systems to the “Graphics Off” mode. Thus, at the outset of example #2, all PC-MicroKey 1300s are in the “Graphics Off” mode, and no microcomputer, <b>205</b>, is transmitting combined information of video RAM and received composite video to its associated monitor, <b>202</b>M.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0406" num="0442">When decoder, <b>203</b>, receives the embedded information of the second message of example #2, decoder, <b>203</b>, processes and transfers said information in the same fashion that applied to the second message of example #1 with three exceptions.</div>

Rather said information at memory matches particular preprogrammed this-message-addressed-to-200 information that invokes preprogrammed transfer-to-200 instructions. Controller, <b>39</b>, executes said instructions, and rather than activating the output port that outputs to SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, said instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to activate the output port that outputs to buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0408" num="0444">Then, subsequently, when said process-length-token instructions cause controller, <b>39</b>, to compare the information at SPAM-length-info memory, which is the length-token information of said second message of example #2, to token-comparison information, said information at memory does not match the X-token information matched by the length-token of the second message of example #1. Rather, said information at memory matches particular preprogrammed Y-token information associated with particular preprogrammed y-bits information whose numeric value is the MMS-L of the second message of example #2. Said match causes controller, <b>39</b>, automatically to select said y-bits information and place said information at said SPAM-length-info memory. Thus controller, <b>39</b>, processes a value of MMS-L that is different from the value processed in example #1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0409" num="0445">Finally, because the second message of example #2 is longer than the second message of example #1 and the MMS-L of example #2 is greater than the MMS-L of example #1, when said transfer-a-00-header-message instructions control the transfer of the second message of example #2 to signal processor, <b>200</b>, said instructions transfer a longer message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0410" num="0446">In all other respects, controller, <b>39</b> processes and transfers the second message of example #2 just as it processed and transferred the second message of example #1.

Because the information of said meter instruction field instructs signal processor, <b>200</b>, only to perform said incrementing, upon completing the last step of incrementing or comparing, automatically buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>, discards all information of said 2nd meter information (#2) except the incremented record information and commences processing in the conventional fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0435" num="0471">Thus, not only does the second message of example #2cause the combining of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> and the display of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> only at selected subscriber stations that are preprogrammed with decryption key J, it also causes the retaining of meter information associated with its own decryption at said selected stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0436" num="0472">Subsequently, decoder, <b>203</b>, receives the third message of the “Wall Street Week” program which conveys the third combining synch command.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0437" num="0473">In example #2, all signal processing apparatus process the third combining synch command precisely as in the first example. Said command reaches all URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, and causes each to execute the aforementioned “GRAPHICS OFF” command. But only at those selected ones of said URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, that are preprogrammed with decryption key J does the third combining synch command actually cause combining to cease. At all other URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, executing “GRAPHICS OFF” has no effect because each of said other URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, is already in “Graphics Off” mode when said “GRAPHICS OFF” is executed. Because the aforementioned particular ones among said control invoking instructions that preceded the first message of the “Wall Street Week” program caused all URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, to set their PC-MicroKey 1300s to the “Graphics Off” mode and because no information of the second combining synch command reached said other microcomputers, <b>205</b>, and executed “GRAPHICS ON”, the PC-MicroKey 1300 of each of said other URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, is in “Graphics Off” mode when the third message of example #2 is transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0438" num="0474">Thus in example #2, not only does the second combining synch command cause the combining and the display of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> only at selected subscriber stations and the retaining of meter information at (and only at) said stations, it also causes selective processing—for example, the selecting of information of decryption key J at selected stations—that enables the third combining synch command to have effect only at selected stations without any selective processing of said third command. Placing particular so-called “soft switches,” one of which exists at each subscriber station, all into one given original position, “off” or “on”, then transmitting a command that is processed selectively at selected stations and places said switches at said stations into the opposite position, “on” of “off”, makes it possible to transmit a subsequent command that returns said switches at said selected stations (and only said switches) to said original position without any additional selective processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0439" num="0475">Significant advantages of simplicity and speed are achieved by devising signal processing apparatus and methods that minimize the need for selective processing. With regard to said third combining synch command, for example, no step of decrypting is required to affect only those stations that are preprogrammed with decryption key J. Accordingly, no possibility exists that an error in decrypting may occur at one or more of said stations, causing the combining of video RAM information and received video information, at said one or more, not to cease at the proper time and to continue beyond said time (until such time as some subsequent command may execute “GRAPHICS OFF” or clear information from said video RAM at said stations). Because no time is required for decrypting, no possibility exists that some station may take longer (or shorter) than proper to perform decrypting causing the image of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to be displayed at some monitor, <b>202</b>M, longer (or shorter) than proper. Perhaps most important, because no time is required for selective processing of said third command, the time interval that separates the time of embedding said third command at said remote station that originates the “Wall Street Week” program and the time of ceasing caused by said command at URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, can be the shortest possible interval. Making it possible for said time interval to be the shortest possible interval minimizes the chance that an error may occur in the timing of the embedding of said third command at said remote station causing all URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, to cease combining at a time that is other than the proper time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0029" num="0000">The Preferred Configuration of Controller, <b>39</b>, and SPAM-Controller, <b>205</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0440" num="0476">Heretofore, this specification has treated the controller of decoder, <b>203</b>, (which is controller, <b>39</b>) and the SPAM input controller of microcomputer, <b>205</b>, (which is SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C) as separate controllers. This treatment has served to show how SPAM messages are transferred from one controller to another, at any given subscriber station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0441" num="0477">But, in the preferred embodiment, the controller of the decoder that detects the SPAM signals of a combined medium transmission, at any given subscriber station, and the controller that executes the information of said signals at the microcomputer that combines the local and broadcast programming, at said station, are one and the same. More precisely, controller, <b>39</b>, of decoder, <b>203</b>, and SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, are one and the same (and are called, hereinafter, “controller, <b>39</b>”). Thus the preferred embodiment of controller, <b>39</b>, is configured and preprogrammed not only to control the detecting, correcting, converting, and executing of controlled functions at decoder, <b>203</b>, but also to input to and execute at microcomputer, <b>205</b>, the information of any given detected SPAM message that is addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0442" num="0478"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows one such preferred controller, <b>39</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0443" num="0479">One aspect of the preferred embodiment of controller, <b>39</b>, is a series of buffers and processors at which forward error correction, protocol conversion, and the invoking of controlled functions take place in series. Buffer, <b>39</b>A, and processor, <b>39</b>B, are the first buffer and processor of the series and perform the forward error correcting functions of controller, <b>39</b>. Buffer, <b>39</b>C, and processor, <b>39</b>D, are the second buffer and processor and perform protocol conversion functions. Buffer, <b>39</b>E, and control processor, <b>39</b>J, are the third buffer and processor. All controlled functions invoked at controller, <b>39</b>, by received SPAM signals are invoked at control processor, <b>39</b>J.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0444" num="0480">Performing forward error correction and protocol conversion and invoking the controlled functions at a series of processors, in this fashion, rather than sequentially at one processor has significant advantages as regards speed. Inputting the information of each SPAM signal word to three processors does take longer than inputting said information to just one processor. But this is more than offset by the fact that having three processors rather than just one enables controller, <b>39</b>, to process the information of three signal words simultaneously. Control processor, <b>39</b>J, can invoke and process the controlled function of a first signal word while processor, <b>39</b>D, converts the information of a second signal word and processor, <b>39</b>B, corrects the information of a third signal word.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0445" num="0481">A second aspect of the preferred embodiment of controller, <b>39</b>, is a matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, that operates under control of control processor, <b>39</b>J, and can transfer information of received SPAM signals from buffer, <b>39</b>E, directly to addressed apparatus. Transferring said information in this fashion rather than through control processor, <b>39</b>J, has the advantage of freeing control processor, <b>39</b>J, to perform other functions while said information is transferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0446" num="0482">As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows, each processor, <b>39</b>B, <b>39</b>D, and <b>39</b>J, has associated RAM and ROM and, hence, constitutes a programmable controller in its own right. Each processor, <b>39</b>B, <b>39</b>D, and <b>39</b>J, controls its associated buffer, <b>39</b>A, <b>39</b>C, and <b>39</b>E respectively. Each buffer, <b>39</b>A, <b>39</b>C, and <b>39</b>E, is a conventional buffer that receives, buffers, and transfers binary information in fashions well known in the art. Each buffer, <b>39</b>A and <b>39</b>C, transfers its received and buffered information to its associated processor, <b>39</b>B and <b>39</b>D respectively, for processing. Buffer, <b>39</b>E, transfers its received and buffered information, via EOFS Valve, <b>39</b>F, to matrix switch, <b>39</b>I.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0447" num="0483">The preferred embodiment of controller, <b>39</b>, also has a buffer, <b>39</b>G, that is a conventional buffer with means for receiving information from other inputs external to decoder, <b>203</b>. Among said inputs is, in particular, an input from controller, <b>12</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b> (which input performs the functions of the input from controller, <b>12</b>, to SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Buffer, <b>39</b>G, outputs its received and buffered information, via EOFS Valve, <b>39</b>H, to matrix switch, <b>39</b>I. Buffer, <b>39</b>G, is configured, in a fashion well known in the art, with capacity to identify to control processor, <b>39</b>J, which input is the source of any given instance of information received and buffered at buffer, <b>39</b>G, and capacity to output selectively, under control of control processor, <b>39</b>J, any given instance of received information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0448" num="0484">EOFS Valves, <b>39</b>F and <b>39</b>H, are EOFS valves of the type described above and transfer the buffered information of buffers, <b>39</b>E and <b>39</b>G respectively, to matrix switch, <b>39</b>I. Said valves operate under control of control processor, <b>39</b>J, and monitor all information, so transferred, continuously for end of file signals in the fashion described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0449" num="0485">Matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, is a conventional digital matrix switch, well known in the art of telephone communication switching, that is configured for the small number of inputs and outputs required at controller, <b>39</b>.

Among such other outputs is one or more (hereinafter called, “null outputs”) with capacity for accepting binary information and merely recording said information at particular memory associated with matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, thereby overwriting and obliterating information previously recorded at said memory. The purpose of such a null output is to provide means whereby said switch can automatically cause information of any selected SPAM message to be discarded rather than transferred to addressed apparatus. (Other examples of other outputs are cited below.) Matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, also has capacity to receive control information from control processor, <b>39</b>J, and transfer said information to the CPU and/or the PC-MicroKey 1300 system of microcomputer, <b>205</b>, and to receive control information from the CPU and/or the PC-MicroKey 1300 system of microcomputer, <b>205</b>, and transfer said information to control processor, <b>39</b>J. Matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, transfers information in such a way that information inputted at any given input is transferred to a selected one or ones of said outputs without modification, and a multiplicity of information transfers can take place simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0450" num="0486">Control processor, <b>39</b>J, has capacity for computing information and processing all control information necessary for controlling all apparatus of decoder, <b>203</b> (or such other decoder as the controller of a given control processor, <b>39</b>J, may be installed in).

The register memories of control processor, <b>39</b>J, include (but are not limited to) particular SPAM-input-signal register memory whose length in bit locations is sufficient to contain the longest possible instance of SPAM command information with associated padding bits; the aforementioned SPAM-header and SPAM-exec register memories; particular SPAM-Flag-monitor-info, SPAM-Flag-at-secondary-control-level, SPAM-Flag-executing-secondary-command, SPAM-Flag-secondary-level-incomplete, SPAM-Flag-primary-level-2nd-step-incomplete, SPAM-Flag-primary-level-3rd-step-incomplete, SPAM-Flag-secondary-level-2nd-step-incomplete, SPAM-Flag-secondary-level-3rd-step-incomplete, SPAM-Flag-first-condition-failed, SPAM-Flag-second-condition-failed, SPAM-Flag-do-not-meter, and SPAM-Flag-working register memories each of which are one bit location in length; the aforementioned SPAM-length-info, SPAM-mm-format, SPAM-first-precondition, SPAM-second-precondition, SPAM-last-01-header-exec register memories; particular SPAM-decryption-mark, SPAM-primary-input-source, SPAM-secondary-input-source, SPAM-next-primary-instruction-address, SPAM-next-secondary-instruction-address, SPAM-executing-secondary-command, SPAM-last-secondary-01-header-exec, SPAM-address-of-next-instruction-upon-primary-interrupt, and SPAM-address-of-next-instruction-upon-secondary-interrupt register memories whose functions are described below; and a plurality of working register memories that include first-working and second-working register memories.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0454" num="0490">Examples #3 and #4 of the combining of the “Wall Street Week” program described above, which relate elaborations of examples #1 and #2, illustrate in detail the operation of the preferred embodiment of controller, <b>39</b>.</div>
<heading id="h-0030">Operating S. P. Systems</heading>
<heading id="h-0031">Example #3</heading>
<heading id="h-0032">First Word</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0455" num="0491">Example #3 differs from example #1 in just two respects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0456" num="0492">First, example #3 focuses on selected subscriber stations where signal processing apparatus and methods are used to collect monitor information for so-called “program ratings” (such as so-called “Nielsen ratings”) that estimate the sizes of television (or radio) program audiences. In the present invention, subscriber stations can be preprogrammed to process and record monitor information of SPAM commands and transfer said information to one or more remote data collection stations where computers process the monitor information to generate such ratings. In example #3, all apparatus of the subscriber station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are so preprogrammed, and buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>, operates, in fashions described more fully below, under control of the aforementioned on-board controller, <b>14</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0457" num="0493">Second, the controller, <b>39</b>, of example #3 is the preferred embodiment of controller, <b>39</b>, and replaces the controller, <b>39</b>, and SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, of example #1. Insofar as messages addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, are concerned, the preferred embodiment of controller, <b>39</b>, is preprogrammed to perform the controlled functions of the SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, of example #1. Thus the preprogrammed information at the RAM and/or ROM associated with control processor, <b>39</b>J, includes, for example, the execute-at-205, execute-conditional-overlay-at-205, and cease-overlay information and the load-run-and-code, conditional-overlay-at-205, and cease-overlaying-at-205 instructions preprogrammed at SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, in example #1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0458" num="0494">In all other respects example #3 is identical to example #1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0459" num="0495">Example #3 begins, like example #1, with divider, <b>4</b>, transferring the embedded information of the first message to decoder, <b>203</b>. In the same fashion that applied in example #1, receiving said embedded information at decoder, <b>203</b>, causes the binary information of said first message to be received, with error correcting information, at decoder, <b>203</b>, and detected at digital detector, <b>34</b>. Detector, <b>34</b>, inputs the detected information to controller, <b>39</b>, at buffer, <b>39</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0460" num="0496">The first step of processing at controller, <b>39</b>, takes place at processor, <b>39</b>B, where error correction occurs. As said detected information is inputted, buffer, <b>39</b>A, receives, buffers, and transfers said information, signal word by signal word, an to processor, <b>39</b>B, in a fashion well in the art. Processor, <b>39</b>B, receives each word, in turn, with its associated error correcting information and uses the error correcting information, in its forward error correcting fashion, to check the binary information of said word and correct the information of said word, as required, then transfers the correct information of said word to buffer, <b>39</b>C, and discards said error correcting information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0461" num="0497">The second step of processing is protocol conversion and takes place at processor, <b>39</b>D. Buffer, <b>39</b>C, receives and buffers the corrected information of each word, in turn, and transfers said information to processor, <b>39</b>D. As processor, <b>39</b>D, receives said information, in its protocol conversion fashion, processor, <b>39</b>B, converts the corrected binary information of each word into converted information that all appropriate subscriber station apparatus can receive and process and transfers the converted information of each word to buffer, <b>39</b>E.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0462" num="0498">As buffer, <b>39</b>E, receives the corrected information of each word, buffer, <b>39</b>E, buffers and transfers said information to EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F, as quickly as said valve, <b>39</b>F, is prepared to receive said information. EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F, processes said information, in its end of file signal detecting fashion described above, to detect information of an end of file signal and outputs said information to matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, as quickly as the apparatus to which said switch, <b>39</b>I, transfers said information is prepared to receive said information. As matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, receives the converted information of each word, said switch, <b>39</b>I, transfers said information to a selected output port of said switch, <b>39</b>I. Said selected port is the particular port to which control processor, <b>39</b>J, causes said switch, <b>39</b>I, to transfer said information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0463" num="0499">At the outset of example #3, matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, is configured to input the output of EOFS Valve, <b>39</b>F, to control processor, <b>39</b>J, and control processor, <b>39</b>J, awaits header information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0464" num="0500">When EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F, commences transferring the SPAM information of the first message of example #3, control processor, <b>39</b>J, executes a first step of receiving SPAM message information and receives the header information in said first message. Control processor, <b>39</b>J, accepts, receives in turn, and records in sequence at particular SPAM-input-signal register memory a particular first quantity of said words. Said first quantity is the smallest number of signal words that can contain one instance of header information (that is, H bits). In the simplest preferred embodiment where a SPAM header is two bits long and signal words are eight-bit bytes, said first quantity is one. Then, automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, ceases accepting SPAM signal information transferred from EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F, and said valve, <b>39</b>F, commences holding the next processed signal word of said first message until control processor, <b>39</b>J, becomes prepared, once again, to accept and receive SPAM signal information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0465" num="0501">Then control processor, <b>39</b>J, processes said header information. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, selects information of the first H bits at said SPAM-input-signal memory and records said information of H bits at said SPAM-header memory then compares the information at said SPAM-header memory to the aforementioned 11-header-invoking information that is “11”. No match results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0466" num="0502">Because control processor, <b>39</b>J, and the RAM and ROM associated with said processor, <b>39</b>J, are preprogrammed to process the monitor information of SPAM commands to provide viewership data for remote computer processing, not resulting in a match with said 11-header-invoking information causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, to execute particular preprogrammed evaluate-message-content instructions before receiving and processing the execution segment information in said first message. Automatically, said instructions cause control processor, <b>39</b>J, to compare the information at said SPAM-header memory with preprogrammed invoke-monitor-processing information. A match results with particular “01” information. Said match signifies the presence of meter-monitor information in said first message and causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, to enter “0” at particular SPAM-Flag-monitor-info register memory that is normally “1”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0467" num="0503">Then automatically control processor, <b>39</b>J, executes a second step of receiving SPAM signal information and receives the execution segment information in said first message. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, commences accepting and EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F, commences transferring additional SPAM signal words. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, receives and records said words in sequence at said SPAM-input-signal memory immediately following the last of said first quantity of signal words until the total quantity of SPAM signal words recorded at said memory equals a particular second quantity. Said second quantity is the smallest number of signal words that can contain one instance of header and execution segment information (that is, H+X bits). (If H+X bits can be contained in one signal word, said second quantity equals said first quantity, and control processor, <b>39</b>J, records no additional SPAM signal words in the course of said second step of receiving SPAM signal information.) Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, ceases accepting SPAM signal information transferred from EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0468" num="0504">Then control processor, <b>39</b>J, processes said execution segment information. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, selects information of the first X bits of information at said SPAM-input-signal memory immediately after the first H bits, records said information of X bits at said SPAM-exec memory, and compares the information at said SPAM-exec memory with controlled-function-invoking information that is preprogrammed at the RAM and/or ROM associated with said processor, <b>39</b>J. A match results with the aforementioned execute-at-205 information that is identical to the execute-at-205 information preprogrammed at SPAM-controller, <b>205</b>C, of example #1. Said match causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, to execute the aforementioned load-run-and-code instructions.

Said monitor information also provides statistics on those particular subscriber stations that tune to and process the programming of said “Wall Street Week” program but cannot display <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> combined medium image information because said particular stations are preprogrammed with decryption key information of J but not of Z. Such statistics enable programming suppliers to evaluate their strategies for marketing and pricing programming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0528" num="0564">In example #4, before the first message is embedded at the “Wall Street Week” program originating studio and transmitted, all information of the execution segment, the meter-monitor segment, and the program instruction set in the information segment are encrypted, using standard encryption techniques that encrypt binary information without altering the number of bits in said information. However, the cadence information of said message remains unencrypted. More precisely, the “01” header, any padding bits added at the end of the information segment, and the end of file signal that ends said message remain unencrypted. (The length token and any padding bits at the end of the command information in a message that ends with an end of file signal are not, strictly speaking, cadence information because they provide no information as to the location of the header that follows such a message.) Like the second message of example #2, the first message of example #4 is only partially encrypted in order to enable subscriber stations that lack capacity to decrypt said message to process accurately the cadence information of said message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0529" num="0565">In example #4, the encryption of the execution segment of said first message is done in such a fashion that, after encryption, said segment is identical to a particular execution segment that addresses URS signal processors, <b>200</b>, and instructs said processors, <b>200</b>, to use a particular decryption key Z (different from the decryption key J that decrypted the second message of example #2) and decrypt the message in which said segment occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0530" num="0566">Because said first message is encrypted, its meter-monitor segment contains a seventh field: a meter instruction field. Accordingly, the length of said first message, the number of bits in its meter-monitor segment, the information of the meter-monitor format field, and the numeric value of MMS-L is greater in example #4 than in example #1 and example #3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0531" num="0567">As described above in “One Combined Medium,” before any messages of the “Wall Street Week” programming are transmitted, control invoking instructions are embedded at said program originating studio and transmitted to all subscriber stations.

In addition (and not described in “One Combined Medium”), said instructions also include particular instructions that cause information of zero to be placed at the aforementioned SPAM-first-precondition and SPAM-second-precondition register memories. Accordingly, at the outset of example #4, no PC-MicroKey 1300 is in “Graphics On” mode; no microcomputer, <b>205</b>, contains any image information at video RAM; and no “program unit identification code” information exists at the SPAM-first-precondition register memory of any control processor, <b>39</b>J.</div>

<heading id="h-0046">Third Message</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0628" num="0664">Subsequently, the embedded information of the third message of the “Wall Street Week” program is inputted to decoder, <b>203</b>. Said information is identical to the embedded information of the third message of examples #1, #2, and #3 and causes the same processing at decoder, <b>203</b>, that the information of the third message of example #3 caused. The information of the third message of example #4 causes “GRAPHICS OFF” to be executed at the PC-MicroKey System of the microcomputers, <b>205</b>, of all subscriber stations tuned to the “Wall Street Week” transmission. But like the third message of example #2, the third message of example #4 causes combining actually to cease only each selected one of said stations where information of the second message previously caused combining to commence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0629" num="0665">However, example #4 does differ from example #2. In example #2, the second message causes combining to commence at every selected station where the information of said second message is decrypted; that is, every station preprogrammed with information of decryption key J. But the second message of example #4 causes combining to commence only at those selected stations where information not only of said second message is decrypted but also where information of the first message of example #4 had been decrypted; that is, only at those stations preprogrammed not only with information of decryption key J but also information of decryption key Z.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0630" num="0666">Thus example #4 illustrates a case where not only does selective processing of the second message enable the third message to have effect only at selected stations without any selective processing of said third message, the selective processing of the first message enables the third message to have effect only at an even more selective group of stations than would otherwise be the case. Placing the PC-MicroKey Systems of all stations into the “Graphics Off” mode prior to transmitting the first message of example #4 enables the third message of example #4 in the simplest possible fashion to cause combining to cease only at those stations that are preprogrammed with decryption key information not only of J but also of Z, with all the benefits outlined at the end of example #2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0631" num="0667">Placing particular so-called “soft switches,” one of which exists at each subscriber station, all into one given original position, “off” or “on”, then transmitting a command that is processed selectively at selected stations and places said switches at said stations into the opposite position, “on” of “off”, makes it possible to transmit a subsequent command that returns said switches at said selected stations (and only said switches) to said original position without any additional selective processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0632" num="0668">Significant advantages of simplicity and speed are achieved by devising signal processing apparatus and methods that minimize the need for selective processing. With regard to said third combining synch command, for example, no step of decrypting is required to affect only those stations that are preprogrammed with decryption key J. Accordingly, no possibility exists that an error in decrypting may occur at one or more of said stations, causing the combining of video RAM information and received video information, at said one or more, not to cease at the proper time and to continue beyond said time (until such time as some subsequent command may execute “GRAPHICS OFF” or clear information from said video RAM at said stations). Because no time is required for decrypting, no possibility exists that some station may take longer (or shorter) than proper to perform decrypting causing the image of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to be displayed at some monitor, <b>202</b>M, longer (or shorter) than proper. Perhaps most important, because no time is required for selective processing of said third command, the time interval that separates the time of embedding said third command at said remote station that originates the “Wall Street Week” program and the time of ceasing caused by said command at URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, can be the shortest possible interval. Making it possible for said time interval to be the shortest possible interval minimizes the chance that an error may occur in the timing of the embedding of said third command at said remote station causing all URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, to cease combining at a time that is other than the proper time.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0633" num="0669">Example #5 focuses on program unit identification signals detected at decoders, <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0634" num="0670">Signal processor, <b>200</b>, is preprogrammed with information that identifies each cable and over-the-air (hereinafter, “wireless”) transmission or frequency in the locality of the subscriber station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as well as the standard broadcast and cablecast practices that apply on said transmissions and frequencies. Via a conventional multi-channel cable transmission, in a fashion well known in the art, four channels of conventional television programming and two conventional FM radio signals are inputted to a first alternate contact of switch, <b>1</b>, and to mixer, <b>2</b>. Said television channels are transmitted normally assigned to channels 2, 4, 7, and 13 of the television frequency spectrum. Said radio signals are transmitted on 99.0 MHz and 100.0 MHz of the FM frequency spectrum. Via a conventional television receiving antenna, three conventional wireless television transmissions are inputted to the second alternate contact of switch, <b>1</b>. Said wireless transmissions are on the frequencies of the television spectrum normally assigned to channels 5, 9, and 13. In a predetermined fashion, controller, <b>20</b>, controls oscillator, <b>6</b>, to sequence local oscillator, <b>6</b>, in the pattern: cable channel 2, cable channel 4, cable channel 7, cable channel 13, wireless channel 5, wireless channel 9, wireless channel 13, then to repeat said pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0635" num="0671">In example #5, the “Wall Street Week” combining synch commands are transmitted unencrypted as in the first example, and the “Wall Street Week” program is transmitted on the frequency of channel 13 by a wireless broadcast station whose transmission is retransmitted on the frequency of channel 13 on said cable. Thus a viewer can tune to the “Wall Street Week” program on either wireless channel 13 or cable channel 13. Simultaneously, different programs are transmitted on each of the other television and radio transmissions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0636" num="0672">Controller, <b>20</b>, has preprogrammed the RAM associated with the control processor, <b>39</b>J, of the controller, <b>39</b>, of decoder, <b>30</b>, with bit information of a channel mark associated with each transmission of television programming received at decoder, <b>30</b>. (While wireless channel 13 and cable channel 13 may transmit the same programming, they have different channel marks.) At said RAM, said control processor, <b>39</b>J, maintains, associated with appropriate channel mark information, monitor information records of the last command containing meter-monitor program identification information inputted via each channel transmission. Said records include program unit identification information. At the outset of the example, no transmission of “Wall Street Week” program unit identification information has yet occurred, and the program unit information associated with the source mark of wireless channel 13 and, separately, with the source mark of cable channel 13 is the unit information of the television programming transmitted immediately before the start of the “Wall Street Week” transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0637" num="0673">At the outset of example #5, the contact lever of switch, <b>1</b>, is connected to said first alternate contact of switch, <b>1</b>, to which is inputted the full spectrum of frequencies transmitted on said cable, and mixer, <b>3</b>, is set to select the frequency of channel 13. Thus transmissions on cable channel 13 are inputted to decoder, <b>30</b>. Furthermore, the EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F, of controller, <b>39</b>, of decoder, <b>30</b>, has identified an end of file signal embedded in the inputted channel 13 transmission and is set to receive transfer SPAM message information; the matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, of said controller, <b>39</b>, is set to transfer SPAM message information from said EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F, to said control processor, <b>39</b>J; and said control processor, <b>39</b>J is set to receive and process header information of a SPAM message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0638" num="0674">Example #5 begins with the embedding and transmitting, at the remote station that originates the “Wall Street Week” broadcast, of the first message of the “Wall Street Week” program which is the message of the first combining synch command. The transmission of said broadcast is received at the remote cable transmission station that transmits the multi-channel cable transmission inputted to signal processor, <b>200</b>; combined into the full spectrum cable transmission on the frequency of channel 13; and retransmitted. Said cable transmission is inputted via said first alternate contact of switch, <b>1</b>, and said contact lever to mixer, <b>3</b>. Mixer, <b>3</b>, selects the frequency of channel 13 and inputs said frequency of interest, at a fixed frequency, to TV signal decoder, <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0639" num="0675">Receiving said frequency of interest causes decoder, <b>30</b>, (which is shown in greater detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and whose controller, <b>39</b>, is shown in greater detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) to receive and process the command information of said first message. The inputted frequency of channel 13 is inputted, first, to filter, <b>31</b>, which filters said input and outputs the one TV channel signal of channel 13 to amplitude demodulator, <b>32</b>. Demodulator, <b>32</b>, demodulates said inputted channel signal using standard demodulator techniques and transfers the demodulated channel signal of said channel 13 to digital detector, <b>38</b>; line receiver, <b>33</b>; and audio demodulator, <b>35</b>. Thereafter, the embedded information of the first combining synch command is caused to be recorded at the SPAM-input-signal register memory of the control processor, <b>39</b>J, of said decoder, <b>30</b>, in the same fashion that the embedded information of said message is detected and recorded at decoder, <b>203</b>, in example #3. Receiving said embedded information causes the binary SPAM information of said first command, with error correcting information, to be detected at detector, <b>34</b>; checked and corrected, as necessary, at processor, <b>39</b>B; converted into locally usable binary information at processor, <b>39</b>D; and recorded at the SPAM-input-signal memory of said control processor, <b>39</b>J. The control apparatus of decoder, <b>30</b>, is preprogrammed to process said information as monitor information and local control information. (Hereinafter, said first command may be called the 1st command (#5).) Receiving said first command causes the preprogrammed instructions at the RAM and ROM associated with control processor, <b>39</b>J, to cause control processor, <b>39</b>J, to process the information of said command in the following fashion. In a predetermined fashion, control processor, <b>39</b>J, locates the monitor information that it retains in said RAM associated with the channel mark of cable channel 13 and compares the “program unit identification code” of said first command with the program unit information of said monitor information in RAM. No match results which indicates cable channel 13 is transmitting a new program unit. Not resulting in a match causes said controller, <b>39</b>, automatically to transfer information of new programming to microcomputer, <b>205</b>, and to transfer to buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>, for further processing said monitor information in RAM which is monitor information of the programming transmitted on cable channel 13 prior to the “Wall Street Week” program. Automatically, said control processor, <b>39</b>J, causes matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, to cease transferring information from said EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F, to control processor, <b>39</b>J, and commence transferring information from control processor, <b>39</b>J, to buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, (to which said matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, has capacity to transfer information). Automatically said control processor, <b>39</b>J, transmits a message that consists of binary information of a “00” header (indicating a command with execution and meter-monitor segments) then the execution segment information of the pseudo command then a meter-monitor segment containing said monitor information in RAM (including the associated channel mark and the format information of said information) then any padding bits required to end said message. (Hereinafter, said message whose transmission is caused by receiving said first command is called the “1st-old-program-command (#5).”) Then, in a predetermined fashion, control processor, <b>39</b>J, determines that said first command contains subject matter meter-monitor information causing said control processor, <b>39</b>J, to transmit a message that consists of binary information of a “00” header then particular execution segment information that is addressed to microcomputer, <b>205</b>, (and that causes microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to process the information of the meter-monitor segment immediately following said execution segment information as new programming now being transmitted on the channel of the channel mark of said meter-monitor segment segment) then meter-monitor segment information that includes the “program unit identification code” and subject matter information of said first command and the channel mark of cable channel 13 as well as appropriate meter-monitor format information then any padding bits required to end said message. (Said message whose transmission is caused by receiving said first command enables microcomputer, <b>205</b>, in a fashion described more fully below, to tune automatically to receive the program that said “program unit identification code” identifies if said program is of interest, and said message is called, hereinafter, the “1st-new-program-message (#5)”.) Then said control processor, <b>39</b>J, deletes from said RAM all information of said monitor information in RAM except the information of said channel mark and records at said RAM, associated with said channel mark, the meter-monitor segment information of the information at said SPAM-input-signal memory, which is said first command, but replaces the meter-monitor format information that is recorded with new format information that reflects the addition of a channel mark. Finally, controller, <b>39</b>J, transmits particular detection-complete information to controller, <b>20</b>; causes all apparatus of decoder, <b>30</b>, except said RAM to cease receiving SPAM message information and delete all information received on said frequency of interest (that is, cable channel 13); and causes said matrix switch, <b>39</b>I, to cease transferring information from said control processor, <b>39</b>J, to said buffer/comparator, <b>8</b>, and commence transferring SPAM message information from EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F, to its null output.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0683" num="0719">In each example, when the automatic processing caused by the received SPAM signal information reaches the point at which recorder, <b>16</b>, finishes recording the first signal record information transferred from buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>, recorder, <b>16</b>, measures the quantity of its recording capacity that holds signal records, in a predetermined fashion, and determines that said quantity is equal to or greater than said particular fullness information. Said determining causes recorder, <b>16</b>, to transfer a particular instruct-to-call instruction to controller, <b>20</b>, that causes controller, <b>20</b>, to activate telephone connection, <b>22</b>, and proceed with a particular preprogrammed telephone signal record transfer sequence that is fully automatic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0684" num="0720">The first stage of said sequence involves transferring audit information to a particular first host computer at a first remote station. Controller, <b>20</b>, transfers the telephone number, 1-800-AUDITOR, to auto dialer, <b>24</b>, and causes said dialer, <b>24</b>, to dial said number. Said first computer answers said telephone call, and in a fashion well known in the art, controller, <b>20</b>, and said first computer automatically establish telephone communications. Automatically, controller, <b>20</b>, causes telephone connection. <b>22</b>, to transfer particular identifying information that includes the unique digital identifying code of ROM, <b>21</b>, to said first computer followed by a particular instruct-to-receive signal. Said instruct-to-receive signal causes said first computer automatically to prepare to receive audit records then to transfer a particular start signal via connection, <b>22</b>, to controller, <b>20</b>. Receiving said start signal, sent automatically in response to controller, <b>20</b>'s, instruct-to-receive signal, causes controller, <b>20</b>, to cause recorder, <b>16</b>, to transmit all recorded meter audit records and particular other audit information to telephone connection, <b>22</b>, which causes said connection, <b>22</b>, to transmit said records and information to said first computer. When recorder, <b>20</b>, transmits the last bit of said record and other information, recorder, <b>20</b>, transmits particular finished-with-first-stage information to controller, <b>20</b>, which causes controller, <b>20</b>, to transmit a particular acknowledge receipt instruction to said first computer. Automatically said first computer determines, in a predetermined fashion, that the audit information has been received correctly and completely, and said determining causes said first computer automatically to transmit a particular transmission complete signal to controller, <b>20</b>. Receiving said complete signal causes controller, <b>20</b>, to cause telephone connection, <b>22</b>, to terminate said telephone call. Then controller, <b>20</b>, transfers information to recorder, <b>16</b>, that causes recorder, <b>16</b>, to erase from memory all said record and other information that is not also meter charge information or monitor information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0685" num="0721">Having completed the first stage, controller, <b>20</b>, then commences automatically the second stage of said sequence which involves transferring meter charge information to a particular second host computer at a second remote station. Controller, <b>20</b>, transfers the telephone number, 1-800-CHARGES, to auto dialer, <b>24</b>, and causes the dialing of said number. But said number is busy. Telephone connection, <b>22</b>, receives a telephone busy signal, well known in the art, and transfers information of said signal to controller, <b>20</b>. Receiving said information causes controller, <b>20</b>, to execute a preprogrammed redial sequence. Thereafter, whenever controller, <b>20</b>, polls its input sources for input signal information in a polling fashion well known in the art, it causes dialer, <b>24</b>, regularly to redial said number. Controller, <b>20</b>, continues said redialing until said second computer answers said call.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0686" num="0722">Said redial sequence does not prevent controller, <b>20</b>, from proceeding with other processing tasks; it merely defers execution of the remaining preprogrammed instructions of the second stage. When said second computer answers said call, controller, <b>20</b>, will automatically execute said remaining instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0687" num="0723">Having deferred further execution of the second stage, controller, <b>20</b>, proceeds to the third stage which involves transferring monitor information to a particular third host computer at a third remote station. Controller, <b>20</b>, causes the dialing of the telephone number, 1-800-MONITOR, and establishes telephone communications with said third computer. Automatically, controller, <b>20</b>, causes the transfer to said third computer of particular identifying information and a particular instruct-to-receive signal causing said third computer to determine that it is not prepared to receive information and to respond with a particular call-back signal. Said call-back signal instructs controller, <b>20</b>, to defer further execution of the third stage until a particular deferred time—the first waiting moment after 1:00 AM the following morning—and causes controller, <b>20</b>, to execute a preprogrammed time-check-and-determining sequence. Under control of said sequence, as a regular step in the sequence of the aforementioned polling fashion, controller, <b>20</b>, checks the time of clock, <b>18</b>, and determines whether said clock time is after said deferred time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0688" num="0724">Having deferred further execution of the third stage, controller, <b>20</b>, proceeds with other processing. The third stage is the final stage of said automatic telephone signal record transfer sequence. Accordingly, controller, <b>20</b>, starts polling for instructions and commences regularly executing said redial and said time-check-and-determining sequences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0689" num="0725">Subsequently, in the course of executing said redial instructions, controller, <b>20</b>, and said second computer establish telephone communications in the fashion described in the first stage above. Controller, <b>20</b>, then causes the transfer to said second computer of particular identifying information followed by a particular instruct-to-receive signal causing said second computer to respond with a particular start signal that causes controller, <b>20</b>, to cause the transmitting of all recorded meter charge records to said second computer. When recorder, <b>20</b>, finishes transmitting meter charge information, controller, <b>20</b>, transmits a particular acknowledge receipt instruction to said second computer. Automatically said second computer responds with a particular transmission complete signal that causes controller, <b>20</b>, to terminate said telephone call then to cause recorder, <b>16</b>, to erase from memory all said meter charge information. Then, in a preprogrammed fashion, controller, <b>20</b>, deactivates the redial sequence instruction portion of said polling sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0690" num="0726">So completing the second stage causes controller, <b>20</b>, once again to commence polling for instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0691" num="0727">Subsequently, controller, <b>20</b>, determines that said clock time is after said deferred time which causes controller, <b>20</b>, automatically to deactivate said time-check-and-determining sequence and recommence said third stage. Automatically, controller, <b>20</b>, reestablishes telephone communications with said third computer and causes said third computer to transfer to controller, <b>20</b>, its particular start signal. Then controller, <b>20</b>, causes the transmitting of all recorded monitor records to said third computer. When said transmitting is finished, controller, <b>20</b>, transmits a particular acknowledge receipt instruction to said third computer. Automatically said third computer responds with a particular transmission complete signal that causes controller, <b>20</b>, to terminate said telephone call then to cause recorder, <b>16</b>, to erase from memory all said monitor record information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0692" num="0728">Completing the final deferred instructions of said automatic telephone signal record transfer sequence causes controller, <b>20</b>, to end said sequence and commence processing in the conventional fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0693" num="0729">In examples #3 and #4 (and #5 if information of said 1st-new-program-message (#5) reaches buffer/comparator, <b>14</b>, before any other instance of monitor information), receiving the first message of the “Wall Street Week” program causes the apparatus of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> subscriber station to carry out said signal record transfer sequence. Simultaneously, other stations have reached a similar level of fullness, and said command causes said other stations also to execute said transfer sequence. Accordingly, not only does transmitting said first message cause all the functions described above in example #3 and #4 (and #5), transmitting said message also causes apparatus at one and more subscriber stations to transfer recorded information selectively to one and more remote stations at the time of execution and at deferred times, causes computers at said stations to process said information, and causes said computers to transfer information, point-to-point, to said subscriber station apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0694" num="0730">Examples #3, #4, and #5 do not show the second message of the “Wall Street Week” program causing information to be recorded at the recorder, <b>16</b>, of the subscriber station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Accordingly, said message does not cause apparatus of said station to transfer of record information to one or more remote station computers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0695" num="0731">Nevertheless, it is clear from the above exposition that the transmission of any SPAM command (including the pseudo command) that includes meter-monitor information can cause monitor record information to be recorded at the recorder, <b>16</b>, of selected stations and can cause signal processors, <b>200</b>, at selected ones of said stations (that is, at stations where recorders, <b>16</b>, equal or exceed particular fullness information) to transfer meter and/or monitor record information selectively to one or more remote stations and cause computers at said stations to process the information in the fashions described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0696" num="0732">(Indeed, as the above exposition makes clear, the impact of the transmission of SPAM information can be yet more complex and meaningful. In example #4, receiving the second message does cause selected stations to record monitor record information the recorders, <b>16</b>, of said stations. Said stations are those stations that are preprogrammed to collect monitor information at which the first message is not decrypted but the second message is; at which, as a consequence, program unit identification information does not exist at SPAM-first-precondition memories and, hence, where <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> combinings fail to occur because the first precondition is not satisfied; and at which, as a consequence, receiving said second messages causes a 2nd monitor information (#4) transmission and causes processing of said 2nd monitor information (#4) at buffer/comparators, <b>14</b>. At said stations, because no monitor information of the first “Wall Street Week” program message was previously processed—because none was decrypted—monitor record information of prior programming still exists at said buffer/comparators, <b>14</b>, when said 2nd monitor information (#4) is received at said buffer/comparators, <b>14</b>. At selected ones of said stations which ones where recorders, <b>16</b>, will equal or exceed particular fullness information when the next instance of record information is recorded, receiving said second message causes the recording of said monitor record information of prior programming, causes the transferring of meter and/or monitor record information selectively to one or more remote stations, and causes computers at said stations to process the information in the fashions described herein.)</div>
<heading id="h-0050">Regulating the Reception and Use of Programming</heading>
<heading id="h-0051">Including Example #6</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0697" num="0733">Examples #2 and #4, above, illustrate methods of controlling encryption and decryption means, well known in the art, within signal processing systems to regulate (and meter) the reception and use of control instructions that generate combined medium overlay information and cause combinings to commence and cease at selected stations. Said means and methods involve the operation of preprogrammed cipher keys (such as keys J and Z) and cipher algorithms to decrypt transmitted information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0698" num="0734">The present invention includes other apparatus and methods for regulating the reception and use of combined medium control instructions, and the apparatus and methods of the present invention that are used to control (and meter) combined medium communication can also regulate the reception and use of prior art electronic programming transmissions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0699" num="0735">In the prior art, various means and methods exist for regulating the reception and use of electronically transmitted programming. Various scrambling means are well known in the art for scrambling, usually the video portion of analogue television transmissions in such a fashion that only subscriber stations with appropriate descrambling means have capacity to tune suitably to the television transmissions and display the transmitted television image information. Encryption/decryption means and methods, well known in the art, can regulate the reception and use of, for example, digital video and audio television transmissions, digital audio radio and phonograph transmissions, digital broadcast print transmission, and digital data communications. Other techniques, well known in the art, involve controlling interrupt means that may be as simple as on/off switches to interrupt or disconnect programming transmissions at stations that lack authorizing information or are determined in other fashions not to be duly authorized. Still other techniques, also well known in the art, involve controlling jamming means that spoil transmitted programming at stations that lack authorizing information or are determined not to be duly authorized, thereby degrading the usefulness of said programming. Such other techniques include, for example, inserting so-called “noise” into the transmitted programming which noise may be, for example, overlays of one or more separate transmissions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0700" num="0736">The means and methods of the present invention for regulating reception and use of programming relate, in particular, to three features of the present invention. The computer system of the present invention has capacity at each subscriber station to compute station specific information based on preprogrammed information that exists at each station and that differs from station to station. Given this capacity, any central control station of the present invention that originates a SPAM transmission can cause subscriber station apparatus to decrypt received SPAM information in different fashions with each station decrypting its received information is its own station specific fashion. A central station can cause different stations to compute different station specific decryption cipher keys and/or algorithms to use in any given step of decryption or to compute station specific key and/or algorithm identification information that differs from station to station and controls each station in identifying the key and/or algorithm to use for any given step of decrypting. A second feature of the present invention is that effective SPAM processing depends on the correspondence between the transmitted SPAM information that causes processing at the subscriber stations and the information preprogrammed at the various stations that controls the SPAM processing at each station. In order for any given SPAM execution segment to invoke any given controlled function at any given station, the received binary information of said segment (for example, “010011”) must match preprogrammed controlled-function-invoking information (“010011”) at each station. This feature permits each station to be preprogrammed with station specific controlled-function-invoking information that differs from station to station (which means that no single SPAM execution segment could invoke a given function at all stations without first being processed at selected stations to render its information to correspond to the station specific preprogrammed invoking information of said stations). The third feature of the present invention is an extended system of means and methods for regulating the reception and use of SPAM information—including decryption key and algorithm information—that is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and discussed more fully below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0701" num="0737">By themselves, the first and second features provide a technique whereby a message such as the second message of the “Wall Street Week” program can take affect at only selected stations (such as those stations preprogrammed with decryption key J) without being decrypted at said stations. (Hereinafter, this technique is called “covert control.”)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0702" num="0738">An example #6, that focuses on the second message of the “Wall Street Week” program and is set within the context of example #4, illustrates the operation of covert control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0703" num="0739">In examples #1, #2, #3, and #4, the information of the execution segment of said second message, when unencrypted, is identical from example to example. For example, if said information is “100110” in example #1, it is “100110” in example #3 and, after decryption, in examples #2 and #4. And the preprogrammed execute-conditional-overlay-at-205 information that said information of the execution segment matches when compared with controlled-function-invoking information is also “100110”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0704" num="0740">But in example #6 the information of the execution segment of said second message is different; for example, said information is “111111”. And the particular binary number that is selected—“111111” in the particular example—is selected because no subscriber station is preprogrammed, at the outset of the example, with any controlled-function-invoking information that is “111111”. (In other words, were said “111111” information of the execution segment transmitted without any other action taking place first, transmitting said information would cause no controlled function to be executed at any subscriber station because said information would not match any controller-function-invoking information at any station.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0705" num="0741">In example #6, two particular messages are transmitted each of which consists of a “01” header; execution, meter-monitor, and information segments; and an end of file signal. (Hereinafter, said messages are called the “1st supplementary message (#6)” and the “2nd supplementary message (#6)”.) In each message, the information of said segments is encrypted prior to transmission in the same fashion that the information of the first message of example #4 is encrypted, except that the encryption is done with key J rather than key Z and the encrypted information of the execution segment instructs subscriber stations to decrypt with key J.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0706" num="0742">The “Wall Street Week” program originating studio embeds and transmits the 1st supplementary message (#6) before transmitting said second message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0707" num="0743">Just as is the case with the first message of example #4, at the subscriber station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (and at other stations that are preprogrammed with decryption key J), receiving the 1st supplementary message (#6) causes the apparatus of said station to decrypt said message (using key J) and execute any controlled functions that are invoked by the unencrypted execution segment of said message. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, causes decryptor, <b>39</b>K, to receive the information of said message; decryptor, <b>39</b>K, decrypts the encrypted information of said message and transfers said message to EOFS valve, <b>39</b>H; and EOFS valve, <b>39</b>H, inputs the information of said message, unencrypted, to control processor, <b>39</b>J, until the end of file signal of said message is detected. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, compares the unencrypted information of the execution segment in said message to the aforementioned controlled-function-invoking information, and a match occurs with particular preprogrammed execute-at-39J information that causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, to execute particular preprogrammed load-and-run-at-39J instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0708" num="0744">Executing said instructions causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, to record the received SPAM information of said 1st supplementary message (#6) in a fashion similar to the recording of the first message of example #4 except that the information of the information segment of said 1st supplementary message (#6) is recorded at particular RAM associated with control processor, <b>39</b>J, rather than particular RAM of microcomputer, <b>205</b>. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, records all remaining command information of said 1st supplementary message (#6) together with any padding bits immediately following said command at the aforementioned SPAM-input-signal register memory then continues receiving the SPAM information of said message and loads said information (which is the information of the information segment of said message) at particular working memory of said RAM associated with control processor, <b>39</b>J.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0709" num="0745">In due course, EOFS valve, <b>39</b>H, receives complete information of the end of file signal that ends said 1st supplementary message (#6). Receiving said information causes EOFS valve, <b>39</b>H, to transmit the aforementioned interrupt signal of EOFS-signal-detected information to control processor, <b>39</b>J.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0710" num="0746">Receiving said signal while under control of said load-and-run-at-39J instructions causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, to execute the information of the information segment of said 1st supplementary message (#6) that is loaded at said RAM as the so-called machine language instructions of one so-called job.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0711" num="0747">Executing said information causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, in the predetermined fashion of the said information that is preprogrammed at said RAM at the time of execution by virtue of being so loaded prior to being so executed, to locate the location of that particular instance of controlled-function-invoking information that is “100110” (which is the execute-conditional-overlay-at-205 information that causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, to execute the controlled function of said conditional-overlay-at-205 instruction) and modify the information at said location to be “111111”. (Simultaneously, other control processors, <b>39</b>J, and at other stations that are preprogrammed with decryption key J execute information of loaded information of said information segment and modify information of the execute-conditional-overlay-at-205 information, at said control processors, <b>39</b>J, to be “111111”.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0712" num="0748">In this fashion, the execute-conditional-overlay-at-205 information at the control processors, <b>39</b>J, of those selected subscriber stations that are preprogrammed with information of decryption key J is altered from its standard “100110” and becomes “111111”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0713" num="0749">Accordingly, when the second message of the “Wall Street Week” program of example #6 is transmitted with its “111111” execution segment, said message is processed at those stations that are preprogrammed with said information of decryption key J precisely as the second message of example #3 is processed at said stations. (At all other stations, all information of said message is automatically discarded because the “111111” information of its execution segment fails to match any preprogrammed controlled-function-invoking information.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0714" num="0750">The “Wall Street Week” program originating studio embeds and transmits the 2nd supplementary message (#6) after transmitting said second message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0715" num="0751">At the subscriber station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (and at other stations that are preprogrammed with decryption key J), receiving said 2nd supplementary message (#6) causes precisely the same processing that is caused by receiving the 1st supplementary message (#6) with just one exception. Whereas executing the loaded information of the information segment of the 1st supplementary message (#6) causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, to locate that instance of controlled-function-invoking information that is “100110” and modify the information at the location of said “100110” to be “111111”, executing the loaded information of the information segment of the 2nd supplementary message (#6) causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, to locate that instance of controlled-function-invoking information that is “111111” and modify the information at the location of said “111111” to be “100110”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0716" num="0752">In this fashion, the execute-conditional-overlay-at-205 information at the control processors, <b>39</b>J, of those selected subscriber stations that are preprogrammed with information of decryption key J is returned to its standard value: “100110”. (Hereinafter, the normal binary value of a given instance of information that invokes a preprogrammed function—such as, for example, the “100110” that is the normal value of said execute-conditional-overlay-at-205 information—is called a “standard control-invoking value”, and a value that temporary replaces a standard control-invoking value in the course a covert control application—such as “111111” in example #6—is called a “covert control-invoking value”.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0717" num="0753">Covert control provides significant benefits. One benefit is speed. For example, when covert control is employed, no time is spent decrypting messages (such as the second “Wall Street Week” message of examples #2 or #4) that convey combining synch commands. Thus the shortest possible interval of time can exist between the moment when a given combining synch command (such as the command of said second message) is embedded at the program originating studio and transmitted and the moment when it causes combining at those selected stations at which it causes combining. A second benefit arises out of the capacity to repeat. In example #6, after transmitting said 1st supplementary message (#6) and causing the covert control-invoking value, “111111”, to replace the standard control-invoking value of the execute-conditional-overlay-at-205 information at those selected subscriber stations that are preprogrammed with decryption key J, the “Wall Street Week” program originating studio can invoke the aforementioned conditional-overlay-at-205 instructions at said selected stations not just once but many time by transmitting execution segments that are “111111” before transmitting said 2nd supplementary message (#6) and causing the standard control-invoking value of said execute-conditional-overlay-at-205 information, “100110”, to replace said covert control-invoking value at said selected stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0718" num="0754"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the Signal Processing Programming Reception and Use Regulating System that is the third feature of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0719" num="0755">The subscriber station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has capacity for receiving wireless television programming transmissions at a conventional antenna, <b>199</b>, and a multi-channel cable transmission at converter boxes, <b>201</b> and <b>222</b>. Said boxes, <b>201</b> and <b>222</b>, are conventional cable converter boxes with capacity, well known in the art, for receiving information of a selected channel of a multiplexed multi-channel transmission and converting the selected information to a given output frequency.

Antenna, <b>199</b>, and boxes, <b>201</b> and <b>222</b>, transmit their received information to matrix switch, <b>258</b>, which is a conventional matrix switch, well known in the art, with capacity for receiving multiple inputs and outputting said inputs selectively to selected output apparatus. One apparatus that said switch has capacity for outputting to is television tuner, <b>215</b>. However, the configuration <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> differs from the configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> in that television tuner, <b>215</b>, outputs its audio and video outputs to said matrix switch, <b>258</b>, rather than to monitor, <b>202</b>M, and divider, <b>4</b>, respectively. Instead, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is said switch, <b>258</b>, that outputs the information that is input to said monitor, <b>202</b>M, and divider, <b>4</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows five additional devices—three decryptors, <b>107</b>, <b>224</b> and <b>231</b>, a signal stripper, <b>229</b>, and a signal generator, <b>230</b>—associated with matrix switch, <b>258</b>. Decryptors, <b>107</b>, <b>224</b> and <b>231</b>, are conventional decryptors, well known in the art, with capacity for receiving encrypted digital information, decrypting said information by means of a selected cipher algorithm and a selected cipher key, and outputting the decrypted information. Signal stripper, <b>229</b>, is a conventional signal stripper, well known in the art, with capacity for receiving a transmission of video information, removing embedded or otherwise inserted signal information selectively, and outputting the transmission absent the removed information.

The digital audio is transmitted in the clear. Said studio transmits the information of said program to a plurality of intermediate transmission stations by so-called “landline” means and/or Earth orbiting satellite transponder means, well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0725" num="0761">Each of said intermediate transmission stations receives the transmission originated by said studio and retransmits the information of said transmission to a plurality of ultimate receiver stations.</div>

For example, each one of said decoders, <b>138</b>, <b>281</b>, <b>282</b>, <b>284</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>283</b>, <b>145</b>, <b>149</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>285</b>, <b>227</b>, and <b>286</b>, requires less apparatus than is shown in the appropriate corresponding figure, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, or <b>2</b>C. Said decoders can be located in the aforementioned circuitry of their associated apparatus in such fashions that said decoders do not require filters, <b>31</b>, and demodulators, <b>32</b> and <b>35</b>, (in the case of TV signal decoders) or radio receiver circuitry, <b>41</b>, (in the case of radio signal decoders) or other receiver circuitry, <b>45</b>, (in the case of other signal decoders). On the other hand, decoder, <b>203</b>, may have more apparatus that that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, which is described more fully below, shows that a microcomputer, <b>205</b>, can be controlled by SPAM information embedded in transmissions other than television transmissions. Thus, because the particular decoder that controls a particular associated apparatus will be configured and preprogrammed to detect SPAM information in every transmission that can be inputted to and control said apparatus, the decoder, <b>203</b>, associated with microcomputer, <b>205</b>, may be modified to constitute an “All Signal Decoder” through the addition of additional apparatus such as the radio receiver circuitry, <b>41</b>, radio decoder, <b>42</b>, and digital detector, <b>43</b>, of the Radio Signal Decoder of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and the other receiver circuitry, <b>45</b>, and digital detector, <b>46</b>, of the Other Signal Decoder of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, said additional apparatus operating under the control of the controller, <b>39</b>, of said decoder, <b>203</b>, and inputting detected digital information to the buffer, <b>39</b>A, of said controller, <b>39</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0776" num="0812">If a given intermediate or output apparatus can receive transmissions from more than one source or of more than one kind—television, radio, or other—it will have sufficient apparatus to monitor every channel and kind of transmission it can receive. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows multi-picture TV monitor, <b>148</b>, that has capacity to receive two inputted transmissions and has two TV decoders, <b>149</b> and <b>150</b>. In the preferred embodiment, one decoder, <b>149</b>, is located at a point in the circuitry of monitor, <b>148</b>, where said decoder, <b>149</b>, receives the information of one inputted transmission; the other decoder, <b>150</b>, is located at a point in said circuitry said decoder, <b>150</b>, receives the information of the other inputted transmission. And for example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows radio tuner &amp; amplifier, <b>213</b>, that also has capacity to receive two inputted transmissions and has two decoders: radio decoder, <b>138</b>, and other decoder, <b>281</b>. In the preferred embodiment, one decoder, <b>138</b>, is located at a point in the circuitry of tuner &amp; amplifier, <b>213</b>, where said decoder, <b>138</b>, receives information of one inputted transmission (eg., the selected radio frequency that is the particular frequency, of the spectrum of wireless frequencies received at antenna, <b>199</b>, and inputted via switch, <b>258</b>, that is the frequency that the radio tuner of tuner &amp; amplifier tunes to); the other decoder, <b>281</b>, is located at a point in said circuitry where said decoder, <b>281</b>, receives the information of the other inputted transmission (eg., the output frequency of record turn table, <b>280</b>, inputted via said switch, <b>258</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0777" num="0813">The onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, controls the operation of all the decoders that merely monitor the operation of associated subscriber station apparatus and also controls other particular apparatus of the subscriber station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in particular monitor information functions. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows that signal processor, <b>200</b>, (at onboard controller, <b>14</b>A) has bus communications means for communicating control information to the aforementioned decoders, <b>138</b>, <b>281</b>, <b>282</b>, <b>284</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>283</b>, <b>145</b>, <b>149</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>285</b>, <b>227</b>, and <b>286</b>. By such bus means, onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, can cause any on or all of said decoders to commence or cease processing and transmitting SPAM monitor information and can cause any one or all of said decoders to change the location or locations that are searched for SPAM information. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows that, via said bus communications means, signal processor, <b>200</b>, has capacity for communicating control information (from onboard controller, <b>14</b>A) to subscriber station player apparatus that has capacity for playing prerecorded programming (and in so doing, originating transmission at said station of said programming). Said player apparatus includes laser disc player, <b>232</b>, record turn table, <b>280</b>, audio recorder/player, <b>255</b>, video recorder/player, <b>217</b>, and other recorder/player, <b>257</b>. Each of said player apparatus has capacity, under control of onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, for generating, embedding in programming transmissions, and transmitting source mark information that identifies (and distinguishes from one another) each one of said player apparatus. By causing said player apparatus to transmit identifying source mark information, onboard controller, can cause local apparatus to collect monitor information that identifies which local player apparatus is the source of any given output of a locally originated, prerecorded programming transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0778" num="0814">But the onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, does not control the operation of those decoders that control the operation of subscriber station apparatus in the execution of SPAM controlled functions. Instead, all decoders that execute SPAM controlled functions are controlled, even in monitoring the operation of their associated apparatus, by the controller, <b>20</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, decoder, <b>203</b>, is the only such decoder with capacity to execute SPAM controlled functions. As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows, decoder, <b>203</b>, and signal processor, <b>200</b>, (at onboard controller, <b>14</b>A) have no capacity to communicate with each other via the aforementioned bus communications means for communicating control information. Rather decoder, <b>203</b>, communicates control information directly with the controller, <b>20</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. (In respect to a decoder and other apparatus that are controlled by a controller, <b>20</b>, the onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, of the signal processor, <b>200</b>, of said controller, <b>20</b>, is preprogrammed to input to said controller, <b>20</b>, all monitor instructions addressed to said decoder or associated apparatus, and said controller, <b>20</b>, is preprogrammed to receive said instructions and transfer said instructions to said decoder or associated apparatus appropriately in accordance with the priority of the operation of said decoder or associated apparatus.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0779" num="0815">Decoders that execute SPAM controlled functions are controlled in regard to monitoring by controller, <b>20</b>, rather than onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, because timely execution of controlled functions (and the transmission of control information related to such execution such as, for example, decryption key information as in example #4 above) has far higher priority that the collection of monitor information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0780" num="0816">One particular advantage of these methods for monitoring programming is that, by embedding the SPAM information in the audio and/or video and/or other parts of the programming that are conventionally recorded by, for example, conventional video cassette recorders, these methods provide techniques for gathering statistics on what is recorded, for example, on video and audio cassette recorders and on how people replay such recordings. For example, a subscriber might instruct video recorder/player, <b>217</b>, automatically to record the NBC Network Nightly News as might receive the programming over Manhattan Cable TV channel 4 and record the programming at the time of original broadcast transmission—from 7:00 PM to 7:30 PM on the evening of Jul. 15, 1985. Each discrete bit of this information could be transmitted to the subscriber station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in meter-monitor information (of a SPAM command with an appropriate execution segment such as information of the pseudo command) embedded in the transmitted programming. So embedding and transmitting said meter-monitor information would cause recorder, <b>217</b>, to record said information. In addition, decoder, <b>218</b>, would detect said information and transfer said information to signal processor, <b>200</b>, together with appropriate source mark information, but no decoder apparatus associated with any of the aforementioned output apparatus would detect said information, causing said signal processor, <b>200</b>, in a predetermined fashion to record a signal record of programming recorded at recorder, <b>217</b>. (Simultaneously, the information of said programming is being displayed at the monitors, <b>202</b>M, of other subscriber stations that are tuned to the frequency of said News as broadcast; decoders, <b>145</b>, associated with said monitors, <b>202</b>M, are detecting said embedded meter-monitor information and transmitting said information to the signal processors, <b>200</b>, of said stations; and said signal processors, <b>200</b>, are recording signal records of programming displayed at said monitors, <b>202</b>M.) Subsequently, the subscriber might play back the recorded programming and view said programming on TV monitor, <b>202</b>M, from 10:45 PM to 11:15 PM the same evening. So playing back and transmitting the recorded programming to monitor, <b>202</b>M, would cause TV signal decoder, <b>145</b>, to detect said meter-monitor information and transfer said information, together with appropriate source mark information, to signal processor, <b>131</b>, causing said signal processor, <b>200</b>, to record a signal record of said information together with date and time information of said 10:45 PM to 11:15 PM the same evening selected from the clock, <b>18</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0781" num="0817">Prerecorded, commercially distributed video and audio tapes, videodiscs, so-called “compact discs” of audio, and so-called “CD ROM” discs of data can also contain unique codes, embedded in the prerecorded programming, that identify the use and usage of said programming when said tapes or discs are played. For example, laser disc player, <b>232</b>, can be a compact disc player upon which is loaded a compact disc. SPAM messages, embedded in the programming prerecorded on said disc, can contain pseudo command execution segment information and meter-monitor information that documents that said prerecorded programming is of Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 4 as recorded by the Berlin Philharmoniker and the disc is distributed by EMI Records Ltd. on the Angel label with a particular catalog serial number. Through matrix switch, <b>258</b>, the output of player, <b>232</b>, is inputted to the amplifier, <b>213</b>, and the output of amplifier, <b>213</b>, is inputted to speaker system, <b>263</b>. When player, <b>232</b>, commences playing and transmitting said prerecorded programming, transmitting said programming causes other decoder, <b>281</b>, and other decoder, <b>285</b>, to detect said embedded messages at amplifier, <b>213</b>, and speaker system, <b>263</b>, respectively, and transmit said meter-monitor information to signal processor, <b>200</b>, via the aforementioned bus communications means for transferring monitor information, thereby causing onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, to commence retaining monitor information in a signal record that reflects the outputting of said programming and, in a predetermined fashion, to determine that the information of said record includes no information identifying a station or apparatus originating the transmission of said programming. So determining causes onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, to transmit a particular transmit-source-code instruction, via the aforementioned bus communications means for transferring control information, to the local apparatus that have capacity for playing prerecorded programming, which apparatus include player, <b>232</b>, and record turn table, <b>280</b>. Receiving said instruction causes player, <b>232</b>, and turn table, <b>280</b>, each to generate, embed in its transmitted programming in a predetermined fashion, and transmit its own preprogrammed identifier code information that identifies each distinctly differently it from all other subscriber station apparatus (all of which apparatus have the capacity so to do). Causing player, <b>232</b>, to transmit its distinct code causes other decoders, <b>281</b> and <b>285</b>, to detect said code and transmit information of said code to signal processor, <b>200</b>, causing onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, to retain information of said code in said signal record, thereby adding to said record information of the apparatus originating the transmission of said programming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0782" num="0818">In the case of any given programming that is outputted at any given output apparatus, thereby enabling a subscriber to view or hear or read or in some other way perceive the information of said programming, the onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, may and probably will receive monitor information from several different sources. For example, in the case of the “Wall Street Week” program, transmitting the first and second SPAM messages of example #3 (which are not encrypted) will cause not only decoder, <b>203</b>, to process the meter-monitor information of said messages and transmit the aforementioned 1st monitor information (#3) and 2nd monitor information (#3), via the monitor information bus means of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to onboard controller, <b>14</b>A. The programming of said “Wall Street Week” program is received at tuner, <b>215</b>, and displayed at monitor, <b>202</b>M. Accordingly, transmitting said messages will also cause the decoder associated with tuner, <b>215</b>—decoder, <b>282</b>—to detect, process, and transmit monitor information of said messages to onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, that is identical to said 1st monitor information (#3) and 2nd monitor information (#3) except that the source mark information identifies decoder, <b>282</b>, rather than decoder, <b>203</b>. Likewise, unless the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> information overlaid at microcomputer, <b>205</b>, covers and obliterates the embedded information of said messages that is inputted from divider, <b>4</b>, to microcomputer, <b>205</b>, and would otherwise be transmitted to monitor, <b>202</b>M, in the combined programming outputted by microcomputer, <b>205</b>, (which covering and obliterating does not occur in example #3), transmitting said messages will also cause the decoder, <b>145</b>, to detect, process, and transmit monitor information of said messages to onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, that is also identical to said 1st and 2nd monitor information (#3) except that the source mark information identifies decoder, <b>145</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0783" num="0819">As described above, onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, organizes its contained signal records on the basis of the different source mark information of the separate decoders of its subscriber station. Were onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, preprogrammed to process monitor information just in this simple fashion, transmitting the first and second messages of example #3 would cause onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, to record (and subsequently transmit to recorder, <b>16</b>, then later to one or more remote stations) three separate signal records that would duplicate each other except that each would be associated with the source mark of a different decoder, <b>282</b>, <b>203</b>, or <b>145</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0784" num="0820">In the preferred embodiment, to minimize unnecessary duplication, prior to retaining monitor information in signal records, onboard controller, <b>14</b>A, is preprogrammed to consolidate, in a predetermined fashion or fashions, monitor information transmissions that contain different source mark information but common “program unit identification code” information in such a way that subordinate sources are identified—which, in the “Wall Street Week” example, are tuner, <b>215</b>/decoder, <b>282</b>, and monitor, <b>202</b>M/decoder, <b>145</b>, where no combined medium functions and no SPAM controlled functions are executed—the monitor information from said sources is included, in a predetermined fashion, within the signal record information of the principal source—which source is, in the example, decoder, <b>203</b>, at microcomputer, <b>205</b>—in such a way that only exception information is recorded in the recorded information of the monitor information transmitted from the subordinate sources.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0800" num="0836">Determining that particular incoming programming is scheduled for time deferred transmission can cause computer, <b>73</b>, to cause the recording of said programming.

Whenever programming is played on recorder, <b>76</b> or <b>78</b>, decoder, <b>77</b> or <b>79</b> respectively, detects SPAM information embedded in the prerecorded programming played at the play heads of recorder, <b>76</b> or <b>78</b>, and transmits said SPAM information to computer, <b>73</b>. Said SPAM information can include not only “program unit identification code” information but also information regarding of the distance from the point on the tape at which a given SPAM message is embedded to the point on the tape where the program unit begins and ends (or to any other selected point). To position the start point (or another selected point) of a given program unit at the play heads of a given recorder, <b>76</b>, computer, <b>73</b>, instructs switch, <b>75</b>, to configure its switches so as to transfer the transmission input from said recorder, <b>76</b>, to no output. Then by instructing recorder, <b>76</b>, to play and decoder, <b>77</b>, to detect SPAM information in a particular location or locations, computer, <b>73</b>, causes decoder, <b>77</b>, to detect and transfer to computer, <b>73</b>, said program unit and distance information.

In the preferred embodiment, distance information is embedded in the relevant normal transmission location of its programming and occurs periodically throughout a program unit with increasing frequency as the closeness of the start or end of the programming approaches and with one instance, in television programming, occurring on the first and fourth frames and the last two frames of the programming.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0804" num="0840">Computer, <b>73</b>, has capacity for automatically organizing the locations of units of prerecorded programming on recording media such as magnetic video tapes loaded on a plurality of recorder/players to play according to a given schedule. For example, four spot commercials—program units Q, Y, W, and D—are loaded on <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>. D and Q are recorded on the video tape loaded on recorder, <b>76</b>, with D first. W and Y are recorded on the tape on recorder, <b>78</b>, with W first.

Caused to organize the locations of said units to play according to said schedule, computer, <b>73</b>, determines automatically, in a predetermined fashion, that units Q, Y and D should be recorded on the tape loaded on recorder, <b>76</b>, with Q recorded first and D recorded immediately after Y In a predetermined fashion, computer, <b>73</b>, determines that insufficient available space exists on the tape on recorder, <b>76</b>, to record Y immediately before D or on recorder, <b>78</b>, to record D immediately after Y. So determining causes computer, <b>73</b>, automatically to locate a place on the tape loaded on recorder, <b>78</b>, that contains sufficient space for recording D. (Computer, <b>73</b>, can contain records that identify how space on particular tapes is allocated or it can locate this space by playing the tapes, retaining information of “program unit identification code” and distance information prerecorded on said tapes [or the absence of such information], and analyzing said information in a predetermined fashion.) Automatically, computer, <b>73</b>, verifies that the space is truly available by causing recorder, <b>78</b>, to move forward or rewind to the start of the located space then to play for the duration of the space; by causing decoder, <b>79</b>, simultaneously to search for embedded SPAM message information, detect said information, and transfer said information to computer, <b>73</b>; and by checking the detected SPAM information in a predetermined fashion to ensure that detected meter-monitor information does not identify a program unit that is scheduled to be transmitted at a future time. Determining said located space to be available causes computer, <b>73</b>, to cause recorder, <b>76</b>, to move forward or rewind to the start of program unit D; to cause recorder, <b>78</b>, to rewind to the start of said located space; and to cause switch, <b>75</b>, to configure its switches so as to transfer the output of recorder, <b>76</b>, to the input of recorder, <b>78</b>.

Program unit D is now recorded on the tape on recorder, <b>78</b>, and program unit Q is the only unit on recorder, <b>76</b>. Then automatically, in the locating fashion described above, computer, <b>73</b>, locates an available space on the tape on recorder, <b>76</b>, that is large enough for recording program units Y and D together. Computer, <b>73</b>, verifies the availability of the space in the verifying fashion above. Computer, <b>73</b>, causes recorder, <b>78</b>, to move forward or rewind to the start of program unit Y; causes recorder, <b>76</b>, to rewind to the start of the available space; and causes switch, <b>75</b>, to configure its switches so as to transfer the output of recorder, <b>78</b>, to the input of recorder, <b>76</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0817" num="0853">One such remote distribution station might be, for example, a so-called “satellite uplink” that transmits programming, in a fashion well known in the art, to a plurality of receiver stations via a satellite transponder (said intermediate transmission stations being among said receiver stations). Said programming might be, for example, so-called “television spot commercials.” Providing means where by one station can transmit programming to a plurality of intermediate transmission stations and cause each intermediate station to transmit its own specific selected units of said programming according to its own specific schedule enables one such distribution station such as a so-called “spot rep.” agency that sells the so-called “spot time” of many, widely separated local broadcast stations and cable systems to transmit many different spot commercial program units to said stations and systems automatically and cause each station or system automatically to retransmit its specific selected commercial program units according to its specific schedule. And providing means that document the specific program units transmitted at each specific station enables said distribution station to provide so-called “proof of performance” to parties who pay for the transmission of said spot commercials.</div>

In the case of programming that is transmitted to said station with all required program instruction sets and combining synch commands already properly embedded, said station records and transmits said programming just as said station records and transmits conventional television programming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0845" num="0881">But said station also has means for automatically generating and embedding combined medium programming control instructions in certain fashions. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows signal strippers, <b>81</b>, <b>85</b>, and <b>89</b>, of which models exist well known in the art, that computer, <b>73</b>, can cause to remove SPAM information from programming as required, and signal generators, <b>82</b>, <b>86</b>, and <b>90</b>, also well known in the art, that computer, <b>73</b>, can cause to embed SPAM information as required.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0846" num="0882">For sake of example, program units, Q and D, above are combined medium programming of the same sort as “Wall Street Week” except that computer, <b>73</b>, must insert one or more particular locally generated program instruction sets into a local transmission of the programming of each of said program units. For example, program unit Q is a spot commercial of a supermarket chain that describes discounts and so-called “cents-off coupon specials” at local supermarkets. The particular formulas that apply to discounts and the particular items on special vary from specific supermarket to specific supermarket and from time to time, and the information in the embedded program instruction sets of any given transmission of unit Q must reflect the particular formulas and items that apply at specific local supermarkets at the time of said transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0847" num="0883">Program units Q and D are delivered, organized to play, and played according to schedule in the automatic fashions described above but with certain variations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0848" num="0884">Computer, <b>73</b>, is preprogrammed to process combined medium programming. When the aforementioned remote distribution station inputs information to computer, <b>73</b>, via network, <b>98</b>, regarding unit Q, said distribution station inputs information that Q is particular combined medium programming and instructs computer, <b>73</b>, to commence particular program instruction set generation in a particular fashion at a particular time interval prior to the scheduled playing of Q. (Hereinafter, a particular instance of such a time period is called “interval,” as in “interval Q” of unit Q.) Inputting said information and instructions causes Computer, <b>73</b>, to record said information and instructions in its record keeping fashion together with the scheduled generation time which computer, <b>73</b>, calculates as the scheduled play time minus interval Q. Prior to the scheduled generation time, particular local-formula-and-item information is inputted to computer, <b>73</b>, regarding the formulas and items that apply in the case of this particular transmission of Q.

Said information may be inputted from local input, <b>74</b>, or over network, <b>98</b>, and computer, <b>73</b>, records said information in a predetermined fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0849" num="0885">Computer program instructions, of the sort well known in the art, are also inputted to computer, <b>73</b>, and computer, <b>73</b>, is caused to execute said instructions.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0850" num="0886">For example, when executed, one particular intermediate generation set that is inputted to computer, <b>73</b>, causes computer, <b>73</b>, in a fashion that is described more fully below, to generate particular program instruction set information of the combined medium programming of program unit Q.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0851" num="0887">Computer, <b>73</b>, can receive and be caused to execute intermediate generation set information in any fashion that a computer receives and is caused to execute computer program instructions.</div>

And said intermediate set is prerecorded in said program unit before the start of said conventional programming. For example, in the case of television programming such as the programming of unit Q, the particular intermediate set that is inputted to computer, <b>73</b>, is located on the recording medium of unit Q within the defined space of program unit Q immediately following the point at which unit Q starts and before the point at which the conventional television information of Q commences. Said intermediate generation set information is embedded in the so-called “full frame” video on each successive frame until complete information of said set information is embedded; that is, embedding of said set information commences at the first line of the normal transmission location and continues on each successive detectable line of a first frame and, continuing in this fashion, on each successive frame until all intermediate generation set information is embedded. The conventional television video and audio information of program unit Q are prerecorded in the conventional fashion, commencing at the frame immediately following the last frame in which intermediate generation set information is embedded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0853" num="0889">Any given intermediate generation set contains generally applicable information of the particular program instruction set whose generation it causes. Generally applicable information is specific. For example, the generally applicable information of the intermediate generation set of the programming of Q includes binary sound image information of a particular announcer's voice saying, “forty-three”, “forty-five”, “forty-six”, “low-salt Vindaloo”, “Mild version Quick”, and “Hot version Quick”. And any given datum of generally applicable information may be specific information only of selected subscriber stations. Yet such information is generally applicable at any given transmission station because any given datum may be applicable at any or all of the subscriber stations of said transmission station.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1089" num="1155">So far in this specification has treated the process of controlling combined medium operations as if the process of generating the computer information of any given computer based combining—for example, the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> information of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> combining—begins with the embedding, at a program originating studio, and transmitting of instructions that cause subscriber station microcomputers, <b>205</b>, to generate said computer information. (In the case of said <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> information, this specification has, so far, treated the process of generating the particular information of said <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> as if said process begins with the embedding and transmitting of the first message of the “Wall Street Week” example.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1090" num="1156">In actuality, the process of controlling computer-based combined media operations is continuous and involves systematic inputting and maintaining of up-to-date user specific data at each subscriber station.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1092" num="1158">However, the present invention provides means and methods for systematically inputting and maintaining user specific data at subscriber stations.</div>

(Said remote station transmits said closing stock price data and causes specific subscriber stations to select and process their specific information of interest in the fashion in which remote news-service-A station transmitted the AT&amp;T news item and caused selected stations to select and process, in their specific fashions, the information of said item.)

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1096" num="1162">Subsequently, but before the aforementioned 8:30 PM time (which is 8:30 PM, Eastern Standard Time on said Friday evening and is the time when so-called “live” transmission of the “Wall Street Week” program commences), the program originating studio that originates transmission of the “Wall Street Week” program transmits the aforementioned Prepare-To-Retransmit-WSW message, 1st-WSW-program-enabling-message (#7), 1st-WSW-decryption-check (#7), eight SPAM messages each of which is called a “2nd-WSW-program-enabling-message (#7)”, and 2nd-WSW-decryption-check (#7). In so doing, said studio causes a plurality of intermediate transmission stations that are preprogrammed and function in the fashion of the station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and a plurality of subscriber stations that are preprogrammed and function in the fashion of the station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref> (and <b>7</b>C) to cause apparatus at each of said subscriber stations to interconnect, receive information of said transmission, decrypt said information, and prepare to display (or otherwise output) information of said “Wall Street Week” program in the fashions of example #7 and of the above description called “MORE ON EXAMPLE #7”.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1098" num="1164">Then the combined medium combining process described above in “One Combined Medium” and in examples #1, #2, #3, #4, etc. commences. And the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> combining is displayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1099" num="1165">But the combining of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is just part of a larger process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1100" num="1166">When the “Wall Street Week” transmission begins at <b>8</b>:<b>30</b> PM on a Friday evening, the program instruction set in the first message of the “Wall Street Week” example instructs microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to generate not one but a plurality overlays. The combining of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is merely the first.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1101" num="1167">Computer operations take time and some computers are slower than others. Partly this is a question of hardware; a so-called eight bit microprocessor is generally slower performing a given operation than a sixteen bit processor for reasons that are well known in the art. But even with precisely the same hardware and systems software, two computers can take different times to complete a given operation if only because they contain different data. For example, it takes longer to calculate the value of a portfolio containing one thousand stocks than a portfolio of one. Furthermore, it is undesirable to separate computer operations merely because they result in the generation of separate overlays because such separation may result in unnecessary duplication of calculations. For example, the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> display of user specific overall stock portfolio performance could be followed by second and third displays that analyze portions of the subscriber's portfolio—eg., the portion invested in New York Stock Exchange listed stocks in comparison to the so-called “NYSE” index and the portion invested in so-called “over-the-counter” stocks in comparison to the so-called “NASDAQ” index. In order to calculate the value of the overall portfolio, it is necessary to calculate the value of these portions. To require that the values of the portions be recalculated for subsequent overlays would be inefficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1102" num="1168">In computer-based combined medium communications, the amount of information that a given system can convey is dependent on the efficiency of the employment of program instruction sets and combining synch commands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1103" num="1169">In the preferred embodiment, unlike conventional television where information is presented strictly in the sequence of its transmission, the transmission and execution of program instruction set information for second (or subsequent) overlays can precede the transmission of the combining synch command of first overlays and the time of first overlay ceasings. To minimize waiting time, the controllers, <b>39</b>, of decoders, <b>203</b>, (or analogous controllers, <b>44</b> or <b>47</b>, of analogous radio decoders of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> of other decoders of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> that execute SPAM message information at a microcomputer, <b>205</b>) combining synch commands that cause combining or the ceasing of combining (as, for example, the commands of the second and third messages of the “Wall Street Week” example) are processed as interrupts to the CPUs of microcomputers, <b>205</b>; program instruction sets, once executed, instruct microcomputers, <b>205</b>, to wait only when further processing, under the control of the instructions of said sets, would entail overwriting RAM information whose overlay time or processing time has not yet ended. And to prevent microcomputers, <b>205</b>, that fall behind from displaying incomplete overlays, any given SPAM message that causes a combining specifies the identity of the particular overlay information whose combining it causes and causes a combining only at subscriber station where information exists of the completion of the identified overlay. For example, receiving the second message of the “Wall Street Week” program causes the combining of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> information and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> information only at stations where information at the aforementioned SPAM-first-precondition and SPAM-second-precondition register memories matches selected information of the meter-monitor segment of said message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1104" num="1170">Finally, in order to cause microcomputers, <b>205</b>, that fall behind to catch up, a particular fashion exists in the preferred embodiment for restoring efficient operations. Microcomputers, <b>205</b>, that fall behind are caused to jump over and avoid executing instructions that control the generating of overlay information (such as <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) whose overlay time (that is, combining time) has passed. In a fashion well known in the art, selected so-called “lines of code” of program instruction sets are preprogrammed with label information that identifies each one of said line, and the instructions of said set periodically compare preprogrammed information of said set to information at particular overlay-target RAM memory in order to control efficient operation in a fashion described more fully below. When a combining fails to occur at any given station because information of the completion of an identified overlay does not exist at said station, the controller, <b>203</b>, of said station automatically causes the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to so-called “jump”, in a jump fashion well known in the art, to that selected one of said lines of code where the instructions of said program instruction set commence causing the generation of the information of that particular overlay that is next to be combined. For example, at the start of the “Wall Street Week” example, information of “00000000” exists at the SPAM-second-precondition register memories of the decoders, <b>203</b>, of every subscriber station. The overlay of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is the first overlay of the “Wall Street Week” program, and the information of the meter-monitor field of the second message of said example identifies said overlay with binary information of “00000001”. The next overlay of said program, which is the second overlay, is identified with information of “00000010”. Receiving said second message causes the decoders, <b>203</b>, at each subscriber station to compare information at said SPAM-second-precondition register memories to the “00000001” information of the overlay number field of said message. At those stations that have completed generating at RAM the information of said first overlay (eg., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), the instructions of the program instruction set of said example have caused information of “00000001” to be placed at said SPAM-second-precondition memories. At said stations, matches result and cause the combining of locally generated overlay information (eg., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) with the transmitted <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> information and cause the display of combined medium information (eg., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). At other stations that have not completed generating at RAM the information of said first overlay (eg., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), matches do not result, causing the controllers, <b>39</b>, of the decoders, <b>203</b>, of said stations to execute the aforementioned particular second-condition-test-failed instructions of the aforementioned conditional-overlay-at-205 instructions. Executing said second-condition-test-failed instructions causes each of said controllers, <b>39</b>, to compute a particular overlay-target number; to interrupt the operation of the CPU of the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of its station; to cause said CPU to place information of said overlay-target number at particular overlay-target RAM memory; to cause said CPU to execute a so-called “machine language jump” to the particular so-called “offset address” of the information at RAM of said program instruction set that is associated, in the predetermined fashion of the instructions of said set, with said overlay-target number; and to cause said microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to continue executing the instructions of said set from the instruction at said address. In so doing, said microcomputer, <b>205</b>, can skip over and avoid executing instructions whose overlay time has passed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1105" num="1171">The particular overlay-target number that any given controller, <b>39</b>, calculates, under control of said second-condition-test-failed instructions, is a function of the overlay number information of the SPAM message that invokes said conditional-overlay-at-205 instructions and is also a function of the history of the efficiency of the operation of the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of the subscriber station of said controller, <b>39</b>, at the time when said instructions are invoked. In the case the second message of the “Wall Street Week” example, the overlay that said message causes to be combined is the first overlay generated under control of the program instruction set that generates said overlay. Accordingly, the information recorded, in a predetermined fashion, at particular history-of-efficiency memory at each controller, <b>39</b>, of a decoder, <b>203</b>, of said other stations (that have not completed generating the information of said first overlay at the time of receiving said second message) is “00000000” and indicates that said microcomputer, <b>205</b>, has not failed to generate any overlay, generated under control of said set, on time. Thus when receiving said second message at said other stations causes the execution of said second-condition-test-failed instructions, said instructions cause said controllers, <b>39</b>, to increment by one the overlay number information of said message, thereby generating overlay-target information of “00000010”; to cause the microcomputers, <b>205</b>, of said stations to place information of said “00000010” at said overlay-target RAM memory; to cause said microcomputers, <b>205</b>, to jump to and continue executing the instructions of said program instruction set at the instruction at the particular preprogrammed “offset address” of the particular line of code of said set that is identified by the particular label associated, in a predetermined fashion, with said “00000010”; and to increment by one the information at said history-of-efficiency memory, thereby generating history-of-efficiency information of “00000001” which indicates that said microcomputer, <b>205</b>, has failed to generate one overlay, generated under control of said set, on time. Thereafter, whenever receiving a SPAM message of said “Wall Street Week” program causes a controller, <b>39</b>, of said other stations to execute said second-condition-test-failed instructions, said instructions cause said controller, <b>39</b>, to compute its overlay-target number by incrementing the overlay number information of said message by more than one and to cause the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of its station to restore efficiency by skipping over instructions that cause the generation of more than one overlay (including one or more overlays whose overlay time has not yet come). As said microcomputer, <b>205</b>, generates the information of the overlay that is identified by said overlay-target number, the instructions of said set cause said microcomputer, <b>205</b>, in a predetermined fashion that involves comparing preprogrammed particular overlay-being-generated information of said set to information at said overlay-target RAM memory, to identify particular instructions of said set that control just the generation of said one or more overlays whose overlay time has not yet come and to jump over and avoid executing said instructions, thereby executing only those instructions that control generation of information of said identified overlay (or of overlays whose overlay time follows the overlay time of said identified overlay). In so doing, said microcomputer, <b>205</b>, can skip over and avoid executing selected instructions whose overlay time has not passed in order to catch up and recommence combining at an overlay time that is after the overlay time of the overlay or overlays whose generation is controlled by said selected instructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1106" num="1172">Thus transmitting to a plurality of subscriber stations any given SPAM message that invokes said conditional-overlay-at-205 instructions causes apparatus at selected ones of said stations to combine locally generated overlay information (eg., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) with transmitted information (eg., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) and to cause the display of combined medium information (eg., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) and causes apparatus at selected other stations to generate information of overlays whose combining is not caused by receiving said message (because the overlay times of said overlays is subsequent to the overlay time of said locally generated overlay information [eg., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>] whose combining is caused by said message). Furthermore, transmitting said messages causes the apparatus at said selected other stations to generate information of overlays in such a way that each station generates information of an overlay that has a specific overlay time and the specific overlay time of the overlays generated at specific station varies from station to station and is different at different stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0068" num="0000">Transmitting and Receiving Program Instruction Sets</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1107" num="1173">In television, the normal transmission location is in the vertical interval of the television transmission. SPAM signals are not normally transmitted in the visible portion of the television picture because the information of said signals can be seen by viewers (often as so-called “snow”). However, the transmission capacity of the vertical interval is limited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1108" num="1174">In computer-based combined medium communications, the amount of locally generated information that any given system can display (or otherwise output) to subscribers is dependent on maximizing the volume of program instruction set instructions that said system can transmit and maximizing the time interval between the transmission (more precisely, the execution) of the instructions of any given program instruction set and the overlay times of the individual locally generated overlays whose generation said instructions cause. The greater the volume of program instruction set information that is transmitted in any given combined medium program, the greater is the amount of overlay information can be generated at subscriber stations. And the earlier said information is transmitted in said program, the greater is the efficiency with which generating is controlled at subscriber stations (because the longest possible time intervals can separate the commencement of the generating of the information of individual overlays and the individual overlay times of said overlays).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1109" num="1175">In the preferred embodiment, the program instruction set information of any given combined medium program is transmitted as soon as possible after commencement of said program, and the present invention includes means and methods to maximize the transmission of program instruction set information at the start of combined medium programs. (As related above, in the preferred embodiment, all SPAM commands are transmitted in the normal transmission location of any given transmission.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1110" num="1176">In the video/computer combined medium, capacity is found by transmitting said sets in portions of the television picture that are covered by locally generated overlays (which in digital television transmissions can include frames of transmitted video that are “frozen” after reception in fashions well known in the art). One controlled function that is preprogrammed at the controllers, <b>39</b>, of the decoders, <b>203</b>, of subscriber stations and that is caused to be executed by receiving a SPAM message containing expand-to-full-field-search execution segment information is a function whose instructions cause said controller, <b>39</b>, to cause the line receivers, <b>33</b>, of said decoders, <b>203</b>, to commence detecting digital information in every frame of its received video information from the first detectable portion of line <b>20</b> of said frame to the last detectable portion of the last line of said frame. A second controlled function that is preprogrammed at said controllers, <b>39</b>, and that is caused to be executed by receiving a SPAM message containing resume-normal-location-search execution segment information is a function whose instructions cause said controller, <b>39</b>, to cause said line receivers, <b>33</b>, to commence detecting digital information in the normal transmission location of every frame of its received video information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1111" num="1177">An example illustrates transmitting program instruction set information in a portion of the television picture that is normally visible but that is temporarily covered by an overlay. In the example, the program originating studio that originates a given program causes each subscriber station to generate information of the so-called “titles” of said program (that is, the textual information listing the title said program, the names of the cast and crew members, etc.), causes said locally generated information to overlay and obscure completely the transmitted video information of said program, and transmits program instruction set information in the full field video of the transmission so obscured (that is, in every frame of the transmitted video information from the first detectable portion of line <b>20</b> of said frame to the last detectable portion of the last line of said frame).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1113" num="1179">At the start of the conventional television information of said program, said program originating studio embeds a SPAM message that contains the execution segment information that is identical to the execution segment information of the first message of the “Wall Street Week” example and information segment information of a particular set-to-color program instruction set. Receiving said message causes apparatus at each station, in the fashions described above, to execute the information of said set; to clear the video RAM of the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of said station; and to set all of said RAM, in a fashion well known in the art, to an opaque background color such as light blue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1114" num="1180">Next said program originating studio embeds a SPAM message that contains the execution segment information that is identical to the execution segment information of the second message of the “Wall Street Week” example.

In so doing, said apparatus causes said transmitted video to be covered and obscured completely by said opaque background color.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1115" num="1181">Then said studio embeds a SPAM message that contains one instance of said expand-to-full-field-search execution segment information.

So executing said information causes said microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to commence generating at said RAM, in a fashion well known in the art, the image information of a so-called “crawl” of said titles. In so doing, said studio causes said microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to display the information of said titles at the monitor, <b>202</b>M, of said station. (Simultaneously, a microcomputer, <b>205</b>, at every other subscriber station executes the same information and displays the same titles, and said studio transmits audio information of appropriate so-called “program theme music,” causing apparatus at each station to emit the sound of said music.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1117" num="1183">Then said studio embeds in the full field video and transmits a particular program-instruction-set-of-this-program SPAM message that contains particular record-at-256 execution segment information and information segment information of a particular generate-overlays-of-this-program program instruction set.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0073" num="0000">Preprogramming Receiver Station Operating Systems</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1235" num="1321">So-called “operating systems” are well known in the art and generally comprise the most basic form of processor control instructions. In order to control fundamental aspects of the processing of any given data file, such as a DATA_OF.ITS or DATA_OF.URS file, under control of any given computer program, such as a PROGRAM.EXE program, a computer is usually preprogrammed with an operating system that controls such fundamental aspects as, for example, so-called “input/output” functions. One such system that is commonly known as “PC-DOS” or “MS-DOS” is an operating system of the IBM personal computer, commonly known as the “IBM PC.” (PC-DOS or MS-DOS is described in Disk Operating System of the IBM Personal Computer Computer Language Series.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1236" num="1322">Many computers are designed to hold operating system instructions at RAM. The IBM PC is one such computer. When power is turned on to an IBM PC, under control of particular instructions that are permanently recorded at ROM and are commonly known as “ROM BIOS”, said PC accesses a disk at a particular disk drive and loads the instructions of a particular prerecorded file from said disk to particular locations of RAM in a fashion well known in the art that is commonly known as “booting.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1237" num="1323">One advantage of recording operating system instructions at memory such as RAM that can be conveniently overwritten relates to expanding system functions. New so-called “routines” can easily be entered into a given system to control existing apparatus of said system in new functions, and the operating system of a given system can be expanded easily to control newly installed apparatus. Thus many versions usually exist of any given operating system which versions have greater or lesser capacities. For example, versions 1.00, 1.10, 2.00, etc. exist of PC-DOS and MS-DOS. Each version has capacity for controlling the operation of an IBM PC, and later versions generally have expanded capacities in comparison to earlier versions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1238" num="1324">Efficient operation of any given computer system of the present invention requires capacity to control the preprogramming of the operating system software of receiver station apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1239" num="1325">Receiver station apparatus of the present invention is extensive and can vary greatly from station to station. For example, apparatus that requires preprogramming at the station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, includes microcomputer, <b>205</b>; controllers, <b>12</b> and <b>20</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>; the RAMs associated with the processors, <b>39</b>B and <b>39</b>D, and with the control processor, <b>39</b>J, of decoder, <b>30</b>, of signal processor, <b>200</b>; and the RAMs associated with the processors, <b>39</b>B and <b>39</b>D, and with the control processor, <b>39</b>J, of other decoders of said station such as decoders, <b>203</b> and <b>282</b>. Other ultimate receiver stations can include less apparatus, more apparatus, or simply different apparatus. (For example, one receiver station may have the decoder, <b>203</b>/SPAM controller, <b>205</b>C, apparatus of example #1 while another station has the preferred decoder, <b>203</b>, apparatus of example #3.) Furthermore, the complete computer system of a remote network origination and control station such as the program originating studio that transmits the program unit of Q in example #10 involves apparatus not only at ultimate receiver stations but also at intermediate transmission stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1240" num="1326">One objective of the unified system of programming communication of the present invention is standardization of receiver station operating systems. With standardization, any given transmission station such as the program originating studio of example #10 can assemble and take control of a computer system of the computers of selected subscriber stations in the fashion described above in example #7 without any need to preprogram system software at any apparatus of said selected subscriber stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1241" num="1327">Another objective of the present invention is flexibility and convenience in reprogramming operating systems in order to expand system functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1242" num="1328">The present invention provides means and methods whereby one remote system master control station can preprogram all intermediate transmission stations and ultimate receiver station in a given geographical area (such as, for example, the continental United States of America) by transmitting a given sequence of SPAM messages that contain operating system instructions which sequence is received at and processed by all receiver stations and from which selected stations select selected messages that contain instructions of specific relevance. Each message is addressed to specific station SPAM control apparatus such as ITS computers, <b>73</b>, in the case of intermediate transmission stations and URS signal processors, <b>200</b>, in the case of ultimate receiver stations. Each message consists of a “01” header; execution segment information addressed to the appropriate station SPAM control apparatus; meter-monitor information that identifies not only a specific preprogrammable apparatus such as URS decoders, <b>203</b>, but also the particular version of said apparatus (for example, URS decoders, <b>203</b>, of the version illustrated above in example #1 rather than example #3); padding bits as required; an information segment that consists, itself, of a particular SPAM message without an end of file signal; and an end of file signal. The information of each information segment consist of a “01” header; execution segment information addressed to said specific preprogrammable apparatus version which segment information causes said apparatus version to invoke its ROM preprogramming instructions; appropriate meter-monitor information that may include particular meter instructions; padding bits as required; and an information segment that contains the operating system instructions of said specific apparatus version.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1243" num="1329">Each appropriate receiver station apparatus that receives and processes a SPAM message of said sequence is preprogrammed with the necessary controlled-function-invoking information and controlled function instructions invoked by said message, and the information and instructions so invoked are preprogrammed at ROM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1244" num="1330">Likewise, each specific receiver station SPAM control apparatus has access to specific information that is preprogrammed at non-volatile memory that identifies not only the specific preprogrammable apparatus (such as URS decoders, <b>203</b>) of said station but also the particular version of said apparatus (for example, URS decoders, <b>203</b>, of the version illustrated above in example #3).</div>

Automatically, switch controller, <b>20</b>A, causes matrix switch, <b>259</b>, to configure its switches so as to transfer information inputted from controller, <b>12</b>, to decoder, <b>203</b>, then transmits said transfer-operating-system-message instruction to controller, <b>20</b>, causing controller, <b>20</b>, to transmit said instruction to controller, <b>12</b>, and causing controller, <b>12</b>, to transmit to matrix switch, <b>259</b>, all information of the information segment and end of file signal of said third SPAM message. In so doing, controller, <b>12</b>, inputs said information segment and end of file signal to decoder, <b>203</b>. (Simultaneously, at stations where the decoders, <b>203</b>, are of the version of example #1, receiving said third message causes controllers, <b>12</b>, [functioning with controllers, <b>20</b> and <b>20</b>A, and with EPROMs, <b>20</b>A] to discard all information of said message.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1259" num="1345">Said information that is inputted to decoder, <b>203</b>, is the contained SPAM message of said third SPAM message and is a complete SPAM message in its own right. Said contained message consists of a “01” header; execution segment information that is addressed to URS decoders, <b>203</b>, of the example #3 version and that causes said decoders, <b>203</b>, each to invoke its ROM instructions for entering operating system instructions into its RAM; appropriate meter-monitor information that may include particular meter instructions; padding bits as required; and an information segment that contains the SPAM operating system instructions of an example #3 version decoder, <b>203</b>. Immediately following the last bit of said information segment is the end of file signal of said third SPAM message which is also the end of file signal of said contained SPAM message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1260" num="1346">Receiving said contained SPAM message causes decoder, <b>203</b>, to record the operating system instructions of said message at particular operating system locations at the RAMs of decoder, <b>203</b>, and to commence operating under control of said instructions. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, compares the execution segment information of said message to controlled-function-invoking information and determines that said execution segment information matched particular load-operating-system-of-203 information that is preprogrammed at the ROM associated with control processor, <b>39</b>J, and that invokes particular load-operating-system-of-203 instructions that are preprogrammed at the ROM associated with control processor, <b>39</b>J. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, executes said instructions and, under control of said instructions, causes processor, <b>39</b>B, to cease receiving information from buffer, <b>39</b>A, then loads all information of the information segment of said message sequentially at the RAM associated with control processor, <b>39</b>J, (which has capacity to contain all information of an operating system of an example #3 version decoder, <b>203</b>) starting at the first bit location of said RAM and overwriting, if necessary, the information of all bit locations of said RAM. Then, receiving interrupt information of an end of file signal from EOFS valve, <b>39</b>F, causes control processor, <b>39</b>J, automatically, under control of said load-operating-system-of-203 instructions, to load all information so loaded at selected operating system locations of decoder, <b>203</b>. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, selects particular information at particular first bit locations of said RAM (which information is particular first binary information of the information segment of said contained SPAM message) and determines the composition of the operating system information so recorded at RAM by processing said information in a predetermined fashion under control of said load-operating-system-of-203 instructions. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, inputs particular commence-loading-operating-system instructions to processor, <b>39</b>B; selects the binary information of particular bit locations at said RAM; and inputs said information to processor, <b>39</b>B, thereby causing processor, <b>39</b>B, to record said information sequentially at particular operating system locations of the RAM associated with said processor, <b>39</b>B, beginning at the first bit location of said RAM. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, then inputs said commence-loading-operating-system instructions to processor, <b>39</b>D; selects the binary information of particular bit locations at said RAM associated with said control processor, <b>39</b>J; and inputs said information to processor, <b>39</b>D, thereby causing processor, <b>39</b>D, to record said information sequentially at particular operating system locations of the RAM associated with said processor, <b>39</b>D, beginning at the first bit location of said RAM. Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, then selects the binary information of a particular first signal word of bit locations and a particular second signal word of bit locations at said RAM associated with said control processor, <b>39</b>J; and inputs said selected information separately to EOFS valves, <b>39</b>F and <b>39</b>H, thereby causing said valves, <b>39</b>F and <b>39</b>H, each to record at its EOFS Standard Word Location the information of said first signal word of bit locations and at its EOFS Standard Length Location the information of said second signal word of bit locations. In so doing, receiving said third messages may causes said decoder, <b>203</b>, subsequently to commence detecting end of file signals of new composition and/or length. (In other words, thereafter said valves, <b>39</b>F and <b>39</b>H, may detect end of file signals that are composed of, for example, fifteen sequential instances of “11101110” binary information rather than eleven sequential instances of “11111111” binary information.) Automatically, control processor, <b>39</b>J, then moves selected binary information of particular bit locations at said RAM associated with said control processor, <b>39</b>J, to particular operating system locations of said RAM, beginning at the first bit location of said RAM. In so doing, control processor, <b>39</b>J, completes causing all operating system instructions of said contained SPAM message to be located at the appropriate operating system RAM locations of said decoder, <b>203</b>. Then automatically, under control of said commence-loading-operating-system instructions, control processor, <b>39</b>J, causes all buffer, non-operating system RAM, and non-operating system register locations of decoder, <b>203</b>, (except for buffer, <b>39</b>A) to be cleared; causes all other apparatus of decoder, <b>203</b>, to commence processing under control of the new operating system instructions; causes processor, <b>39</b>B, to commence receiving and processing information from buffer, <b>39</b>A; and commences waiting for information of a SPAM header under control, first, of a particular new operating system instruction that is located at a predetermined location said RAM associated with control processor, <b>39</b>J. (Simultaneously, at other stations where the decoders, <b>203</b>, are of the example #3 version, receiving said third SPAM message causes other apparatus to load the operating system instructions of the contained SPAM message of said third message at the appropriate operating system RAM locations of said decoders, <b>203</b>, and causes said decoders, <b>203</b>, to come under control of said instructions in the same fashion.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1261" num="1347">Subsequently, said remote station transmits additional operating system SPAM messages until one SPAM message has been transmitted that is addressed to each separate version of SPAM apparatus.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1262" num="1348">Receiving each message causes apparatus of each receiving station, in the fashions described above, to determine whether an apparatus of the apparatus version identified by the meter-monitor information of said message exists at said station, to input a contained SPAM message to an apparatus of said apparatus version if an apparatus of said apparatus version exists at said station, and to discard all information of said message if no apparatus of said apparatus version exists at said station. (Said contained messages that are addressed to apparatus such as decoder, <b>30</b>, PRAM controller, <b>20</b>, and switch controller, <b>20</b>A, that exist within the equipment case of a signal processor, <b>200</b>, are inputted to said apparatus from controller, <b>12</b>, via controller, <b>20</b>, rather than via matrix switch, <b>259</b>.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1263" num="1349">Receiving each contained SPAM message causes the apparatus version of said message, in the fashion described above, to record the operating system instructions and information of said message to at particular operating system locations at the RAMs and EOFS valves that control the operation of said apparatus and to commence operating under control of said instructions and information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1264" num="1350">Following the transmission of each message, for a particular interval of time no SPAM information is transmitted that is causes any processing at any apparatus of the apparatus version of message.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0074" num="0000">The Preferred SPAM Header</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1265" num="1351">An important feature of the preferred embodiment of the present invention is flexibility for expansion while continuing to accommodate, within the unified system, existing information requirements. Subscribers who have simple information demands must have capacity to receive and process simple SPAM messages with simple subscriber station apparatus. Such simple messages may contain, for example, only sixty-four alternate instances of SPAM execution segment binary information, and the optimal length of SPAM execution segment information for such subscribers would be six binary digits. Simultaneously, subscribers who have complex information demands must have capacity to receive and process more complex SPAM messages that control more extensive subscriber station apparatus. Controlling the subscriber station apparatus of subscribers who have complex information demands far more execution segment capacity than is provide by a system that has only six binary digits of execution segment information transmission capacity. And invariably, many different classes of subscriber will exist with different information demands and different optimal SPAM execution segment lengths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1266" num="1352">Two objectives of the unified system of the present invention are to provide capacity whereby any given transmission can transmit SPAM messages to all classes of subscribers and capacity whereby the apparatus of subscribers with complex information demands can process not only complex messages but also simple messages. More precisely, the present invention provides means and methods whereby SPAM messages of different execution segment lengths can be transmitted, intermixed on one transmission, and complex SPAM receiver apparatus with capacity to process long SPAM execution segment information can also process short SPAM execution segment information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1267" num="1353">In the preferred embodiment these objectives are realized by having SPAM header information identify not only the four alternate message compositions of the simplest preferred embodiment specified above but also many alternate versions of message composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1268" num="1354">In the preferred embodiment, the length of a SPAM header—and of the SPAM-header register memory of any given SPAM apparatus—is the length of one signal word which is one byte of eight binary digits. SPAM messages are composed of varying numbers and sequences of segments of highest priority, intermediate priority, and lowest priority segment information. Complex SPAM receiver apparatus have means and are preprogrammed to process at register memory execution segment information of varying lengths of binary information. And simple SPAM receiver apparatus are preprogrammed to process at RAM and/or ROM SPAM messages that are too complex to be processed at their register memories (if only to discard said messages).</div>
<heading id="h-0075">A Summary Example #11</heading>
<heading id="h-0076">And the General Case</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1269" num="1355">The full scope of the unified system of programming communication of the present invention comprehends and includes all of the above described apparatus and methods in all of their variations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1270" num="1356">An example #11 that focuses on generating and communicating information of farmers at a time in the future illustrates a few features of the full scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1271" num="1357">In February, 2027, farmers all over Europe make plans regarding which crops to plant for the 2027 growing season. Each farmer is confronted with the problem of deciding what mix of crops is most profitable to grow on his property, given his resources. Each farmer has a subscriber station that is identical to the station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> except that each station has two television recorder/players that are recorder/players, <b>217</b> and <b>217</b>A; two television tuners, <b>215</b> and <b>215</b>A; and a laser disk player, <b>232</b>. Particular farm information of the specific farm of each farmer is recorded in a file named MY_FARM.DAT on a disk at the A: disk drive of the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of each station. The recorded data includes, for example, data of the number and size of the individual parcels of property of the farmer's farm, the soil conditions of said parcels, the aspects of said parcels with respect to sunlight and shade, the history of crop rotation of said parcels, the farm equipment of said farmer, and the financial resources of said farmer. Each farmer's laser disc player, <b>232</b>, is loaded with a so-call “optical disk” on which is recorded a file named “PROPRIET.MOD” that contains encrypted information of a proprietary software module. When accessed, the instructions of said module cause a microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to analyze any given crop planting plan and generate information of a recommended planting plan and growing method that minimizes the expense of insect and other crop pest damage given maximum revenue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1272" num="1358">Elsewhere and at the same time, national planners of each member nation of the European Economic Community seek to formulate agricultural policy for the 2027 growing season and to communicate information of that policy to farmers, thereby influencing the farmers decisions regarding which crops to plant. Each nation has a national intermediate transmission station that is identical to the intermediate station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> except that it transmits output information of several individual television channels to receiver stations via a satellite in geosynchronous orbit over Europe rather than via a cable field distribution system. At the computer, <b>73</b>, of each national intermediate transmission station is local-formula-and-item information of specific data, in a file named NATIONAL.AGI, regarding proposed subsidy formulas and items regarding the various alternate crops that farmers of the nation may choose to grow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1273" num="1359">Simultaneously, other national planners of each nation seek to formulate other economic policies including tax and revenue raising policies and monetary policies. At the computer, <b>73</b>, of each national intermediate transmission station, in a file named NATIONAL.TAX, is local-formula-and-item information of specific proposed tax formulas and items regarding, for example, taxes on farm incomes and proposed depreciation schedules of farm equipment. And in a file named NATIONAL.MON is local-formula-and-item information of specific proposed money supply growth rates and interest rates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1274" num="1360">Each nation also has a plurality of local governments at which local planners seek to formulate local tax and revenue raising policies and welfare and subsidized employment policies. Each local government has a local intermediate transmission station that is identical to the intermediate station of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and that transmits multiplexed output information of several separate television channels via a cable field distribution system. At the computer, <b>73</b>, of each local intermediate transmission station, in a file named LOCAL.TAX, is local-formula-and-item information of specific proposed tax formulas and items regarding, for example, income taxes that relate to farmers and property taxes that relate to farm land and equipment. And in a file named LOCAL.EMP is local-formula-and-item information of specific proposed employment subsidy formulas relating to local unemployed persons which formulas vary with respect to the specific education levels of the unemployed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1275" num="1361">Just as government planners wish to communicate policy information to and receive response information from farmers, so too, businessmen wish to advertise to farmers the benefits of their goods and proprietary information services and to persuade farmers to respond by ordering their goods and services.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1276" num="1362">Each farmer's station has capacity and is preprogrammed to receive programming transmitted via satellite by a particular European master network origination and control station and the specific national intermediate transmission station of the specific nation of said farmer and is a subscriber station in the field distribution system of the local intermediate transmission station of the farmer's local government.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1277" num="1363">At 3:00 AM Greenwich Mean Time on Monday, Feb. 15, 2027, the signal processor of each receiver station in the nations of the European Economic Community—including each national and each local intermediate transmission station and each ultimate receiver station of a farmer—commences receiving information of the particular master transmission of said European master network station. Automatically, the controller, <b>20</b>, of the signal processor of each receiver station in said nations causes its oscillator, <b>6</b>, switch, <b>1</b>, and mixer, <b>3</b>, to input a selected frequency to its decoder, <b>30</b>, and causes said decoder, <b>30</b>, to commence processing the information of said frequency. Said selected frequency is the specific operating system master control frequency of the information preprogrammed at its station specific EPROM, <b>20</b>B. Automatically each receiver station that is equipped with a satellite earth station (<b>50</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6 or 250</figref> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) receives and inputs to its switch, <b>1</b>, information of a particular master transmission of said European master network station. Then the controller, <b>20</b>, of the signal processor of the signal processor system, <b>71</b>, of each intermediate transmission station (of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) in said nations causes the computer, <b>73</b>, of said station to cause apparatus of said station also to retransmit information of said master transmission on the frequency of a selected master channel transmission. Automatically each receiver station that is not equipped with a satellite earth station commences receiving and inputting to its switch, <b>1</b>, information of said master transmission that is retransmitted on the frequency of a selected master channel transmission of a selected intermediate transmission station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1278" num="1364">At 3:10 AM, GMT, said European master network station transmits particular SPAM message information, embedded in the information of said master transmission, including a SPAM end of file signal and the aforementioned sequence of SPAM messages that contain operating system instructions. In so doing, said European master network station inputs operating system instructions to all SPAM apparatus and receiver station computers, <b>73</b>, and microcomputers, <b>205</b>, thereby causing said apparatus and computers, <b>73</b> and <b>205</b>, as described above in “PREPROGRAMMING RECEIVER STATION OPERATING SYSTEMS,” to commence operating under control of the instructions of said operating systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1279" num="1365">Causing each signal processor at every receiver station in said nations to commence operating under control of its specific operating system instructions causes apparatus of each signal processor to commence processing sequentially information of a plurality of specific frequencies in the fashion of example #5 to detect program unit identification signal information. One frequency that is processed at each receiver station is the specific operating system master control frequency of the information preprogrammed at the station specific EPROM, <b>20</b>B, of said station. Said frequency is either said master transmission of said European master network station or a selected master channel transmission of a selected intermediate transmission station upon which information of said master transmission is retransmitted. Thus information of said master transmission is processed at each receiver station for program unit identification information of interest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1280" num="1366">In due course, various transmission stations commence embedding program unit identification signal information in programming transmissions and transmitting the transmissions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1281" num="1367">Transmitting the programming with said embedded program unit identification information causes signal processors at selected receiver stations each to commence selecting and receiving specific programming of interest in the fashion of “AUTOMATING U. R. STATIONS . . . RECEIVING SELECTED PROGRAMMING.” Automatically receiver stations all over said nations commence tuning to different transmissions and receiving selected programming that differs from receiver station to receiver station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1282" num="1368">At 3:59 PM, GMT on Monday, Feb. 15, 2027, said European master network station commences embedding in the information of said master transmission and transmitting program unit identification information of a particular combined medium television program, “Farm Plans of Europe.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1283" num="1369">Farmers and government planners all over Europe wish to receive and interact with the information of said program and have preprogrammed the apparatus of their stations to receive and combined to the programming transmission of said program. Thus so transmitting said program unit identification information of said “Farm Plans of Europe” program causes apparatus at the ultimate receiver stations of farmers in all of said nations to interconnect display (or other output apparatus) to the transmission of said program and to combine to the computer system of said transmission in the fashions described in example #10 and in “AUTOMATING U. R. STATIONS . . . MORE ON EXAMPLE #7 . . . RECEIVING SELECTED PROGRAMMING AND COMBINING SELECTED URS MICROCOMPUTERS, <b>205</b>, AUTOMATICALLY TO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM OF A SELECTED PROGRAMMING TRANSMISSION.” Automatically each ultimate receiver station that is equipped with a satellite earth station, <b>250</b>, commences transferring received information of said master transmission, via its matrix switch, <b>258</b>, to its divider, <b>4</b>, (thereby inputting said received information to its computer, <b>205</b>, and its decoder, <b>203</b>) and commences transferring the television output information of its microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to its television monitor, <b>202</b>M, thereby causing display and emission of the television images and sound of said output information. Automatically each receiver station that is not equipped with a satellite earth station tunes its tuner, <b>215</b>, to receive the specific master channel transmission of its specific selected local intermediate transmission station (which retransmits the master transmission of said European European master network station on its master channel transmission) and commences transferring received information of said master channel transmission, via its matrix switch, <b>258</b>, to its divider, <b>4</b>, (thereby inputting said received information to its computer, <b>205</b>, and its decoder, <b>203</b>) and commences transferring the television output information of its microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to its television monitor, <b>202</b>M, thereby causing display and emission of the television images and sound of said output information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1284" num="1370">At 3:59:45 PM, GMT said European master network station embeds in the information of said master transmission and transmits a SPAM message that is addressed to the ITS computers, <b>73</b>, of intermediate stations that are local stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1285" num="1371">Receiving said message causes each of said local intermediate station automatically to tune selected receiver apparatus to the specific satellite transmission that is the particular second television channel output transmission of its specific national intermediate transmission station and to input the embedded SPAM information of said transmission to its computer, <b>73</b>, thereby causing said computer, <b>73</b>, to come under control of the output transmission of the computer, <b>73</b>, of its national intermediate station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1286" num="1372">At 3:59:55 PM, GMT, said European master network station transmits end of file signal information then invokes broadcast control of each national intermediate transmission station computer, <b>73</b>, and each ultimate receiver station microcomputer, <b>205</b>, that receives SPAM information of said master transmission. Automatically said European master network station commences controlling directly the computers, <b>73</b>, of said national intermediate stations and the microcomputers, <b>205</b>, of said ultimate receiver stations. And said master station causes each national intermediate station computer, <b>73</b>, to embed in its particular second television channel transmission and to transmit end of file signal information then to invoke broadcast control of the computers, <b>73</b>, of its specific local intermediate transmission stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1287" num="1373">At 4:00 PM, GMT, said European master network station commences transmitting the conventional television information of said “Farm Plans of Europe” program.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1288" num="1374">Immediately, said European master network station causes ultimate receiver stations to obscure all video information of said master transmission and display only locally generated information and causes all national intermediate station computers, <b>73</b>, and ultimate receiver station microcomputers, <b>205</b>, that are combined to the transmission of said master station to commence receiving SPAM information embedded in the full frame video of said master transmission. Said master station transmits SPAM information that is addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, that causes said microcomputers, <b>205</b>, to commence combining and displaying locally titles information (while sound is emitted of transmitted audio theme music) in the fashion described in “CONTROLLING COMPUTER-BASED COMBINED MEDIA OPERATIONS.” Then said master station transmits SPAM information that is addressed to ITS computers, <b>73</b>, of intermediate stations that are national stations and to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, which SPAM information causes decoder apparatus to commence receiving SPAM information embedded in the full frame video of said master transmission at each national intermediate station and each ultimate receiver station where a microcomputer, <b>205</b>, is combined to the computer system of said master transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1289" num="1375">Then said European master network station causes said ultimate receiver stations each to commence receiving and emitting at its speaker system, <b>261</b>, sound information of a selected transmission that transmits audio language information of said “Farm Plans of Europe” program in the specific language that is the primary language of its subscriber. On a selected secondary transmission, said master station transmits, in a fashion well known in the art, a spectrum of radio frequencies containing a plurality of individual frequency transmission each of which expresses the audio of said program in a separate European language including minority languages such as Flemish, Welsh, Basque, etc. (Each local intermediate station receives and retransmits said spectrum on a particular channel frequency spectrum.) Particular specific primary language information is preprogrammed at specific SPAM apparatus (such as, for example, radio decoders, <b>211</b>). Said master station embeds and transmits particular specific-language SPAM information addressed to said specific SPAM apparatus, and receiving said specific-language information causes said specific apparatus at each ultimate receiver station to tune and emit the sound of the specific primary language of the subscriber of said station (for example, in the fashion of AUTOMATING U. R. STATIONS . . . COORDINATING A STEREO SIMULCAST.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1290" num="1376">Next said European master network station transmits in the full frame video of said master transmission a SPAM message that is addressed to ITS computers, <b>73</b>, of intermediate stations that are national stations and that contains information segment information of a particular national level intermediate generation set. Receiving said message causes each national intermediate transmission station to input to and execute at its computer, <b>73</b>, the information of said set. (The information of said set and the processing and functioning caused by executing said information are described more fully below.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1291" num="1377">Said European master network station then transmits a series of SPAM messages that cause ultimate receiver stations to commence processing combined medium programming of said “Farm Plans of Europe” program and displaying (or otherwise outputting) combined medium information in a particular fashion. First, said master station transmits a SPAM message that causes the signal processor, <b>200</b>, of each ultimate receiver station to cause its oscillator, <b>6</b>, switch, <b>1</b>, and mixer, <b>3</b>, to input the specific operating system master control frequency of its EPROM, <b>20</b>B, continuously to its decoder, <b>30</b>, thereby causing said decoder, <b>30</b>, to commence processing the information of said frequency continuously. (In so doing, said master station causes SPAM information embedded in said master transmission to be inputted to said signal processor, <b>200</b>, continuously irrespective of the transmissions inputted to decoders, <b>145</b>, <b>203</b>, or <b>282</b>, and prevents signal processor, <b>200</b>, from identifying any other programming of interest at its station.) Then said master station embeds and transmits in the full frame video of said master transmission a SPAM message that is addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, that contains information segment information of a particular first program instruction set. Transmitting said message causes the all ultimate receiver station microcomputers, <b>205</b>, that are combined to the computer system of the transmission of said master station to commence executing the instructions of said set and to commence generating local video, audio, and print overlay and output information in the fashions described above. Then said master station transmit a SPAM message that causes all SPAM decoder apparatus of all national intermediate stations and all ultimate receiver stations with microcomputers, <b>205</b>, combined to the transmission of said master station to commence receiving SPAM information embedded in only the normal transmission location of said master transmission; commences embedding SPAM information only in the normal transmission location; and commences transmitting the conventional video of said “Farm Plans of Europe” program. And as said master station transmits conventional video and audio information that shows visually and describes aurally information of general interest to farmers in all of said nations, said master station commences periodically embedding and transmitting SPAM messages that are addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, and that cause specific information of each farmer to be generated, under control of the instructions of said program instruction set, at each ultimate receiver station and that cause locally generated information periodically to be displayed or emitted as sound or printed in the fashion of example #10 at each ultimate subscriber station whose microcomputer, <b>205</b>, is combined to the computer system of said master transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1292" num="1378">In the mean time, executing their inputted information of said national level intermediate generation set causes the computers, <b>73</b>, of said national intermediate stations each to generate information of a specific local level intermediate generation set in the fashion that receiving the intermediate generation set of Q caused different intermediate stations to compute and incorporate specific formula-and-item-of-this-transmission information into generally applicable information of the program instruction sets of Q.1 and Q.2 in example #10. Said national level intermediate generation set includes generally applicable information of national agriculture and economic policy information, of local tax formulas and items and employment subsidy formulas, and of farmers' recommended crop planting plans. Said national level set also contains a particular projected market price at which farmers are projected to be able to sell each alternate crop. Each price is projected on the basis of projected demand for each crop and the aggregate quantity that European farmers are projected to supply. In addition, said national level set contains information of the aggregate amount of farm borrowing. Executing the information of said set causes the computer, <b>73</b>, of each national intermediate transmission station to access its specific NATIONAL.AGI, NATIONAL.TAX, and NATIONAL.MON files and to compute formula-and-item-of-this-transmission information specific subsidy formulas and items regarding each alternate crop that national farmers may grow, regarding specific tax formulas and depreciation schedules, and regarding specific monetary growth and interest rates, all given the specific market price information of said national level intermediate generation set and the projected aggregate amount of farm borrowing. Having computed said formula-and-item-of-this-transmission information, each computer, <b>73</b>, is caused to incorporate said information selectively into selected generally applicable information of said national level set, thereby generating at each of said computers, <b>73</b>, a specific local level intermediate generation set that applies to the local intermediate transmission stations of its nation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1293" num="1379">After an interval of time that is long enough for each national intermediate generation station to generate its specific local level intermediate generation set, said European master network station embeds and transmits a SPAM message that is addressed to ITS, computers, <b>73</b>, of intermediate stations that are national stations and that instructs said stations to embed and transmit their specific local intermediate sets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1294" num="1380">Receiving said message causes the computer, <b>73</b>, of each national intermediate station to embed in the normal location of its particular second television channel transmission and to transmit a particular SPAM message that is addressed to ITS computers, <b>73</b>, and that contains information segment information of its specific local level intermediate generation set.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1295" num="1381">Receiving the specific SPAM message of its national intermediate station causes the computer, <b>73</b>, of each local intermediate station to execute the contained local level intermediate generation set of said message and to generate information of a specific program instruction set in the fashion that executing the intermediate generation set of Q caused different intermediate stations in example #10 to generate their specific program instruction sets of Q.1 or Q.2. Executing the information of its local level set causes the computer, <b>73</b>, of each local intermediate station to access its specific LOCAL.TAX and LOCAL.EMP files and to compute formula-and-item-of-this-transmission information of specific local income and property tax formulas and local employment subsidy formulas, all given the specific market price information, the projected aggregate amount of farm borrowing, the specific national subsidy formulas and items regarding each alternate crop that national farmers may grow, the specific national tax formulas and depreciation schedules, and the specific national monetary growth and interest rates that are information of its local level intermediate generation set. Automatically, each computer, <b>73</b>, of a local intermediate station incorporates its computed information selectively into selected generally applicable information of said local level intermediate generation set, compiles information, and links information, thereby generating its specific program instruction set.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1296" num="1382">At 4:29:50 PM, GMT, after an interval of time that is long enough for each local intermediate generation station to generate its specific program instruction set, said European master network station transmits a particular SPAM first-master-cueing message (#11) that is addressed to ITS computers, <b>73</b>, of intermediate stations that are national stations. Receiving said message causes each national intermediate station to generate and embed in the normal location of its particular second television channel transmission a particular SPAM first-national-cueing message (#11) that is addressed to ITS computers, <b>73</b>, of intermediate stations that are local stations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1297" num="1383">Receiving said message causes each local intermediate station to commence playing prerecorded programming loaded at its recorder, <b>76</b>, and transmitting said programming to its field distribution system, <b>93</b>, on the television channel transmission that is the master channel transmission of said intermediate station. In so doing, each local intermediate station commences transmitting television information of a national and local segment of the “Farm Plans of Europe” program. (Each national intermediate station can have transmitted said prerecorded programming to its local intermediate stations and caused said stations to organize said programming in the fashion of examples #8 and #9 or, alternatively, said first-national-cueing message (#11) could cause each local station to commence transmitting on its master channel transmission the its received television transmission of the second television channel output transmission of its specific national intermediate transmission station.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1298" num="1384">Automatically each ultimate receiver station that is not equipped with a satellite earth station (and which is, as a consequence, receiving the master transmission of said European master station retransmitted on the master channel transmission of its local intermediate transmission station) commences receiving the programming transmitted by the recorder, <b>76</b>, of its local intermediate station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1299" num="1385">At 4:29:55 PM, GMT, said European master network station embeds in its master transmission and transmits a particular SPAM second-master-cueing message (#11) that is addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1300" num="1386">Only ultimate receiver stations that are equipped with and that receive the information of said master transmission directly by means of satellite earth station apparatus receive said second-master-cueing message (#11), and receiving said message causes said stations each to receive and process the combined medium programming of the television channel transmission that is the master channel transmission of its particular local intermediate transmission station (of which transmission information is preprogrammed at its EPROM, <b>20</b>B). Automatically, a tuner, <b>215</b>, is tuned at each of said stations to receive the particular master channel transmission of the EPROM, <b>20</b>B, of said station and apparatus of said station interconnects to input the received master channel transmission to the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, and the decoder, <b>203</b>, of said station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1301" num="1387">In due course, each recorder, <b>76</b>, transmits prerecorded end of file information then a particular transmit-program-instruction-set SPAM message (#11) addressed to ITS computers, <b>73</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1302" num="1388">In the fashion of example #9, each local intermediate station detects the particular SPAM message of its recorder, <b>76</b>, at its decoder, <b>77</b>, and receiving its particular message causes each station to embed and transmit end of file signal information then a particular first SPAM message that is addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, and that contains complete information of its particular program instruction set. (In example #11, the local stations are preprogrammed in such a fashion that receiving its specific transmit-program-instruction-set message (#11) causes each station to transmit the program instruction set generated by the local intermediate generation set of its national intermediate station rather than by a prerecorded intermediate generation set previously transmitted by its recorder, <b>76</b>.) Subsequently, additional SPAM messages that are embedded in said prerecorded programming and that are addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, are transmitted by said recorder, <b>76</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1303" num="1389">Receiving the particular first SPAM message of its local intermediate station causes apparatus of the subscriber station of each farmer to execute the contained program instruction set of said message at the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of said station and to commence generating the specific combined medium output information of its subscriber station. And receiving said additional SPAM messages causes apparatus at each subscriber station of a farmer to display or otherwise output (or to cease displaying or otherwise outputting) combined medium program of said national and local segment of the “Farm Plans of Europe” program. Automatically, the display and output apparatus of each farmer's station commences displaying and outputting television picture image, sound, and print information of the national and local agricultural, economic, tax, and employment subsidy policies combined periodically with related locally generated information of specific relevance to each farmer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1304" num="1390">So executing a specific contained program instruction set causes each microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to generate a specific so-called “optimal” solution for its particular farmer's problem of deciding what mix of crops is most profitable to grow on his property, given his resources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1305" num="1391">First, each microcomputer, <b>205</b>, accesses the specific information of its particular farmer. Automatically, under control of its specific received program instruction set, each microcomputer, <b>205</b>, accesses the file, MY_FARM.DAT, that is prerecorded on the disk loaded at its A: disk drive and also accesses the encrypted “PROPRIET.MOD” file that is prerecorded at the laser disc player, <b>232</b>, of each farmer's station (the information of which last named file is prerecorded by any one of a plurality of proprietary services companies whose information any given farmer may acquire and the information of which varies from farmer's station to farmer's station).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1306" num="1392">To access the information of its encrypted “PROPRIET.MOD” file, the instructions of its particular program instruction set cause each microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to decrypt the information of said file and enter the decrypted information of said file at particular RAM. In so doing, said instructions also cause each signal processor, <b>200</b>, to retain meter information of the decryption of said file. (Selected stations that are preprogrammed to retain monitor information are also caused to retain monitor information.) The information of said file is embedded in the so-called “full frame” video at a laser disc loaded at the disk player, <b>232</b>, of each station intermixed with SPAM messages that control the decryption and metering of the information of said file. Automatically, at the beginning of a particular interval during which its local intermediate station transmits no SPAM message information to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, instructions of its particular program instruction set cause each microcomputer, <b>205</b>, to instruct its signal processor, <b>200</b>, to cause its laser disk player, <b>232</b>, to play. Then, in the fashion of example #7, apparatus of each station are caused to decrypt and retain meter information of the decryption of the encrypted information of said file. (At each station, in a predetermined fashion that is controlled by the instructions of its program instruction set, apparatus is caused, to input the received television information transmitted by the recorder, <b>76</b>, of its local intermediate station directly from its tuner, <b>215</b>, to its TV monitor, <b>202</b>M then to input the decrypted information of its “PROPRIET.MOD” file to its microcomputer, <b>205</b>, via its decoder, <b>203</b>, then to recommence inputting said received television information from its tuner, <b>215</b>, to its TV monitor, <b>202</b>M, via its divider, <b>4</b>, and microcomputer, <b>205</b>.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1307" num="1393">Then using linear programming techniques that are well known in the art, each farmer's microcomputer, <b>205</b>, under control of the particular program instruction set generated and transmitted by its local intermediate station, computes its particular farmer's “optimal” crop planting plan by making reference to said farmer's specific data that includes, for example, the number and size of the individual parcels of property of the farmer's farm, the soil conditions of said parcels, the aspects of said parcels with respect to sunlight and shade, the history of crop rotation of said parcels, the farm equipment of said farmer, and the financial resources of said farmer; by using said data as so-called “constraints”; and by applying information of said program instruction set. Said information that is applied includes the specific market price information and projected aggregate amount of farm borrowing transmitted by said European master network control station as generally applicable information in its outputted national level intermediate generation set; the specific national subsidy formulas and items regarding each alternate crop that national farmers may grow, the specific national tax formulas and depreciation schedules, and the specific national monetary growth and interest rates that were incorporated at the national intermediate station of each farmer into the generally applicable information of said national level intermediate generation set to generate its local level intermediate generation set; and the specific local income and property tax formulas and local employment subsidy formulas that were incorporated at the local intermediate station of each farmer into the generally applicable information of its received local level intermediate generation set to generate its program instruction set (which is the program instruction set received at said farmer's station).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1308" num="1394">The specific “optimal” crop planting plans so computed vary from station to station and include budget information of projected revenues, expenses, and profits. The plan of one particular farmer calls for planting forty acres of oats and sixty acres of wheat and projects profits of fifteen thousand units of local currency. The plan of a particular second farmer calls for planting fifteen acres of broad beans and five acres of tomatoes and projects profits of thirty thousand units of local currency. The plan of a particular third farmer calls for planting ten acres of red tulips and two acres of blue tulips and projects profits of twenty thousand units of local currency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1309" num="1395">Each specific “optimal” crop planting plan may also include so-called “sensitivity analyses” that are well known in the art and information of alternate planting plans that are close to but not quite optimal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1310" num="1396">Automatically, under control of its received program instruction set, the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of its farmer's station records complete information of said farmer's crop planting plan at its A: disk in a file named PLANTING.DAT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1311" num="1397">Then automatically, under control of its particular program instruction set, each farmer's microcomputer, <b>205</b>, computes and retains information of a particular schedule of spot commercials. Information of twenty-six specific potential commercials of any given schedule are included in the information of its set, and the specific commercials include, for example, commercials for a particular new farm truck, a particular new farm tractor, a particular new farm disk harrow, software of a particular new “PROPRIET.MOD” module for analyzing crop planting plans and generating recommended planting plans in a “new improved fashion,” etc. Under control of the instructions of its particular set, by analyzing the budget information of its farmers crop planting plan, each microcomputer, <b>205</b>, automatically identifies four commercial spots that are of a particular possible highest potential value to its farmer. For example, by analyzing equipment depreciation information, one microcomputer, <b>205</b>, determines that its farmer has an old truck, a new tractor, and a new disk harrow and selects, as one of its four commercials, the commercial of the new truck. Meanwhile, another microcomputer, <b>205</b>, determines that its farmer has an old truck, a new tractor, and a old disk harrow and selects the commercial of the new truck because a new truck is costlier than a disk harrow and may be more valuable to its farmer. Automatically, the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of each station inputs to the signal processor, <b>200</b>, of its station particular schedule information of its four identified commercial spots.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1312" num="1398">In due course, the recorder, <b>76</b>, of each local intermediate station transmits further additional SPAM messages that are embedded in its prerecorded programming and that are addressed to URS microcomputers, <b>205</b>, then transmits a particular local-second-cueing message (#11) that is addressed to ITS computers, <b>73</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1313" num="1399">Receiving the further additional SPAM messages of its local intermediate station causes apparatus at each subscriber station of a farmer to display or otherwise output (or to cease displaying or otherwise outputting) further combined medium programming of said national and local segment of the “Farm Plans of Europe” program. Automatically, in the fashion of example #10, the display and output apparatus of each farmer's station commences displaying and outputting generally applicable television picture image, sound, and print information of a crop planting plan combined periodically with related locally generated specific crop planting plan information of its specific farmer. Automatically, crop and budget information of the aforementioned optimal crop planting plan of each farmer is explained in the outputted the generally applicable programming and is displayed, emitted in sound, and printed at the station of each farmer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1314" num="1400">Then so transmitting a particular local-second-cueing message (#11) at each local intermediate station causes a decoder, <b>77</b>, at each station to detect the local-second-cueing message (#11) transmitted at its station and input said message to the computer, <b>73</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1315" num="1401">Receiving its local-second-cueing message (#11) causes the computer, <b>73</b>, of each local intermediate station to embed SPAM message information that is addressed to URS signal processors, <b>200</b>, in the normal location of its master channel transmission then after a particular interval to cause the video recorder/player, <b>78</b>, of its station to commence playing and to cause apparatus of its station to transmit the output of said recorder/player, <b>78</b>, to the field distribution system of said station on the television transmission of a particular second television channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1316" num="1402">Transmitting said SPAM message information at its local intermediate station causes apparatus of each farmer's station to receive and input said information to the signal processor, <b>200</b>, of said station, and receiving said information causes the signal processor, <b>200</b>, of said station to cause its tuner, <b>215</b>A, to commence receiving the transmission of the particular second television channel of its local intermediate station; to cause apparatus of said station to interconnect to transfer the transmission received at said tuner, <b>215</b>A, to a selected video recorder/player, <b>217</b> or <b>217</b>A; and to cause said video recorder, <b>217</b> or <b>217</b>A, to prepare to record selected programming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1317" num="1403">Then after an interval that is long enough for each of its subscriber stations to prepare a selected recorder/player, <b>217</b> or <b>217</b>A, to record selected programming, each computer, <b>73</b>, causes said recorder, <b>78</b>, to commence playing. In so doing, each computer, <b>73</b>, causes twenty-six program units of commercial spot programming to be transmitted, in series, to its subscriber stations. Each program unit is preceded by embedded program unit identification information of its own that is addressed to URS signal processors, <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1318" num="1404">Automatically, the signal processor, <b>200</b>, of each station causes its recorder/players, <b>217</b> and <b>217</b>A, in the fashion that applied to computer, <b>73</b>, and recorders, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>, in example #8, to record and then to organize to play the selected programming of the selected commercial spots of its station. Automatically, a decoder, <b>282</b>A, at the tuner, <b>215</b>A, of each station detects each datum of program unit identification information received at its tuner, <b>215</b>A, and inputs each datum to the signal processor, <b>200</b>, of its station. Automatically, said signal processor, <b>200</b>, causes a selected recorder/player, <b>217</b> or <b>217</b>A, to record selected programming then, after a particular last unit is received, to organize the recorded programming to play according to its schedule previously inputted by its microcomputer, <b>205</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1319" num="1405">In due course, the instructions of the program instruction set received at each farmer's station cause a particular module, TELEPHON.EXE, to be recorded at a particular disk drive of the microcomputer, <b>205</b>, of each farmer's station (in the fashion of the file, “SHOPPING.EXE” in example #10) which, when executed, will permit the farmer to modify the information of his specific crop planting plan and associated budget and to transmit the specific information of his plan (as modified if modified) to a particular data collection computer at a remote station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1320" num="1406">Then a particular second-cueing message (#11) that is embedded at the end of the prerecorded national and local segment of the “Farm Plans of Europe” programming at the recorder, <b>76</b>, of each local intermediate station and that is addressed to URS signal processors, <b>200</b>, is transmitted and causes the signal processor, <b>200</b>, of each farmer's station to separate the apparatus of its station from the master channel transmission and second television of its local intermediate station; to cause its recorder/players, <b>217</b> and <b>217</b>A, to commence playing their prerecorded commercial spot programming in the fashion of example #8, and to cause apparatus of its station to interconnect so as to commence generating and displaying (or otherwise outputting) combined medium programming of the programming transmitted by its selected recorder/player, <b>217</b> or <b>217</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1321" num="1407">Playing each commercial spot causes the combined medium information of said spot to display information of a particular commercial product such as a truck or a particular service such as a software package; to access the prerecorded “A:PLANTING.DAT” disk file information of a farmer's crop planting plan; in a fashion well known in the art, to generate cost/benefit financial analysis of the incremental benefit of acquiring and using the displayed product or service (by comparison with the farmer's existing product or service of like kind); and to display (or otherwise output) information of said analysis (if said analysis results in a positive net present benefit).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1322" num="1408">After studying his specific crop planting plan and associated budget projections, his associated sensitivity analyses, and the output information of the selected commercial spots of his station, each farmer loads and runs his prerecorded module, TELEPHON.EXE, in a fashion well known in the art. Under control of the instructions of the TELEPHON.EXE module of his station controlling the operation of his signal processor, <b>200</b>, each farmer enters information at his local input, <b>225</b>, that modifies the information of his file, “PLANTING.DAT,” to suit his own wishes and inclinations then executes particular information of said TELEPHON.EXE module that causes the instructions of said module to cause his signal processor, <b>200</b>, to transmit the information of his “PLANTING.DAT” file, via telephone network in the fashion of example #10, to a computer at a particular remote data collection station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1323" num="1409">Over the course of a particular time such as two days, computers at remote data collection stations receive data automatically from each farmer of said nations which data indicates the specific quantity of each crop that each farmer expects to harvest during the 2027 growing season. Automatically, the received data is aggregated, in a fashion well known in the art, at the computer of said European master network origination and control station which allows planners at said station to modify and refine the variables of the national intermediate generation set of said station, especially the projected market prices at which farmers are projected to be able to sell each alternate crop.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1324" num="1410">The aggregated data is also distributed automatically to computers at the national and local intermediate transmission stations, enabling national and local planners to vary and refine the policy variables of their stations' local-formula-and-item information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1325" num="1411">Then, at 3:59 PM, on Thursday, Feb. 18, 2027, the cycle of generating and communicating information of farmers is repeated using the refined variables. Once again farmers receive optimal planting plans, given the new refined variables, and respond with their own plans, causing data to be aggregated at the computer of said European master network origination and control station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1326" num="1412">In an iterative fashion well known in the art, this cycle is repeated several times until a satisfactory European master agricultural plan is achieved. Invariable early cycles result in excessive planned planting, but as projected variables are refined in subsequent planning cycles, the excesses are eliminated. Ultimately the planners are able to establish policy formula and item variables at levels that yield socially beneficial economic conditions while enabling farmers individually to maximize the profitability of their planting plans, subject to their individual resources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1327" num="1413">In this fashion, the unified system of programming communication of the present invention facilitates efficient economic planning and decision making.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-1328" num="1414">It is obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the foregoing is presented by way of example only and that the invention is not to be unduly restricted thereby since modifications may be made in the structure of the various parts or in the methods of their functioning without functionally departing from the spirit of the invention. Any SPAM message and any other programming transmission can be caused, through encryption/decryption and other SPAM regulating techniques of the present invention, to take affect fully only selected stations and station apparatus. Because any transmission station can invoke any SPAM controlled function by transmitting a SPAM message with meter-monitor segment information, invoking any given SPAM controlled function can also cause meter information and or monitor information to be processed in the fashions described above at apparatus and stations where said controlled function is invoked. Intermediate transmission stations can be equipped with SPAM regulating capacity such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, monitoring capacity such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and control information switching and bus communications capacity such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. Controlling such capacity by means of transmitted SPAM messages, a remote network origination and control station can transmit programming to intermediate transmission stations, regulate and meter the use of said programming at said stations, monitor the use and usage of said programming at said stations, and control communication of control information at said stations all in the fashions that apply above to ultimate receiver stations. And any given transmission station can cause its receiver stations to function automatically not only in the fashions described above in the sections on automating ultimate receiver stations but in any appropriate fashion that a network origination and control station can cause intermediate transmission stations to function automatically.</div>
