<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a medical optical observation instrument and, in particular, to a surgical microscope. Additionally, the invention relates to a method for contrasting polarization-rotating tissue in an image, obtained by means of a medical optical observation instrument, of an observation object containing a polarization-rotating tissue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">During neurosurgical interventions, nerve fiber tracts can only be differentiated very badly from surrounding tissue. Here, there is a risk of damaging nerve fiber tracts during tumor or vessel operations and therefore impair functional areas. It is for this reason that there is a need for improved intra-surgical contrasting of the nerve fiber tracts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">This object is achieved by a medical optical observation instrument according to claim <b>1</b> and by a method for contrasting polarization-rotating tissue according to claim <b>15</b>. The dependent claims contain advantageous embodiments of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A medical optical observation instrument according to the invention comprises an illumination system, which comprises an illumination beam path for illuminating an observation object with illumination light. Furthermore, it comprises an observation system, which comprises an observation beam path for producing an image of the observation object with the aid of reflected illumination light emanating, referred to as observation light below, from the observation object and at least one camera, to which illumination light is fed for recording a digital image of the observation object, and a device for contrasting polarization-rotating tissue, such as, in particular, nerve fiber tracts, in the observation object, which device is connected to the at least one camera for receiving the digital image of the observation object. The device for contrasting polarization-rotating tissue in the observation object comprises:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">at least one illumination apparatus, arranged in the illumination system, comprising a polarization portion, which is suitable for producing illumination light with a linear polarization that is adjustable in the plane perpendicular to the optical axis of the illumination beam path,</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">at least one linear analyzer, arranged in the observation system and rotatable about the optical axis of the observation beam path, for determining the polarization direction of the observation light,</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">an image processing apparatus connected to the at least one camera for receiving the digital image of the observation object, which image processing apparatus establishes and outputs an image contrast value representing the image contrast in the digital image of the observation object, and</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0008">an optimization apparatus connected to the image processing apparatus for receiving the image contrast value and connected to the at least one rotatable linear analyzer and the polarization portion for outputting actuation signals, which optimization apparatus maximizes the image contrast value by adapting the polarization direction of the illumination light and the polarization direction of the linear analyzer with the aid of the actuation signals.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0009">The present invention can be used, in particular, for contrasting nerve fiber tracts. What is used here is that anisotropic substances of the nerve fibers, such as the myelin components, rotate the polarization direction of polarized light. By way of example, this is described in A. Axer, T. Rings, M. Axer and D. Graf von Keyserlingk, Bildverarbeitung für die Medizin [“Image processing for medicine”] 2001, Informatik aktuell [“Contemporary information technology”] 2001, pages 330 to 334. Therefore, what can be achieved by adjusting the orientation of the polarization direction of the linear analyzer in relation to the orientation of the polarization direction in the illumination light when nerve fiber tracts are illuminated by suitably linearly polarized light is that the linearly polarized light rotated by the nerve fiber tracts substantially can pass the linear analyzer, whereas light that was reflected by tissue in the surroundings of the nerve fiber tracts and therefore did not experience a rotation in the polarization direction substantially cannot pass the linear analyzer. Consequently, the intensity values of pixels depicting the nerve fiber tracts are higher than the intensity values of pixels depicting no nerve fiber tracts in the image recorded by the camera when the linear analyzer is adjusted, and so a high image contrast is created. Therefore, within the scope of the present invention, there is an adjustment of the linear analyzer in relation to the orientation of the polarization direction in the illumination light such that high contrasting of the nerve fiber tracts is achieved by maximizing the image contrast. Here, by rotating the polarization portion of the illumination apparatus, it is possible to set a polarization direction in the linearly polarized illumination light which is suitable in view of the ideal effect of the nerve fiber tracts when rotating the polarization direction. Since the adjustment of the orientation of the polarization direction of the linear analyzer in relation to the orientation of the polarization direction in the illumination light can be implemented in an automated manner on the basis of the image recorded by the camera, the medical optical observation instrument according to the invention enables automated contrasting of nerve fiber tracts. Thus, in the method according to the invention for contrasting nerve fiber tracts, a digital image of the observation object is recorded with the aid of the cameras of a medical optical observation instrument according to the invention, the image contrast is established in the digital image of the observation object, and the image contrast is maximized by adapting the polarization direction of the illumination light and the polarization direction of the linear analyzer. In addition to contrasting nerve fiber tracts, the invention can also be used in an analogous manner for contrasting different tissue which rotates the polarization direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0010">In particular, the medical optical observation instrument may comprise an observation system with two stereoscopic subsystems, wherein each stereoscopic subsystem comprises a stereoscopic beam path and a camera is arranged in each one of the stereoscopic subsystems, with observation light for recording a digital partial image of the observation object being fed to said camera such that the digital image of the observation object is a stereoscopic image. In this case it is possible to create e.g. a purely digital surgical microscope, which enables a contrasted image of polarization-rotating tissue as soon as the image contrast of the camera images is optimized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0011">If an eyepiece and a first beam splitter are arranged in each one of the stereoscopic subsystems in the medical optical observation instrument, wherein the first beam splitter guides one portion of the observation light situated in the stereoscopic subsystem in the direction of the camera of the stereoscopic subsystem and another portion of the observation light situated in the stereoscopic subsystem in the direction of the eyepiece of the stereoscopic subsystem, then it is also possible to generate a purely optical image with contrasted polarization-rotating tissue as soon as the image contrast of the camera images is optimized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0012">If, moreover, a display and a second beam splitter are arranged in each one of the stereoscopic subsystems, wherein the second beam splitter is situated between the first beam splitter and the eyepiece and couples a beam path emanating from the display in the direction of the eyepiece into the stereoscopic partial beam path of the stereoscopic subsystem, then a hybrid image can be offered to the observer, in which hybrid image a conventional optical image of the observation object without contrasted polarization-rotating tissue is superposed on an electronically generated image, which highlights the polarization-rotating tissue. Here, it is possible to arrange the analyzer in the beam path of the stereoscopic subsystem between the first beam splitter and the camera such that the illumination light fed to the eyepiece does not experience intensity losses since it does not pass the linear analyzer. By contrast, the images recorded by the cameras show contrasted polarization-rotating tissue after optimization of the image contrast; by way of electronic image processing, this can be superposed on the non-contrasted image generated purely optically for the purpose of generating the hybrid image. If, moreover, a shutter is arranged between the first beam splitter and the second beam splitter in each one of the stereoscopic partial beam paths, it is possible to alternate between, firstly, an optical display or hybrid display and, secondly, a purely electronic display of the contrasted polarization-rotating tissue. For the purposes of the purely electronic display of the contrasted polarization-rotating tissue, the shutters are introduced into the beam path between the beam splitters such that only an image shown by means of the display reaches the eyepieces. Here, a purely electronic display or hybrid display also renders it possible to highlight the polarization-rotating tissue by false-color displays, contour lines or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0013">In the medical optical observation instrument according to the invention, the illumination apparatus may be configured in such a way that it comprises an illumination light source and, as a polarization portion, a linear polarizer, rotatable about the optical axis of the illumination beam path, for polarizing the illumination light emanating from the illumination light source. In this case, it is possible to make use of a simple illumination light source which does not emit polarizing light. Alternatively, the illumination apparatus may comprise an illumination light source emitting linearly polarized light as a polarization portion, which illumination light source is rotatably mounted about the optical axis of the illumination beam path. By way of example, a laser, an incandescent lamp or a luminescence emitter such as a gas discharge lamp, a light-emitting diode, etc. can be used as illumination light source. If a laser is used, it is possible to use an infrared laser. It is possible to use an infrared laser if there is an electronic display or hybrid display of the contrasted polarization-rotating tissue. The profile of the polarization-rotating tissue can be established on the basis of the infrared image, which is not visible in the eyepieces, and it can be converted into a visible image which is then coupled into the illumination beam path of the respective stereoscopic subsystem in the direction of the eyepiece via the second beam splitter by means of the display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0014">The illumination light source may comprise a primary light source emitting the illumination light, a secondary light source, an optical waveguide with an input end and an output end, and a coupling apparatus for coupling the illumination light into the input end of the optical waveguide. In this embodiment of the illumination light source, the output end of the optical waveguide is the secondary light source. The use of an optical waveguide renders it possible to arrange the primary light source at a distance from the medical optical observation instrument. In general, the primary light sources need to be cooled, which may lead to vibrations. The use of an optical waveguide renders it possible to decouple the medical optical observation instrument from the vibrations created by the cooling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0015">If a light source emitting polarized light is used as a primary light source, the optical waveguide may comprise at least one polarization-maintaining fiber. By way of example, it is possible to use an infrared laser emitting polarized light, the light of which is coupled into the at least one polarization-maintaining fiber. The light from a further light source, which e.g. emits unpolarized visible light, can then be coupled into the remaining fibers of the optical waveguide. However, in principle, it is also possible to configure all fibers of the optical waveguide to maintain polarization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0016">If the illumination light source comprises a primary light source that emits unpolarized light and a linear polarizer for polarizing the light, it is advantageous if the linear polarizer is arranged between the output end of the optical waveguide and the observation object, since the optical waveguide then need not comprise any polarization-maintaining fibers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0017">In an advantageous development of the medical optical observation instrument according to the invention, the device for contrasting polarization-rotating tissue comprises:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0018">a navigation data input for receiving navigation data from a navigation system,</li> <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0019">a data input for receiving pre-surgical data, e.g. from a storage medium or a tomography system,</li> <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0020">an introduction device for introducing the at least one linear analyzer into the observation beam path,</li> <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0021">an introduction or switching-on device for introducing the polarization portion into the illumination beam path or for switching on the polarization portion, and</li> <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0022">a control unit for controlling the introduction device and the introduction or switching-on device, which control unit is connected to the data input for receiving pre-surgical data and connected to the navigation data input for receiving navigation data, establishes whether the medical optical observation instrument is directed onto polarization-rotating tissue on the basis of the received navigation data and the received pre-surgical data, and actuates the introduction device and the introduction or switching-on device when the medical optical observation instrument is directed onto polarization-rotating tissue.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0023">In this way, it is possible to start the execution of the method according to the invention for contrasting polarization-rotating tissue, in particular for contrasting nerve fiber tracts, in an automated manner as soon as the medical optical observation instrument is directed onto polarization-rotating tissue such as e.g. a nerve fiber tract. Accordingly, the method can be stopped by virtue of the polarization portion of the illumination apparatus being removed from the illumination beam path or being switched off as soon as the medical optical observation instrument is no longer directed onto polarization-rotating tissue. As a result, it is possible to avoid the identity loss by the polarization of the illumination light and the analysis of the observation light when no polarization-rotating tissue is observed. By way of example, the pre-surgical data may be available in the form of magnetic resonance imaging data (MRI data) or of other tomography data.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0029">Below, a surgical microscope <b>2</b> configured according to the invention is explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> as a first exemplary embodiment for a medical optical observation instrument according to the invention. The surgical microscope <b>2</b> comprises an illumination system, which provides an illumination beam path <b>42</b> for illuminating an observation object <b>3</b> with illumination light, and an observation system, which provides an observation beam path <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B for producing an observation image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0030">The observation system of the surgical microscope <b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> serves to observe an object field <b>3</b>, which contains tissue with nerve fiber tracts. It comprises an objective <b>5</b> facing the object field <b>3</b>, which objective can, in particular, be embodied as an achromatic or apochromatic objective. In the present exemplary embodiment, the objective <b>5</b> consists of two partial lenses cemented together, which form an achromatic objective. The object field <b>3</b> is arranged in the focal plane of the objective <b>5</b> such that it is imaged at infinity by the objective <b>5</b>. In other words, a divergent beam <b>7</b> emanating from the object field <b>3</b> is converted into a parallel beam <b>9</b> when passing through the objective <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0031">In the embodiment variant of the surgical microscope <b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the objective <b>5</b> merely consists of an achromatic lens. However, it is also possible to use an objective lens system comprising a plurality of lenses, in particular a so-called varifocal objective, by means of which the working distance of the surgical microscope <b>2</b>, i.e. the distance of the object-side focal plane from the vertex of the first object-side lens face of the objective <b>5</b>, also referred to as object back focus, can be varied. A varifocal objective also images the object field <b>3</b> arranged in the focal plane to infinity such that a parallel beam is present on the observer side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0032">A magnification changer <b>11</b> is arranged at the observer side of the objective <b>5</b>, which magnification changer may be embodied either—as in the exemplary embodiment illustrated—as a zoom system for changing the magnification factor in a continuously variable fashion or as a so-called Galilean changer for changing the magnification factor step by step. In a zoom system constructed e.g. from a lens combination comprising three lenses, the two object-side lenses can be displaced in order to vary the magnification factor. In actual fact, however, the zoom system may also comprise more than three lenses, e.g. four or more lenses, wherein the outer lenses can then also be arranged in a fixed fashion. In a Galilean changer, by contrast, there are a plurality of fixed lens combinations which represent different magnification factors and can be introduced into the beam path alternately. Both a zoom system and a Galilean changer convert an object-side parallel beam into an observer-side parallel beam having a different beam diameter. In the present exemplary embodiment, the magnification changer <b>11</b> is already part of the binocular beam path of the surgical microscope <b>2</b>, that is to say that it has a dedicated lens combination for each stereoscopic partial beam path <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B of the surgical microscope <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0033">An interface arrangement <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B is adjacent to the magnification changer <b>11</b> on the observer side, which interface arrangement comprises beam splitter prisms <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B in the present exemplary embodiment. In principle, however, other types of beam splitters may also be used, e.g. partly transmissive mirrors. In the present exemplary embodiment, the interfaces <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B serve for coupling out beams from the partial beam paths of the surgical microscope <b>2</b>. The decoupled beams are fed to cameras <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B with electronic image sensors <b>23</b>A, <b>23</b>B via adapter optics <b>19</b>A, <b>19</b>B. By way of example, the image sensors may be implemented as CCD sensors or CMOS sensors. Electronic and, in particular, digital stereoscopic partial images of the object field <b>3</b> are recorded by means of the cameras <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0034">A binocular tube <b>27</b> is adjacent to the interface arrangement <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B on the observer side. Said binocular tube comprises two tube objectives <b>29</b>A, <b>29</b>B which focus the respective parallel beam <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B onto an intermediate image plane <b>31</b>A, <b>31</b>B, that is to say image the object field <b>3</b> onto the respective intermediate image plane <b>31</b>A, <b>31</b>B. The intermediate images situated in the intermediate image planes <b>31</b>A, <b>31</b>B are finally imaged toward infinity by eyepiece lenses <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B such that an observer can observe these with a relaxed eye. Moreover, in the binocular tube <b>27</b>, the distance between the two partial beams <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B is magnified by means of a mirror system or by means of prisms <b>33</b>A, <b>33</b>B in order to adapt the distance to the intraocular distance of the observer. Image erection is additionally carried out by means of the mirror system or the prisms <b>33</b>A, <b>33</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0035">The surgical microscope <b>2</b> is moreover equipped with an illumination system, by means of which the object field <b>3</b> can be illuminated with illumination light along an illumination beam path <b>42</b>. For producing the illumination light, the illumination system has an illumination apparatus <b>17</b>, which comprises a self-luminous primary light source <b>41</b> such as a halogen incandescent lamp, a gas-discharge lamp, a light-emitting diode etc. and an optical waveguide <b>51</b> with an input end <b>50</b> and an output end <b>52</b> in the present exemplary embodiment. The light emanating from the primary light source <b>41</b> is coupled into the input end of an optical waveguide <b>51</b> by way of a coupling apparatus <b>49</b> and emerges from the output end <b>52</b> of the optical waveguide <b>51</b>, which forms a non-self-luminous secondary light source. In the present exemplary embodiment, the illumination light emerging from the output end <b>52</b> of the optical waveguide <b>51</b> is directed in the direction of the object field <b>3</b> via a deflection mirror <b>43</b> or deflection prism in order to illuminate said object field. Moreover, illumination optics (not depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which ensure homogeneous illumination of the whole observed object field <b>3</b>, may be present in the illumination system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0036">The surgical microscope <b>2</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is equipped with a device <b>53</b> for contrasting polarization-rotating tissue in the object field <b>3</b>. This device is depicted schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It comprises a linear polarizer <b>47</b>, which can be introduced into the illumination beam path <b>42</b> when nerve fiber tracts, which constitute polarization-rotating tissue, are intended to be contrasted in the tissue situated in the object field <b>3</b>. The linear polarizer <b>47</b> is mounted in such a rotatable manner that it can be rotated about the optical axis of the illumination beam path <b>42</b> when it is inserted into the illumination beam path <b>42</b>. By rotating the linear polarizer about the optical axis of the illumination beam path <b>42</b>, it is possible to set the polarization direction of the illumination light reaching the object field <b>3</b> in order to be able to set the polarization direction in a suitable manner in view of the rotation of the polarization direction by the anisotropic substances of the nerve fibers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0037">Furthermore, the device <b>53</b> for contrasting polarization-rotating tissue <b>2</b> comprises two linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B, which can be inserted into the observation partial beam paths <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B when the nerve fiber tracts (or a different polarization-rotating tissue) of the tissue situated in the object field <b>3</b> is intended to be contrasted. The linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B are mounted in such a way that they can be rotated about the optical axes of the stereoscopic partial beam paths <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B when these are introduced into the partial beam paths. In the present exemplary embodiment, the linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B are situated between the magnification changer <b>11</b> and the interface arrangement <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0038">Suitably actuatable actuators are present in the surgical microscope for rotating the linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B. Accordingly, a suitable controllable actuator is present for rotating the linear polarizer <b>47</b> in the illumination beam path <b>42</b>. Here, the individual actuators are controllable independently of one another such that the polarization direction in the illumination light can be set independently of the setting of the polarization direction of the analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B with the aid of the polarizer <b>47</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0039">The device for contrasting polarization-rotating tissue furthermore comprises an image processing apparatus <b>55</b>, which is connected to the cameras <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B in the observation system of the surgical microscope <b>2</b> for receiving digital stereoscopic partial images, and an optimization apparatus <b>57</b>, which is connected firstly to the image processing apparatus <b>55</b> and connected secondly to the linear polarizer <b>47</b> and the linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B. On the basis of at least one of the received stereoscopic partial images, the image processing apparatus establishes a contrast value which represents the contrast in the received image. By way of example, the contrast value may be calculated on the basis of the Michelson contrast, which is formed, firstly, by the ratio from the difference between the maximum intensity in the image and the minimum intensity in the image and, secondly, the sum of the maximum intensity in the image and of the minimum intensity in the image. Here, the intensity values may correspond either to grayscale values or brightness values on the L-axis of the Lab color space. In the Lab color space, a color is characterized on the basis of an axis “L”, which specifies the brightness (luminance) of the color with values from 1 to 100, an axis “a”, along which the green component of a color lies in the negative value range and the red component of a color lies in the positive value range, and an axis “b”, along which the blue component of a color lies in the negative value range and the yellow component of a color lies in the positive value range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0040">Instead of using the maximum intensity and the minimum intensity of the overall image for establishing the Michelson contrast, it is also possible to decompose the image into small sections, for which the Michelson contrast is calculated in each case. Then, e.g. a mean value or a different statistical measure relating to the individual Michelson contrast values can be formed as contrast value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0041">The contrast value is output from the image processing apparatus <b>55</b> to the image optimization apparatus <b>57</b>. On the basis of the currently received contrast value, for example by way of a comparison with at least one previously received contrast value and a model for the profile of the contrast value as a function of the polarization directions of the polarizer <b>47</b> and of the analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B, said image optimization apparatus establishes a new polarization direction of the polarizer <b>47</b> and/or a new polarization direction of the analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B. This continues until a maximum of the contrast value has been reached. By way of example, the optimization device may identify a maximum by virtue of the contrast value decreasing independently of how the polarization direction of the analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B and/or the polarization direction of the polarizer <b>47</b> is modified. The setting of the polarization direction of the linear polarizer <b>47</b> and the polarization direction of the linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B, at which the maximum in the contrast value occurs, is then kept constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0042">If contrasting of the nerve fiber tracts is no longer desired, the linear polarizer <b>47</b> and the linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B can be removed from the beam paths again.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0043">A second exemplary embodiment for the medical optical observation instrument according to the invention is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Like the medical optical observation instrument of the first exemplary embodiment, the medical optical observation instrument of the second exemplary embodiment is embodied as a surgical microscope. Features of the surgical microscope <b>58</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which correspond to the features of the surgical microscope <b>2</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, are denoted by the same reference signs in both <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and are not explained again in order to avoid repetition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0044">A first difference between the surgical microscope <b>58</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the surgical microscope <b>2</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> lies in the fact that displays <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B and a second interface arrangement <b>59</b>A, <b>59</b>B with beam splitter prisms <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B (or alternatively with partly transmissive mirrors) are present. The beam splitter prisms <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B of the second interface arrangement <b>59</b>A, <b>59</b>B are arranged on the observer side of the beam splitter prisms <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B of the first interface arrangement <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B. By way of the beam splitter prisms <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B of the second interface arrangement <b>59</b>A, <b>59</b>B, it is possible to couple images depicted on the displays <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B into the stereoscopic observation partial beam paths <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B in the direction of the binocular tube <b>27</b> with the aid of display optics <b>65</b>A, <b>65</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0045">Furthermore, the surgical microscope <b>58</b> shown in figure differs from the surgical microscope <b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by virtue of the linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B being arranged between the first beam splitters <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B and the cameras <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B rather than between the magnification changer <b>11</b> and the first beam splitters <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B. Therefore, the linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B are not situated in the beam path leading to the binocular tube <b>27</b>. The optimization of the image contrast therefore merely has an effect on the contrast in the images recorded by the cameras <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B, and not on the contrast in the intermediate images observed with the eyepieces <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B. Therefore, there is no contrasting of the nerve fiber tracts in the intermediate images observed by the eyepieces <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B. In order nevertheless to be able to observe an image with contrasted nerve fiber tracts by way of the binocular tube <b>27</b>, the information about the position of the nerve fiber tracts is taken from the images recorded by the cameras <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B by image processing means and prepared in such a way that it can be superposed on to the intermediate images with the aid of the displays <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B, for example as a contour image or as colored regions. This procedure enables high flexibility in the type of display of the contrasted nerve fiber tracts. Moreover, the identifiability of tissue regions outside of the nerve fiber tracts is reduced to a lesser extent than in the surgical microscope depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> since light from such tissue regions is not suppressed by the analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B in the beam paths leading to the intermediate images.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0046">In contrast to the surgical microscope <b>2</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the illumination system in the surgical microscope <b>58</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has two light sources, namely a conventional light source <b>41</b>, which emits unpolarized light, and an infrared laser, which emits linearly polarized infrared light. Both light sources may be used, either individually or together, for illuminating the object field <b>3</b>. The infrared laser <b>69</b> is mounted in such a way that it can be rotated about the optical axis thereof such that the polarization direction of the laser light about the optical axis of the illumination beam path <b>70</b> can be set. The object field <b>3</b> is illuminated by the light of the conventional light source <b>41</b> by means of first illumination optics <b>67</b> and by the light of the infrared laser by means of second illumination optics <b>71</b>. If contrasting of nerve fiber tracts is unwanted, the laser <b>69</b> can be switched off. It should be noted here that common illumination optics may also be present for the conventional light source <b>41</b> and the infrared laser and that other light sources emitting polarized light can be used instead of the infrared laser.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0047">Since the illumination light used in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for contrasting the nerve fiber tracts lies outside of the visible spectral range, the image observed through the eyepieces <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B is not influenced in terms of the brightness thereof by the illumination used for contrasting. In particular, it is possible to set the conventional illumination for visual observation completely independently of the polarized illumination for contrasting the nerve fiber tracts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0048">As described above, the contrasting is displayed in the intermediate images observed by the eyepieces <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B by virtue of the contrast information being superposed into the intermediate images with the aid of the displays <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B. However, alternatively, it is also possible to observe a purely electronic image through the eyepieces <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B. To this end, shutters <b>71</b>A, <b>71</b>B can be arranged in the stereoscopic partial beam paths <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B between the first beam splitter prisms <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B and the second beam splitter prisms <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B. Said shutters can be introduced into the partial beam paths <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B in order to prevent the entry of illumination light into the second beam splitter prisms <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B. An observer peering through the eyepieces <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B then merely sees the images shown on the displays <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B. Then, the images recorded by the cameras <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B, which of course also comprise the visible spectral range, are depicted on the displays <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B. Information obtained with the aid of the infrared light about the nerve fiber tracts can be inserted into these images such that an electronic image, in which the nerve fiber tracts are highlighted with high contrast, is produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0049">In an alternative embodiment of the second exemplary embodiment, it is possible to use an illumination apparatus as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> instead of the illumination apparatus with the two light sources <b>41</b> and <b>69</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this case, contrasting of the nerve fiber tracts would be implemented in the same way as was described with reference to the first exemplary embodiment, wherein the contrasted image is recorded by the cameras <b>21</b>A, <b>21</b>B and depicted on the displays <b>63</b>A, <b>63</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0050">A development of the medical optical observation instrument according to the invention is depicted schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The medical optical observation instrument from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a surgical microscope <b>73</b> according to the invention, which, in particular, may be embodied like the surgical microscope <b>2</b> from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or like the surgical microscope <b>58</b> from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the development shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the surgical microscope <b>73</b> is equipped with an introduction device <b>75</b> for introducing the linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B into the respective stereoscopic partial beam paths and with an introduction or switching-on device <b>77</b> for introducing the linear polarizer <b>47</b> into the observation beam path or for switching-on the infrared laser <b>69</b>. The introduction device <b>75</b> and the introduction or switching-on device <b>77</b> are connected to a control unit <b>79</b>, which in turn is connected to a navigation data input <b>80</b> for receiving navigation data from a navigation system <b>81</b> and a data input <b>82</b> for receiving pre-surgical data from a storage medium <b>83</b> containing such data. In addition, or as an alternative, to retrieving pre-surgical data from the storage medium <b>83</b>, the control unit <b>79</b> can retrieve pre-surgical data from a tomography system via the data input <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0051">The navigation system <b>81</b> establishes position and orientation data of the surgical microscope <b>73</b> in relation to the object field <b>3</b>, which data are retrieved by the control unit <b>79</b>. The pre-surgical data stored in the storage medium <b>83</b> contain position data of the nerve fiber tracts in the object field <b>3</b>. By way of example, the position data may originate from magnetic resonance imaging data (MRI data) or other tomography data. Moreover, images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging or a different tomography method can be stored for retrieval purposes in the storage medium <b>83</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0052">The control unit <b>79</b> determines whether or not the focal point of the surgical microscope <b>73</b> is directed onto the nerve fiber tracts on the basis of the received pre-surgical data and the navigation data. If the control unit <b>79</b> determines that the focal point is directed onto nerve fiber tracts, it prompts the introduction device <b>75</b> to introduce the linear analyzers <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B into the observation beam paths and it prompts the introduction or switching-on device <b>77</b> to introduce the linear polarizer <b>47</b> into the illumination beam path or to switch on the light source for polarized light. In this manner, it is possible to start the method for contrasting nerve fiber tracts in an automated manner as soon as nerve fiber tracts are observed using the surgical microscope <b>73</b>. Moreover, it is possible to compare the profile of the nerve fiber tracts in the intra-surgical image obtained by the surgical microscope <b>73</b> with the profile of the nerve fiber tracts in a pre-surgical image obtained by magnetic resonance imaging or a different tomography method and thus, for example, establish whether there has been a displacement of tissue regions since the pre-surgical images were recorded. By way of example, in this manner it is possible to determine a so-called brain shift.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0053">For explanatory purposes, the present invention was described in detail on the basis of exemplary embodiments. A person skilled in the art recognizes that the features of the individual exemplary embodiments can be combined with one another. By way of example, a light source which emits polarized light can be used in the illumination apparatus <b>17</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The optical waveguide <b>51</b> then comprises at least one polarization-maintaining optical fiber. Likewise, in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is possible to couple the light from the conventional light source <b>41</b> and/or the light from the laser <b>69</b> into an optical waveguide. If the light from the laser <b>69</b> is coupled into an optical waveguide, it is possible either for the whole optical waveguide to consist of polarization-maintaining optical fibers or for the optical waveguide to comprise at least one polarization-maintaining optical fiber and, therebeyond, consist of conventional optical fibers. Then, the light from the laser <b>69</b> would be coupled into the polarization-maintaining optical fibers. Moreover, a person skilled in the art recognizes that it is possible to deviate from the described exemplary embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention. By way of example, he identifies that the medical optical observation instrument can, for example, also be embodied as an endoscope rather than as a surgical microscope. In particular, a person skilled in the art also identifies that other polarization-rotating tissue can be contrasted instead of the nerve fiber tracts described in the exemplary embodiment. Therefore, the invention is merely intended to be restricted by the attached claims.</div>
