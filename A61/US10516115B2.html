<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a dinaphthothiophene derivative, a method of preparing the same, an organic semiconductor material containing the same, an organic semiconductor ink containing the same, and an organic transistor containing the same.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the related art, a thin-film transistor (TFT) in which amorphous silicon or polycrystalline silicon is used as a material has been widely used as a switching element for a liquid crystal display device, an organic EL display device, and the like. However, a CVD apparatus used for producing a transistor using the silicon materials is expensive and thus, producing of a large transistor integrated circuit leads to an increase in producing cost. In addition, the silicon material is formed into a film at high temperature, and therefore, due to a problem of heat resistance, cannot be applied to a next generation flexible display device in which a plastic substrate is supposed to be used. In order to solve this problem, an organic transistor in which an organic semiconductor material is used as a channel (semiconductor layer) instead of the silicon semiconductor material has been proposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Since it is possible to form a film at low temperature by using the organic semiconductor material as an ink, a large-scale production facility is not required. In addition, the organic semiconductor material can be applied to a plastic substrate with poor heat resistance and has been expected to be applied to flexible electronics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Such an organic semiconductor material had a problem in that, since semiconductor properties (mobility) are poor as compared with the silicon semiconductor materials, a response speed of the transistor is slow and thereby it is difficult to put it into practical use; however, in recent years, materials, the mobility of which exceeds that of amorphous silicon, have been developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, PTL 1 discloses that a compound having a dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene skeleton exhibits mobility of 4.0 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs in a vacuum evaporated film, PTLs 2 and 3 disclose that a dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (hereinafter, abbreviated as dinaphthothiophene) derivative exhibits a high mobility of 11 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs in a single crystal thin film formed by an edge casting method, NPL 1 discloses that 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene exhibits a high mobility of 30 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs in a single crystal film prepared by a double ink jet method while its properties have large variation, PTL 4 discloses that a phenyl substituted naphthodichalcogen compound exhibits a mobility of 0.7 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs, and PTLs 5 and 6 disclose that a compound exhibiting a highly ordered liquid crystal phase shows a mobility of 5.7 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs in a thin film formed via a highly ordered liquid crystal phase. As such, the organic semiconductor materials exhibiting the semiconductor properties where the mobility thereof exceeds that of amorphous silicon (0.5 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs) have been reported one after another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Although the mobility of the organic semiconductors has been increased in this way, it has not yet been put to practical use. The reason is that the mobility as disclosed above is evaluated by using a semiconductor layer composed of a film prepared by a film-forming method which gives a homogeneous bulk such as a single crystal film prepared by an edge casting method or a double ink jet method, a thin film prepared by a vacuum deposition method and a thin film prepared by a spin coating method, and in the case of using the semiconductor layer made of a polycrystalline film which is prepared by dropping (drop-casting) an ink droplet and then drying it, that is, a practical printing method such as an ink jet method and a nozzle printing method, the properties are deteriorated.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0008">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0015">The organic semiconductor material in the related art has poor solubility in a solvent, and thus it is difficult to prepare an ink. Accordingly, there was a problem in film formation by a wet process which is required for establishing a printing process. In addition, even for a material having solvent solubility, there are some problems in preparation of a homogeneous film, because disorder of molecular orientation, partial crystallization, and the like take place during a wet process. Thus, in order to obtain high mobility, a film-formation method which is difficult to put into practical use and/or a complicated post deposition process such as an annealing treatment were required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0016">In this regard, an object of the present invention is to provide a compound which is excellent in solubility in a solvent and easily provides a film exhibiting high mobility without complicated processes, that is, a film exhibiting high mobility only by drop-casting ink droplets and then drying them, an organic semiconductor material using the same, and an organic semiconductor ink which enables easy fabrication of an organic transistor composed of a practical configuration.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0017">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the present inventors have repeatedly conducted intensive studies, found that dinaphthothiophene having a specific substituent-position structure has excellent solubility in a solvent, therefore has suitability as an organic semiconductor ink, and can provide an organic semiconductor film having high mobility even by not a complicated method but a simple and practical wet film formation method, that is, a method of drop-casting and drying of ink droplets, and thereby completed the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0018">That is, the present invention is configured as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0019">1. A preparing method of a dinaphthothiophene derivative represented by General Formula (D), the method including the following steps (I) and (II):</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0021">(II) a second step of performing dehydrogenation reaction of the sulfide derivative (C) in the presence of a transition metal salt or a transition metal complex to produce a dinaphthothiophene derivative represented by General Formula (D).</div>

Specific examples thereof include a hydrogen atom including light hydrogen, deuterium hydrogen and tritium hydrogen, an acyclic or cyclic alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms wherein at least one hydrogen atom in the alkyl group may be substituted with an aromatic group, a halogeno group or a nitrile group, and at least one —CH<sub>2</sub>— in the alkyl group may be replaced by —O—, —R′C═CR′—, —CO—, —OCO—, —COO—, —S—, —SO<sub>2</sub>—, —SO—, —NH—, —NR′— or —C≡— provided that, with respect to each of an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom and a nitrogen atom, the same atoms are not directly bonded to each other, wherein R′ represents an acyclic or cyclic alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms; a halogeno group; an aromatic group wherein the aromatic group may be substituted with an acyclic or cyclic alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a halogeno group, an aromatic group or a nitrile group, wherein at least one hydrogen atom in the alkyl group may be substituted with an aromatic group, a halogeno group or a nitrile group and, at least one —CH<sub>2</sub>— in the alkyl group may be replaced by —O—, —CR″═CR″—, —CO—, —OCO—, —COO—, —S—, —SO<sub>2</sub>—, —SO—, —NH—, —NR″— or —C≡— provided that, with respect to each of an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom and a nitrogen atom, the same atoms are not directly bonded to each other, wherein R″ represents an acyclic or cyclic alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms; a nitro group; and a nitrile group. Here, the substituents are not limited to these examples. Note that, specific examples of the alkyl group, the halogeno group and the aromatic group include the same substituent as those of the compound (dinaphthothiophene derivative) of the present invention which will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0051">Regarding the position structure of the substituent, the case where R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>12 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>11 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>10 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, R<sub>4 </sub>and R<sub>9 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, R<sub>5 </sub>and R<sub>8 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, and R<sub>6 </sub>and R<sub>7 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, provided that in terms of at least one combination of six combinations of R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>12</sub>, R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>11</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>10</sub>, R<sub>4 </sub>and R<sub>9</sub>, R<sub>5 </sub>and R<sub>8</sub>, and R<sub>6 </sub>and R<sub>7</sub>, the two substituents which constitute the combination are different from each other is preferable; the case which can be achieved with the features of the preparing method described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0052">The method of preparing the dinaphthothiophene derivative of the present invention includes (I) a first step of subjecting a naphthol derivative represented by General Formula (A) and a naphthalene thiol derivative represented by General Formula (B) to dehydration condensation in the presence of acid to produce a sulfide derivative represented by General formula (C); and (II) a second step of performing dehydrogenation reaction of the sulfide derivative (C) in the presence of a transition metal salt or a transition metal complex to produce a dinaphthothiophene derivative (D).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0053">Since a conventionally well-known method of preparing a dinaphthothiophene derivative (PTL 2) is performed under the extreme conditions such as the reaction at 300° C., thus kinds of the substituents that can be introduced are limited, and further since the aforementioned method requires multistage synthesis, thus the yield is low. Further, regarding the position structure of the substituent, the aforementioned method, due to the nature of the method, produces only the derivative in which R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>12 </sub>are the same as each other, R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>11 </sub>are the same as each other, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>10 </sub>are the same as each other, R<sub>4 </sub>and R<sub>9 </sub>are the same as each other, R<sub>5 </sub>and R<sub>8 </sub>are the same as each other, and R<sub>6 </sub>and R<sub>7 </sub>are the same as each other. In contrast, in the present preparing method, since the reaction conditions are mild and the number of steps is small, a number of the substituent group can be used and the yield is high. Further, the present preparing method can produce a dinaphthothiophene derivative in which R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>12 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>11 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>10 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, R<sub>4 </sub>and R<sub>9 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, R<sub>5 </sub>and R<sub>8 </sub>are the same as or different from each other, and R<sub>6 </sub>and R<sub>7 </sub>are the same as or different from each other provided that in terms of at least one combination of six combinations of R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>12</sub>, R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>11</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>10</sub>, R<sub>4 </sub>and R<sub>9</sub>, R<sub>5 </sub>and R<sub>8</sub>, and R<sub>6 </sub>and R<sub>7</sub>, the two substituents which constitute the combination are different from each other. Such a derivative has suitability as an organic semiconductor ink owing to its excellent solubility in a solvent as described later, and further since its intermolecular force is optimized, can yield an organic semiconductor film with high semiconductor properties (mobility) by using a simple and practical wet film formation method, that is, a method of only drop-casting the ink and then drying it.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0149">Organic Semiconductor Material and Ink</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0150">The compound of the present invention can be used as an organic semiconductor material for an organic semiconductor device. In order to use the compound of the present invention as an organic semiconductor, typically, the compound is used in a state of film morphology (organic semiconductor film or organic semiconductor layer). Regarding the film formation, it may be formed by a conventionally well-known dry film formation method such as vacuum deposition, but it is preferable to be formed by a wet film formation method (coating method or printing method) which is capable of forming a film at low temperature and is excellent productivity, and thus, the compound of the present invention, that is, the organic semiconductor material is preferably used as ink. The compound of the present invention is dissolved in a solvent to thereby prepare the ink. In addition, in order to impart ink properties (print suitability) to the extent that the semiconductor properties are not impaired, a leveling agent such as a fluorine-based or silicon-based leveling agent and a polymer compound such as polystyrene, an acrylic resin, or a high molecular weight organic semiconductor compound can also be added as a viscosity regulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0151">Any solvent may be used, and two or more kinds of solvents may be used in combination. Specifically, an aliphatic solvent such as n-hexane, n-octane, n-decane, and n-dodecane can be exemplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0152">Specific examples further include an alicyclic solvent such as cyclohexane; an aromatic solvent such as benzene, toluene, cumene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, p-cymene, mesitylene, anisole, 2-methyl anisole, 3-methyl anisole, 4-methyl anisole, 2,5-dimethyl anisole, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, 2,4-dimethyl anisole, phenetole, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, propyl benzoate, butyl benzoate, 1,5-dimethyl tetralin, n-propyl benzene, n-butyl benzene, n-pentyl benzene, 1,3,5-triethylbenzene, 1,3-dimethoxybenzene, 2,5-diethoxybenzene, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, and trichlorobenzene; an ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, anisole, benzyl ethyl ether, ethyl phenyl ether, diphenyl ether, and methyl t-butyl ether; and an ester solvent such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl cellosolve, and propylene glycol methyl ether acetate; an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol; a ketone solvent such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone, and 3-heptanone; and other dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and diethyl formamide; however, the compound of the invention is not limited thereto.</div>

Examples of such materials include a π-conjugated polymer exhibiting semiconductive properties, a non-π-conjugated polymer exhibiting semiconductive properties, and a low molecular weight organic semiconductor compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0155">The organic semiconductor ink of the present invention contributes to a homogeneous organic semiconductor film with high orderly arrangement of molecular arrangement. Therefore, the obtained organic semiconductor film can exhibit high mobility. In addition, there is no need to perform special processing such as special printing film formation or thermal annealing in order to obtain a film with high orderly arrangement of molecular arrangement and it is possible to obtain an organic semiconductor film with high mobility only by adding dropwise and drying the ink.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0156">Organic Semiconductor Device</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0157">Next, the organic semiconductor device of the present invention will be described. The organic semiconductor device of the present invention is an organic semiconductor device containing the compound of the present invention in an active layer portion (semiconductor layer).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0160">Organic Transistor</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0161">Next, an organic transistor containing the compound of the present invention will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0162">The organic transistor is typically configured to include a source electrode, a drain electrode, agate electrode, a gate insulating layer, and an organic semiconductor layer, and there are various kinds of organic transistors depending on the disposition of each electrode and each layer. However, the compound of the present invention and the organic semiconductor material are not limited to the kinds of the organic transistors, and can be used for any organic transistor. Regarding the kinds of the organic transistors, it is possible to refer to Material Science of Aldrich, Basics, 6, “Basics of organic transistor” and the like.</div>

Reference 1 is a substrate, reference 2 is a gate electrode, reference 3 is a gate insulating layer, reference 4 is an organic semiconductor layer, reference 5 is a source electrode, and reference 6 is a drain electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0164">Here, the bottom gate bottom contact type (hereinafter, BC type) has more practical structure from the aspect that the organic semiconductor material which is more deteriorated than other element forming materials (metal for electrode material and resin for gate insulating material) regarding heat resistance, weather resistance, and solvent resistance is treated at last step of the element producing process. On the other hand, as compared with a bottom gate top contact type (hereinafter, TC type), the BC type tends to be deteriorated in the element properties (Material Science of Aldrich, Basics, 6, Chapter 2.2 “Basics of organic transistor”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0165">The features of the compound of the present invention is that even if conventionally well-known compounds for organic semiconductor material exhibit high properties in the TC type, but the properties are not realized in the BC type; whereas, as described below, even in the BC type, it has high mobility equal to or greater than 1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs. The reason for this is that the compound of the present invention forms a polycrystalline film that contributes to high mobility with appropriate cohesive force only by adding dropwise and drying the ink droplets.</div>
