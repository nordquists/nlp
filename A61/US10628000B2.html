As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the edge index display unit <b>12</b> displays <b>19</b> edge indices <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, - - - , and <b>61</b> <i>s</i>, in which the page ranges of the items (a carbide end mill, a high-speed steel end mill, - - - , factory goods) are colored into strips, in the fore edge image <b>60</b> in a vertically (in the y direction) shifted and superposed manner in such a way that the edge indices do not overlap each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The subsequent STEP <b>5</b> to STEP <b>8</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, STEP <b>10</b>, and STEP <b>20</b> are processes performed by the item name image display unit <b>13</b> (corresponding to an item name image displaying step in the electronic book browsing assistance method of the present invention). As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the item name image display unit <b>13</b> displays the item name image <b>70</b> composed of 19 item bars <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, - - - , and <b>70</b> <i>s. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The item name image display unit <b>13</b> performs enlarged display of an item bar displaying the name of an item assigned to the edge index with which the indicator is in contact in STEP <b>5</b>. Furthermore, in the next STEP <b>6</b>, the item name image display unit <b>13</b> displays vertical lines indicating the positions of the pages included in the item “tap” in the lower part of the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h </i>subjected to the enlarged display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Incidentally, as illustrated in the enlarged display at E of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the width of the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h </i>in the horizontal direction (x direction) indicates the range of the pages included in the item “tap” and the position of each vertical line displayed in the lower part of the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h </i>indicates the arrangement order of each page in the item “tap.” In the example of E, the item “tap” ranges from page <b>100</b> to page <b>200</b> (selected range) and a pointer <b>71</b> is located in the middle of the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h </i>and therefore the example illustrates that the arrangement order of page <b>150</b> in the middle is selected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Moreover, the item name image display unit <b>13</b> sets a darker color as the value of the opening tendency weighting coefficient of each vertical line increases according to the value of the opening tendency weighting coefficient of each vertical line, with respect to the shade of color of each vertical line (which corresponds to a change in the display mode of the vertical line of the present invention). Although a change in the display mode of the vertical line corresponding to each page has been performed by changing the shade of color in this embodiment, any display mode may be used as long as a user is able to identify differences in the browsing frequency of the respective pages, and the display mode may be changed with the color type, the luminance, the line width (thickness), or the like, in addition to the shade of color.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Incidentally, the opening tendency weighting coefficient is set to a greater value as the browsing frequency of each page increases with respect to each page. Moreover, the browsing frequency of each page is included in browsing data retained in the memory of the electronic catalog server <b>101</b> or of the control unit <b>10</b> by the browsing history management unit <b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, the shade of the color of each vertical line displayed in the lower part of the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h </i>changes according to the browsing frequency, and the user is able to easily find a page that the user often browses by visually recognizing the shades of the color of the vertical lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a state in which a user's finger (indicator) is in contact with the edge index <b>61</b> <i>h </i>assigned to the item “tap” (a state in which “tap” is selected), where the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h </i>displaying the “tap” name is enlarged in comparison with other item bars in the display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In the next STEP <b>7</b>, the item name image display unit <b>13</b> branches to STEP <b>10</b> if the contact position detection circuit <b>21</b> detects that the indicator slides in the vertical direction of the fore edge image <b>60</b>. Thereafter, when the edge index with which the indicator F is in contact is switched as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the item name image display unit <b>13</b> changes the display mode of the item name image <b>70</b> in response thereto and then proceeds to STEP <b>8</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, the left side of the white arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a state in which the user's finger F (indicator) is in contact with the edge index <b>61</b> <i>h </i>assigned to the item “tap,” where the item name image display unit <b>13</b> displays the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h </i>displaying the name of the item “tap” so as to be larger in size than other item bars and gradually decreases the sizes of the item bars <b>70</b> <i>g</i>, <b>70</b> <i>f</i>, <b>70</b> <i>i</i>, and <b>70</b> <i>j </i>around the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h</i>, thereby enabling the user to easily recognize that the item “tap” is selected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, the right side of the white arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a case where the user's finger F slides upward (in the y direction) and then the state is switched to another state in which the user's finger F is in contact with the edge index <b>61</b> <i>e </i>assigned to the item “drill.” In this case, the item name image display unit <b>13</b> increases the size of an item bar <b>70</b> <i>e </i>displaying the name of the item “drill” so as to be larger than other item bars and gradually decreases the sizes of the item bars <b>70</b> <i>d</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c</i>, <b>70</b> <i>f</i>, and <b>70</b> <i>g </i>around the item bar <b>70</b> <i>e</i>, thereby enabling the user to easily recognize that the item “drill” is selected. The same applies to the case where the user's finger F slides downward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">In the next STEP <b>8</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the item name image display unit <b>13</b> branches to STEP <b>20</b> when the contact position detection circuit <b>21</b> detects that the indicator slides in the horizontal direction of the fore edge image <b>60</b>. Thereafter, the item name image display unit <b>13</b> changes the position of the pointer <b>71</b> in the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h </i>according to the position in the horizontal direction where the indicator (the user's finger F) is in contact with the fore edge image <b>60</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and then proceeds to STEP <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">The left side of the white arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a case where the state is switched to another state in which the user's finger F is in contact with the edge index <b>61</b> <i>h </i>assigned to the item “tap,” where the item name image display unit <b>13</b> displays the pointer <b>71</b> in the central part in the horizontal direction (x direction) of the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Furthermore, if the user performs an operation of sliding the finger F in the right direction as illustrated on the right side of the white arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the item name image display unit <b>13</b> shifts the position of the pointer <b>71</b> to the right side in response to the operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Incidentally, the position of the pointer <b>71</b> in the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h </i>corresponds to the arrangement position (arrangement order) of the page in the range <b>80</b> <i>h </i>of the pages included in the item “tap” as described with reference to E. Therefore, the user is able to easily recognize the position of the selected page by visually recognizing the position of the pointer <b>71</b> of the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Although the description has been made by giving an example of the edge index <b>61</b> <i>h </i>and the item bar <b>70</b> <i>h </i>assigned to the item “tap” with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the item name image display unit <b>13</b> performs the same processing with respect to the edge index and the item bar assigned to any other item.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The subsequent STEP <b>9</b> and STEP <b>30</b> are processes performed by the selected page display unit <b>14</b> (corresponding to a selected page displaying step of the electronic book browsing assistance method of the present invention). The selected page display unit <b>14</b> branches to STEP <b>30</b> if the tilt sensor <b>22</b> detects a rightward tilt operation in which the touch panel device <b>1</b> is switched from the state on the left side of the white arrow illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> (a state in which the user faces the touch panel device <b>1</b> in this specification) to a state on the right side in STEP <b>9</b> (if the tilt sensor <b>22</b> detects an occurrence of tilting to the right at a separately-set angle or more), or the selected page display unit <b>14</b> returns to STEP <b>7</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> unless the rightward tilt operation is detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In STEP <b>30</b>, the selected page display unit <b>14</b> erases the displays of the fore edge image <b>60</b> and the item name image <b>70</b> and displays the browse screen <b>40</b> displayed by selecting the page calculated using a predetermined function according to the position of the pointer in the item bar and the opening tendency weighting coefficients of the pages therearound in the touch panel display unit <b>20</b> as illustrated on the right side of the white arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and then returns to STEP <b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Through the processes of the flowcharts in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> described hereinabove, the user is able to easily identify and display a target page by displaying the search screen <b>41</b> including the fore edge image <b>60</b> and the item name image <b>70</b> by tilting the touch panel device <b>1</b> to the left, switching the item selected by sliding the finger in the vertical direction on the fore edge image <b>60</b>, selecting the position of the page in the range of the pages of each item by sliding the finger in the horizontal direction, and tilting the touch panel device <b>1</b> to the right.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Subsequently, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, description will be made on the management of browsing data using a server (electronic catalog server) <b>101</b> and on coloring processing of the fore edge image <b>60</b> using the browsing data.</div>
