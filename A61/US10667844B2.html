<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to medical devices and, more particularly, to methods and apparatuses for spinal stabilization.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The human spine is a flexible weight bearing column formed from a plurality of bones called vertebrae. There are thirty three vertebrae, which can be grouped into one of five regions (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal). Moving down the spine, there are generally seven cervical vertebra, twelve thoracic vertebra, five lumbar vertebra, five sacral vertebra, and four coccygeal vertebra. The vertebra of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of the spine are typically separate throughout the life of an individual. In contrast, the vertebra of the sacral and coccygeal regions in an adult are fused to form two bones, the five sacral vertebra which form the sacrum and the four coccygeal vertebra which form the coccyx.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, each vertebra contains an anterior, solid segment or body and a posterior segment or arch. The arch is generally formed of two pedicles and two laminae, supporting seven processes—four articular, two transverse, and one spinous. There are exceptions to these general characteristics of a vertebra. For example, the first cervical vertebra (atlas vertebra) has neither a body nor spinous process. In addition, the second cervical vertebra (axis vertebra) has an odontoid process, which is a strong, prominent process, shaped like a tooth, rising perpendicularly from the upper surface of the body of the axis vertebra. Further details regarding the construction of the spine may be found in such common references as Gray's Anatomy, Crown Publishers, Inc., 1977, pp. 33-54, which is herein incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The human vertebrae and associated connective elements are subjected to a variety of diseases and conditions which cause pain and disability. Among these diseases and conditions are spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, vertebral instability, spinal stenosis and degenerated, herniated, or degenerated and herniated intervertebral discs. Additionally, the vertebrae and associated connective elements are subject to injuries, including fractures and torn ligaments and surgical manipulations, including laminectomies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The pain and disability related to the diseases and conditions often result from the displacement of all or part of a vertebra from the remainder of the vertebral column. Over the past two decades, a variety of methods have been developed to restore the displaced vertebra to their normal position and to fix them within the vertebral column. Spinal fusion is one such method. In spinal fusion, one or more of the vertebra of the spine are united together (“fused”) so that motion no longer occurs between them. The vertebra may be united with various types of fixation systems. These fixation systems may include a variety of longitudinal elements such as rods or plates that span two or more vertebrae and are affixed to the vertebrae by various fixation elements such as wires, staples, and screws (often inserted through the pedicles of the vertebrae). These systems may be affixed to either the posterior or the anterior side of the spine. In other applications, one or more bone screws may be inserted through adjacent vertebrae to provide stabilization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Although spinal fusion is a highly documented and proven form of treatment in many patients, there is currently a great interest in surgical techniques that provide stabilization of the spine while allowing for some degree of movement. In this manner, the natural motion of the spine can be preserved, especially for those patients with mild or moderate disc conditions. In certain types of these techniques, flexible materials are used as fixation rods to stabilize the spine while permitting a limited degree of movement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Notwithstanding the variety of efforts in the prior art described above, these techniques are associated with a variety of disadvantages. In particular, these techniques typically involve an open surgical procedure, which results higher cost, lengthy in-patient hospital stays and the pain associated with open procedures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there remains a need for improved techniques and systems for stabilization the spine. Preferably, the devices are implantable through a minimally invasive procedure.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Although the stabilization devices of the present invention will be disclosed primarily in the context of a spinal stabilization procedure, the methods and structures disclosed herein are intended for application in any of a variety medical applications, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. For example, certain features and aspects of bone stabilization device and techniques described herein may be applicable to proximal fractures of the femur and a wide variety of fractures and osteotomies, the hand, such as interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal arthrodesis, transverse phalangeal and metacarpal fracture fixation, spiral phalangeal and metacarpal fracture fixation, oblique phalangeal and metacarpal fracture fixation, intercondylar phalangeal and metacarpal fracture fixation, phalangeal and metacarpal osteotomy fixation as well as others known in the art. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,511,481, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. A wide variety of phalangeal and metatarsal osteotomies and fractures of the foot may also be stabilized using the bone fixation devices described herein. These include, among others, distal metaphyseal osteotomies such as those described by Austin and Reverdin-Laird, base wedge osteotomies, oblique diaphyseal, digital arthrodesis as well as a wide variety of others that will be known to those of skill in the art. Fractures of the fibular and tibial malleoli, pilon fractures and other fractures of the bones of the leg may be fixated and stabilized with these bone fixation devices with or without the use of plates, both absorbable or non-absorbing types, and with alternate embodiments of the current invention The stabilization devices may also be used to attach tissue or structure to the bone, such as in ligament reattachment and other soft tissue attachment procedures. Plates and washers, with or without tissue spikes for soft tissue attachment, and other implants may also be attached to bone, using either resorbable or nonresorbable fixation devices depending upon the implant and procedure. The stabilization devices may also be used to attach sutures to the bone, such as in any of a variety of tissue suspension procedures. The bone stabilization device described herein may be used with or without plate(s) or washer(s), all of which can be either permanent, absorbable, or combinations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are side and rear elevational views of a pair of bone stabilization devices <b>12</b>, positioned within a body structure <b>10</b> <i>a </i>of the spine. As will be explained in detail below, the bone stabilization device <b>12</b> may be used in a variety of techniques to stabilize the spine. In one embodiment, the device <b>12</b> is attached (e.g., inserted or screwed into) and/or coupled to a single body structure and limits motion of a second body structure. In the another embodiment, the device <b>12</b> limits extension in the spine by being attached and/or coupled to an inferior body structure and limiting motion of an adjacent superior body structure. “Body structure” as used herein is the anterior solid segment and the posterior segment of any vertebrae of the five regions (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal) of the spine. In some embodiments, the device limits motion by contacting, abutting against and/or wedging against the adjacent body structure and/or a device coupled to the adjacent body structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference to the illustrated embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the distal end of the bone stabilization device <b>12</b> is inserted into the pedicle of the inferior vertebrae, preferably through the pars (i.e., the region between the lamina between and the superior articular processes). The proximal end of the device <b>12</b> extends above the pars such that it limits motion of a superior adjacent vertebrae <b>10</b> <i>b </i>with respect to the inferior adjacent vertebrae <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. In one embodiment, the proximal end of the device limits motion by abutting and/or wedging against a surface of the superior adjacent vertebrae as the superior adjacent vertebrae moves relative to the inferior adjacent vertebrae. In this manner, at least one degree of motion between the inferior and superior vertebrae may be limited. For example, the spine generally has six (6) degrees of motion which include flexion, extension, left and right lateral bending and axial rotation or torsion. In the illustrated embodiment, at least extension of the spine is limited. Embodiments in which the devices are inserted with bilateral symmetry can be used to limit left and right lateral bending.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In the illustrated embodiment, motion of the spine is limited when the proximal end of the device contacts, abuts, and/or wedges against the inferior articular process of the superior adjacent vertebra <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. In this application, it should be appreciated that one or more intermediate member(s) (e.g., plates, platforms, coatings, cement, and/or adhesives) can be can be coupled to the superior adjacent vertebra <b>10</b> <i>b </i>or other portions of the spine that the device contacts, abuts, and/or wedges against. Thus, in this application, when reference is made to the device contacting, abutting and/or wedging against a portion of the spine it should be appreciated that this includes embodiments in which the device contacts, abuts and/or wedges against one or more intermediate members that are coupled to the spine unless otherwise noted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">As explained below, the bone stabilization devices <b>12</b> may be used after laminectomy, discectomy, artificial disc replacement, microdiscectomy, laminotomy and other applications for providing temporary or permanent stability in the spinal column. For example, lateral or central spinal stenosis may be treated with the bone fixation devices <b>12</b> and techniques described below. In such procedures, the bone fixation devices <b>12</b> and techniques may be used alone or in combination with laminectomy, discectomy, artificial disc replacement, and/or other applications for relieving pain and/or providing stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">An embodiment of the stabilization device <b>12</b> will now be described in detail with initial reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. The stabilization device <b>12</b> comprises a body <b>28</b> that extends between a proximal end <b>30</b> and a distal end <b>32</b>. The length, diameter and construction materials of the body <b>28</b> can be varied, depending upon the intended clinical application. In embodiments optimized for spinal stabilization in an adult human population, the body <b>28</b> will generally be within the range of from about 20-90 mm in length and within the range of from about 3.0-8.5 mm in maximum diameter. The length of the helical anchor, discussed below, may be about 8-80 millimeters. Of course, it is understood that these dimensions are illustrative and that they may be varied as required for a particular patient or procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the body <b>28</b> comprises titanium. However, as will be described in more detail below, other metals, or bioabsorbable or nonabsorbable polymeric materials may be utilized, depending upon the dimensions and desired structural integrity of the finished stabilization device <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The distal end <b>32</b> of the body <b>28</b> is provided with a cancellous bone anchor and/or distal cortical bone anchor <b>34</b>. Generally, for spinal stabilization, the distal bone anchor <b>34</b> is adapted to be rotationally inserted into a portion (e.g., the pars or pedicle) of a first vertebra. In the illustrated embodiment, the distal anchor <b>34</b> comprises a helical locking structure <b>72</b> for engaging cancellous and/or distal cortical bone. In the illustrated embodiment, the locking structure <b>72</b> comprises a flange that is wrapped around a central core <b>73</b>, which in the illustrated embodiment is generally cylindrical in shape. The flange <b>72</b> extends through at least one and generally from about two to about 50 or more full revolutions depending upon the axial length of the distal anchor <b>34</b> and intended application. The flange will generally complete from about 2 to about 60 revolutions. The helical flange <b>72</b> is preferably provided with a pitch and an axial spacing to optimize the retention force within cancellous bone. While the helical locking structure <b>72</b> is generally preferred for the distal anchor, it should be appreciated that other distal anchor could comprises other structures configured to secure the device in the cancellous bone anchor and/or distal cortical bone, such as, for example, various combinations and sub-combinations of hooks, prongs, expandable flanges, etc. See also e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,648,890, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The helical flange <b>72</b> of the illustrated embodiment has a generally triangular cross-sectional shape (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). However, it should be appreciated that the helical flange <b>72</b> can have any of a variety of cross sectional shapes, such as rectangular, oval or other as deemed desirable for a particular application through routine experimentation in view of the disclosure herein. For example, in one modified embodiment, the flange <b>72</b> has a triangular cross-sectional shape with a blunted or square apex. One particularly advantageous cross-sectional shape of the flange are the blunted or square type shapes. Such shapes can reduce cutting into the bone as the proximal end of the device is activated against causing a windshield wiper effect that can loosen the device <b>12</b>. The outer edge of the helical flange <b>72</b> defines an outer boundary. The ratio of the diameter of the outer boundary to the diameter of the central core <b>73</b> can be optimized with respect to the desired retention force within the cancellous bone and giving due consideration to the structural integrity and strength of the distal anchor <b>34</b>. Another aspect of the distal anchor <b>34</b> that can be optimized is the shape of the outer boundary and the central core <b>73</b>, which in the illustrated embodiment are generally cylindrical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The distal end <b>32</b> and/or the outer edges of the helical flange <b>72</b> may be atraumatic (e.g., blunt or soft). This inhibits the tendency of the stabilization device <b>12</b> to migrate anatomically distally and potentially out of the vertebrae after implantation. Distal migration is also inhibited by the dimensions and presence of a proximal anchor <b>50</b>, which will be described below. In the spinal column, distal migration is particularly disadvantageous because the distal anchor <b>34</b> may harm the tissue, nerves, blood vessels and/or spinal cord which lie within and/or surround the spine. Such features also reduce the tendency of the distal anchor to cut into the bone during the “window-wiper effect” that is caused by cyclic loading of the device as will be described. In other embodiments, the distal end <b>32</b> and/or the outer edges of the helical flange <b>72</b> may be sharp and/or configured such that the distal anchor <b>34</b> is self tapping and/or self drilling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">A variety of other embodiments for the distal anchor <b>32</b> can also be used. For example, the various distal anchors described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/012,687, filed Nov. 13, 2001 can be incorporated into the stabilization device <b>12</b> described herein. The entire contents of this application are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. In particular, the distal anchor <b>32</b> may comprise a single helical thread surrounding a lumen, much as in a conventional corkscrew. Alternatively, a double helical thread may be utilized, with the distal end of the first thread rotationally offset from the distal end of the second thread. The use of a double helical thread can enable a greater axial travel for a given degree of rotation and greater retention force than a corresponding single helical thread. Specific distal anchor designs can be optimized for the intended use, taking into account desired performance characteristics, the integrity of the distal bone, and whether the distal anchor is intended to engage exclusively cancellous bone or will also engage cortical bone. In still other embodiments, the distal anchor <b>34</b> may be formed without a helical flange. For example, various embodiments of levers, prongs, hooks and/or radially expandable devices may also be used. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,648,890, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the body <b>28</b> is cannulated forming a central lumen <b>42</b> to accommodate installation over a placement wire as is understood in the art. The cross section of the illustrated central lumen is circular but in other embodiments may be non circular, e.g., hexagonal, to accommodate a corresponding male tool for installation or removal of the body <b>28</b> as explained below. In other embodiments, the body <b>28</b> may partially or wholly solid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the proximal end <b>30</b> of the body <b>28</b> is provided with a rotational coupling <b>70</b>, for allowing the body <b>28</b> to be rotated. Rotation of the rotational coupling <b>70</b> can be utilized to rotationally drive the distal anchor <b>32</b> into the bone. In such embodiments, any of a variety of rotation devices may be utilized, such as electric drills or hand tools, which allow the clinician to manually rotate the proximal end <b>30</b> of the body <b>28</b>. Thus, the rotational coupling <b>70</b> may have any of a variety of cross sectional configurations, such as one or more curved faces, flats or splines. In the illustrated embodiment, the rotational coupling <b>70</b> is a male element in the form of a hexagonal projection. However, in other embodiments, the rotational coupling <b>70</b> may be in the form of a female component, machined, milled or attached to the proximal end <b>30</b> of the body <b>28</b>. For example, in one such embodiment, the rotational coupling <b>70</b> comprises an axial recess with a polygonal cross section, such as a hexagonal cross section. As explained above, the axial recess may be provided as part of the central lumen <b>42</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The proximal end <b>30</b> of the fixation device is also provided with a proximal anchor <b>50</b>. The proximal anchor <b>50</b> comprises a housing <b>52</b>, which forms a lumen <b>53</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) configured such that the body <b>28</b> may extend, at least partially, through the proximal anchor <b>50</b>. The proximal anchor <b>50</b> is axially distally moveable along the body <b>28</b> such that the proximal anchor <b>50</b> can be properly placed with respect the inferior vertebral and superior vertebra. As will be explained below, complimentary locking structures such as threads, levers, split rings, and/or ratchet like structures between the proximal anchor <b>50</b> and the body <b>28</b> resist proximal movement of the anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the body <b>28</b> under normal use conditions. The proximal anchor <b>50</b> preferably can be axially advanced along the body <b>28</b> with and/or without rotation as will be apparent from the disclosure herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">With particular reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, in the illustrated embodiment, the complementary structure of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is formed by an annular ring <b>51</b>, which is positioned within an annular recess <b>55</b> formed along the lumen <b>53</b>. As will be explained below, the ring <b>51</b> comprises surface structures <b>54</b> which interact with complimentary surface structures <b>58</b> on the body <b>28</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the complimentary surface structures <b>58</b> comprise a series of annular ridges or grooves <b>60</b> formed on the surface of the body <b>28</b>. The surface structures <b>54</b> and complementary surface structures <b>58</b> permit distal axial travel of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the body <b>28</b>, but resist proximal travel of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the body <b>28</b> as explained below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the annular ring <b>51</b> is split (i.e., has a least one gap) and is interposed between the body <b>28</b> and the recess <b>55</b> of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, the ring <b>51</b> comprises a tubular housing <b>57</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), which defines a gap or space <b>59</b>. In one embodiment, the gap <b>59</b> is defined by a pair of edges <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, that are generally straight and parallel to each other. Although not illustrated, it should be appreciated that in modified embodiments, the ring <b>51</b> can be formed without a gap. When the ring <b>51</b> is positioned along the body <b>28</b>, the ring <b>51</b> preferably surrounds a substantial portion of the body <b>28</b>. The ring <b>51</b> can be configured so that the ring <b>51</b> can flex or move radially outwardly in response to an axial force so that the ring <b>51</b> can be moved relative to the body <b>28</b>, as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">In the illustrated embodiment, the tubular housing <b>57</b> includes at least one and in the illustrated embodiment ten teeth or flanges <b>63</b>, which are configured to engage the complementary surface structures <b>58</b> on the body <b>28</b> in a ratchet-like motion. In the illustrated embodiment (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the teeth or flanges include a first surface <b>65</b> that lies generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the anchor and generally faces the proximal direction (i.e., the direction labeled “P” in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and a second surface <b>67</b> that is inclined with respect to the longitudinal axis of the anchor and that faces distal direction (i.e., the direction labeled “D” in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). It should be noted that the proximal and directions in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are reversed with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the recess <b>55</b> is sized and dimensioned such that as the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is advanced distally over the body, the second surface <b>67</b> of the annular ring <b>51</b> can slide along and over the complementary retention structures <b>58</b> of the body <b>28</b>. That is, the recess <b>55</b> provides a space for the annular ring to move radially away from the body <b>28</b> as the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is advanced distally.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">A distal portion <b>69</b> of the recess <b>55</b> is sized and dimensioned such that after the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is appropriately advanced, proximal motion of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is resisted as the annular ring <b>51</b> becomes wedged between the body <b>28</b> and an angled engagement surface <b>71</b> of the distal portion <b>69</b>. In this manner, proximal movement of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> under normal use conditions may be prevented. In modified embodiments, the annular ring <b>51</b> can be sized and dimensioned such that the ring <b>51</b> is biased inwardly to engage the retention structures <b>58</b> on the body <b>28</b>. The bias of the annular ring <b>51</b> can result in a more effective engagement between the complementary retention structures <b>58</b> of the body and the retention structures <b>54</b> of the ring <b>51</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In certain embodiments, it is advantageous for the outer surface <b>49</b> of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> to rotate with respect to the body <b>28</b>. This arrangement advantageously reduces the tendency of the body <b>28</b> to rotate and/or move within the superior articular process of the inferior vertebrae <b>10</b> <i>a </i>as the outer surface <b>49</b> contacts, abuts or wedges against the inferior articular process of the superior vertebrae <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. In the illustrated embodiment, rotation of the outer surface <b>49</b> is provided by configuring the lumen <b>53</b> and annular recess <b>55</b> such that the anchor <b>50</b> can rotate about the body <b>28</b> and ring <b>51</b>. Preferably, as the anchor <b>50</b> rotates the axial position of the anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the body <b>28</b> remains fixed. That is, the annular ring <b>51</b> resists proximal travel of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the body <b>28</b> while the anchor <b>50</b> is permitted to rotate about the body <b>28</b> and ring <b>51</b>. Of course those of skill in the art will recognize other configurations and mechanisms (e.g., bearings, rollers, slip rings, etc.) for providing rotation of the outer surface <b>49</b> with respect to the body <b>28</b>. In a modified embodiment, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> can be configured such that it does not rotate with respect to the body <b>28</b>. In such an embodiment, a key or one or more anti-rotational features (e.g., splines, grooves, flat sides, etc.) can be provided between the proximal anchor <b>50</b>, the ring <b>51</b> and/or the body <b>51</b> to limit or prevent rotation of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the body <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As mentioned above, it is contemplated that various other retention structures <b>54</b> and complementary retention structures <b>58</b> may be used between the body <b>28</b> and the proximal anchor <b>50</b> to permit distal axial travel of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the body <b>28</b>, but resist proximal travel of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the body <b>28</b>. Examples of such structures can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,685,706, entitled “PROXIMAL ANCHORS FOR BONE FIXATION SYSTEM.” The entire contents of this patent is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein. In such embodiments, the structures <b>54</b> and complementary retention structures <b>58</b> can be configured to allow the proximal anchor to be advanced with or without rotation with respect to the body <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">As mentioned above, the complimentary surface structures <b>58</b> on the body <b>28</b> comprise threads, and/or a series of annular ridges or grooves <b>60</b>. These retention structures <b>58</b> are spaced axially apart along the body <b>28</b>, between a proximal limit <b>62</b> and a distal limit <b>64</b>. See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The axial distance between proximal limit <b>62</b> and distal limit <b>64</b> is related to the desired axial working range of the proximal anchor <b>50</b>, and thus the range of functional sizes of the stabilization device <b>12</b>. Thus, the stabilization device <b>12</b> of the example embodiment can provide accurate placement between the distal anchor <b>34</b> and the proximal anchor <b>50</b> throughout a range of motion following the placement of the distal anchor in a vertebra. That is, the distal anchor <b>34</b> may be positioned within the cancellous and/or distal cortical bone of a vertebra, and the proximal anchor may be distally advanced with respect to the distal anchor throughout a range to provide accurate placement of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the vertebra without needing to relocate the distal anchor <b>34</b> and without needing to initially locate the distal anchor <b>34</b> in a precise position with respect to the proximal side of the bone or another vertebra. The arrangement also allows the compression between the distal anchor <b>34</b> and the proximal anchor <b>50</b> to be adjusted. Providing a working range throughout which positioning of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is independent from setting the distal anchor <b>34</b> allows a single device to be useful for a wide variety of different anatomies, as well as eliminates or reduces the need for accurate device measurement. In addition, this arrangement allows the clinician to adjust the compression force during the procedure without adjusting the position of the distal anchor. In this manner, the clinician may focus on positioning the distal anchor sufficiently within the vertebra to avoid or reduce the potential for distal migration out of the vertebra, which may damage the particularly delicate tissue, blood vessels, nerves and/or spinal cord surrounding or within the spinal column. In addition or alternative, the above described arrangement allows the clinician to adjust the positioning of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the inferior articular process of the superior adjacent vertebrae. In this manner, the clinician may adjust the position of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> without adjusting the position of the distal anchor such that the anchor <b>50</b> is configured to wedge or abut against inferior articular process of the superior adjacent vertebrae. In a modified embodiment, the position of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the surrounding vertebra can be adjusted by rotating the device <b>12</b> and advancing the distal anchor and the proximal anchor carried by the body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> can be distally advanced over the body <b>28</b> without rotating the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the body <b>28</b>. In one embodiment, the ring <b>51</b> and the proximal anchor <b>50</b> are rotationally linked by, for example, providing inter-engaging structures (e.g., tabs, ridges and the like). In such an embodiment, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> can be advanced without rotating the proximal anchor <b>50</b> and be removed and/or the position adjusted in a proximal or distal direction by rotating the proximal anchor with respect to the body <b>28</b>. This can allow the surgeon to remove an proximal anchor and use a different sized or configured proximal anchor <b>50</b> if the first proximal anchor is determined to be inadequate. In such an embodiment, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is preferably provided with one or more engagement structures (e.g., slots, hexes, recesses, protrusions, etc.) configured to engage a rotational and/or gripping device (e.g., slots, hexes, recesses, protrusions, etc.). Thus, in some embodiments, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> can be pulled and/or rotated such that the anchor <b>50</b> is removed from the body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In many applications, the working range is at least about 10% of the overall length of the device, and may be as much as 20% or 50% or more of the overall device length. In the context of a spinal application, working ranges of up to about 10 mm or more may be provided, since estimates within that range can normally be readily accomplished within the clinical setting. The embodiments disclosed herein can be scaled to have a greater or a lesser working range, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In embodiments optimized for spinal stabilization in an adult human population, the anchor <b>50</b> will have a diameter within the range of from about 1 to 1/16 of an inch in another embodiment the proximal anchor proximal anchor <b>50</b> within the range from about 0.5 to ⅛ of an inch in another embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">With reference back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, in the illustrated embodiment, the outer surface <b>49</b> of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> has a smooth or spherical shape. As will be explained below, the outer surface <b>49</b> of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is configured to abut against the inferior facet of the superior adjacent vertebrae. In this manner, motion between the adjacent vertebrae may be limited and/or constrained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which the body <b>28</b> comprises a first portion <b>36</b> and a second portion <b>38</b> that are coupled together at a junction <b>40</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first portion <b>36</b> carries the distal anchor <b>34</b> (shown without a central core) while the second portion <b>38</b> forms the proximal end <b>30</b> of the body <b>28</b>. As will be explained in more detail below, in certain embodiments, the second portion <b>38</b> may be used to pull the body <b>28</b> and therefore will sometimes be referred to as a “pull-pin.” The first and second portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are preferably detachably coupled to each other at the junction <b>40</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are detachably coupled to each other via interlocking threads. Specifically, as best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the body <b>28</b> includes an inner surface <b>41</b>, which defines a central lumen <b>42</b> that preferably extends from the proximal end <b>30</b> to the distal end <b>32</b> throughout the body <b>28</b>. At the proximal end of the first portion <b>36</b>, the inner surface <b>41</b> includes a first threaded portion <b>44</b>. The first threaded portion <b>44</b> is configured to mate with a second threaded portion <b>46</b>, which is located on the outer surface <b>45</b> of the second portion <b>38</b>. The interlocking annular threads of the first and second threaded portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> allow the first and second portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> to be detachably coupled to each other. In one modified embodiment, the orientation of the first and second threaded portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> can be reversed. That is, the first threaded portion <b>44</b> can be located on the outer surface of the first portion <b>36</b> and the second threaded portion <b>46</b> can be located on the inner surface <b>41</b> at the distal end of the second portion <b>38</b>. Any of a variety of other releasable complementary engagement structures may also be used, to allow removal of second portion <b>38</b> following implantation, as is discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">In a modified arrangement, the second portion <b>38</b> can comprise any of a variety of tensioning elements for permitting proximal tension to be placed on the distal anchor <b>34</b> while the proximal anchor is advanced distally to compress the fracture. For example, any of a variety of tubes or wires can be removably attached to the first portion <b>36</b> and extend proximally to the proximal handpiece. In one such arrangement, the first portion <b>36</b> can include a releasable connector in the form of a latching element, such as an eye or hook. The second portion <b>38</b> can include a complementary releasable connector (e.g., a complementary hook) for engaging the first portion <b>36</b>. In this manner, the second portion <b>38</b> can be detachably coupled to the first portion <b>36</b> such proximal traction can be applied to the first portion <b>36</b> through the second portion as will be explained below. Alternatively, the second portion <b>48</b> may be provided with an eye or hook, or transverse bar, around which or through which a suture or wire may be advanced, both ends of which are retained at the proximal end of the device. Following proximal tension on the tensioning element during the compression and/or positioning step, one end of the suture or wire is released, and the other end may be pulled free of the device. Alternate releasable proximal tensioning structures may be devised by those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In a final position, the distal end of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> preferably extends distally past the junction <b>40</b> between the first portion <b>36</b> and the second portion <b>38</b>.

As such, rotation of the proximal collar <b>50</b> is transmitted to the first portion <b>36</b> and distal anchor <b>34</b> of the body <b>28</b>. Of course, those of skill in the art will recognize various other types of splines or other interfit structures can be used to prevent relative rotation of the proximal anchor and the first portion <b>36</b> of the body <b>28</b>. To rotate the proximal anchor <b>50</b>, the housing <b>52</b> may be provided with a gripping structure (not shown) to permit an insertion tool to rotate the flange proximal anchor <b>50</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Methods implanting stabilization devices described above as part of a spinal stabilization procedure will now be described. Although certain aspects and features of the methods and instruments described herein can be utilized in an open surgical procedure, the disclosed methods and instruments are optimized in the context of a percutaneous or minimally invasive approach in which the procedure is done through one or more percutaneous small openings. Thus, the method steps which follow and those disclosed are intended for use in a trans-tissue approach. However, to simplify the illustrations, the soft tissue adjacent the treatment site have not been illustrated in the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In one embodiment of use, a patient with a spinal instability is identified. The patient is preferably positioned face down on an operating table, placing the spinal column into a normal or flexed position. A trocar optionally may then be inserted through a tissue tract and advanced towards a first vertebrae. In another embodiment, biopsy needle (e.g., Jamshidi™) device can be used. A guidewire may then be advanced through the trocar (or directly through the tissue, for example, in an open surgical procedure) and into the first vertebrae. The guide wire is preferably inserted into the pedicle of the vertebrae preferably through the pars (i.e. the region of the lamina between the superior and inferior articular processes). A suitable expandable access sheath or dilator can then be inserted over the guidewire and expanded to enlarge the tissue tract and provide an access lumen for performing the methods described below in a minimally invasive manner. In a modified embodiment, a suitable tissue expander (e.g., a balloon expanded catheter or a series of radially enlarged sheaths) can be inserted over the guidewire and expanded to enlarge the tissue tract. A surgical sheath can then be advanced over the expanded tissue expander. The tissue expander can then be removed such that the surgical sheath provides an enlarged access lumen. Any of a variety of expandable access sheaths or tissue expanders can be used, such as, for example, a balloon expanded catheter, a series of radially enlarged sheaths inserted over each other, and/or the dilation introducer described in U.S. patent application Ser.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">A drill with a rotatable tip may be advanced over the guidewire and through the sheath.

The opening may be configured for (i) for insertion of the body <b>28</b> of the bone stabilization device <b>12</b>, (ii) taping and/or (iii) providing a counter sink for the proximal anchor <b>50</b>. In other embodiments, the step of drilling may be omitted. In such embodiments, the distal anchor <b>34</b> is preferably self-tapping and self drilling. In embodiments, in which an opening is formed, a wire or other instrument may be inserted into the opening and used to measure the desired length of the body <b>29</b> of the device <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The body <b>28</b> of the fixation device may be advanced over the guidewire and through the sheath until it engages the vertebrae. The body <b>28</b> may be coupled to a suitable insertion tool prior to the step of engaging the fixation device <b>12</b> with the vertebrae. The insertion tool may be configured to engage the coupling <b>70</b> on the proximal end of the body <b>28</b> such that insertion tool may be used to rotate the body <b>28</b>. In such an embodiment, the fixation device <b>12</b> is preferably configured such that it can also be advanced over the guidewire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">The insertion tool may be used to rotate the body <b>28</b> thereby driving the distal anchor <b>34</b> to the desired depth within the pedicle of the vertebrae.

In another embodiment, the anchor <b>50</b> may be pre-attached and/or coupled to the body <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In one embodiment, the clinician will have access to an array of devices <b>12</b>, having, for example, different diameters, axial lengths, configurations and/or shapes. The clinician will assess the position of the body <b>28</b> with respect to the superior vertebrae and chose the device <b>12</b> from the array, which best fits the patient anatomy to achieve the desired clinical result. In another embodiment, the clinician will have access to an array of devices <b>12</b>, having, for example, bodies <b>28</b> of different diameters, axial lengths. The clinician will also have an array of proximal anchors <b>50</b>, having, for example, different configurations and/or shapes. The clinician will choose the appropriate body <b>28</b> and then assess the position of the body <b>28</b> with respect to the superior vertebrae and chose the proximal anchor <b>50</b> from the array, which best fits the patient anatomy to achieve the desired clinical result. In such an embodiment, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is advantageously coupled to body <b>28</b> after the body <b>28</b> is partially or fully inserted into the vertebrae.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Once the distal anchor <b>34</b> is in the desired location, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is preferably advanced over the body <b>28</b> until it reaches its desired position. This may be accomplished by pushing on the proximal anchor <b>50</b> or by applying a distal force to the proximal anchor <b>50</b>. In another embodiment, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is advanced by applying a proximal retraction force to the proximal end <b>30</b> of body <b>28</b>, such as by conventional hemostats, pliers or a calibrated loading device, while distal force is applied to the proximal anchor <b>50</b>. In this manner, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is advanced distally with respect to the body <b>28</b> until the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is in its proper position (e.g., positioned snugly against the outer surface of the vertebra.) Appropriate tensioning of the stabilization device <b>12</b> can be accomplished by tactile feedback or through the use of a calibration device for applying a predetermined load on the stabilization device <b>12</b>. As explained above, one advantage of the structure of the illustrated embodiments is the ability to adjust the compression and/or the position of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> independently of the setting of the distal anchor <b>34</b> within the vertebra. For example, the positioning of the distal anchor <b>34</b> within the vertebra can be decoupled from the positioning of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> with respect to the superior vertebra.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> is pushed over the body <b>28</b> by tapping the device with a slap hammer or similar device that can be used over a guidewire. In this manner, the distal end of the device <b>12</b> is advantageously minimally disturbed, which prevents (or minimizes) the threads in the bore from being stripped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">Following appropriate tensioning of the proximal anchor <b>50</b>, the proximal portion of the body <b>28</b> extending proximally from the proximal anchor <b>50</b> can be removed. In one embodiment, this may involve cutting the proximal end of the body <b>28</b>. For example, the proximal end of the body may be separated by a cutting instrument or by cauterizing. Cauterizing may fuse the proximal anchor <b>50</b> to the body <b>32</b> thereby adding to the retention force between the proximal anchor <b>50</b> and the body <b>28</b>. Such fusion between the proximal anchor and the body may be particularly advantageous if the pin and the proximal anchor are made from a polymeric or plastic material. In this manner, as the material of the proximal anchor and/or the pin is absorbed or degrades, the fusion caused by the cauterizing continues to provide retention force between the proximal anchor and the body.

In this manner, extension is limited while other motion is not. For example, flexion, lateral movement and/or torsion between the superior and inferior vertebra is not limited or constrained. In this manner, the natural motion of the spine can be preserved, especially for those patients with mild or moderate disc conditions. Preferably, the devices are implantable through a minimally invasive procedure and, more preferably, through the use of small percutaneous openings as described above. In this manner, the high cost, lengthy in-patient hospital stays and the pain associated with open procedures can be avoided and/or reduced. In one embodiment, the devices <b>12</b> may be removed and/or proximal anchors <b>50</b> may be removed in a subsequent procedure if the patient's condition improves.

For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a proximal anchor <b>700</b> in which the proximal anchor <b>700</b> can be radially expanded such that the relationship between the anchor <b>700</b> and the adjacent vertebrae can be adjusted by the surgeon. In this embodiment, the anchor <b>700</b> comprises an wall <b>702</b>, which can be formed of an elastic material. The wall is coupled to an inner member <b>704</b> that comprises a tubular housing <b>706</b> and a proximal flange <b>708</b>, which can be arranged as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. The wall <b>702</b> and the inner member <b>704</b> define a cavity <b>710</b>, which can be filled with an inflation material <b>712</b>, such as, for example, a gas, liquid, gel, and/or hardenable or semi-hardenable media (e.g., an polymer, epoxy or cement). One or more valves <b>714</b> (e.g., a duck bill valve) can be provided along the wall <b>702</b>. An inflation lumen <b>716</b> can extend through the valve such that the cavity <b>710</b> can be inflated with the inflation material <b>712</b>. After inflation, the lumen <b>716</b> is removed and the valve <b>714</b> seals the cavity <b>710</b>. One or more dividing walls <b>718</b> can be provided with the cavity <b>710</b> such that the anchor <b>50</b> can be inflated in discrete or semi-discrete sections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">In one embodiment of use, the body <b>28</b> and proximal anchor <b>700</b> are inserted into position as described herein. The cavity <b>710</b> is then inflated to expand the proximal anchor <b>50</b> and increases its diameter. In this manner, the surgeon can control the degree to which the proximal anchor <b>50</b> limits the motion of the spine. For example, in one embodiment, increasing the diameter of the proximal anchor <b>50</b> would increase the distance between the two vertebrae. In some embodiments, the inflation material <b>712</b> can also be removed such that the dimensions can be decreased during the same procedure in which the device <b>12</b> is inserted into the spine. In still other embodiments, the inflation material <b>712</b> can be added or removed in a subsequent, preferably, minimally invasive second procedure such that the degree which the proximal anchor <b>50</b> limits the motion of the spine can be adjusted in the second, subsequent procedure. In one embodiment, this is done by inserting a lumen through the valve and adding and/or removing the inflation media <b>712</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A-D</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a proximal anchor <b>750</b> in which one or more dimensions of the anchor <b>750</b> an be adjusted. In this embodiment, the dimensions are adjusted using a mechanical mechanism. With reference to the illustrated embodiment, the anchor <b>750</b> can include a proximal member <b>752</b> and a distal member <b>754</b>, which can be moveably carried by the body <b>28</b> as described below. The proximal member <b>752</b> defines a proximal stop <b>756</b> and the distal member <b>754</b> defines a distal stop <b>758</b>. An expandable member <b>760</b> is positioned between the proximal and distal stops <b>756</b>, <b>758</b>. The expandable member <b>760</b> is configured to expand radially as the proximal and distal stops <b>756</b>, <b>758</b> are moved towards each other and the expandable member <b>760</b> is compressed therebetween. In one embodiment, the expandable member <b>760</b> comprises an elastic material that when compressed expands as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>. In another embodiment, the expandable member <b>760</b> comprises a malleable material (e.g., a metal or metal alloy) that is provided with one or more slots. In such an embodiment, the slots allow the member <b>760</b> to expand as it is compressed between the proximal and distal stops <b>756</b>, <b>758</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>, the proximal member <b>752</b> can be provided with a recess <b>55</b> and ring <b>51</b> as described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In this manner, the proximal member <b>752</b> can be advanced in the distal direction while proximal movement of the member <b>752</b> is resisted. Of course, other complementary retention structures can be used between the member <b>752</b> and the body <b>28</b> as described to permit distal movement while resisting proximal movement. The distal movement of the distal member <b>754</b> can be prevented by a distal stop <b>762</b> provided on the body <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>, the distal member <b>754</b> can be provided with a smooth bore <b>764</b> such that it can be advanced over the body <b>28</b> towards the distal stop <b>762</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a proximal anchor <b>770</b> which is similar to the previous embodiment. In this embodiment, the proximal member <b>752</b> includes threads <b>772</b> such that the proximal member <b>752</b> can be distally advanced or proximal retracted by rotation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a proximal anchor <b>780</b>. In this embodiment, the proximal member <b>752</b> is configured as described with reference FIG. <b>20</b>D. However, the distal member <b>754</b> is provided with threads <b>782</b> such that the position of the distal member <b>754</b> on the body <b>28</b> can be adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The above described devices and techniques limit motion of the spine by providing an abutment or wedge surface on one vertebrae or body structure. The abutment surface contacts, abuts, and/or wedges against a portion of a second, adjacent vertebrae or body structure so as limit least one degree of motion between the two vertebra or body structure while permitting at least one other degree of motion. While the above described devices and techniques are generally preferred, certain features and aspects can be extended to modified embodiments for limiting motion between vertebra. These modified embodiments will now be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In one embodiment, the proximal anchor <b>50</b> of the fixation device may be, coupled to, attached or integrally formed with the body <b>28</b>. In this manner, movement between the proximal anchor <b>50</b> and the body <b>28</b> is not permitted. Instead, the clinician may chose a fixation device of the proper length and advance the device into the vertebrae until the proximal anchor lies flush with the vertebrae or is otherwise positioned accordingly with respect to the vertebrae. In one particular, embodiment, the proximal anchor that is coupled to, attached or integrally formed with the body <b>28</b> is configured to have an outer surface which can rotate, preferably freely, with respect to the body <b>28</b>. This arrangement advantageously reduces the tendency of the device to rotate and/or move within the inferior vertebrae as the proximal anchor <b>50</b> contacts the superior vertebrae.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">In another embodiment, the abutment surface may be attached to the vertebrae through the use of an adhesive, fasteners, staples, screws and the like. In still another embodiment, the abutment surface may formed on a distal end of a stabilization device that is inserted through the front side of the vertebrae.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">In the embodiments described above, the device <b>12</b> is generally inserted into the spine from a posterior position such that a distal end of the device <b>12</b> is inserted into the first, inferior vertebrae and a proximal end of the device <b>12</b> contacts or wedges against the second, superior vertebrae. However, it is anticipated that certain features and aspects of the embodiments described herein can be applied to a procedure in which the device is inserted from a lateral or anterior site. In such an embodiment, the distal end or side portion of the device may contact or wedge against the second superior vertebrae. Such embodiments provide a contact or wedge surface which is supported by one body structure to limit of the motion of an adjacent body structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">In the embodiments, described above, it is generally advantageous that the proximal anchor be radiopaque or otherwise configured such that in can be seen with visual aids used during surgery. In this manner, the surgeon can more accurately position the proximal anchor with respect to the superior and inferior vertebra.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Preferably, the clinician will have access to an array of fixation devices <b>12</b>, having, for example, different diameters, axial lengths and, if applicable, angular relationships. These may be packaged one or more per package in sterile or non-sterile envelopes or peelable pouches, or in dispensing cartridges which may each hold a plurality of devices <b>12</b>. The clinician will assess the dimensions and load requirements, and select a fixation device from the array, which meets the desired specifications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">The fixation devices may also be made from conventional non-absorbable, biocompatible materials including stainless steel, titanium, alloys thereof, polymers, composites and the like and equivalents thereof. In one embodiment, the distal anchor comprises a metal helix, while the body and the proximal anchor comprise a bioabsorbable material. In another embodiment, the body is made of PEEK™ polymer or similar plastic material. Alternatively, the distal anchor comprises a bioabsorbable material, and the body and proximal anchor comprise either a bioabsorbable material or a non-absorbable material. As a further alternative, each of the distal anchor and the body comprise a non-absorbable material, connected by an absorbable link. This may be accomplished by providing a concentric fit between the distal anchor and the body, with a transverse absorbable pin extending therethrough. This embodiment will enable removal of the body following dissipation of the pin, while leaving the distal anchor within the bone.</div>
