<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a work machine.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In a hydraulic excavator, work members such as a boom, an arm, and a bucket (hereinafter also referred to as the “front work device”) are each rotatably supported, so that, when operated singly, the forward end of the bucket crowds an arcuate locus. Thus, in the case where a linear finished surface is to be formed with the forward end of the bucket, for example, through arm crowding operation, it is necessary for the operator to drive the boom, the arm and the bucket in a combined fashion to make the locus of the bucket forward end linear. Thus, high skill is required of the operator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In view of this, a technique is available according to which a function by which the driving of actuator is controlled automatically or semi-automatically by a computer (controller) (the function is referred to as a machine control) is applied to excavation works, with the forward end of the bucket being moved along a target surface at the time of excavating operation (at the time of operation of the arm or the bucket). As a technique of this type, there is known one according to which a boom cylinder is automatically controlled during excavating operation through control by the operator to add the boom raising operation as appropriate, limiting the bucket forward end position to the target surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A configuration of a target surface is not always set as a single flat surface, and there are cases where a plurality of target surfaces are set continuously. Disclosed in Patent Document 1 is a technique according to which when a target configuration of the excavation work is defined by at least one segment defined by two points, an operation signal is corrected such that the operation of at least one of the plurality of hydraulic actuators is reduced when the distal end of the work device approaches one of a plurality of points determining the at least one segment.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In Patent Document 1, a control object of the work device is the distal end of the work device. The work device is decelerated in accordance with the distance between one of the points defining the target surface (segment) and the distal end of the work device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Depending on the posture of the bucket constituting the distal end of the work device, however, there are cases where not the forward end (claw tip) of the bucket but some other point on the bucket (e.g., the rear end of the bucket which is the point on the opposite side of the bucket forward end at a bucket bottom surface portion) is closest to the target surface. In such cases, proper control is impossible with the technique of Patent Document 1, and there is a possibility of the other point (e.g., the rear end of the bucket) intruding the target surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a work machine performing proper deceleration control on the work device in the case where there are a plurality of target surfaces.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The present application includes a plurality of means for solving the above problem, an example of which is a work machine including: a multi-joint type work device formed by connecting a plurality of driven members and configured to operate in a predetermined operational plane; a plurality of hydraulic actuators each driving corresponding one of the plurality of driven members on the basis of an operation signal; an operation device outputting the operation signal to a hydraulic actuator desired by an operator among the plurality of hydraulic actuators; and a controller that executes area limiting control such that the work device moves on a target surface of a control object and in an area above the target surface, by outputting the operation signal to at least one of the plurality of actuators or by correcting the operation signal output to at least one of the plurality of hydraulic actuators. The controller is equipped with a storage device storing two segments that are connected at a different angle in the operational plane and that can be the target surface of the control object, a position of an inflection point that is an intersection of the two segments in the operational plane, and a first reference point and a second reference point set at a distal end portion of the work device, a position computing section computing positions of the first reference point and the second reference point in the operational plane on the basis of a posture of the work device, and a first distance computing section computing distances from the first reference point and the second reference point in the operational plane to the target surface of the control object; and when a smaller one of the distances from the first reference point and the second reference point to the target surface of the control object is equal to or lower than a threshold value, the controller corrects the operation signal output from the operation device so as to reduce an operational speed of the hydraulic actuator that is an control target of the operation signal.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, even when there exist a plurality of target surfaces, proper deceleration control is executed, and it is possible to prevent intrusion of the work device on the target surfaces.</div>

While in the following the present invention is applied to a hydraulic excavator equipped with a bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>as the attachment at the distal end of a work device, the present invention may also be applied to a hydraulic excavator equipped with an attachment other than a bucket. Further, the present invention is also applicable to a work machine other than a hydraulic excavator so long as it has a multi-joint type work device formed by connecting together a plurality of driven members and configured to operate in a predetermined operational plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In the following description, when there exist a plurality of same components, a letter may be affixed to the end of the character (number). In some cases, however, the letter may be omitted, and the plurality of components may be given collectively. For example, when there exist three pumps <b>300</b> <i>a</i>, <b>300</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>300</b> <i>c</i>, these may be collectively written as pumps <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the hydraulic excavator to which the present invention is applied has: a hydraulic pump <b>2</b>; a plurality of hydraulic actuators including a boom cylinder <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, an arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, a bucket cylinder <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, a swing motor <b>3</b> <i>d</i>, and left and right traveling motors <b>3</b> <i>e </i>and <b>3</b> <i>f </i>which are driven by a hydraulic working fluid from the hydraulic pump <b>2</b>; a plurality of operation lever devices (operation devices) <b>4</b> <i>a </i>through <b>4</b> <i>f </i>provided respectively in correspondence with the hydraulic actuators <b>3</b> <i>a </i>through <b>3</b> <i>f</i>; a plurality of flow control valves <b>5</b> <i>a </i>through <b>5</b> <i>f </i>connected between the hydraulic pump <b>2</b> and the plurality of hydraulic actuators <b>3</b> <i>a </i>through <b>3</b> <i>f</i>, controlled by an operation signal output in accordance with the operation amount and the operating direction of the operation lever devices <b>4</b> <i>a </i>through <b>4</b> <i>f</i>, and controlling the flow rate and the direction of the hydraulic working fluid supplied to the actuators <b>3</b> <i>a </i>through <b>3</b> <i>f</i>; and a relief valve <b>6</b> configured to be opened when the pressure between the hydraulic pump <b>2</b> and the flow control valves <b>5</b> <i>a </i>through <b>5</b> <i>f </i>is equal to or more than a set value. These constitute a hydraulic drive system driving the driven members of the hydraulic excavator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hydraulic excavator is composed of a multi-joint type front work device <b>1</b>A formed by connecting a plurality of vertically rotating driven members (a boom <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, an arm <b>1</b> <i>b</i>, and a bucket <b>1</b> <i>c</i>), and a machine body <b>1</b>B consisting of an upper swing structure <b>1</b> <i>d </i>and a lower track structure <b>1</b> <i>e</i>, and the proximal end of the boom <b>1</b> <i>a </i>of the front work device <b>1</b>A is supported by the front portion of the upper swing structure <b>1</b> <i>d</i>. The boom <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, the arm <b>1</b> <i>b</i>, the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c</i>, the upper swing structure <b>1</b> <i>d</i>, and the lower track structure <b>1</b> <i>e </i>constitute the driven members respectively driven by a boom cylinder <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, an arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, a bucket cylinder <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, a swing motor <b>3</b> <i>d</i>, and left and right traveling motors <b>3</b> <i>e </i>and <b>3</b> <i>f. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The boom <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, the arm <b>1</b> <i>b</i>, and the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>operate in a plane orthogonal to the front work device <b>1</b>A in the width direction. In the following, this plane may be referred to as the operational plane. The operational plane is a plane orthogonal to the rotation shafts of the boom <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, the arm <b>1</b> <i>b</i>, and the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c</i>, and can be set at the center in the width direction of the boom <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, the arm <b>1</b> <i>b</i>, and the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The operations of the boom cylinder <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, the arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, the bucket cylinder <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, the swing motor <b>3</b> <i>d</i>, and the left and right traveling motors <b>3</b> <i>e </i>and <b>3</b> <i>f </i>are designated by operation signals (pilot pressures) input to hydraulic drive sections <b>50</b> <i>a </i>through <b>55</b> <i>b </i>of the flow control valves <b>5</b> <i>a </i>through <b>5</b> <i>f </i>controlling the direction and the flow rate of the hydraulic working fluid supplied to the actuators <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, <b>3</b> <i>d</i>, <b>3</b> <i>e</i>, and <b>3</b> <i>f</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The operation lever devices <b>4</b> <i>a </i>through <b>4</b> <i>f </i>are of the hydraulic pilot type. They supply as operation signals pilot pressures in correspondence with the operation amounts of the operation levers <b>4</b> <i>a </i>through <b>4</b> <i>f </i>respectively operated by the operator to the hydraulic drive sections <b>50</b> <i>a </i>through <b>55</b> <i>b </i>of the flow control valves <b>5</b> <i>a </i>through <b>5</b> <i>f </i>corresponding to the operational direction via pilot lines <b>44</b> <i>a </i>through <b>49</b> <i>b</i>, and drive these flow control valves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The hydraulic excavator of the present embodiment is equipped with a control system aiding the excavating operation of the operator. More specifically, there is provided an excavation control system that executes control in which, when excavating operation (more specifically, designation of arm crowding, bucket crowding, or bucket dumping) is input via the operation lever devices <b>4</b> <i>b </i>and <b>4</b> <i>c</i>, based on the positional relationship between a control point set at the distal end portion of the work device <b>1</b>A and a target surface, the position of the control point is maintained in an area on or above the target surface, with at least one of the hydraulic actuators <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>3</b> <i>c </i>being forcibly operated such that it does not intrude the area under the target surface (with, for example, the boom cylinder <b>3</b> <i>a </i>being extended to forcibly perform the boom raising operation). In this specification, this control is sometimes referred to as “area limiting control” or “machine control.” Due to this control, intrusion of the control point into the area below the target surface is prevented, so that it is possible to perform excavation along the target surface independently of the degree of skill of the operator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the control point related to the area limiting control is set on a segment connecting the forward end P<b>1</b> and the rear end Q<b>1</b> of the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>(the segment is referred to as the “control line”). Further, in the present embodiment, the control point is set on the control line. In the case where the control line is above the target surface, the point on the control line that is closest to the target surface is used as the control point, and in the case where the control line crosses the target surface or below the target surface, the point on the control line that is most intruding on the target surface is used as the control point. Thus, in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the bucket rear end Q<b>1</b> serves as the control point. Regarding the control line it is also possible to select a segment other than that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as the control line so long as it is included in the contour of the sectional configuration of the distal end portion of the work device <b>1</b>A (e.g., the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c</i>) taken along the operational plane. Further, there are no limitations to the rule by which the control point is set on the control line. For example, it may be selectable arbitrary by the operator from the control line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The excavation control system used for area limiting control is equipped with: an area limiting switch <b>7</b> installed at a position where it does not interfere with the field of vision of the operator, for example, above the operation panel in the cab, and configured to switch between effective and ineffective of the area limiting control; a storage device (e.g., ROM) <b>93</b> storing various items of information such as information on the target configuration of the excavation object set continuously by a plurality of target surfaces (segments) (target configuration information), and the area where the control point of the work device <b>1</b>A is to operate for the purpose of forming the target configuration (which is also referred to as the “set area”); angle sensors <b>8</b> <i>a</i>, <b>8</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>8</b> <i>c </i>provided at the respective rotational fulcrums of the boom <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, the arm <b>1</b> <i>b</i>, and the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>and detecting their rotational angles as condition amounts related to the position and posture of the front work device <b>1</b>A; and an inclination angle sensor <b>8</b> <i>d </i>detecting the inclination angle in the front-rear direction of the machine body <b>1</b>B with respect to a reference surface (e.g., a horizontal surface).</div>

In the following, the end point of each target surface may be referred to as the “inflection point.” The target configuration may be defined by connecting together the target surfaces of the same angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The target configuration information is gained, for example, by defining the target configuration by inputting the points on each segment to the operational plane on the spot by using the claw tip or the like of the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>as the reference.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Next, the feature of the above embodiment will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">(1) According to the above embodiment, there is provided a work machine (hydraulic excavator) including: a multi-joint type work device (e.g., a work device <b>1</b>A) formed by connecting a plurality of driven members (e.g., a boom <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, an arm <b>1</b> <i>b</i>, and a bucket <b>1</b> <i>c</i>) and configured to operate in a predetermined operational plane (e.g., in an XY plane or an XaYa plane); a plurality of hydraulic actuators (e.g., a boom cylinder <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, an arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, and a bucket cylinder <b>3</b> <i>c</i>) respectively driving the plurality of driven members based on an operation signal (e.g., a pilot pressure); an operation device (an operation lever device <b>4</b>) outputting the operation signal to a hydraulic actuator of the plurality of hydraulic actuators, desired by the operator; and an operation control section <b>900</b> (a control unit <b>9</b>) that executes area limiting control such that the work device moves on a target surface (on a target surface A or on a boundary L) of a control object or in an area above the same (within a set area), by outputting the operation signal to at least one of the plurality of actuators or by correcting the operation signal output to at least one of the plurality of hydraulic actuators. The operation control section is equipped with a storage device (e.g., a ROM <b>93</b> of the control unit <b>9</b>) storing two segments (target surfaces A and B) that are connected at a different angle in the operational plane and that can be the target surface of the control object, a position of an inflection point C that is the intersection of the two segments in the operation plane, and a first reference point P<b>1</b> and a second reference point Q<b>1</b> set at a distal end portion (the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c</i>) of the work device, a position computing section <b>21</b> (control unit <b>9</b>) computing the positions of the first reference point P<b>1</b> and the second reference point Q<b>1</b> in the operational plane based on the posture of the work device <b>1</b>A, and a first distance computing section <b>22</b> (control unit <b>9</b>) calculating distances PC<b>1</b> and QC<b>1</b> from the first reference point P<b>1</b> and the second reference point Q<b>1</b> in the operational plane to the target surface of the control object; and when the smaller of the distances PC<b>1</b> and QC<b>1</b> from the first reference point P<b>1</b> and the second reference point Q<b>1</b> to the target surface of the control object is equal to or lower than a threshold value T<b>1</b>, the operation control section <b>900</b> corrects an operation signal output from the operation device so as to reduce the operational speed of a hydraulic actuator (e.g., the arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b</i>) that is the control target of the operation signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">For example, when it is determined whether or not the deceleration of the arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b </i>is necessary based on the distance from one reference point set at the distal end portion of the work device <b>1</b>A (e.g., the control point set at the claw tip of the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c</i>) to the inflection point C, deceleration cannot be effected when another point on the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>which is not the reference point approaches the target surface of the control object, and there is a fear of the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>coming into contact with the target surface or getting below the target surface. However, when, as in the present embodiment, it is determined whether or not the deceleration of the arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b </i>is necessary based on the magnitudes of the distances PC<b>1</b> and QC<b>1</b> from the two reference points P<b>1</b> and Q<b>1</b> set at the distal end portion of the work device <b>1</b>A to the inflection point C as in the present embodiment, the deceleration of the arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b </i>is executed when one of the two reference points P<b>1</b> and Q<b>1</b> approaches the target surface of the control object, so that it is possible to reliably prevent the work device <b>1</b>A (control point) from intruding into the target surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">As the first reference point and the second reference point, it is possible to arbitrarily select points suitable for determining whether or not the distal end portion of the work device <b>1</b>A has approached the target surface from the surface of the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>and the vicinity thereof (the distal end portion of the work device <b>1</b>A). That is, a point other than the bucket forward end P<b>1</b> and the bucket rear end Q<b>1</b> can be selected. For example, it is also possible to select a point at the bottom surface P<b>3</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>or a point at the outermost portion P<b>4</b> of the bucket link (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Further, it is also possible to select three or more reference points so long as they are on the surface of the distal end portion of the work device <b>1</b>A, performing the control of the present application based on the reference points or the distances from the projection points thereof to the inflection point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">(2) In the above embodiment, the work machine of the above item (1) may further include: a projection position computing section <b>24</b> (control unit <b>9</b>) calculating the positions, in the operational plane, of two projection points P<b>2</b> and Q<b>2</b> obtained through projection of the first reference point P<b>1</b> and the second reference point Q<b>1</b> onto the target surface of the control object, and a second distance computing section <b>25</b> (control unit <b>9</b>) calculating the distances PC<b>2</b> and QC<b>2</b> from the positions of the two projection points in the operational plane to the inflection point C. In the case where the operation control section <b>900</b> reduces the operational speed of the hydraulic actuator (e.g., the arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b</i>) constituting the control target of the operation signal, the smaller the smaller of the distances PC<b>2</b> and QC<b>2</b> from the two projection points to the inflection point, the smaller the deceleration coefficient (Kd), whereby the degree of reduction is set to be large.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Here, as compared with the smaller of the distances PC<b>1</b> and QC<b>1</b> from the two reference points P<b>1</b> and Q<b>1</b> to the target surface A and the smaller of the distances from P<b>1</b> and Q<b>1</b> to the inflection point C, the smaller of the distances PC<b>2</b> and QC<b>2</b> from the two projection points P<b>2</b> and Q<b>2</b> to the inflection point C serves as an appropriate index indicating the degree of approach of the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>and the inflection point C on the target surface A, and also serves as an index indicating the approximation degree of the next target surface B subsequent to the inflection point C and the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c</i>. If, in order to prevent intrusion into the next target surface B, the deceleration degree is determined using the distances PC<b>1</b> and QC<b>1</b> as the references, there is a fear of the deceleration becoming excessive to cause the operator to experience discomfort. However, when, as in the present embodiment, the deceleration degree is determined by using the distances PC<b>2</b> and QC<b>2</b> as the reference, the deceleration degree is determined by using the approximation degree of the next target surface B and the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c</i>, so that there is no excessive deceleration, and it is possible to prevent intrusion into the next target surface B. In the present structure, proper deceleration is executed in the case where the smaller value of PC<b>2</b> and QC<b>2</b> is smaller than the smaller value of PC<b>1</b> and QC<b>1</b> (e.g., in the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), whereby a particularly marked effect is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">It is not necessary for the surface (projection surface) onto which the two reference points P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> and the inflection point C are projected to be the target surface of the control object. It is only necessary for the positional relationship on the straight line with respect to the inflection point C to be the same. For example, the projection surface may be a surface obtained by rotating the target surface of the control object around the inflection point C by the same amount as the target surface angle thereof. Further, a surface obtained through parallel translation of the target surface A along with the inflection point C may be used as the projection surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">(3) In the above embodiment, the work machine of the above (2) may further include a determination section <b>26</b> (control unit <b>9</b>) determining whether or not the inflection point C exists between the two projection points P<b>2</b> and Q<b>2</b> on the target surface of the control object or in the extension thereof. When the smaller of the distances from the first reference point P<b>1</b> and the second reference point Q<b>1</b> to the target surface of the control object is equal to or lower than the threshold value T<b>1</b>, and when the determination section <b>26</b> determines that the inflection point C exists between the two projection points P<b>2</b> and Q<b>2</b>, the operation control section <b>900</b> corrects the operation signal output from the operation device such that the reduction degree of the operational speed of the hydraulic actuator (e.g., the arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b</i>) constituting the control target of operation signal is set to the maximum value of the reduction degree set based on the smaller of the distances PC<b>2</b> and QC<b>2</b> in the above item (2) (the value when the distance is zero).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">In the case where the inflection point C exists between the two projection points P<b>2</b> and Q<b>2</b>, the existence of the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>at a position sufficiently close to the next target surface is to be predicted. In the present embodiment, in such a case, the deceleration degree based on the distances PC<b>2</b> and QC<b>2</b> is made maximum. This helps to prevent intrusion into the next target surface. While in the embodiment described above the deceleration degree is a “maximum value,” this should not be construed limitedly. It is only necessary for the hydraulic actuator to be decelerated further than the deceleration degree set based on the smaller of the distances PC<b>2</b> and QC<b>2</b>. It is also possible to use a value beyond the maximum value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">(4) Further, in the above embodiment, the work machine according to above (3) may further include an angle change amount computing section <b>27</b> (control unit <b>9</b>) calculating the angle change amount which is the absolute value of the difference between the target surface angle θ<b>1</b> of the target surface constituting the control object and the target surface angle θ<b>2</b> of the target surface constituting the next control object. In the case where the operation control section <b>900</b> reduces the operational speed of the hydraulic actuator (e.g., the arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b</i>) constituting the control target of the operation signal, the reduction degree is set to be the larger the larger the angle change amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">When the deceleration is thus effected in accordance with the angle change amount, it is possible to sufficiently decelerate the actuator even in the case where the angle made by the target surface angles is acute, making it possible to prevent intrusion into the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>of the next target surface.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">ADDITIONAL REMARK</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">In the case where the vertical component of the upper limit value La and the limiting value ‘a’ are compared with each other at the same position in the vicinity of the inflection point C, it is desirable to set the deceleration coefficient K such that the vertical component of the upper limit value La is smaller than the limiting value ‘a.’ For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows an example in which the deceleration coefficient K is set such that the vertical component of the upper limit value La is smaller than the limiting value ‘a’ when the distance is less than a distance R<b>1</b> in the vicinity of the inflection point C (the angle coefficient Ka−0 for the sake of simplification of the description). When the deceleration coefficient K is thus set, the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>is further decelerated than in the ordinary area limiting control in the vicinity of the inflection point C (the range less than the distance R<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), so that even in the case where there are a plurality of target surfaces, appropriate deceleration control is executed, and intrusion into the target surface of the work device can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In the embodiment described above, when the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>approaches the inflection point C, the arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b </i>is decelerated to thereby reduce the bucket speed. However, instead of/in addition to the arm cylinder <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, the boom cylinder <b>3</b> <i>a </i>and/or the bucket cylinder <b>3</b> <i>c </i>may be decelerated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">In the case described above, in order that the work device <b>1</b>A may move within the set area at the operation of the arm <b>1</b> <i>b</i>, the control unit <b>9</b> serves as the start point to output an operation signal designating expansion (forcible boom raising) to the boom cylinder <b>3</b> <i>a </i>to perform area limiting control. However, in the situation in which the operator serves as the start point to output an operation signal designating boom raising from the operation lever device <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, the area limiting control may be performed by correcting the operation signal by the control unit <b>9</b>. Further, while in the case described above area limiting control is effected by adding as appropriate boom raising by the control unit <b>9</b> at the time of arm operation by the operator operation, the area limiting control may be performed by adding as appropriate the damping/crowding of the bucket <b>1</b> <i>c </i>instead of/in addition to the boom raising. That is, in the area limiting control, there is the possibility of both of the following two controls being performed such that the work device <b>1</b>A may operate within the set area: a control in which the control unit <b>9</b> serves as the start point to output an operation signal to at least one of the flow control valves <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, <b>5</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>5</b> <i>c </i>of the three hydraulic cylinders <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>3</b> <i>c </i>performing the operation of the work device <b>1</b>A; and a control in which correction by the control unit <b>9</b> is effected on the operation signal output to at least one of the flow control valves <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, <b>5</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>5</b> <i>c </i>of the three hydraulic cylinders <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, with the operator serving as the start point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Further, the area limiting control may be executed solely at the time of arm crowding when the substantial excavating operation is executed.</div>
