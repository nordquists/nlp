<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">An image display apparatus is provided which is capable of suppressing generation of cracks to be caused by a load applied to a partition disposed between an anode panel and a cathode panel. The partition for retaining a predetermined distance between back and front substrates by using bonding material is constituted of a partition main body and an electric conducting layer coated on the outer peripheral surface of the partition main body. The partition main body has curved portions at the corners of upper and lower end portions, the curved portions contacting the back and front substrates. It is possible to prevent damages of an electrode to be caused by a mechanical load applied to cathode and anode panels having electrodes on opposing surfaces. </div>
