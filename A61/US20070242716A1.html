<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A single mode high power laser device such as a VCSEL is formed with two oxide apertures, one on each side of the active region or cavity. The sizes of the apertures and the distances from the apertures to the cavity center are chosen or optimum, near-Gaussian current density distribution. The high power of a VCSEL thus formed is improved still more by good heat removal by either formation of a via through the substrate and gold plating on top and bottom of the VCSEL (including the via) or by lifting the VCSEL structure from the substrate and locating it on a heat sink. </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002"> VCSEL, or Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser, is a semiconductor micro-laser diode that emits light in a cylindrical beam vertically from the surface of a fabricated wafer and offers significant advantages when compared to the edge-emitting lasers currently used in the majority of fiber optical communication systems. When compared with edge-emitters, VCSELs offer lower threshold currents, low-divergence circular output beams, higher direct modulation speed, longitudinal single mode emission, case of integration to form 2-D arrays and higher coupling efficiency into optical fiber. However, high fiber-coupling efficiencies are only reached at low optical powers, because with increasing output power higher order transverse modes are supported by the cavity. In general, the complex transverse modal behavior of VCSELs at high pump rates is a major drawback for many practical applications. The modal behavior, just like most of the other key properties of the VCSELs, depends strongly on the confinement mechanism. Despite many of their inherent advantages over their rivals, VCSELs still suffer from many inadequacies. Most prominent are “limited power” and lack of “modal purity.” These unresolved issues have compelled the VCSEL to enjoy only a 10% share of the whole semiconductor laser market. </div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004"> The distinction between the influence of different effects such as pump induced current spreading, spatial hole burning and thermal gradients inside the cavity on the carrier distribution have been discussed by Degen et al. [1]. These complex and partly counter-acting effects tend to produce high order transverse modes in the optical cavity. The pump-induced inhomogeneities predominantly govern the carrier distribution in the laser [1]. These inhomogeneities arise purely from the current flow through the confinement area and not from an interaction with optical fields in the cavity. This conclusion is supported by the results of theoretical simulations by Nakwaski [2]. His modeling results in distributions of the current density inside the carrier confinement region show distinct maxima at the borders of the VCSEL and a deep dip in the center. Our modeling results also show the same behavior. These distributions are in good agreement with the experimental results of Degen et al. [1] and they favor strongly the emission of high order modes, which is due to inhomogeneous spatial gain distribution. </div>
</li> <li> <div class="description-line" id="h-0005" num="0000"> Multi Mode Behavior Due to Spatial Hole Burning: </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005"> The tendency to high order mode emission is further enhanced by spatial hole burning which is due to interaction between the optical field and the carrier reservoir in the cavity. The influence of these effects on the carrier distribution and on the lasing near-field have been modeled in detail by Zhao et al. [3] and by Kakwaski et al. [4]. The influence of spatial hole burning is much smaller than the effect of current spreading but it further enhances the tendency to higher order mode emission [3] [4]. </div>
</li> <li> <div class="description-line" id="h-0006" num="0000"> Multi Mode Behavior Due to Strong Thermal Gradients Inside the Cavity: </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006"> A third effect that forces the laser to high order mode emission is the presence of strong thermal gradients in the cavity. These gradients have also been modeled by Nakwaski et al. [4] and temperature differences larger than 30K have been predicted between the center and the border region of the VCSEL. These differences originate from Joule-heating and heating by non-radiating recombination processes. Thus the temperature differences will be highest for injection currents larger than the thermal rollover point because the injection current is already high and non-radiating recombination is on the rise. As a consequence of this thermal gradient, carriers will be thermally excited and redistributed towards higher energies. This effect of spectral carrier redistribution is stronger in the hot center of the VCSEL and weaker at the cooler periphery. The strong redistribution of carriers in the center of the VCSEL obviously leads to a broad dip in the carrier distribution and eventually to a multi-mode spectrum. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007"> The above effects have been well explained and experimentally demonstrated by several authors [1], [3], [4]. The effect of inhomogeneous carrier distribution is seen as the predominant mechanism towards governing the modal behavior in the cavity. There are some additional second order effects like diffusion of carriers in the active region and carrier recombination. The influence of these effects is assumed minimal in comparison to the effect due to inhomogeneous pump profile or carrier distribution. </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0043]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0041" num="0043"> A schematic diagram of the location of a pair of apertures in accordance with the invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In a VCSEL construction <b>20</b>, at least two oxide apertures <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> with different sizes are located on each side of an active region <b>26</b> at varying distances from the active region in the DBRs or mirror stacks on each side of the active region. Current confinement and spreading in the cavity is controlled by the size and position of the oxide apertures. The current distribution strongly favors single mode operation if the size and distance of the apertures from the active region are optimally chosen. Since the mirror stacks are built up in pairs of mirrors as is known in DBR creation, distances of the oxide layers and oxide apertures from the active region are measured here and referred to here in “mirror pairs.”</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0044]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0042" num="0044"> Detailed 3D modeling was carried out using Femlab, a popular finite element tool, to see the effect of double oxide-aperture in profiling the spatial carrier distribution. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the theoretical modeling results for a conventional VCSEL design, where the oxide layer is at the first null of the E-field in the p-mirror stack, which is placed roughly one mirror pair away from the cavity or active region between mirror stacks. In the conventional VCSEL design, workers in the art tend to place the oxide layer as close as the first null of the E-field to favor index guiding by the oxide layer and enhance current confinement in the active area. At smaller aperture and smaller injection, optical wave guiding effect becomes dominant thereby supporting single mode. From <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> it is clearly seen that the current distribution is not in favor of single mode operation despite the help of index-guiding effect because the carrier distribution has distinct maxima on the periphery of the aperture area. Therefore this conventional structure design can only support single mode operation at smaller aperture at around ˜5 μm, resulting in a very small output power, 1-2 mW. </div>

In this particular design, the p-mirror oxide aperture (which is to say the oxide aperture on the p-mirror stack side of the active region) is six mirror pairs away from the cavity or active region and has a diameter of 5 μm and the n-mirror aperture (i.e. the oxide aperture on the n-mirror stack side of the active region) is two mirror pairs away from the cavity or active region and has a diameter of 15 μm. The curve <b>28</b> gives the current density at the cavity center.

However by moving the p-aperture farther away from the active region the spectral purity gets better as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0057]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0055" num="0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the LIV characteristics of a double aperture VCSEL whose p-aperture is at the seventh mirror pair in p-DBR and n-aperture at the first mirror pair in n-DBR. The threshold current is more than 12 mA and threshold voltage is more than 7 volts. The record peak power is more than 7 mW at 12V. The higher threshold and lower peak power is due to the fact that for this growth the doping was lower by three times due to some problems in the MBE. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the spectrum of the VCSEL which reports single mode operation at the peak power and over the range of 20 mA current injection. This set of experiments has shown that invention is capable of tailoring the gain of a laser by tailoring the spatial current injection profile and thereby controlling the modal behavior of a VCSEL has been proved. </div>
