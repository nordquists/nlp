<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a light transmitting conductive film. In particular, it relates to an electromagnetic wave shielding material which is capable of shielding electromagnetic wave generated from the front face of a display such as a cathodic ray tube (CRT), a plasma display panel (PDP), a liquid crystal display, an electroluminescence (EL) display or a field emission display (FED), a microwave oven, an electronic device, a printed line board and so on and has a light transmittance, and a method of producing the same. The invention further relates to a method of producing a display filter and a display filter obtained thereby and an electromagnetic wave shielding material to be used therein. More specifically speaking, it relates to a method of producing a display filter comprising an electromagnetic wave shielding material capable of blocking electromagnetic wave generated from a plasma display panel, a display filter obtained thereby and an electromagnetic wave shielding material to be used therein.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">With the recent increasing use of various electrical facilities and electronic devices, there arises a rapid increase in electromagnetic interference (EMI). It is pointed out that EMI not only causes mechanical errors and disturbances in electrical devices but also exerts adverse effects on the health of workers operating these devices. Thus, it has been required to control the electromagnetic intensity generated from electrical/electronic devices not to exceed a standard or regulation level.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">As a countermeasure against the above-described EMI, it is needed to shield electromagnetic wave, which can be self-evidently established by using the characteristics of a metal of not allowing electromagnetic transmission. Thus, there have been adopted, for example, a method of using a housing made of a metal or a highly conductive material, a method of inserting a metal plate between circuit baseboards and a method of coating a cable with a metal foil. However, a display of a CRT, a PDP or the like should be transparent, since an operator should recognize characters and so on indicated on the screen. However, the front face of a display frequently becomes opaque in each of the methods as cited above, which makes these methods unsuitable as an electromagnetic wave shielding method.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Compared with a CRT, etc., a PDP generates a particularly large amount of electromagnetic wave. Therefore, it is required that a PDP has stronger electromagnetic wave shielding properties. Electromagnetic wave shielding properties can be briefly expressed in surface resistivity. A light transmitting electromagnetic wave shielding material for CRT should have a surface resistivity of about 300 Ω/sq or less, while a light transmitting electromagnetic wave shielding material for PDP should have a surface resistivity of about 2.5 Ω/sq or less. Furthermore, a light transmitting electromagnetic wave shielding material for plasma TV for consumer use should have an extremely high conductivity, i.e., a surface resistivity of about 1.5 Ω/sq or less, preferably 0.1 Ω/sq or less.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Concerning transparency, a light transmitting electromagnetic wave shielding material for CRT should have a transparency of about 70% or more, while a light transmitting electromagnetic wave shielding material for PDP should have a still higher transparency of 80% or more.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">To overcome the problems as discussed above, there have been proposed various materials and methods for achieving both of favorable electromagnetic wave shielding properties and high transparency with the use of a metal mesh having apertures, as will be described herein below.</div>

However, this shielding material suffers from a problem that it has a broad mesh line width and, therefore, makes the screen dark when employed in shielding a display screen. As a result, characters indicated on the display becomes hardly visible.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">(2) Mesh Obtained by Electroless Plating Process</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">There has been proposed a method which comprises printing a lattice pattern by using an electroless plating catalyst and then conducting electroless plating (see, for example, JP-A-11-170420 (Patent Document 2) and JP-A-05-283889 (Patent Document 3)). In this case, however, the printed catalyst has a broad line width of about 60 μm, which makes it unsuitable for a display with a need for a relatively narrow line width and a precise pattern.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, there has been proposed a method which comprises coating a photoresist containing an electroless plating catalyst, exposing and developing the same to form an electroless plating catalyst pattern and then conducting electroless plating (see, for example, JP-A-11-170421 (Patent Document 4)). However, a conductive film has a visible light transmittance of 72% and, therefore, only an insufficient transparency can be obtained thereby. Moreover, this method suffers from a problem in the production cost, i.e., highly expensive palladium should be employed as the electroless plating catalyst for removing most of the exposed part after the exposure.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">(3) Mesh Obtained by Etching Process Using Photolithographic Technique</div>

Because of enabling fine processing, this method is advantageous in forming a mesh having a high aperture ratio (a high transmittance) and being capable of shielding even strong electromagnetic release. On the other hand, it suffers from a problem that the production process is troublesome and complicated and, therefore, costs high. Further, it is known that because of using the etching procedure, the lattice pattern has a problem that the intersecting points have broader line width than straight lines. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that this method suffers from the problem of moire that should be overcome.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">Displays have been widely used particularly for personal computers, monitors and so on. Also, there is a tendency toward thin and large-sized displays. As a large and thin display, a plasma display panel has attracted public attention. Due to the structure and operation mechanism thereof, however, plasma display panel suffers from serious leakage of electromagnetic wave and generates near infrared rays. According to Electrical Appliance and Material Safety Law, electromagnetic wave generation should be regulated not to exceed a standard level. Since near infrared rays affect peripheral devices and cause mechanical errors, rays within the near infrared region (800 to 1000 nm) should be cut to a level causing no problem in practice.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">To shield electromagnetic wave, it is required cover the display surface with a highly conductive substance. Such a highly conductive substance to be used in covering (i.e., an electromagnetic wave shielding material) should be transparent so as not to seriously damage the display indication. As one of electromagnetic wave shielding materials fulfilling these requirements, it has been a practice to use electromagnetic wave shielding films produced by forming a transparent multilayer film made of an oxide, a metal, etc. on a transparent base by, for example, sputtering. However, these electromagnetic wave shielding films are still insufficient in conductivity at present. Therefore, they are usable as an electromagnetic wave shielding material exclusively in the case with a need for only low electromagnetic wave shielding properties. As another electromagnetic wave shielding material, there have been employed conductive mesh films produced by forming a mesh-patterned metal layer on a base made of a polymer film. In this method, a high light transmittance can be established by forming the mesh pattern by using a microprocessing technique such as photolithography. Since the mesh pattern is formed with the use of a metal, moreover, a higher electromagnetic wave shielding ability can be established than in the case of using a transparent multilayer film.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">When electromagnetic wave is absorbed by a conductive substance, an electrical charge is generated on the conductive substance. The electrical charge thus generated induces the oscillation of electromagnetic wave again with the use of the conductive substance as an antenna. Unless the thus generated electrical charge is quickly made escape through an earthing wire, there arises a risk of the leakage of the electromagnetic wave. Thus, the conductive layer of the display filter should be electrically connected to the inside of the display body. A display filter having these functions is reported by, for example, JP-A-2002-323861 (Patent Document 10).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">In a conductive mesh film to be used in a display filter as described above, it is necessary to conduct patterning the metal layer of each single display filter by using a mask in a size fitting the indication part of the display. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of conductive mesh film having been employed hitherto. In bonding a conductive mesh film as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to a glass plate, the mesh-patterned part and the non-mesh part should be positioned in accordance with the specification of the display. Thus, it takes a longer time for bonding and there arises an increase in positioning loss, which results in a lowering in the production efficiency. That is to say, a conductive mesh film of this type suffers from a serious problem in production cost. In the conductive mesh film as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, furthermore, the mesh part serving as the indication part and the non-mesh part serving as the non-indication part for connecting to the display body are both fixed in size. As a result, there arises another problem that such a conductive mesh film of a certain specification can be hardly applicable to various filters.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">It is known that the shielding ability of an EMI shielding material is improved by earthing the conductive part. A mesh suffering from a line breakage frequently has an area that cannot be earthed. Therefore, an area to be used as an EMI shielding material should be prevented from line breakage. According to the existing mesh-forming methods excluding the fiber system as discussed above, on the other hand, it is only possible to produce a mesh being free from line breakage in a certain area. This is because, when a mesh pattern is formed by the electroless copper plating process, the plating catalyst nucleus is patterned by the printing system as in screen printing and, therefore, the mesh undergoes breakage in a screen or depressed surface unit. In the photolithography, a mesh undergoes breakage in an exposure mask unit.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">Although JP-A-2004-207001 discloses using an image setter of the internal drum system in exposure, a mesh undergoes breakage in a length shorter than the inner periphery of the drum in this internal drum system.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">To overcome these problems, use is made of, for example, in producing a conductive mesh film for PDP, a method comprising positioning a mesh breakage-free part of a shielding material with a PDP module or an optical filter material which is called a front face panel or a window material and has a glass or the like as a substrate. In this method, there arises a greater loss in the shielding material. Even in the case of using a rolled shielding material in a long sheet type for elevating the productivity, it takes a longer time for positioning and thus the production speed cannot be sufficiently elevated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention has been made under these circumstances. Namely, a first object of the invention is to provide a method whereby a light transmitting conductive film, which has both of favorable EMI shielding properties and a high transparency at the same time and is free from moire, and whereby a thin line pattern can be easily formed inexpensively on a large scale. Another object of the invention is to provide an electromagnetic wave shielding material having a continuous mesh pattern formed thereon so as to reduce a loss in the shielding material and elevate the productivity.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0136]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0124" num="0136">The term “to” inserted between numerical values herein has a meaning including the numerical values presented immediately before and after the same respectively as the lower and upper limits.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0137]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0125" num="0137">Examples of the method whereby the continuous mesh pattern is formed include printing, ink jetting, heat transfer and so on. In the case of printing, a cylindrical printing plate having a seamless continuous pattern formed thereon should be used either in the gravure method, the flexographic method or any other method. It is necessary that thin lines of several to ten-odd μm are arranged at intervals of several hundred μm and each line is connected to its own end after running around the plate. However, it is very difficult to construct such a printing plate and the obtained plate having these thin lines has only insufficient print tolerance.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0138]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0126" num="0138">On the other hand, only an insufficient resolution can be achieved by the ink jetting method or the heat transfer method and, therefore, continuous wires of several μm can be hardly drawn thereby. As the results of intensive studies, the present inventors have found out that thin line drawing with a laser beam is most suitably usable in forming a continuous mesh pattern. In the case of repeatedly drawing precise thin lines over a length of from several hundred to several thousand meters and a width of several meters, however, there arises a problem that the width and pitch would vary due to the vibration during transport or a slight change in the transport speed. To overcome this problem, the inventors conducted further studies. As a result, they have found out that it can be particularly effectively solved by providing a curved exposure stage (more particularly speaking, an exposure roller), which has an even surface in the opposite side across the support of a part wherein a laser beam focuses images on the exposure face, in parallel to the main scanning direction of the laser beam.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0139]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0127" num="0139">It is preferable that the exposure is made of a metal.

Thus, light scattering on the surface causes a decrease in the transparency. This problem can be overcome by smoothly coating the face having the peaks and valleys with a resin having a refractive index closely similar to the transparent plastic substrate to thereby minimize irregular reflection and exhibit transparency. Because of having an extremely small line width, the geometric pattern drawn with the conductive material on the transparent plastic substrate is invisible to the naked eye. Moreover, the pitch is sufficiently large, which contributes to the exhibition of the apparent transparency.

Accordingly, there arise various problems such as foaming on the adhesion face or occurrence of peeling, and, in its turn, deformation in an image or a color change from the inherent color to be displayed. The foaming and peeling problems are both caused by the peeling of the sticky material from the plastic film or the glass plate. This phenomenon possibly occurs in both of the plastic film side and the glass plate side. Namely, it occurs in the side having the smaller adhesion force. Therefore, the sticky material should have large adhesion force to both of the plastic film and the glass plate at a high temperature. More specifically speaking, it is preferable that the sticky material has an adhesion force to both of the plastic film and the glass plate of 10 g/cm or more at 80° C., more preferably 30 g/cm or more. However, it is sometimes undesirable to use a sticky material having an adhesion force exceeding 2000 g/cm, since the bonding procedure becomes troublesome in this case, though such a sticky material can be used without any problem in the case being free from the troubles as described above.

In the case of forming the conductive pattern P on the first blackening layer <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, the second blackening layer <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, etc. by the metal plating method in the invention, a conductive blackening layer that can be processed by metal plating should be employed. In the case of blackening the layer by the etching method or the electrodeposition method at the final stage, on the other hand, it is possible to form a nonconductive blackening layer by using a nonconductive material. The conductive blackening layer can be formed generally by using a conductive metal compound such as a compound of nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn) or copper (Cu). The nonconductive blackening layer can be formed by using, for example, a pasty black polymer material such as a black ink, a black chemical material such as a black compound prepared by chemically treating a metal plated surface or an electrodepositable ionic polymer material such as an electrodepositable coating material. In the present invention, a blackening layer can be formed by using such a blackening layer-formation method and appropriately selecting a method suitable for the production process of producing the electromagnetic wave shielding plate.</div>

When a part having a black color amounts to 20% or more of the total surface area of the conductive patterned face, the contrast can be elevated.

As the black plating bath as described above, it is possible in the invention to use a black plating bath containing nickel sulfate as the main component. Also, use can be made of a commercially available black plating bath. Specific examples usable herein include a black plating bath (trade name: NOBUROI SNC, Sn—Ni alloy base) manufactured by Shimizu Co., Ltd., a black plating bath (trade name: NIKKA BLACK, Sn—Ni alloy base) manufactured by NIHON KAGAKU SANGYO Co., Ltd.), a black plating bath (trade name: EBONY CHROM 85 SERIES, Cr-base) manufactured by KINZOKU KAGAKU KOGYO K.K. and so on. As the black plating bath, use can be made of various black plating baths including Zn-based and Cu-based ones. In the invention, similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in the above-described document, the electrodepositable substrate <b>14</b> having the second blackening layer <b>3</b> <i>b </i>formed thereon is dipped in a metal electrolyte for shielding electromagnetic wave. Thus, a mesh-like conductive pattern <b>4</b> having a desired thickness is laminated and electrodeposited on the part corresponding to the second blackening layer <b>3</b> <i>b </i>of the electrodepositable substrate <b>14</b>. As the material for forming the mesh-like conductive pattern <b>4</b>, such a metal as cited above as highly conductive materials can be used as the most advantageous material. In the case of thus forming the electrodeposited metal layer, use can be made of a metal electrolyte commonly employed in the art. Since there are many kinds of inexpensive metal electrolytes, this case is advantageous in that a metal electrolyte appropriate for the purpose can be freely selected. As an inexpensive and highly conductive metal, Cu has been frequently used in general. Although Cu is usable in the invention too, it is needless to say that another metal is also usable so long as being appropriate for the purpose and useful. In the invention, it is not always necessary that the mesh-like conductive pattern <b>4</b> consists of a single metal layer alone. Since a mesh-like conductive pattern P made of Cu as described above is relatively soft and liable to suffer from scuff marks, it is also possible to form a double-layered metal electrodeposited layer using a hard metal commonly employed such as Ni or Cr, though such a case is not shown in the drawing. As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows, after forming the mesh-like conductive pattern <b>4</b> in the invention, the surface of the mesh-like conductive pattern <b>4</b> is chemically treated. In the case where the conductive pattern P is made of copper (Cu), for example, the mesh-like conductive pattern <b>4</b> is surface-treated with a hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) solution to blacken the copper surface as copper sulfide (CuS). Thus, the surface of the metal electrodeposited layer constituting the mesh-like conductive pattern <b>4</b> is blackened to form the first blackening layer <b>3</b> <i>a</i>. Subsequently, the above-described second blackening layer <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, the conductive pattern layer <b>4</b> and the first blackening layer <b>3</b> <i>a </i>are successively laminated in this order to give the mesh-like conductive pattern P. In the invention, the blackening treatment of the copper surface as described above can be easily conducted by using a sulfide compound or a sulfide-based compound. Alternatively, there are many kinds of commercially available treating agents such as COPPER BLACK CuO, COPPER BLACK CuS, selenium-based COPPER BLACK No. 65, etc. (trade names; manufactured by ISOLATE KAGAKU KENKYUSHO) and EBONOL C SPECIAL (trade name; manufactured by MELTEX Inc.) which can be also employed in the invention.</div>

Thus, it is necessary to regulate the transmittance in the wavelength region of from 800 to 1000 nm to 25% or less, preferably 15% or less and more preferably 10% or less. An optical filter to be used in a plasma display should have a transmission color of neutral gray or blue gray. This is because it is necessary to maintain or improve the light emission characteristics and contrast of the plasma display and a white color with a somewhat higher color temperature than the standard white color is preferred in some cases. It is said that a color plasma display has only insufficient color reproducibility. It is therefore preferable to selectively lower unnecessary light emission from a fluorescent body or discharged gas causing the above problem. In particular, a light emission spectrum in red display shows several emission peaks in a wavelength range of about 580 nm to about 700 nm and there arises a problem that red light emission becomes close to an orange color with a low color purity due to a relatively strong emission peak in the short wavelength side. These optical characteristics can be controlled by using a dye. Namely, near infrared rays can be cut by using a near infrared absorber while unnecessary light emission can be reduced by using a dye capable of selectively absorbing the unnecessary light emission, thereby achieving desired optical characteristics.

As the transparent sticky material, use can be preferably made of a pressure-sensitive adhesive in the form of a sheet. It is also possible to use a liquid type one to be coated. Moreover, use can be made of a liquid type adhesive which hardens by allowing to stand at room temperature or heating. It is favorable that the face of the functional film (E) on which the sticky material layer is to be formed is preliminarily subjected to an adhesion-facilitating treatment such as coating with an adhesion accelerator or corona discharge so as to improve the wetting characteristics.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0387]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0377" num="0387">Since a plasma display generates strong near infrared rays, these near infrared rays should be reduced to such an extent as causing no problem in practice. Thus, a display filter to be used in a plasma display should have a transmission color of neutral gray or blue gray. This is because it is necessary to maintain or improve the light emission characteristics and contrast of the plasma display and a white color with a somewhat higher color temperature than the standard white color is preferred in some cases. It is said that a color plasma display has only insufficient color reproducibility. It is therefore preferable to selectively lower unnecessary light emission from a fluorescent body or discharged gas causing the above problem by the display filter.</div>

Namely, near infrared rays can be cut by using a near infrared absorber while unnecessary light emission can be reduced by using a dye capable of selectively absorbing the unnecessary light emission, thereby achieving desired optical characteristics. It is also possible to achieve a favorable color tone of the display filter by using a dye having an appropriate absorption within the visible region.</div>

When a transparent indication part is needed as in a display, a window-shaped electromagnetic wave shielding filter having a light transmitting conductive layer, such as the display filter of the invention, is provided. Electromagnetic wave is absorbed by the conductive layer and then induces electrical charge. The charge thus generated oscillates electromagnetic wave by using the conductive substance as an antenna. Unless the charge is quickly cut off by earthing, therefore, there arises a risk of the leakage of the electromagnetic wave. Therefore, the display filter should be in electrical contact with the earthing part of the display body. In the case of forming another layer on the conductive layer (B) of the electromagnetic wave shielding material, the conductive layer (B) is not entirely coated with the other layer but a conductive connection part allowing conduction to the outside should be left. The constitution wherein the functional film (E) is bonded to the conductive layer (B) via the transparent sticky material layer (D<b>2</b>) as described above corresponds to this case. Although the conductive connection part is not particularly restricted in shape, it is necessary that there is no gap allowing the leakage of electromagnetic wave between the display filter and the display body. It is therefore adequate that the conductive connection part is continuously formed in the periphery of the conductive layer (B). Namely, it is preferable that a frame-like conductive connection part is provided excluding the center serving as the indication part of the display. However, the invention is not particularly restricted thereto and a discontinuous conductive connection part may be employed so long as the leakage of the electromagnetic wave can be prevented. For example, use can be made of the end sections of two facing sides of the display filter as the conductive connection parts.</div>

To print and coat such a conductive coating material or paste, use can be made of a publicly known method. It is preferable that the coating or paste to be used has a black color. In the case where the electrode thus formed has a black color, it is usable as a substitute for a black frame print, which has been employed for distinguishing an indication part from a non-indication part in the display, and thus the filter can be produced at a lowered cost.</div>

Then, the individual light beams having been modulated in the exposure state in the individual pixel portions pass through apertures and the beam spots are shaped by partly shielding the light beams followed by the irradiation onto the exposure face. During this exposure processing, the exposure ratios of the individual beam spots are changed from aperture to aperture having different opening areas and opening shapes. Thus, the exposure ratios can be changed among the beam spots having passed the apertures having different opening areas and opening shapes so that the exposure doses of the individual beam spots, which have different areas and shapes when focused on the exposure face in multiple or overlap exposure, can be altered to achieve the same functions and effects as changing the opening areas and the opening shapes of the apertures. As a result, it becomes possible to conduct the exposure processing (exposure recording) approximately in accordance with appropriate spot sizes (beam spot areas) and spot shapes of the beam spots on the exposure face which vary depending on various conditions such as the shape and diagram of the exposure pattern and the properties of the photosensitive material. Thus, the shape and diagram of the exposure pattern can be appropriately formed by using this exposure head. It is also possible to change the opening areas and opening shapes of the apertures without replacing the aperture array and it is unnecessary to transport the aperture array, etc. Owing to these characteristics, the constitution can be simplified and the beam spot shapes can be immediately changed so as to achieve appropriate beam spot shapes which vary depending on various conditions such as the shape and diagram of the exposure pattern and the properties of the photosensitive material. Since the complicated and troublesome operation for taking off the aperture array and replacing by another one can be omitted, the working efficiency can be improved.</div>
