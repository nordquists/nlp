<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Aspects of the present disclosure involve a high dynamic range scenographic image and video projection system and method. One particular aspect of the present disclosure involves the projection of an image of an object onto the object in such a manner than projected image elements are positioned substantially on the actual image of the object. The object may be two or three dimensional. The projection enhances or otherwise alters the hue, contrast, brightness, saturation, luminance, and/or other visible features of the object. Hence, through deployment of the techniques set forth herein, visual as well as non-visible (e.g., infrared, etc.) features of an object may be altered. Additionally, visual and not-visual features may be added to the object as well as a collection of objects.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a colored medallion with three characters, a sky, two ships and some other features. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the colored medallion of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> with an image of the medallion projected on the medallion. As can be seen, at least contrast, hue and saturation are altered in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> compared to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The medallion is painted in opaque scenic paint style. However, different painting styles, such as transparent water color, oil, etc. colors (including grey scale) may be used in various possible implementations. The medallion was then digitally photographed under outdoor daylight, although the image of the object or objects may be taken under different lighting conditions, whether artificial or natural, with attendant image impact due to the lighting. The image of the medallion was then projected on the actual medallion in such a way to minimize distortion of the image, and to align the image of the medallion with corresponding features of the medallion. Hence, for example, image features of the foreground character, such as the characters eyes, hands, shoes, etc., are aligned in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, with the actual eyes, hands, shoes, etc.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In any particular implementation, the object, whether two dimensional or three dimensional, will include a surface with some form of an optical pattern. The optical pattern may be from pigmentation of some form, such as paint, ink, and the like. A projector is arranged to project patterned light toward the surface of the object such that the projected patterned light is aligned with the optical pattern on the surface. In one particular example, the alignment need not be precise to have the high dynamic effect. For example, with a 1024×768 projector resolution, a misalignment of 4-5 pixels or less is not perceivable and has the high dynamic effect. Projector focus can be counterbalanced with image quality to mitigate the visual effect of blurriness caused by having misalignments that are visible. The patterned light projection affects at least one attribute of light reflected from the surface.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">It is also possible to project the image of a colored object, onto the same object, but with the object having different color features than the colored object. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a split image of the medallion, with a color image projected on a primer grey medallion (right half), compared to the color image projected on the colored medallion (left half). With such a relatively neutral color, such as grey compared to a range of color, various visual effects may be achieved. Moreover, it is also possible to digitally image a grey scale object, and color enhance the image of the object for projection of the color enhanced image onto the object. For example, the image may be colored with blue hues to provide an icy visual effect, the image may be colored with yellow hues to provide a warmer visual effect, when the respective images are projected on the grey scale medallion or other object. Additionally, the image may be colored with other features to enhance or emphasize features, and with respect to video projection, the image may move to provide different effects. For example, the foreground characters eyes may be made to move by projecting an image of the eye and altering the video projection such that the eye moves, animating the medallion figure to some degree.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The coloring of the object, the pigments used to create the coloring and other features of the object, will reflect image projections differently, attenuating different portions of the visual spectrum, etc. Hence, any implementation will be affected depending on the coloring of the object, the lighting conditions under which the image of the object is taken, as well as ambient lighting conditions when the image is projected on the object. Additionally, the light source for the images will alter the appearance of the object when the image is projected on it. For example, digitally photographing the medallion under different light sources affects the reprojected image by shifting the color to favor the spectral content of the projector light source and the spectral content of the photography light source.</div>

The method of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be practiced by various possible system implementations, including a high dynamic range scenographic projection system illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a video media server or other computing system capable of storing, such as with some form of memory coupled with the server, and delivering an image, whether video image or a still image. The video media server is coupled with one more image projectors (projector (<b>0</b>) projector (n)) arranged to project patterned light or video images on an object or scene in a field of view of the projector. The image projectors may be of various possible types, including a Panasonic 7700 series, 7000 lumen, 3 chip DLP, as shown immediately below: 
</div>
</li> <li> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0000">Smaller projectors of the type that may be used include Panasonic 5600 series 5000 lumen, single chip DLP. 

<br/>
The field of view of the projector is the area of the scene or image that the projector illuminates with a projected patterned image. The field of view may be altered with zoom techniques, whether optical or digital, as well as other projection techniques. Further, the projectors may have a specified resolution. For example, a projector may have a resolution of 1024 (pixel width)×768 (pixel height); however, other contrast and resolution rations may be used. The projector or projector have a projector lens, not shown. To obtain a scene image for projection on the scene, a camera which may be digital, or other form of image collector, is coaxially aligned with the projector to image the scene with a similar field of views of the projector.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0008">Referencing the system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the method of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is now described. Beside referencing the system of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the method of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is also discussed with reference to various other figures to illustrate opposition. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a digital photograph of set of two and three dimensional objects employing one particular example of a scenographic projection system with eight projectors providing blended overlapping images of objects with the field of view of a given projector projected on various objects within the field of view of a given projector. The approximate locations of the projectors and their orientation relative to the set are shown as the rectangles labeled P<b>1</b>-P<b>8</b>. Each rectangle also includes a dashed line, illustrating the approximate axis of the projector lens. The photographic image off the set shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes two and three dimensional objects, including a foreground three dimensional tree, a three dimensional bridge over a painted stream (two dimensional) with rocks and a shoreline along the stream, a cottage and a two dimensional tree next to the cottage.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0009">The method of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> begins with the operation of obtaining an image of an object or objects from a camera coaxially aligned with a projector arranged to project patterned light on the object (operation <b>300</b>). Obtaining such an image may first involve positioning the camera coaxially with the projector. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6H</figref> illustrate the illumination of portions of the set from the eight projectors (P<b>1</b>-P<b>8</b>). The illuminations, besides illustrating the area and set objects within the field of view of any given projector, are also used in the process as described below to register the digital image of the portion of the set in the field of view with the image that will be projected on the portion of the set.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0010"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates the illumination of a first portion of the set, including a front and left side portion of the foreground tree, from the first projector (P<b>1</b>). The illuminated portion of the set illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> corresponds with the field of view for the first projector. The field of view from the various projectors is generally rectangular. In the example of FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>A-<b>61</b>, the projectors are arranged to project on the set such that features of the set are covered by the field of view of at least one projector, viewing the set from the front as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The projectors in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6H</figref> are placed at various different orientations (angle with respect to ground and other projectors) and are arranged at different heights and relative distances between projectors. It can be seen from the angle of light shown on the foreground tree that the first projector (P<b>1</b>) is positioned above and to the left of the illumination area such that the projection is at an angle relative to the floor of the set.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0011">Any given implementation can be different. For example, the orientation of the projector(s), the arrangement of projector(s), and the number of projector(s) may depend or otherwise be arranged depending on size of the performance space and the perspective of an audience viewing the set or object. For example, with respect to the set illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is possible that the set would be viewed by an audience in a theater, an amusement park ride, or the like, where the audience, which may be one or more people, is not able to view the set from all possible orientations. For example, audience members might be prohibited from viewing the set of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> from the back, and only be allowed to view the set from the front (the front of the set is the perspective shown in the photograph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Hence, the projectors may be arranged to pattern illuminate various features of the set that would be viewable by audience members, whereas features of the set not viewable by the audience need not be illuminated by a projector.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0012"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates the illumination of a second portion of the set, including a rear portion of the foreground tree, from the second projector (P<b>2</b>). The illuminated portion of the set illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> corresponds with the field of view for the second projector. The field of view of the second projector is rearward of the first field of view, and the portions of the two fields of view overlap (e.g., the rear edge of the first field of view overlaps the front edge of the second field of view). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> illustrates the illumination of a third portion of the set, including a portion of the stream in the front right corner area of the set, from the third projector (P<b>3</b>). The illuminated portion of the set illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> corresponds with the field of view for the third projector. The second and third projectors are generally perpendicular to the floor of the set.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0013"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6D-6F</figref> illustrate the illumination from a fourth (P<b>4</b>), fifth (P<b>5</b>) and sixth (P<b>6</b>) projector, respectively. The fifth projector is positioned directly above the front center set (substantially perpendicular to the floor). The fourth and sixth projectors both illuminate portions of the cottage from the right side of the set. It can be seen that the fourth projector illuminates the right side of the roof of the cottage and a portion of the bridge, whereas the sixth camera illuminates the front of the cottage and an area to the left of the cottage along with some area in front of the cottage. The field of view of the fourth camera overlaps with the field of view of the sixth camera.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0014"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6G and 6H</figref> illustrate the illumination from a seventh and an eighth projector, respectively. The projectors are positioned forwardly of the set, and have larger fields of view compared with the other projectors, as shown by the larger relative size of the illumination area of the seventh and eighth projectors compared to the illumination areas of the first through sixth projectors. To achieve a larger field of view, the seventh and eighth projectors are placed at a greater relative distance from the set and object features within the field of view as compared to the first through sixth projectors.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0015">Finally, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6I</figref> illustrates the set illuminated by all of the projectors. It can be seen that various illuminations areas overlap, and that most of the features of the set are illuminated by at least one projector, and many features are illuminated by more than one projector. There are some areas that are not illuminated, e.g., there is a small shadow under the right front side roof line of the cottage.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0016">To obtain an image of an object for purpose of high dynamic scenographic projection, the illumination areas of each projector may be marked to allow the camera field of view to be aligned and sized with the projector field of view. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the illumination area of the sixth projector (P<b>6</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>) viewed from the orientation of the projector. In this example, a feature of the set at the corners of the illumination area is marked. For example, if the lower left corner of the illumination area, a marker (corner marker <b>3</b>) is placed on a portion of the bridge and in the upper right corner a marker (corner marker <b>2</b>) is placed on the roof of the cottage. Various possible markers may be used, including tape (used in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), reflectors, infrared emitters, and so forth. Marking may be eliminated in the event some other method, whether automated or manual, is employed to generate an image of the field of view for the projector.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0017">Once the field of view of the projector is identified, the digital image may be taken. In one particular method, a digital camera is positioned in coaxial alignment with the projector. The camera is coaxially aligned to minimize distortion and keystone of the image relative to the projector field of view. The camera is positioned such that the image taken from the camera can project on the same field of view of the projector. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an image from a digital camera coaxially aligned with the sixth projector. It can be seen by the tape corner markers (<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) of the projector field of view that the field of view of the digital camera is slightly larger than projector field of view. Hence, an image of the scene within the field of view of the projector is obtained (operation <b>300</b>).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0018">Next, the image may be manipulated so that the image size substantially matches the projector field of view (operation <b>310</b>). In this way, the image projected from the camera will fall within the field of view of the projector, and projected image features will fall on the actual image features. Hence, the projected pattern will substantially align with the object surface patterns. In one example, the raw image is loaded in an image editing program, such as Adobe Photoshop™ and the image is cropped to the corner markers. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the raw image of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> being cropped at the corner markers of the field of view of the sixth projector.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0019">Due to slight coaxial misalignment between the camera center line and the projector center line, it can be seen that the image cannot be precisely cropped at the edges of the field of view of the projector. Note, the zoom lens of the camera typically has a very different ratio than the projection lens, thus having different optical performance characteristics. For example, the upper left side corner marker (<b>1</b>) is slightly lower than the upper left corner between the crop lines, whereas the lower right side corner marker (<b>4</b>) is slightly higher than the lower right corner between the lower second right crop lines, whereas as the lower left and upper right corner markers (<b>1</b>) and (<b>3</b>) are positioned at the corners created by the crop lines. When there is such a coaxial misalignment, and the cropped image does fit within the field of view of the projector, the image may be rotated, skewed, or otherwise adjusted so that the corner markers are positioned at the associated corners of the crop lines (operation <b>320</b>), as shown for example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it can be seen that the image has been rotated and slightly skewed so that upper left corner marker (<b>1</b>) is positioned at the upper left intersection (corner) between the upper and left side crop lines and the lower corner marker (<b>4</b>) is positioned at the lower right intersection (corner) between the lower and right side crop lines.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0020">After the image is cropped, rotated and skewed (should any or all of those operation be undertaken), the image may further be scaled to match the resolution of the projector (operation <b>330</b>). For example, the sixth projector has a resolution of 1024×724, and the image of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is the image of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> (after crop, rotation and skew) scaled to 1024×724. The prepared image is then loaded in the video server (operation <b>350</b>) and projected on the set through the matching projector.(operation <b>360</b>). In the case of a system with more than one projector, the process of image preparation (operations <b>310</b>-<b>330</b>) may be performed for each projector.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0021">The prepared image may be saved as a template for the associated projector, after which further image processing may be performed to create various possible visual and non-visible effects (operation <b>340</b>). In one example, the prepared image is saved as a raw image file, with no compression, to facilitate subsequent image alteration operations that might be complicated due to compression techniques and the resultant image alterations from such compression techniques.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0022">As an alternative approach to the operations set out above, some operations may be performed using a tool such as Adobe Aftereffects™. The Aftereffects computer can be directly connected to the projector and the output scaled and adjusted in real-time.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0023">A first type of image alteration that may be performed is color correction. The color corrected image or the raw prepared image may be projected on a given object. Various issues may prompt color correction of the raw image, such as spectral shifts caused by the illumination light source(s) for the original image, color shifts between projectors The original paint coating may not represent the original design intent and thus can be color corrected at this phase. For example, conventional metal halide projectors may not have consistent color characteristics with different projectors, even when being the same make, model, and age. Such color differences may be caused by lamp life, manufacturing inconsistencies, etc. These color differences may cause slight spectral shifts in the projected images from each projector. Hence, the image projection from different cameras might be noticeable to a viewer without color correction. For example, if projections from projectors with different color characteristics are projected on a scene side-by-side, overlapping boundaries of the two projected images would be viewed as a color shift between the two projected images. Color correction may results in a color corrected image in the form layer on the raw image (after cropping, skewing, and scaling). In one example, color correction, blended images (discussed below) and other base or raw image alterations are created as independent layers in Photoshop™ so they can be edited and adjusted as required without affecting the base image template. Color corrected images would likely be obtained for each projector.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0024">After the color balance of all projected templates is complete, it is also possible to blend the image projections that overlap. In one example, the process may be manual, and may thus involve a digital artist blending the multiple overlaps of all of the projectors using a image editing program. Blending may also be automated. In the manual process, the blends are created in an iterative process, working back and forth between adjacent projectors until a seamless performance environment is obtained. Blending may thus result in a blended image in the form of layer on the color corrected image. Blended images would also likely be obtained for each projector.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0025">In a sophisticated multi-projector three dimensional environment, like shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when all of the media templates are aligned, color corrected and blended, additional production techniques may be employed to enhance the appearance of the projected environment. For example, theatrical lighting techniques may be applied to create another layer. This process may be manual or automated. In a manual process, a theatrical lighting designer may generate images of a “lighting” process that would normally occur during a traditional production. Lighting may involve shading and coloring the environment. However, unlike putting gel in a theatrical fixture, lighting may be applied at a pixel level with respect to each patterned image projection (for each projector) as well as between (in combination) image projectors. The lighting designer may work directly with a media designer to shade and color the environment. Using digital tools, such as Adobe Photoshop™ and Adobe Aftereffects™, the designers can assign shadows and patterns digitally. This allows the designer to create a sense of time, composition and space at a level never before available to a lighting designer. Working at a pixel level, the designer can adjust color, contrast, hue and shadow. In conventional theatrical lighting, the lighting designer must select colored gels for the fixtures so that the colors compliment the scenic paint. These gels, “tint” all of the scenic paint and although beautiful lighting can be created, it has limited range in terms flexibility. Additionally, these “tinted” sources limit the contrast and saturation of different parts of the visible spectrum as they hit all surfaces at once. Shadows are limited to static “Gobos” or patterns installed in the light fixtures. At best, these metal or glass patterns can be rotated to simulate motion.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0026">Besides reprojecting a pattern image in precise registration on an object surface corresponding to the pattern image, the pattern image may further be manipulated to perform numerous possible visual affects by altering the pattern image. With a video pattern image, shadows may be automated. For example, referencing <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is possible to generate animated shadows of the branches of the trees, and move the animated shadows to simulate a windy day. Lighting may be added to the scene, and each pattern image may be altered to flash to a brighter hue when the lighting strikes, and similarly shadows may flash in the proper positions. It is possible to manipulate the perceived direction of light in a scene, whether from a perceived sun, street lamps, and the perceived direction may change, such as an affect of car headlights passing by.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0029" num="0027">It is also possible to project the digital image in such a way that will cancel the reflected color of the object. For example, by inverting the digital image hue, such as with Adobe Photoshop™ the projected pattern cancels the values of the object pattern. Such a technique would allow the visual affect of causing an object in full color to appear to turn black and white when the inverted image is projected in alignment on the object. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a photograph of the scene of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> with the eight projectors of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-GH</figref> projecting an inverted pattern image on the set, causing the set to appear black and white.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0030" num="0028">Special effects may be applied over the entire set using conventional efx software such as Adobe Aftereffects™. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, the set was made to appear to be slowly submerged in water as it rose upward across space. In fact, moving video effects can be applied to any part of the environment. In the case of the creek shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, fore example, moving water may be projected from the projectors with a field of view covering the stream and seamlessly blended. The water will exhibit depth, turbulence and motion, the water may appear to “swirl” around the physically sculpted rocks that are shown in the stream bed.</div>

The colors represent the lighting designers creative input on how to possibly light the tree. The digital artist airbrushed the tree to show the cool side (left) and the warm side (right() per the lighting designers direction with the intent that the sun would be from the right. This is an example of the transition of conventional theatrical lighting to the digital world. Basically, moving from light fixtures with colored gels that illuminate the entire set to a digital video version that illuminates exactly where the designer needs light, down to a pixel level.</div>

The horizontal axis of each graph is wavelength measure in nanometers, and the vertical axis of each graph is watts per meter square. The data is for a Macbeth color chart with known color samples as shown below.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0033]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0033">Red, green, blue, white and black were sampled. A photometer was used to measure each color square under pure white light from a projector. The color chart was then digitally photographed under the same light, and saved as raw uncompressed files. The resulting image files were color balanced to the lightest grey. The resulting files were reprojected on the original Macbeth chart and resampled with the photometer. The charts generally show saturation/chromo levels. The scale of each chart is from 350 nM to 1100 nM in even increments over the range.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0036" num="0034">In the legends, the term “blue/RP” indicates that the graph shows the image re-projected on the Macbeth chat. With blue, the images were shot under blue light from the projector. The term “Blue/w” indicates that the sample was shot under white light from the projector. By reprojecting the painted color of a typical scenic surface, back upon itself, the visual saturation and contrast is enhanced. As the dynamic range of the lighting (projection) increases, the scenery/set becomes more vivid and accurate in it's color reproduction. In the case of the described cottage and forest, the visual representation dramatically reproduces the color depth and vibrancy of an animated feature film, extending well beyond the range and ability of conventional theatrical lighting.</div>

For example, the fabric could be glued to the surface of an object, with the undercoating of the object being black. The fabric may be digitally printed with a red-green-blue pattern as shown below, as one possible example.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0036]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0036">The color range of each component would be carefully matched to the RGB components of the digital image to be projected on the set. Colors falling between the narrow RGB bandpasses may be represented in much lower reflectance for those individual colors. The digital image projection may exhibit similar high dynamic range and contrast as examples described above and further allow for sweeping environmental changes, i.e., fire to ice, which may not be as visually impactful when the object surface is painted or grey scale as discussed above. From a distance, objects with such a tessellated RGB scrim appear dark grey or black when not illuminated with complimentary light. This allows for “black out” capabilities during specific moments of a production.</div>
