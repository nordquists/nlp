<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a joining member which joins plural wooden pieces, and a joining structure which is formed by such a joining member.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Applications No. 2005-229842, filed Aug. 8, 2005; and No. 2005-261212, filed Sep. 8, 2005, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Casings that cover electronic equipments such as cameras and portable telephones are mostly made of synthetic resin or metal. Such casings are formed from plural parts which are joined with each other by screws, caulking, or the like.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, wood comes to attract attention as a material for jackets of electronic equipments. With a wide variety of grain patterns of wooden materials as being natural materials, wood products made of wood exhibit individual features depending on positions of the raw wood from which the particular wood products are cut out. Such individual features of each wood product give it a unique quality. In addition, surface flaws and discolorations caused by a long-term use create unique textures which tend to evoke warm and familiar feeling in the user. Thus, the wooden material attracts attention as a material for products of uniqueness and taste which cannot be found in products made of synthetic resin or light metals. Techniques for processing wooden materials are also developing dramatically.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one conventionally known technique for processing wooden materials: a wooden board is softened with water absorption and compressed; the compressed wooden board is cut along a direction substantially parallel with a direction in which the compressive force is applied, whereby a primary fixed product with a board-like shape is obtained; and the primary fixed product is deformed into a desired three-dimensional shape under heat and moisture (for example, see Japanese Patent No. 3078452. Publication). Further, according to another conventional technique, a softened wooden sheet is compressed and temporarily secured in a prepared mold and left in the mold until the wooden board recovers. Thus a wooden product with a desired shape can be obtained (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H11-77619 Publication).</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">When a joining member is to be fixed to a wooden piece, which is formed through compression as described above, by screwing or caulking, the wooden piece is required to have bosses, ribs, or the like so that screws or caulking members can engage therewith. It is, however, technically difficult to form the bosses or ribs which protrude from the surface of the wooden piece and to compress the formed bosses or ribs into desired shapes similarly to other portions.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In some cases, the thickness of the wooden piece to be attached and fastened with the shape retaining member has to be smaller than that of other parts. The deference in thickness, which means the difference in compression ratios, results in a deference in color tone depending on thickness. In other words, the compressed wooden piece does not have a uniform color tone, which is not preferable in terms of appearance.</div>

In the drawings such as <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the grain patterns of the cover members <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are not shown, since the joining structure of the first embodiment can be realized irrespective of the grain patterns of the cover members <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. The manner of shaping the wooden piece, which is a raw material for the cover member <b>2</b> or <b>3</b>, from the raw wood is determined depending on the conditions, such as strength and appearance required for the cover members <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. Thus the shaped wooden piece may have a straight-grain pattern, a flat-grain pattern, an intermediate grain pattern between the straight grain and the flat grain, an end-grain pattern, for example, as appropriate.</div>

When the screw <b>105</b> is fitted into the main frame portion <b>161</b>, the tapered guide portion <b>162</b> gradually bites into the side plate portion <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the cover member <b>2</b> and the side plate portion <b>3</b> <i>b </i>of the cover member <b>3</b>. Thus, the cover members <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are fixed to the frame <b>106</b>. The tapered shape of the guide portion <b>162</b> serves to prevent the cover members <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> from falling out from the frame <b>106</b> similarly to the grooves <b>1421</b> of the joining member <b>100</b>.
