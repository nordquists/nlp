<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Blood and lymphatic vessels provide complementary functions in maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Blood circulation is optimally designed for efficient delivery and clearance of low molecular weight nutrients and waste products as well as for rapid systemic exposure of all tissues to circulating erythrocytes, immune cells and hormones. The lymphatic system, on the other hand, provides a unidirectional route for clearance of extravasated interstitial fluid, macromolecules and immune cells from the tissues to the blood circulation via the draining lymph-nodes. Both vascular systems were implicated in providing routes for tumor escape and metastatic dissemination.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Metastatic spread of tumors to sentinel lymph nodes is a critical event in tumor progression, and an important prognostic marker. The lymphatic vessels, though providing a key route for tumor cell dissemination to lymph nodes, are typically absent or collapsed in tumors. However, the rim of primary and metastatic tumors is served by draining lymphatics, which show functional activation and structural expansion in response to tumor derived expression of lymphangiogenic growth factors.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The transcriptional coactivator LEDGF/p75 (also named “PSIP2 isoform”) is induced by environmental stresses. Expression of LEDGF/p75 results in induced expression of LEDGF/p75 target genes (AOP2, αB-crystallin and HSP-27). Consensus LEDGF/p75 binding sites, known as stress response elements (STRE), have been described. LEDGF/p75 is expressed in primary and metastatic cancer cells (Daugaard et al, 2007).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">VEGF-C is a protein whose expression is regulated by environmental stresses. VEGF-C has been implicated in peritumor lymphatic remodeling and lymph node metastatic spread for multiple types of cancers (Manila et al., 2002; Skobe et al., 2001). VEGF-C was also shown to be the key lymphangiogenic factor in development and wound healing, mediating its effect through activation of VEGFR-3 on lymphatic endothelial cells. VEGF-C is expressed as a 61 kDa protein, which is subsequently processed by proteolytic enzymes to yield the mature growth factor with increasing affinity to VEGFR-3 on lymphatic endothelial cells.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Prolonged maintenance of tissue homeostasis should include, beyond the acute functional lymphatic response to edema, also a mechanism that would augment lymphatic bed capacity through lymphangiogenesis in response to a chronic increased need for lymphatic clearance. Indeed, VEGF-C expression was shown to be induced by interstitial convection and edema in several experimental models (Boardman and Swartz, 2003; Goldman et al., 2007a; Rutkowski et al., 2006) and in response to inflammation (Baluk et al., 2005).</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0064]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0067" num="0064">The antisense oligonucleotides or polynucleotides of the invention specifically hybridize with one or more nucleic acid molecules encoding LEDGF/p75 polypeptide. As used herein, the term “nucleic acid molecule encoding LEDGF/p75 polypeptide” has been used for convenience to encompass DNA encoding LEDGF/p75, RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRNA or portions thereof) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from such RNA. The hybridization of an antisense with its target nucleic acid is referred to herein as “antisense inhibition.” Such antisense inhibition is typically based upon hydrogen bonding-based hybridization of oligonucleotide strands or segments such that at least one strand or segment is cleaved, degraded, or otherwise rendered inoperable.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0065]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0068" num="0065">The functions of DNA that can be inhibited or interfered with an antisense oligonucleotide or polynucleotide can include replication and transcription. The functions of RNA to be interfered with an antisense oligonucleotide or polynucleotide can include functions such as translocation of the RNA to a site of protein translation, translocation of the RNA to sites within the cell which are distant from the site of RNA synthesis, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more RNA species, and catalytic activity or complex formation involving the RNA which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0066]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0069" num="0066">In the context of this invention, “hybridization” means the pairing of complementary strands of oligomeric compounds. In the present invention, the preferred mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleobases) of the strands of oligomeric compounds. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hybridization can occur under varying circumstances.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0067]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0070" num="0067">An antisense compound is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the target nucleic acid to cause a loss of activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the antisense compound to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and under conditions in which assays are performed in the case of in vitro assays.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0068]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0071" num="0068">In the present invention the phrase “stringent hybridization conditions” or “stringent conditions” refers to conditions under which a compound of the invention will hybridize to its target sequence, but to a minimal number of other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Stringent conditions under which oligomeric compounds hybridize to a target sequence are determined by the nature and composition of the oligomeric compounds and the assays in which they are being investigated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0069]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0072" num="0069">“Complementary” as used herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between one nucleobase of an oligomeric compound to its target nucleic acid. For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide (an oligomeric compound), is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at a certain position of a target nucleic acid, said target nucleic acid being a DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule, then the position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is considered to be a complementary position. The oligonucleotide and the further DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of complementary positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleobases which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, “specifically hybridizable” and “complementary” are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of precise pairing or complementarity over a sufficient number of nucleobases such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and a target nucleic acid.</div>

The guide strand is thought to provide target specificity for RISC-mediated cleavage through perfect base pairing with the mRNA target. Endogenous siRNAs have been identified in plants, fungi, and animals. These siRNAs are derived in vivo from perfectly base-paired dsRNA precursors comprised of two distinct RNA strands. In many cases, endogenous siRNAs originate from repetitive elements within the genome, such as heterochromatic regions at centromeres and telomeres, and are therefore known as repeat-associated siRNAs (rasiRNAs).</div>

Polypeptide analogs include amino acid substitutions and/or additions with naturally occurring amino acid residues, and chemical modifications such as, for example, enzymatic modifications, typically present in nature. Polypeptide analogs also include amino acid substitutions and/or additions with non-natural amino acid residues, and chemical modifications which do not occur in nature.</div>

It is to be appreciated that the analogs and fragments should be active, i.e., their biological activity should be similar to or even higher than that of the native polypeptide, such as, for example, their capability to induce lymphangiogenesis and/or angiogenesis and/or to increase lymphatic clearance.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0091]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0096" num="0091">By using “amino acid substitutions”, it is meant that functionally equivalent amino acid residues are substituted for residues within the sequence resulting in a silent change. The term “functionally equivalent” means, for example, a group of amino acids having similar polarity, similar charge, or similar hydrophobicity. For example, one or more amino acid residues within the sequence can be substituted by another amino acid of a similar polarity, which acts as a functional equivalent, resulting in a silent alteration. Substitutes for an amino acid within the sequence can be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs. For example, the non-polar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine. The polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Such substitutions are known as conservative substitutions. Additionally, a non-conservative substitution can be made in an amino acid that does not contribute to the biological activity of the polypeptide. Such non-conservative substitutions are also encompassed within the term “amino acid substitution”, as used herein. It will be appreciated that the present invention further encompasses polypeptides in which at least one amino acid is substituted by another amino acid to produce polypeptide analogs having increased stability or higher half life as compared to the native polypeptides.</div>

Recombinant production can be achieved by the use of an isolated polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of the present invention, or a fragment, or analog thereof, the isolated polynucleotide operably linked to a promoter for the expression of the polynucleotide. Optionally, a signal peptide and a regulator of the promoter are added. The construct comprising the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptides of the present invention, or a fragment, or analog thereof, the promoter, and optionally the regulator can be placed in a vector, such as a plasmid, virus or phage vector. The vector can be used to transfect or transform a host cell, e.g., a bacterial, yeast, insect, or mammalian cell.

Conjugates comprising polypeptides of the invention and a protein can be made by protein synthesis, e.g., by use of a peptide synthesizer, or by ligating the appropriate nucleic acid sequences encoding the desired amino acid sequences to each other by methods known in the art, in the proper coding frame, and expressing the conjugate by methods commonly known in the art.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0098]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0103" num="0098">An “isolated nucleic acid” refers to a polynucleotide segment or fragment which has been separated from sequences which flank it in a naturally occurring state, e.g., a DNA fragment which has been removed from the sequences which are normally adjacent to the fragment, e.g., the sequences adjacent to the fragment in a genome in which it naturally occurs. The term also applies to polynucleotides, which have been substantially purified from other components, which naturally accompany the polynucleotide in the cell, e.g., RNA or DNA or proteins. The term therefore includes, for example, a recombinant DNA which is incorporated into a vector, into an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus, or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote, or which exists as a separate molecule (e.g., as a cDNA or a genomic or cDNA fragment produced by PCR or restriction enzyme digestion) independent of other sequences. It also includes a recombinant DNA, which is part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequence, and RNA such as mRNA.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0099]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0104" num="0099">The term “encoding” refers to the inherent property of specific sequences of nucleotides in an isolated polynucleotide, such as a gene, a cDNA, or an mRNA, to serve as templates for synthesis of other polymers and macromolecules in biological processes having either a defined sequence of nucleotides (i.e., rRNA, tRNA and mRNA) or a defined sequence of amino acids and the biological properties resulting therefrom. Thus, a gene encodes a peptide or protein if transcription and translation of mRNA corresponding to that gene produces the peptide or protein in a cell or other biological system. Both the coding strand, the nucleotide sequence of which is identical to the mRNA sequence, and the non-coding strand, used as the template for transcription of a gene or cDNA, can be referred to as encoding the peptide or protein or other product of that gene or cDNA.</div>

In general, homologs typically will share at least 50% nucleotide identity to the native sequences of the present invention, in some instances the homologs will share at least 60% nucleotide identity, at least 70%, 80%, 90%, and in still other instances the homologs will share at least 95% nucleotide identity. The homology can be calculated using various, publicly available software tools developed by NCBI (Bethesda, Md.) that can be obtained through the internet. Exemplary tools include the BLAST system. Pairwise and ClustalW alignments (BLOSUM30 matrix setting) as well as Kyte-Doolittle hydropathic analysis can be obtained using the MacVetor sequence analysis software (Oxford Molecular Group). Watson-Crick complements of the foregoing nucleic acids also are embraced by the invention.

For example, serine residues are encoded by the codons TCA, AGT, TCC, TCG, TCT and AGC. Each of the six codons is equivalent for the purposes of encoding a serine residue. Thus, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that any of the serine-encoding nucleotide triplets may be employed to direct the protein synthesis apparatus, in vitro or in vivo, to incorporate a serine residue into an elongating LEDGF polypeptide. Similarly, nucleotide sequence triplets which encode other amino acid residues include, but are not limited to: CCA, CCC, CCG and CCT (proline codons); CGA, CGC, CGG, CGT, AGA and AGG (arginine codons); ACA, ACC, ACG and ACT (threonine codons); AAC and AAT (asparagine codons); and ATA, ATC and ATT (isoleucine codons). Other amino acid residues may be encoded similarly by multiple nucleotide sequences.

Selectable markers include, for example, sequences conferring antibiotic resistance markers, which may be used to obtain successful transformants by selection, such as ampicillin, tetracycline and kanamycin resistance sequences, or supply critical nutrients not available from complex media. Suitable expression vectors may be plasmids derived, for example, from pBR322 or various pUC plasmids, which are commercially available.

Other suitable promoters are eukaryotic promoters, which contain enhancer sequences (e.g., the rabbit ?-globin regulatory elements), constitutively active promoters (e.g., the ?-actin promoter, etc.), signal and/or tissue specific promoters (e.g., inducible and/or repressible promoters, such as a promoter responsive to TNF or RU486, the metallothionine promoter, etc.), and tumor-specific promoters.</div>
