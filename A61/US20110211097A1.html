<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A multi-eye imaging device includes M imaging systems each having an optical system and an imaging element (M is a natural number greater than or equal to 2). The imaging systems include one reference imaging system and M−1 dependent imaging systems. An imaging surface of an imaging element of the reference imaging system and an imaging surface of an imaging element of the dependent imaging system are arranged in substantially the same plane. The imaging element of the reference imaging system and the imaging element of the dependent imaging system are arranged on a straight line that is substantially parallel with a pixel arrangement direction of the imaging element. when a length of one pixel of the imaging element is W, an imaging element of an L-th dependent imaging system (L is a positive integer having a maximum value of M−1) among the dependent imaging systems is arranged at a distance of W×((L/M)+N) (N is a natural number including 0) in a direction substantially orthogonal to the straight line in the plane with respect to the imaging element of the reference imaging system. This configuration make it possible to generate a high resolution image without performing complex control on the optical systems.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, as multi-pixel or high definition progresses due to high performance of imaging devices such as digital still cameras and digital video cameras, there is a problem in that a size of an optical system, such as a lens, or an imaging element is increased to sufficiently exhibit optical performance of the imaging device.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to resolve such a problem, a multi-eye imaging device for generating one high resolution image having a great pixel number by imaging a common subject using a plurality of small and thin imaging systems having a relatively small pixel number and synthesizing a plurality of obtained images has been proposed (e.g., see Non-Patent Document 1). The multi-eye imaging device includes two imaging systems, a left imaging system and a right imaging system, which image the same subject by shifting sampling phases by ½ pixels. Two obtained images are synthesized to obtain a high resolution output image from the images obtained by the respective imaging systems.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The sampling phase cited herein is a spatial phase of a position in which an imaging element of each imaging system performs imaging when a subject is imaged by a plurality of imaging systems. The sampling phase will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, areas imaged by a left imaging system are shown using grids <b>121</b> <i>a </i>and <b>121</b> <i>b</i>, and areas imaged by a right imaging system are shown using grids <b>122</b> <i>a </i>and <b>122</b> <i>b </i>(dotted lines), in which each minimal square indicates an area imaged by one pixel. In the grids <b>121</b> <i>a </i>and <b>122</b> <i>a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, imaging positions of the respective pixels of the imaging elements of the two imaging systems substantially overlap and the sampling phases match. On the other hand, in the grids <b>121</b> <i>b </i>and <b>122</b> <i>b </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, imaging positions of the respective pixels of the imaging elements of the two imaging systems are shifted by ½ pixels in both horizontal and vertical directions, and the sampling phases are shifted by ½ pixels in both horizontal and vertical directions. To generate a high resolution image using such a multi-eye imaging device, it is necessary to perform imaging so that the sampling phases of the two imaging systems do not match, but when a distance from the imaging element to the subject is changed, the sampling phases of the two imaging systems are changed, and the sampling phases may match depending on the imaging distance.</div>

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, an imaging element M corresponds to a left imaging system and an imaging element N corresponds to a right imaging system. The subject is at a point P<b>0</b> or P<b>1</b> and is located on an optical axis of the imaging element M, i.e., an optical axis of a pinhole O. When an imaging distance is changed from H<b>0</b> in which the subject is at P<b>0</b> to H<b>1</b> in which the subject is at P<b>1</b>, a shift amount of the sampling phase is u<b>0</b>-u<b>1</b>, which is expressed by an equation:</div>

When a pixel pitch of the imaging element is 6 μm, the imaging distance is changed from 700 mm to 725 mm, such that the sampling phase is shifted by about ½ pixels. It is assumed that the sampling phase is shifted by ½ pixels at the imaging distance of 700 mm. When the imaging distance is changed to 725 mm, ½+½=1 and the sampling phase is shifted by one pixel. This means that the sampling phase is shifted by one pixel, but, as a result, pixels overlap with each other and the sampling phases match, such that high resolution cannot be realized.

<heading id="h-0004">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0009">In order to resolve this problem, it is necessary to control the two imaging systems according to the imaging distance and shift the sampling phases. A method of shifting the sampling phases includes, for example, a method of changing a convergence angle (an angle between optical axes of the two imaging systems).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0010">However, the imaging device becomes complex and large to change the convergence angle according to the imaging distance. For example, it is assumed that a subject away from the imaging device at 30 km/h is imaged. When the subject is initially in a position of the imaging distance of 1000 mm, the subject moves to a position of the imaging distance of 9333 mm after one second. When this subject is imaged by a multi-eye imaging device having a focal length f of 5 mm, a base length B of 12 mm, and an imaging element pixel pitch of 6 μm, the sampling phase is shifted by about 9 pixels based on Equation (1). That is, a moment at which the subject occupies a position of an imaging distance at which the sampling phases match nine times a second is generated. In order to always obtain a high resolution image from a moving subject, it is necessary to shift the sampling phases by changing the convergence angle at least at the imaging distance at which the sampling phases match. Accordingly, there is a need for a device configuration capable of changing the convergence angle at least nine times a second, making the device complex and large, and requiring complex movement control over the optical system.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0011">Further, in such a problem, only a part of the subject can be obtained with high resolution when the subject has depth despite being stationary. For example, it is assumed that different subjects A and B are simultaneously imaged by a multi-eye imaging device having a focal length f of 5 mm, a base length B of 12 mm, and an imaging element pixel pitch of 6 μm, and imaging distances are 700 mm and 725 mm, respectively. When the sampling phase at the imaging distance of 700 mm is shifted by ½ pixels so that the subject A is obtained with high resolution, the sampling phase at the imaging distance of 725 mm, based on Equation (1), is shifted by ½ pixels with respect to the imaging distance of 700 mm, such that ½+½=1, the sampling phases match, and the subject B cannot be realized with high resolution. Accordingly, different subjects A and B in positions of different depths despite being stationary cannot be simultaneously imaged with high resolution. That is, when a subject has depth, a part of an imaging area cannot be obtained with high resolution.</div>

As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, when the solid lens <b>107</b> is moved, an incident light is deflected and a position on an imaging element <b>10</b> in which an image is formed is changed for optical axis shift. This process in the vertical and horizontal directions allows the optical axis to be independently shifted in the vertical and horizontal directions on an imaging element surface.</div>

In this case, control of an optical axis shift amount is performed on the imaging element <b>10</b>, instead of using an optical system <b>109</b>.
