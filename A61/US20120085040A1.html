<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">An electrical connection system is presented that is especially suited for use with a solar shingle application disposed on a rooftop of a building structure. The electrical connection system, when underlying roof shingles disposed on the rooftop, has a low profile that prevents an undesired buckled visual appearance from occurring to the roof shingles over a service life of the roof shingles. The electrical connection system has a thickness that is about a diameter thickness of at least one wire conductor that attaches with at least one connector body of the electrical connection system. The electrical connection system further includes at least one latch mechanism, that when sufficiently engaged against by a tool, allows a plug connector body to unmate from a socket connector body or a shunt socket connector body. A method to construct the at least one connector of the electrical connection system is also presented.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Current connection systems used for solar roof shingles have a thickness that may make connectors in the connection system difficult to hide under the solar roof shingles during installation. The thickness of current solar connection systems may have a sufficient thickness that causes noticeable visual buckling of a solar shingle and may prevent the solar shingle to lie flat on the decking, or external surface of a rooftop during solar shingle installation. Buckling of the solar shingle may cause the solar shingle to undesirably crack or break which may result in decreased useful life of the solar shingle. Moreover, an undesired crack in the shingle may further undesirably render the shingle electrically inoperative. With increased interest from consumers in renewable energy technology, solar shingles will continue to remain a viable energy choice. Homeowners may also desire the look of aesthetically-pleasing purplish-blue solar shingles in contrast to solar panels which may be undesirably less aesthetic, have more mass than a typical solar shingle, and require a larger footprint when disposed on the rooftop. As such, it will remain desirable to maintain or increase the electrical signal transmission robustness provided by solar roof shingles. To further enhance the electrical signal transmission, it is desired that the connection system be environmentally sealed for protection from environmental elements experienced on the rooftop. It is further desirable to accomplish these tasks while enhancing the cosmetic appearance of the roof shingles on the rooftop over the service life of the roof shingles.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">Solar roof shingles may resemble conventional asphalt roof shingles. As such, in some roofing applications, solar shingles may be intermixed with conventional asphalt shingles. One difference between a solar roof shingle and a conventional asphalt shingle is that solar roof shingles contain an electrical photovoltaic device. When installed on a rooftop of a building structure, such as an office building or a home, these installed solar roof shingles capture rays of sunlight that strike the solar shingles. The photovoltaic device converts the sunlight to energy that may be electrically stored. The electrically stored energy may be used to power electrical devices in the home or office building that contains the installed solar shingle rooftop. Alternately, the stored energy may be transferred back into a local power grid of an electric power company for use by electrical devices in electrical communication with the local power grid.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with the invention, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a low profile electrical connection system <b>10</b> is employed among an array of shingles <b>12</b>, some of which are solar shingles <b>14</b>, disposed on a at least a portion of a rooftop <b>16</b> of a building structure (not shown). The building structure may be a home or an office building. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, shingle array <b>12</b> also includes asphalt shingles <b>18</b>. Alternately, the rooftop may contain any number of solar shingles or be intermixed with other shingle types or solar panels. Low profile electrical connection system <b>10</b> effectively electrically connects solar shingles <b>14</b> together to transfer electrical energy to another electrical device produced by the solar shingles.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">Electrical connection system <b>10</b> includes three types of connectors: a plug connector <b>20</b>, a socket connector <b>22</b>, and a shunt socket connector <b>24</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, connectors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> underlie asphalt shingles <b>18</b> on rooftop <b>16</b>. Alternately, the plug, socket, and shunt socket connectors may underlie solar shingles on the rooftop. Still yet alternately, the plug, socket, or shunt socket connectors may be positioned on the rooftop so as to not underlie any of the roof shingles. Socket connector <b>22</b> receives the mating plug connector <b>20</b> along mating axis A. A primary plug and socket connector pair <b>26</b> are formed when plug connector <b>20</b> and socket connector <b>24</b> are mated together along mating axis A. Shunt socket connector <b>24</b> receives plug connector <b>20</b> along mating axis A′. A secondary plug and shunt socket connector pair <b>28</b> are formed when plug connector <b>20</b> and shunt socket connector <b>24</b> are mated together along mating axis A′. Shunt socket connector <b>24</b> is disposed at a downstream solar shingle in the electrical circuit and assists to electrically close, or complete the electrical circuit such that solar shingles <b>14</b> on rooftop <b>16</b> are electrically connected together. Shunt socket connector <b>24</b> is connected to a terminating plug connector in the electrical circuit. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this terminating plug connector is the last, or sixth plug connector remotely disposed from energy storage device <b>29</b>. Energy storage device <b>29</b> stores the electrical energy generated by solar shingles <b>14</b> and may supply this stored energy to other electrical devices in the building structure and/or the local power grid. In one embodiment, the energy storage device may be disposed on the rooftop with the solar shingles. In another embodiment, the energy storage device may be disposed remotely from the rooftop. In yet other embodiments, instead of being electrically connected to the energy storage device, the electrical connection system may be in electrical communication with an inverter electrical device, or multiple banks of solar shingles, or the local energy power grid as determined by the application of use and the artesian in the solar shingle and wiring and connector arts. Because there is generally only a single secondary connector pair to electrically close an electrical circuit, many solar shingle electrical circuits have a greater number of primary connector pairs than secondary connector pairs. Alternately, a special end shingle may be constructed in contrast to using the shunt socket connector, but this adds undesired increased cost to install the solar shingle roof system. Piezoelectric devices (not shown) associated with the solar shingles may be electrically attached to the wire cables that communicate with respective primary and secondary electrical connector pairs <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> to electrically connect the solar shingles with electrical connection system <b>10</b>. In an alternate embodiment, a large rooftop may have a solar shingle arrangement where the a low profile connection system includes a plurality of plug connectors, a plurality of socket connectors, and a plurality of shunt socket connectors to electrically connect the solar shingle arrangement together. Still yet alternately, a plurality of low profile electrical connection systems may be employed in a plurality of solar shingle electrical circuits on the same rooftop depending on the desired electrical configuration for a solar shingle arrangement. Consideration of specific electrical connection system configurations used with various solar shingle arrangements are left for the artesian in the solar shingle and/or wiring and connector arts.</div>

Plug connector <b>20</b> includes a plug connector body <b>30</b>. Plug connector body <b>30</b> is constructed of a dielectric material. Preferably, plug connector body <b>30</b> is formed of a UL Fl thermoplastic material. Alternately, the plug connector body may be formed of any thermoplastic material that is acceptable for use in a solar shingle application. For the solar shingle application, the material used for the plug connector body should be robust enough to ensure UV, flame, and other voltage requirements are met that are typically encountered in the solar shingle application. Still yet alternately, other thermoplastic materials for the plug connector body may be chosen that are adequate for electrical applications that are not solar shingle applications. Plug connector body <b>30</b> includes a generally axial planar first wall <b>32</b> and a generally axial planar second wall <b>34</b> opposingly spaced from planar first wall <b>32</b> by about a respective diameter d thickness of two wire conductors, or cables <b>36</b>. Sidewalls <b>38</b> join first wall <b>32</b> and second wall <b>34</b> together. Wire cables <b>36</b> have a dielectric insulation outer covering <b>40</b> that surrounds an electrically-conductive inner core <b>42</b>. A portion <b>63</b> of insulation outer covering <b>40</b> proximate an end <b>44</b> of each wire cable <b>36</b> is removed, such as by wire stripping, to expose a portion of inner core <b>42</b> that is a lead <b>46</b> of cable <b>36</b>. Lead <b>46</b> is received by a receiving portion <b>48</b> of a terminal, or an electrical contact <b>50</b> of plug connector <b>20</b> and attached to electrical contact <b>50</b>, such as by crimping, as is known in the wiring and connector arts. After attachment, wire cable <b>36</b> and electrical contact <b>50</b> form a plug wiring assembly <b>52</b>. Electrical contacts <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>each include a bifurcated male blade, or tine contact. Contacts <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>are preferably formed of an electrically conductive metal material, such as brass or tin. Inner core <b>42</b> is formed of a metal material such as copper or copper alloy, or aluminum. Insulation outer covering <b>40</b> may be formed of a dielectric, thermoplastic material. Preferably, insulation outer covering <b>40</b> has similar material chemical properties as those of the material that forms plug connector body <b>30</b>. When connectors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are mated, wire assemblies <b>52</b> are disposed in a single row perpendicular to mating axis A and axially disposed in plug connector body <b>30</b> intermediate first and second wall <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. Wire assemblies <b>52</b> respectively engage an inner surface <b>57</b> of first wall and an inner surface <b>59</b> of second wall <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, first wall <b>32</b> has a generally planar exterior surface <b>54</b> and second wall <b>34</b> has a generally planar exterior surface <b>56</b>. A first plane <b>58</b> is defined along exterior surface <b>54</b> of first wall <b>32</b> and a second plane <b>60</b> is defined along exterior surface <b>56</b> of second wall <b>34</b>. First plane <b>58</b> is has a parallel relationship with second plane <b>60</b>. When plug connector <b>20</b> is mated to socket connector <b>22</b>, socket connector <b>22</b> is generally disposed intermediate first plane <b>58</b> and second plane <b>60</b>. Diameter thickness d of the wire cable <b>36</b>, and hence the overall thickness t of the plug connector <b>20</b> is related to an electrical current-carrying capacity of plug wire assemblies <b>52</b> that may be required for a specific solar shingle electrical application. Thickness t is generally greater than thickness d by the respective thickness of both first wall <b>32</b> and second wall <b>34</b>. In some embodiments, a solar shingle electrical application may require an electrical current capacity through each wire assembly having an electrical range from zero (0) amps direct current (DC) to thirteen (13) amps DC. The thicknesses of the respective walls <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are generally less than diameter thickness d when the electrical connection system is required to electrically transmit up to thirteen (13) amps DC. Two hollow cavities <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>are formed in plug connector body <b>30</b> of plug connector <b>20</b>. Hollow cavities <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>assist to aid in the manufacturability of the plug connector while also reducing material costs of plug connector body <b>30</b>. The hollow cavities helps to mitigate the effects of shrinkage of the plug connector body after the plug connector body is injection molded and may also help for easy release of the plug connector body from the mold dependent on the mold tool design used. Alternately, the hollow cavities may be cored out after the plug connector body is injection molded.</div>

In one embodiment, the wire cable is plasma etched when the wire cable is constructed before being rolled up on a take-up spool.

Additionally, as the insulation outer covering is plasma etched, undesired impurities and contaminants, such has human skin oils, are broken up that further assist to ensure an optimal seal between the insulation outer covering and the connector body. The plasma etching allows chemical bonding of the connector body and the insulation outer covering to achieve a sealed connector body. Preferably, the connector body and the outer insulation covering material are formed of materials having similar chemical properties that allow an effective, sufficient environmental seal between the connector body and the outer insulation covering. In solar shingle applications, preferably the insulation outer covering is formed of a cross-linked polyethylene XLPE material and the connector body is formed of a polyamide PA66 material. Preferably, the insulation outer covering is plasma etched just prior to molding of the connector body in a manufacturing assembly line to ensure an optimal seal between the insulation outer covering and the connector body. In one embodiment, an atmospheric gas is used and in another embodiment a helium gas is used. Any gas may be used that allows for an effective environmental seal of the connector body and the insulation outer covering to be attained.

A sealing ring intermediate ends of the plug and socket or shunt socket connectors prevents at least liquid fluid intrusion from entering a possible first leak path in the electrical connection system. A connector body overmolds the wire assemblies that includes a portion of the outer insulation covering of the associated wire conductors that is plasma etched to prevent at least liquid fluid flow from entering a potential second leak path through the wire cables and in to the electrical connection system. The thickness of the primary and secondary connector pairs ensures that if these pairs are hidden to underlie a solar, asphalt or other type of shingle, that the respective shingle maintains a generally parallel relationship with an external surface of the rooftop to preserve a high quality, visually cosmetic appearance of the rooftop over the lifetime of the roof shingles. A convenient, simple latch mechanism consists of a combination of a shoulder on the plug connector and an engaging nib disposed on a flexible extension arm of the socket or shunt socket connector to ensure that intention is required to unmate the connectors in the primary and/or secondary connector pair. A latch mechanism is intentionally unlatchable by using a tool applied against the latch mechanism that allows the unmating of the connectors in the electrical connection system. Preferably, a tool simultaneously engages the pair of latch mechanisms of the primary and/or secondary pair to allow the connectors in the primary or secondary connector pair to be unmateable in a single motion. A first and a second boss of the plug connector have differing widths. These differing widths are disposed perpendicular to the mating axes when the primary and/or secondary connector pairs are mated together so that the connectors are mated only along the mating axis and not in off-axis direction. This feature lessons the chance that the wiring assemblies and/or the connector bodies may be irreparably damaged. T-boss protuberances disposed on the first boss and the second boss advantageously assist to prevent a scooping condition, or off-axis mating of the connectors in the primary and/or secondary connector pairs. Thumb bumps defined in the first and/or the second external planar walls of the respective plug connector, socket connector, or socket shunt connector advantageously provide a gripping surface for a roof installer to facilitate mating and unmating of these connectors during installation or servicing of the electrical connection system. Hollow core cavities defined within the plug, the socket, or the shunt socket connector may provide for ease of molding manufacturability of these respective connector bodies while further reducing material costs to produce these connector bodies.</div>
