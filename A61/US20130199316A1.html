<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A mechanism which comprises at least one fulcrum element connected to at least one force transmission rod by a connecting member is provided. The mechanism may convert a reciprocating rectilinear movement into a rotational movement of the at least one fulcrum element. The rotation of the at least one fulcrum element may cause the at least one force transmission rod to rotate. The connecting member comprises a part, known as a lever arm that may be situated between the at least one fulcrum element and the at least one force transmission rod and has a length that varies during the relative movement of the at least one fulcrum element with respect to the at least one transmission rod.</div>
