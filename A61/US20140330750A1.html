<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for transforming bank-owned real property assets and/or bank held mortgage note receivables, suitable for refinancing, into a negotiable hybrid mortgage/asset-backed security. The method includes providing a bank mortgage at a below-market mortgage rate for purchase of the real property or refinance by the mortgagor. The bank mortgage, having a face value, is assigned to a secondary market buyer at a market price less than 120% of the mortgage face value and greater than 30% of the mortgage face value. The face value minus the market price defining mortgage note equity. Using the mortgage note equity or a ratio of 33% of the mortgage face value, a negotiable government security is purchased by the secondary market buyer. The bank mortgage note and government security are then securitized into a single negotiable hybrid security suitable for pledging to a central bank as collateral securing a loan to recycle the process.</div>

The non-agency MBS market, mortgages not backed by the government, alone is $1.4 Trillion. When you consider these securities have plummeted in value along with other mortgage portfolios, it is clear why we are experiencing the worst recession since the Great Depression. Additionally, as a result of loan defaults, investors today are requesting many major banks repurchase MBS portfolios sold to them that have not performed. The legal costs related to suits against bond mortgage underwriters are estimated to be in the billions, let alone the actual re-purchase price of an entire portfolio itself.</div>

The bank mortgage is assigned to a secondary market buyer at a market price less than 120% of the mortgage face value and greater than 30% of the mortgage face value. Subsequently, a negotiable government security is purchased (by: the secondary market investor). The bank mortgage and government security are securitized into a single negotiable hybrid mortgage/asset-backed security suitable as eligible collateral to be loan against by the Federal Reserve Collateral Management System.</div>

For example, a bank-owned real property asset may be a foreclosed residential home wherein the bank has more than 50% ownership interest. In another example, the bank-owned real property asset may comprise a so called “Legacy (or Toxic) Asset”—i.e. an asset that has been owned by the bank for such a long time that it actually has lost its original value, is outdated, obsolete or has lost its productivity. Such bank-owned properties are termed “assets” herein (as opposed to “liabilities”) regardless of their relative value. Lastly, in a third example, a bank-owned property asset may be a mortgage note held by the bank against a subject property in whose mortgagor desires to refinance or at a below market interest rate.</div>

<li id="ul0005-0001" num="0047">What it means: The initials stand for the Wall Street Journal, which surveys large banks and publishes the consensus prime rate. The Journal surveys the 30 largest banks, and when three-quarters of them (23) change, the Journal changes its rate, effective on the day the Journal publishes the new rate. It's the most widely quoted measure of the prime rate, which is the rate at which banks will lend money to their most-favored customers. The prime rate will move up or down in lock step with changes by the Federal Reserve Board.</li>
<li id="ul0005-0002" num="0048">How it's used: The prime rate is an important index used by banks to set rates on many consumer loan products, such as credit cards or auto loans. If you see that the prime rate has gone up, your variable credit card rate will soon follow. (Bankrate.com)</li>
