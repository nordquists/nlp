<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, so-called solid-state light source projectors have been developed, which are configured to apply light emitted from a laser diode (hereinafter referred to as LD) as exciting light to a fluorescent member and use wavelength-converted fluorescent light as source light. Like projectors of the related art which use a mercury lamp as a light source, the solid-state light source projectors require brightness. As a technique for realizing brighter solid-state light source projectors, a technique described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2014/0211170 is known.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2014/0211170 discloses a configuration which includes two light source units, each including blue LDs and a fluorescent member and capable of emitting a white light beam. The white light beams from the two light source units are combined by a trapezoidal prism pair on the light incident side of a rod integrator, and guided to a light modulation element. With this configuration, a brighter solid-state light source projector is realized. The two light source units are configured such that a light source image, which is an image of a spot on a fluorescent member, is formed near the trapezoidal prism pair.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">When the intensity of incident light on the fluorescent member is increased to increase the brightness of the solid-state light source projector, the light density of the spot formed by the incident light on the surface of the fluorescent member is increased. Note that the light density here refers to the intensity of light per unit area. The resulting brightness saturation phenomenon may lower the efficiency of light conversion, and the level of brightness may not increase in proportion to the increase in the output of the LDs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">As a solution to this, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2014/0211170 presents a technique that provides a diffusing plate between the LDs and the fluorescent member. This is to blur the spot formed on the surface of the fluorescent member to prevent the light density from becoming too high. When the spot is blurred by using the diffusing plate, the light intensity distribution inside the spot takes the form of a Gaussian distribution where the light intensity decreases from the center toward both ends. Hence, two light source images, each having a light intensity distribution taking the form of a Gaussian distribution, are formed near the trapezoidal prism pair by the two light source units.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The trapezoidal prism pair described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2014/0211170 is formed by two trapezoidal prisms disposed side by side, each having a thickness half the size of the light incident surface of the rod integrator and having a 45-degree reflective surface at an end thereof on the incident side, with their reflective surfaces opposite each other.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">When two light source images, each having a light intensity distribution taking the form of a Gaussian distribution, are formed in such an optical-path combining system, a combined light source image obtained by combining the two increases in size. This increases the amount of light not entering the trapezoidal prism pair, and results in low light use efficiency. To reduce the size of the combined light source image, the two light source images may be brought closer to each other until they overlap. However, light in the region where the two light source images overlap enters a reflective surface which is not an originally intended reflective surface, and is guided in a direction different from the direction of the light modulation element. This results in low light use efficiency.</div>
