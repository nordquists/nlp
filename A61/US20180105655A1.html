<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Currently, absorbents including hydrophilic fiber such as pulp and aqueous-liquid absorbing resins produced mainly from acrylic acid (salt) are widely utilized for sanitary materials such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, and incontinence pads. From the viewpoint of recent improvement in QOL (quality of life), demands for such sanitary materials are shifting to those of lighter weight or of smaller thickness, and following this tendency, reduction of hydrophilic fiber usage has been demanded. Therefore, aqueous-liquid absorbing resin itself has been demanded to provide liquid diffusibility or initial absorption in an absorbent which have been taken by hydrophilic fibers, and aqueous-liquid absorbing resin superior in liquid absorption under load and liquid permeability between swollen gel particles has been needed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">As a method for improving liquid permeability between swollen gel particles, there has been known a method including increasing the crosslinking density of aqueous-liquid absorbing resin surface by specifically crosslinking the SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer) surface to suppress deformation of swollen gel surface, and thereby form gel gaps efficiently (see, for example, Patent Document 1). However, the liquid permeation between swollen gel particles has not been satisfactorily achieved by only conventional surface crosslinking.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">As a method for improving liquid permeability between swollen gel particles, there have been known (1) a method of forming physical spaces by adding an inorganic compound such as silica and talc, (2) a method of forming gel gaps by suppressing adhesion of swollen gel particles by surface-treating with a hydrophobic polymer small in surface free energy, such as modified silicone, and (3) a method of adding aluminum sulfate, aluminum lactate, etc. (see, for example, Patent Document 2, Patent Document 3, and Patent Document 4). However, although the above-cited methods can improve the liquid permeability between swollen gel particles, the methods were problematic in that the amount of absorption under load is lowered and that resin particles are broken during transportation or a diaper production process and the liquid permeability is impaired.</div>

About 50 g of particles to be measured are put on the top sieve and then shaken for five minutes by a RO-TAP sieve shaker. Then, the particles received on the respective sieves and the bottom tray are weighed and the weight fractions of the particles on the respective sieves are calculated with the total weight of the particles considered to be 100% by weight. The calculated values are plotted on a logarithmic probability sheet {taking the size of openings of a sieve (particle diameter) as abscissa and the weight fraction as ordinate} and then a line connecting the respective points is drawn.

Accordingly, they are suitably used for sanitary goods, such as disposable diapers (a disposable diaper for children, a disposable diaper for adults, etc.), napkins (a sanitary napkin, etc.), paper towel, pads (an incontinence pad, a surgical under pad, etc.), and pet sheets (a pet urine absorbing sheet), and is extremely suited for disposable diapers. Moreover, the aqueous-liquid absorbing resin particles produced by the production process of the present invention are useful not only for sanitary goods but also for other various applications such as a pet urine absorbent, a urine gelatinizer of a portable toilet, an agent for preserving freshness of vegetables and fruits etc., a drip absorbent for meats and fishes, a refrigerant, a disposable body warmer, a battery gelatinizer, a water retention agent for plants, soil, etc., a condensation preventing agent, a water stopping material, a packing material, artificial snow, etc.</div>
