<li> <para-num num="[0029]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0029">Wearable items that are versatile are capable of being used for many purposes, such as, to create the appearance of different configurations, to fulfill a need, to adapt the item(s) to various occasions and circumstances, to reduce the need of having to spend a lot of money on purchasing multiple items, and for other purposes. Apparel items and accessories are some examples of common items that are wearable, capable of being made in a plurality of different ways, and suitable for being designed to fulfill a specific use or alternatively, to be versatile.</div>

No. 4,062,062 issued to Basaldua on Dec. 13, 1977 discloses a multi-style garment comprising a lower and an upper tubular portion. The upper portion forms an extension of the lower tubular portion and comprises a pair of spaced apart scarves. Each one of the scarves has a lower end connected to the tubular portion and an upper free end opposite the lower end, and the scarves also extend from a first edge at the front of the garment around to a second edge at the rear of the garment. According to another claimed embodiment of the invention, a garment is provided that is capable of being worn in a plurality of different styles and comprises a lower tubular portion and a pair of opposed scarves that extend upwardly from the tubular portion. Each one of the pair of scarves have a lower end connected to the tubular portion and an upper free end opposite the lower end. The pair of scarves also form an extension of the lower tubular portion and have respective side edges when viewed in elevation, and opposed front and rear edges that taper upwardly and outwardly. However, it can be observed that: a) a lower portion or alternatively, a lower tubular portion is needed for the multi-style garment; and b) none of the garments have another versatile part or component with at least one free end extending in at least one different direction from any of the disclosed pair of scarves at an edge not being opposite the free end of any of the respective scarves, which creates some limitations to how such items can be styled and used.</div>
