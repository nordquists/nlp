<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Honeybees are social insects living in wax nests dedicated to the production and storage of honey and pollen. Western honeybee is the best-known honeybee, which has been used for honey production and crop pollination, according to its biological life cycle. The honeybee managed by humans faces the increasing difficulties due to the worldwide increase of honeybee mortality. Honeybee colony instinctively chooses natural nests to live in and reproduce; natural nest structure is generally a cavity where the honeybees adapt building wax combs. Hives are human-made artificial nests used for beekeeping purposes. Hives can be subdivided in natural ones like e.g. skeps or hollow trees, and into rational hives. Colonies settled in natural nest are generally low populated and rear less brood with respect the ones in rational hives (Honeybee Nests: Composition, Structure, Function—H. R. Hepburn, C. W. W. Pirk, O. Duangphakdee). Rational hive are modular and they provide a space (the nest) where the bees rear new generations and a space (the super) where the bees store honey. In most cases, rational hives make use of removable frames to sustain the combs. Rational hive architecture is horizontal when the super uses the same nest frame/comb assigned to the nest; in this case, the super is placed at a lateral side with respect to the nest. Vertical hives uses a modular layered structure extending vertically. The bee-space concept allows a nest inspection without damaging the colony; however, natural combs or top bars can be used as well. Rational hives are used worldwide due to their suitability to certain beekeeping operations contrary to natural hives or natural nests. The rational hive operations include large-scale use, inspection, artificial replication, transportability, mono-flora honey extraction, superior pollination capability and major colony population, parasite and pathologies control by the beekeeper. Several hive types exist and their use depends to the location, culture, constructive material availability. The hives are geometrically different one type from another being designed e.g. to allow truck transportation and/or to allow monoflora honey production. Rational hives are built in geometrical similitude (in terms of volume, comb surface, etc.) with natural nests (e.g. Lazutin/Layens hives) and they provide the required space to the colony during its seasonal development. Langstroth hive type is used in any climatic location, from India to Alaska, including Australia, America, and Europe. The colony population and the brood surface is seasonal and strongly conditioned by climatic temperature. The colony productivity and the flying bees vary non-proportional with the population size so that high-populated colonies are highly demanded for agriculture services. High populations are also an efficient alternative method to fight several colony diseases, such as small beetle, <i>Vespa velutina</i>, fungus, etc. In recent years, the managing cost to obtain a strong bee colony makes barely profitable for beekeeper the pollination fee of such colony. Colony population peak depends on environmental conditions and to the bee strain. An important hive characteristic is the brood chamber total (wax) surface. A strong colony reach a maximal brood surface into the season, typically included between 40 and 180 dm<sup>2</sup>, which the brood occupies into a standard rational hive. Colonies in natural nests present (as an average) the half of the brood surface with respect to colonies managed in rational hives. From Europe to Africa, the maximal Dadant/Langstroth brood surface is lower than 200 dm<sup>2</sup>. This is generally an over estimation of the maximal brood surface considering the high colony sensitivity to pathologies. The total nest surface is not subject to sensible variations even if more frames (wax combs or free space in case of natural combs) are provided to the colony into the hive, or by modifying the nest configuration from horizontal to vertical. The total brood surface is perceived as a colony expression and not as a hive induced characteristic. The honeybee colony population is slightly affected by the hive type, but it is highly affected by diseases. The heat production and the temperature is a colony need to survive and reproduce. The honeybees can rear brood in a wide range of temperature between 26-36° C. To thermo-regulate the nest, bees' burn honey or sugar provided by the beekeeper. The whole nest is generally thermo-regulated by bees. In most cases, bees cover the total brood surface in order to warm it. The temperature of the hive brood chamber affects the queen egg-laying ratio. The nest incubation temperature strongly influences the newborn bee mortality, activity, communication, and flight capability. Due to the bee temperature dependency, some potential improvements for a better-insulated hive are known. [Mezdocky] “The thickness and the composition of the nest walls will act as insulation and buffer for the internal environment of the nest. To illustrate, a top bar hive in Scotland will probably benefit from some kind of winter insulation more than, for example, a double walled WBC in the South of England. In addition, it is important to note that insulating the hive may affect the humidity”. The bee temperature dependency is well known to have biological effects (e.g. queen laying ratio and incubation timing). However, every scientific papers and community artisans neglect the relation between the hive performance and the colony development. Some improvements were randomly observed providing more insulation above existing hive types, but some strong disadvantages emerged (such as humidity issues). As of today, none observed any specific relation between the existing hive types and the colony development and none tried to design specific new hives engineered to maximize the efficiency of the hive to the total advantage of the colony development, highlighting a quantum benefit due to the hive concept. No significant solutions are available nowadays to definitely take advantages from an optimized hive shape. It is remarked that the nest temperature control lays on bees only. The knowledge of honeybee and its parasites population dynamic is based on the study of the final effects in terms of gross values of infestation or population size or measuring the growing ratio parameters, or the relations of those resulting parameters to the bee life span. It is important to outline how the rough growing ratio coefficients have been widely measured without however understanding or at least investigating their relations to the hive structure. The entire observations were produced with the use of rational hives only. The colony is measured in gross population and brood surface to evaluate its work capability and to define the pollination fees. Inspection of the hive is required, even by law in some cases. Honeybee colony population is retained un-affected by the hive, by the frame (or comb) size; by the intermediate spaces between the combs as they do not constitute any obstacle for the bees and the queen. According to Agroscope Liebefeld-Posieux ALP (Imdorf A., Ruoff K., Fluri P., Development of the honeybee colonies, ALP forum N. 68 November 2011), Swiss honeybee research center and Liebig (Liebig, G.; Gerlich, R.; Sanzenbacher, R. (1997) The development of bee colonies on different sized honeycombs, D. Bienen J. 5 (1): 18-19): “Bees can adapt to any type and size of hive and of honeycomb. These characteristics do not have a significant impact on the development of the colony. When selecting hives, particular attention must therefore be paid to the type of management of the apiary, the technical aspects of the activity, the harvesting conditions and the measures to control <i>Varroa. </i> </div>

<br/>
The basic regulation mechanism responsible, during the beekeeping season, of the impressive growth and the related decrease of the population as well as of the transition from summer bees to winter bees, is genetically established and physiologically regulated.
<br/>
. . . .
<br/>
Also the choice of the type of hive or the size of the honeycombs is irrelevant for the development of the colony”
<br/>
The effect of the standard rational frame size miniaturization leads to weak colony development. The beekeeper experience worldwide confirms lack of hive-colony dependency. Proper insulation applied to standard hives leads to insignificant advantages compared to the enormous influence of pathologies. Consequently, insulation is not a cost effective solution for professional beekeepers. Insulation does not solve the survival problems encountered in cold climates (e.g. Alaska). Furthermore, the attempt to enhance hive insulation and the use of standard hives in very humid climates lead to strong negative effects due to inner condensation/humidity, which increases the colony mortality or causes other pathologies. The honey to brood equivalence is the ratio between the capped wax stores (honey) which a colony requires to build and develop unitary surface of brood. The honey to brood equivalence measures the gross energetic cost of the new generation rearing. Several experiments were performed to measure the honey to brood equivalence; in almost all the cases value corresponding to 1:1 were found. This means that for carrying a full development of 1 dm<sup>2 </sup>of eggs to bees, the colony requires to use 1 dm<sup>2 </sup>of capped stores. For standard hives, the honey to brood equivalence may be also expressed as 0.3 kg_stores/dm<sup>2</sup>_brood. The honey to brood equivalence is considered a biological characteristic of the honeybee species. Pathologies and parasites are substantially not influenced by the hive type. <i>Varroa </i>mite is one of the most dangerous parasites for the honeybee. <i>Varroa </i>spreads in all world hives since late 80, only Australia is today exempted. The <i>Varroa </i>mite development cannot be naturally stopped in western honeybee strains. In absence of the beekeeper contrast, the bee colony collapses in few months to one year. The population dynamic of <i>Varroa </i>mite parasite may be synthesized by the growing ratio. Climatic conditions influence pest diffusion, but again the hive influence is excluded. Wax cell size doesn't affect <i>Varroa </i>mite development. Depending on the location and climate, the <i>Varroa </i>mite can develop with significant yearly variations; the <i>Varroa </i>mite development strongly depends to the bee strain: resistant bees includes Africanized, <i>Cerana, Russian, Monticola</i>, etc. <i>Varroa </i>mite infestation can be experimentally measured in the colony. <i>Varroa </i>mite threshold dangerous infestation is reduced since the last 10 years by a factor of four. Also a small infestation damages the colony because of the continuous virus inoculation. <i>Varroa </i>mite has a relevant impact in colony loss. It is worldwide recognized that a colony cannot survive more than one year without chemical treatment against <i>Varroa </i>mite. On average one to four treatment per year are required. Additionally, a standard colony cannot survive with standard formic treatment only. Given the above, <i>Varroa </i>infestation strongly affects the beekeeper economy. A critical factor is the environmental high influence on the <i>Varroa </i>treatment efficacy. This last factor is a strong limit to the application of formic acid treatment. Formic acid is cost effective and does not develop resistance. Amitraz and fluvalinate are the most effective chemical mite killers, but their efficacy cannot be improved. Alternative solutions are highly expected. As explained, chemical methods are used by all beekeepers to contrast pests. A minor part of beekeepers uses selective methods. Selective methods try to duplicate the bee colonies naturally resistant to pests. Beekeepers, scientists and agriculture organizations dedicate special efforts to this activity without however reaching significant or replicable results. The selection of resistant bees is highly time consuming and costly. Years or decades are required and no success is guaranteed; the success examples cannot be replicated in different geographic areas. Very few success stories regarding the selection of mite resistant bees are worldwide acknowledged. Moreover, the reasons for success are often unclear, and furthermore, success stories were obtained in countries where feral colonies are present and huge distances between apiaries exist.

<li> <para-num num="[0135]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0114" num="0135">A rational hive structure in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is indicated with reference number <b>1</b>. In the various embodiments, same reference numbers refer to the same element. The rational hive structure <b>1</b> comprises a nest comb box <b>2</b> delimiting a brood chamber for bees. In modern hives, the brood chamber is the nursery area where brood at various stages of development—eggs, larvae, and pupae—is located. The nest comb box is generally in the shape of a box defining at its interior the brood chamber. From the structural point of view, the nest comb box <b>2</b> includes a lateral wall <b>3</b> delimiting the inner cavity housing the brood chamber. The inner cavity has a cross-section in a horizontal plane (see e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18</figref>) of polygonal shape, particularly rectangular; the dimension and rectangular elongation are defined by the number and dimensions of the removable comb frames <b>6</b> housed therein (below described in detail). In other embodiments, the inner cavity may have a circular or elliptical cross-section in the horizontal plane. In this respect, the lateral wall <b>3</b> delimiting the inner cavity housing the brood chamber includes four lateral panels <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, <b>3</b> <i>d </i>delimiting a substantially parallelepiped inner cavity. To obtain a reasonable insulation, the lateral wall <b>3</b> has a minimum thickness of about 20 mm, but particularly higher than 30 mm. To the same purpose, the thermal conductivity of the same lateral wall should be low, e.g. lower than 0.3 W/(m·K). The nest comb box <b>2</b> is made therefore of an insulating material, particularly having a low conductivity, such as wood or polyurethane or expanded polymer. In this respect, taking into consideration both the thickness and the thermal conductivity (the higher the thickness, the lower the thermal transmittance), another relevant parameter is the total heat transfer coefficient, which should be lower than 5 W/(m<sup>2</sup>·K), in particular lower than 3.5 W/(m<sup>2</sup>·K) and in even more detail less than 0.5 W/(m<sup>2</sup>·K). To achieve the desired heat transfer coefficient and to control radiation heat exchange, films, layers, painting or other materials can be used to cover and/or paint the inner or external nest. Moreover, to achieve the desired heat transfer, inner natural convection can be improved. In other terms, in the described embodiments, design choice were made to reduce the heat transfer coefficient by working on heat conductivity, radiation and/or natural convection (in particular improving the design in respect to all the above technical features). As shown in the various embodiments, the final shape of the nest comb box <b>2</b> might be different. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a nest comb box <b>2</b> developing vertically: in the upper portion the comb frames <b>6</b> are housed; the lower portion is substantially a hollow space. The wall thickness is constant in correspondence of the upper portion and increases inside the inner cavity from a maximum overall dimension at the lower end of the comb frames <b>6</b> tapering towards a bottom of the hive up to reaching a minimum overall dimension, which remain constant up to the box lower passage. Differently, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a nest comb box <b>2</b> having the lower passage aligned with the lower end of the comb frames <b>6</b>. The box <b>2</b> according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes four flat lateral panels <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, <b>3</b> <i>d </i>delimiting a parallelepiped inner cavity, and opposite lateral panels are constantly parallel one to the other. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (and following embodiments) shows a nest comb box <b>2</b> having (in a first cross-section view) a tapered inner configuration, particularly adapted to match (i.e. counter shaped to) the outer shape of the comb frames <b>6</b>. In this latter configuration, the lateral wall <b>3</b> delimiting the inner cavity housing the brood chamber includes four lateral panels <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, <b>3</b> <i>c</i>, <b>3</b> <i>d </i>delimiting a substantially parallelepiped inner cavity, in which two opposite lateral panels are parallel one another and the other two lateral panels have a thickness increasing on moving from an upper portion of the lateral wall <b>3</b> towards the lower portion of the lateral wall (<b>3</b>). It is noted that the lateral wall <b>3</b> has no holes or cavities for putting into fluid communication the external environment with the inner cavity housing the brood chamber, e.g. neither an entrance for the bees, nor a vent is provided in the lateral wall <b>3</b>. This is in order not to affect the proper thermal insulation of the hive. The exclusive exception is the hive according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, which is specifically designed for extremely warm condition were the external temperature is constantly higher than the requested brood chamber temperature (e.g. desert). In this specific situation, two entrances are provided in the nest comb box <b>2</b>, on opposite panels <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, <b>3</b> <i>d </i>to allow the bees and air to enter the hive. The two entrances define respective tortuous passages to properly direct air into the inner chamber and forcing a ventilation direction through the comb frames; e.g. an upper inlet on one side and a lower inlet at the other side as shown. The nest comb box <b>2</b> is configured to removably house a plurality of comb frames <b>6</b>, in the form of polygonal structures, such as a square structure—<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3A</figref>, a rectangular structure—<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6A</figref>—or a trapezoidal structure—<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9A</figref>, for example. The comb frames <b>6</b> delimit and support the brood comb, which is the beeswax/plastic structure of cells where the queen bee lays eggs. It is the part of the beehive where a new brood is raised by the colony. In general, but not limiting, the comb frame <b>6</b> is in one piece, i.e. the comb frames <b>6</b> are in the form of substantially flat bodies extending in a main plane. Each comb frame includes peripheral element or bars <b>7</b> delimiting an inner comb area <b>8</b> where a comb foundation sheet is placed. Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort, and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger drone cells. It is however noted that not necessarily the comb frame perimeter is completely and fully delimited by peripheral elements/bars. May be that only one upper bar is used which support the comb foundation sheet (or alternatively one upper bar and two lateral bars emerging from the upper bar are present). Additionally (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>b</i> </figref>), it is noted that a comb frame <b>6</b> may be built up combining two semi-comb frames <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>(i.e. bringing one semi-comb frame <b>6</b> <i>a </i>into close contact with the other semi-comb frame <b>6</b> <i>b</i>). In this case, the semi-comb frames <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, <b>6</b> <i>b </i>may be fixedly joined together or not; however, a distance ‘d’ between the lower portion of the upper semi-comb frame <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and the upper portion of the lower semi-comb frame <b>6</b> <i>b </i>should be substantially zero. In other terms, a comb frame is considered a single comb frame <b>6</b>, even if made up of two one or more semi-comb frames, in case there is no gap between the bars, in particular no gap allowing the bees to pass there between. The inner comb area <b>8</b> has an overall one-side dimension of at least 12 dm<sup>2 </sup>to provide sufficient space to the bee nest (correspondingly the overall inner comb area—two sides—of one single comb frame <b>6</b> should be at least 24 dm<sup>2</sup>). In more detail, the inner comb area <b>8</b> of each comb frame <b>6</b> is comprised between 12 and 50 dm<sup>2</sup>, preferentially between 15 and 28 dm<sup>2</sup>, in particular the overall one side dimension of the relevant solutions is about 20 dm<sup>2</sup>. As mentioned, a plurality of comb frames <b>6</b> are housed in parallel in the nest comb box <b>2</b> so that the overall dimension of the inner comb area <b>8</b> sum of all the comb frames <b>6</b> is higher than 100 dm<sup>2</sup>. This is considered a minimum dimension to generate a growing new bee colony. A more relevant range for the overall dimension of the inner comb area <b>8</b> of all the comb frames <b>6</b> is comprised between 150 and 350 dm<sup>2</sup>; in particular the overall dimension of the inner comb area <b>8</b> of all the comb frames <b>6</b> having the best performances is comprised between 200 and 300 dm<sup>2</sup>. To achieve the above areas is necessary to have more than two comb frames <b>6</b> and a reasonable range is included between 3 and 15 frames. The comb frames <b>2</b> are housed into the nest comb box <b>2</b> parallel one with the other, having respective inner comb areas <b>8</b> facing one another. Referring to the enclosed figures, each comb frame <b>6</b> includes four bars <b>7</b> (e.g. made of wood or plastic) connected to each other to define the comb frame (the bars delimit the outer perimeter of the comb frame <b>6</b>); an upper bar <b>7</b> <i>a</i>, generally laying horizontally when the frame <b>6</b> is in use, is connected to a lower bar <b>7</b> <i>b </i>by means of the interposition of two respective lateral bars <b>7</b> <i>c</i>, <b>7</b> <i>d</i>. In certain embodiments, the comb frame may include only three bars, the upper bar <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and the two lateral bars <b>7</b> <i>c</i>, <b>7</b> <i>d</i>. In this latter configuration no lower bar <b>7</b> <i>b </i>is used. In the following description four bars are referred to, however it is intended that the same comb frame configurations are equally included with no lower bar <b>7</b> <i>b </i>(i.e. the lateral bars <b>7</b> <i>c</i>, <b>7</b> <i>d </i>are free at their respective lower portions. Each comb frame <b>6</b> is generally (even if not necessarily) removably housed into the nest comb box <b>2</b>. The upper and the lower bars <b>7</b> <i>a</i>, <b>7</b> <i>b </i>may be substantially parallel to each other as shown in all embodiments. Moreover, the comb frame <b>6</b> is normally symmetric with respect to a vertical axis V. In a first embodiment according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the comb frame <b>6</b> is squared, having the four delimiting bars <b>7</b> <i>a</i>-<b>7</b> <i>d </i>all having substantially the same extension (base B has a length equivalent to the height H). It is noted that the upper bar <b>7</b> <i>a </i>may have emerging sides to be received and housed in corresponding seats of the nest comb box lateral wall so that each comb frame <b>6</b> may be (removably) supported and correctly/precisely positioned in the inner housing. In a more preferred embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6A</figref>, the comb frame is rectangular, with height H longer than the base B; a particularly preferred ratio may include a height H being 0.8B to 3B, particularly 1.5B to 2.2B and specifically twice the base length B (2B=H). The other embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 18</figref> includes a trapezoidal frame <b>6</b>, wherein at least one of the lateral bars <b>7</b> <i>c</i>, <b>7</b> <i>d </i>is inclined with respect to the upper and lower bars <b>7</b> <i>a</i>, <b>7</b> <i>b </i>to define an acute angle α with respect to the lower bar <b>7</b> <i>b</i>; optionally both lateral bars <b>7</b> <i>c</i>, <b>7</b> <i>d </i>are inclined to define respective acute lower angles α, β. As suggested, also just one lateral bar can be inclined. The specific example shows a comb frame having identical acute angles (i.e. α=β); this is only exemplificative and simpler to manufacture. Notably, the angle α and/or β is included in a range between 1° and 15°; a good option is an angle of about 8°. The use of trapezoidal comb frames <b>6</b> allows to further increase the invention advantages because the frame barycenter is moved upward to warmer nest regions, increasing the fraction of the brood surface resident in highest brood temperature range. In this respect, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows the brood temperature versus the brood surface in a rational hive according to the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (rectangular frame). As can be seen, most of the brood surface is included between 30 and 34° C., which represents an exemplificative optimum temperature range for bee development in the climate conditions were the test was run. Notably, accordingly to scientific studies (Tautz J, Maier S, Groh C, Roessler W, Brockmann A.—Behavioral performance in adult honey bees is influenced by the temperature experienced during their pupal development) even small temperature variations of 0.5° have a relevant impact in the quality and vitality of the new born bee. Contrary, the brood temperature versus the brood surface in a rational hive according to prior art hives has a distribution of the type shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, where the most of the brood surface is about 26° C. (the lower limit for bee incubation). The temperature distribution (isothermal contour) inside a standard hive (in deep nest and vertical double deep) is far from being optimized. The gradient of the brood is considerable and the distance between the isothermal lines is extremely small. The brood is layered over the combs at the incubation acceptance range (from 26° to 36°) and the most part of the brood surface is set into the lower temperature range (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>—surface to brood temperature of known hives). The trapezoidal frame (e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) allows to move the frame barycenter upwards and increases the brood surface with higher temperature. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows the brood temperature versus the brood surface in a rational hive according to the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As can be immediately seen, the 80% of the brood surface is at 34° C. and the rest of the brood surface is higher than 28° C. The brood nest is in the perfect situation for incubation and in the maximum brood acceptable range. In other terms, in the invention configuration, the temperature is stratified (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 7A</figref>) with large space between isothermal lines. The major part of the brood is set into the maximal brood acceptable range (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>); the use of the trapezoidal optimized frame allows to set the major part of the brood surface into the maximal temperature range, (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) also for large brood deposition areas (300 dm<sup>2</sup>). Comparison between the resultant surface/temperature (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B, 4A and 7A</figref>) synthetizes the effect of the hive over the brood incubation temperature. Moving back to trapezoidal comb frames <b>6</b>, the middle height (H/2) divides the frame into two regions, namely an upper area <b>8</b> <i>a </i>and a lower area <b>8</b> <i>b </i>of different surface. The ratio between the upper surface (with respect to the middle frame height) and the lower surface can be calculated and optimized. The ratio may be seen as an indication of the advantage obtained to enhance the brood surface temperature with respect to a rectangular frame. A ratio between the upper area <b>8</b> <i>a </i>and the lower area <b>8</b> <i>b </i>of the inner comb area <b>8</b> should be at least 1.05 and optionally at least 1.12 or greater. As previously mentioned, the comb frames <b>2</b> are housed into the nest comb box <b>2</b> parallel one with the other and having the respective inner comb areas <b>8</b> facing one another. The comb frames <b>2</b> lay vertically when in use in side by side relationship (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example). A distance between a middle vertical plane of one comb frame <b>6</b> and a middle vertical plane of an adjacent comb frame <b>6</b> is substantially constant and included between 28 and 35 mm. This allows the bees to build the cells and to keep a sufficient space to move between the frames (e.g. about 8-12 mm once the cells are built, this is the well know bee-space concept). A distance between a middle vertical plane of one comb frame and the lateral wall <b>3</b> of the nest comb box is substantially constant, too and included between 18 and 24 mm to allow the bees to build the cells on the frame side and then to pass in the remaining space. Also a distance between a lateral bar <b>7</b> <i>c</i>; <b>7</b> <i>d </i>of the bars <b>7</b> of each of the comb frames <b>6</b> and a lateral panel <b>3</b> <i>a</i>; <b>3</b> <i>b</i>; <b>3</b> <i>c</i>; <b>3</b> <i>d </i>of the box <b>2</b> should be substantially constant and included between 8 and 12 mm. This prevents that combs are built between the frames <b>6</b> and the box <b>2</b>, but allows the bees to move there between. The rational hive structure <b>1</b> additionally comprises a top cover <b>4</b> located in an upper portion of the hive structure to close an upper access to the hive structure itself. In certain embodiments (e.g. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 7, 10 and 16</figref>) the top cover <b>4</b> directly closes the upper passage; no holes or cavities for putting into fluid communication the external environment with the inner cavity housing the brood chamber are present in the top cover <b>4</b> and/or between the top cover and the lateral wall <b>3</b>. During summer, when external temperature is higher than the internal temperature of the brood chamber, in case of honey supers including a lot of honey, a small hollow might be exceptionally left (e.g. in the top cover). This small hollow does not allow bees to fly through and the bees may close it with wax if they consider it proper. The top cover <b>4</b> may have an overall thickness of at least 10 mm, in particular of at least 20 mm and more in particular of at least 40 mm to provide proper thermal insulation. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the top cover <b>4</b> is box shaped to include a closed air chamber <b>15</b> confined between top and bottom panels <b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b </i>and lateral wall panels <b>4</b> <i>c</i>. Of course, the top cover <b>4</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be used in anyone of the other disclosed embodiments. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 13</figref> show a hive including at least one honey super <b>9</b> placed in correspondence of the upper passage of the nest comb box <b>2</b>. A honey super consists of a box <b>10</b> in which e.g. 8-10 frames <b>11</b> are hung. Standard or customized geometry of the super frame can be used. Western honeybees collect nectar and store the processed nectar in honeycomb, which they build on the frames. When the honeycomb is full, the bees will reduce the moisture content of the honey to 12-18% moisture content before capping the comb with beeswax. Beekeepers will take the full honey supers and extract the honey. The box <b>10</b> has no holes or cavities for putting into fluid communication the external environment with an inner cavity of the box itself. More than one honey super may be used. In this configuration, the top cover <b>4</b> directly closes an upper part of the box <b>10</b>, and in particular no holes or cavities for putting into fluid communication the external environment with the inner cavity housing the brood chamber are present in the top cover <b>4</b> and/or between the top cover and the box <b>10</b>. The rational hive structure according to the described embodiments, further comprises a bottom case <b>12</b> placed below the nest comb box <b>2</b>; generally, though not essentially, the nest comb box and the bottom case <b>12</b> are separate and distinct elements, which may be coupled in use. Bottom case <b>12</b> comprises a respective auxiliary lateral wall <b>13</b> delimiting a bottom cavity (also the bottom case may be in tubular form); in use condition, the comb frames <b>6</b> are preferably not housed in the bottom cavity (see all figures), however, the bottom case <b>12</b> is into fluid communication with the nest comb box <b>2</b>. With the exclusion of the previously described embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> (having a closed bottom case/bottom cavity), the bottom case <b>12</b> comprises a bee entrance <b>14</b>. The bee entrance <b>14</b>, for example in the form of an elongated horizontal slot (of height about 8-16 mm, and preferably 12 mm), is at a distance D, in particular a vertical distance, from the comb frames <b>6</b> of at least 15 mm. The specified minimum distance has the aim to allow a proper air recirculation inside the hive. As indicated in all the figures, the distance is a vertical distance between the entrance <b>14</b> upper profile and a lower bar <b>7</b> <i>d </i>of the comb frames <b>6</b>. The distance D is less than 200 mm and particularly the distance is at least 100-120 mm. The bee hive entrance <b>14</b> can be also alternatively shaped as duct or suitable shape. The entrance <b>14</b> is in the direction of the plurality of lateral bars of one side of the comb frames <b>6</b>, i.e. the comb frames extend away from the bee hive entrance and the slot is transversal to the main plane of each comb frame <b>6</b>. This is only optional: the bee hive entrance <b>14</b> may be parallel to the main plane of each comb frame <b>6</b>. Finally, the hive structure includes a lower closure element <b>5</b>, which closes the lower passage of the auxiliary lateral wall <b>3</b>. The lower closure element <b>5</b> may be separate from and a distinct element with respect to the bottom case <b>12</b>, or the two elements may be made in a single piece depending on the design needs. The lower closure accept the mite inspection board and an eventual net to allow ventilation and transportation.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0137]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0116" num="0137">The described hive structure makes the difference with respect to the hive according to the prior art. The inventors applied to the honey bee colony and the hive a completely new approach and novelties are here indicated. The inventors demonstrated the honey to brood equivalence is not an biological characteristic of the honeybee species: the honey to brood equivalence is related to the hive parameters and the local climatic conditions. It was demonstrated that the honey to brood of standard hives can be largely modified by the criteria at the basis of the invention. Literature describes the colony rearing depending to bee average life or to pathologies or to intrinsic behaviors; however, according to prior art, the colony status was considered not to be related to the hive. The authors linked the population growth to the colony and hive interaction, highlighting the more sensitive physical and configuration parameters. The colony growing exponent is explicitly dependent to the hive dissipation, and it also depends to the hive geometrical parameters. Another important inventor intuition is that the brood temperature is dependent from the hive characteristics. In standard hive: the bees work opposing the physical constraint of the standard hive and they can barely adapt to it. The bees rise the new generations at the lowest temperature range, as the last chance to survive in a very inefficient hive. The brood temperature is far to be optimal for bee synthesis because of the high brood surface at lower temperature (cold brood). Moreover, cold brood leads to a degenerative process producing weaker generations of bees. Differently, the invention allows the colony to manage the brood temperature and rise the new generation at the highest brood temperature range, resulting in better biological bee synthesis. The described critical hive configuration allows optimal temperature control by the bees themselves. The effects are:</div>

An optimal temperature control means that the bees can continuously (in time-seasons) set the temperature within a nest distribution (volume, gradient) not possible to be observed in standard hives. Because of the relation bee quality-temperature and because of other new phenomenon (e.g. the process to raise a new queen by the colony), the colony status follows divergent trajectories once reared in standard or optimized hive. In a short observation time (month/seasons), the colony develops faster with large population and lower honey consumption. During several seasons (years) observation, the colony becomes more resistant to parasites and pathologies, exhibiting a further increase of the surplus capability and a strong reduction in treatment requirement and parasites infestation reduction. The long term effect of the optimized hive is the stability-survivability of the bee stocks respect the continuous decay or the stocks managed into standard hives. The effects of the hive structure are due to the optimal temperature control of the honey bee colony. With the optimal temperature control the inventors noted the following new effects:</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0146]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0125" num="0146">1. The possibility to maintain the brood temperature with low thermal dissipation produces more brood for unit of honey consumed. The honey to brood is not constant, and leads to more population production while reducing the bee work, and increasing the flying bee number (population split). The particular shape of the optimized hive allows to extend the brood surface into the best temperature range with less thermal cost (trapezoid-like frames or upper barycentric frame). This leads to enhance brood surface rearing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0147]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0126" num="0147">2. The characteristics of the hive allows to generate an inner air stratification, almost isothermal, at the optimal bee temperature. This temperature distribution (power/volume/gradient) is intrinsically due to the optimized hive characteristics. This temperature distribution is obtained by the bees (or without the bees by eventually placing a heater into the hive) and origins the long term colony improvement and is one of the factors reducing the mite growing ratio.</div>

The temperature gradient at steady state into the nest can be measured during the k measurement. The hive is maintained in operative configuration, preserving the inner air ducts geometry due to the combs or hive structure. A thermal power is imposed to the nest surface, obtaining a steady state thermal field with a measured environmental temperature difference. The provided necessary thermal power, as well as the nest temperature field, are then measured with an adequate number of inner sensors, so obtain the nest equivalent brood surface at the incubation temperature. Using the above equation and the measure of S, ΔT, and W, it is possible to calculate k. In standard hive the measure is repeated considering the maximal brood surface S=220 dm<sup>2 </sup>and it is compared with the dissipation according to hives of the invention with the identical brood surface S. In case the radiator cannot maintain the range of bee incubation, the portion of the surface at incubation temperature is measured. Efficiency is 1/k (bee effect proportionality) and is proportional to the invention benefits. Invention benefits are found in case of values lower than a specific k. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> discloses the difference in terms of thermal performances between a Dadant wood hive of the prior art and a hive according to embodiments of the present invention. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> it is depicted the heat power for unit of brood area and unit of temperature difference in standard and PrimalBee System hive during a transient thermal cycle. The inventors understood that the benefits to the bee colony may be achieved in case the rational hive structure presents a hive thermal dissipation parameter less than 0.00600 [W/(dm<sup>2</sup>·° C.)]; in particular the hive thermal dissipation parameter should be less than 0.005 [W/(dm<sup>2</sup>·° C.)], measured at 26° C. of imposed temperature difference.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0212]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0182" num="0212">The field test consisted into an experimental comparison of the honey bee colony response to the growth into the standard hive vs optimized hive (i.e. according to described embodiments of the invention). Multiple field tests were carried out considering different climatic regions and hive configurations. The field tests were so implemented. Two groups of 10 hives each, standard and optimized, were prepared. The initial colonies were as much identical as possible, considering strains, supplier, population, infestation. An identical managing protocol, including chemical treatments, nutrition, etc. was decided. The two hive groups were placed into the same environment. Honey bee colony and parasite brood and population were measured for two years. A long term observation was required to obtain a first full development of the both groups. The measure were made with objective methods, considering automatic bee flight counter, pictures of the nest and further computing of the bees over the combs and brood extension.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0223]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0198" num="0223">The described hive structures positively affect the colony population dynamics (unlikely to occur with standard hives). The positive influences are substantially obtained in any climatic region. The colony overall population may increase with respect to the standard hive up to three times. Moreover, increase of the overall population is seen in all seasons, as well as increase of foragers bee population. Increase of the brood surface in respect to standard colonies with identical population was observed. Increase of the maximal season brood surface and increase of the brood surface was achieved in any time during the season. The optimized hive provided increased robustness of the brood to suddenly temperature drops. Novelty in literature, brood surfaces in hives according to the invention were experimentally measured up to 300 dm<sup>2</sup>. The optimized hive provided increased possibility to produce artificial swarms and extension of the replication period. Indeed, a larger colony population, a reduced mortality and infestation, with faster build up, and a less overall work for the colony the invention allow to reproduce artificial swarms at a highest ratio 8:1. The optimized hive provided modification of the ratio between bees into the nest and flying bees in favor of the flying bees and a natural modification of the ratio between drones and workers at favor of workers. Presence of drones into the colony also in winter could be observed, (overwintering drones in cold climates—no brood). The bee population increases the surplus and pollination capability and the fly activity by extension of the daily flight hours, increase of the flight intensity, increase of the flight speed. Increased surplus capability was recorded in cold and extreme climates (mountain regions, northern climates, etc.), too. Additionally, reduced surplus consumption due to quick climatic changes was obtained. The hive caused a huge reduction in <i>Varroa </i>mite growing ratio (80:1 as field test data) and higher resistance other pests (e.g. fungus, etc.), increased colony resistance to <i>Varroa </i>mite at short term and further increase in long term. High reduction of mite infestation in drone cells was achieved and no drone cell cutting required as <i>Varroa </i>managing strategy. At the same time, a stronger colony has major defensive attitude against small beetle or <i>Vespa velutina </i>or other predators. A reduction of artificial nutrition consequent to higher surplus income and due to the higher optimized hive efficiency was observed. High reduction (i.e. disappearing) of robbery between colonies with high population differences as a consequence of increased pollen stores into the colony was obtained. Managing time and cost were significantly reduced and new managing techniques become possible, in particular managing of the colony with formic acid only. In other terms, strong reduction in chemical requirement, both in frequency and quantity, with respect practice/literature is necessary with possibility to migrate to pure chemical free. This additionally allowed increased formic acid efficacy against <i>Varroa </i>mite. The colonies response to parasite and colonies performances were improved due to bee breed differences obtained by highly reducing time and efficacy of the selection. When a number of hives according to the described embodiments is managed properly, the mentioned advantages manifest through time (years) with a continuous and progressive performance (parasites and super) improvement. The improvement is due to the automatic increase of the genetic quality of the colony. The invention also increased colony strength to extreme climates, with increased capability to over wintering in cold climates, increased colony strength to strong temperature variations while brood is present, superior spring build up, increased survivability to forage less periods, adaptability to extreme climates regions and adaptability to high temperature regions. A strong reduction of colony loss in short and long term period was observed with major colony strength to transportation stress and reduction in transportation mortality. The improvement management of the optimal temperature range inside the hive results in an extension of the warm brood surface into the nest and through time (night-day-seasons), a decrease of the temperature gradient, a reduced nest temperature variability due to environmental causes, a better stratification of the nest temperature and a larger distance between isothermal lines. Thereby those other effects were observed: less bees than usual can better control the internal hive temperature, large portion of brood uncovered by bees in healthy and populated colonies and less brood contamination by the mites was obtained. Finally, a modification of the honey to brood equivalence in favor of the colony was possible. A strong colony reduced the incubation time, increased bee work capability, obtained better protein synthesis in larva and pupa and increased capability to build wax combs during the all seasons (Beeswax comb build up was observed in winter time in north Italy).</div>
