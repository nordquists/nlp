<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">Isolation between electrodes is ensured to enhance resistance to a liquid. A conductive film is provided to a surface of a piezoelectric substrate, and laser processing is performed in a groove extending direction on the conductive film between a first groove and a second groove provided to the piezoelectric substrate to thereby form a laser processing area where the conductive film is removed to the surface of the piezoelectric substrate between the first groove and the second groove. In forming the laser processing area, an irradiation operation with a laser is performed along a plurality of laser processing lines extending in the groove extending direction. Further, the irradiation operation with the laser is performed a plurality of times for each of the laser processing lines, and the irradiation operations with the laser performed along the same laser processing line of the plurality of laser processing lines are performed at a time interval from when ending a previous irradiation operation with the laser to when starting a subsequent irradiation operation with the laser.</div>

The liquid jet head is provided with a head chip, and in the liquid jet recording device equipped with the liquid jet head, a liquid is jetted toward the recording target medium via the head chip, and the image, the character, or the like is recorded on the recording target medium.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In manufacturing the actuator plate, it is desirable to ensure a sufficient distance between the electrodes to which respective voltage different from each other are applied. There is seen a phenomenon that as the number of times of jet operation, namely the number of times of drive of the actuator plate, increases, separation or breakage occurs in a protective film and so on provided to a surface of the actuator plate, and the liquid infiltrates into the protective film and so on. When the infiltration of the liquid progresses, the liquid acts as a bridge to cause short circuit between the electrodes in some cases.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">The short circuit between the electrodes can be caused not only by the liquid which infiltrates into the protective film and so on and acts as the bridge, but also by the liquid becoming in the state (e.g., a mist state) in which the liquid can be transmitted through the protective film and so on. Further, there is a tendency that the closer to each other the electrodes adjacent to each other are located, the earlier such short circuit occurs. The fact that the distance should be ensured between the electrodes similarly applies to the manufacture of the actuator plate using the laser processing.</div>

In the first embodiment, when the number of times of jetting of the ink <b>9</b>, in other words, the number of times of driving of the actuator plate <b>411</b>, increases, the separation or the breakage occurs in the protective film provided to the surface of the actuator plate <b>411</b> or the piezoelectric substrate <b>411</b>Z, which progresses as the number of times of jetting further increases. With the progression of such a separation or the like, the ink <b>9</b> infiltrates into the protective film and so on, and then the ink <b>9</b> acts as a bridge to cause the short circuit between the electrodes Edc, Eda adjacent to each other in some cases. According to the present embodiment, since the sufficient distance is ensured between the electrodes Edc, Eda adjacent to each other, even when the separation or the breakage occurs in the protective film and so on, and then the separation or the breakage progresses, it is possible to prevent the ink <b>9</b>, in particular water-based ink, retained in the ejection groove C<b>1</b> <i>e </i>from infiltrating into the protective film and so on and then reaching the electrode Eda in the non-ejection groove C<b>1</b> <i>d </i>to cause the short circuit between the electrodes Edc, Eda.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0089]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, the short circuit between the electrodes Edc, Eda can be caused not only by the ink <b>9</b> infiltrating into the protective film and so on in which the separation or the breakage occurs and acting as the bridge, but also by the ink <b>9</b> becoming in the state (e.g., a mist state) in which the ink <b>9</b> can be transmitted through the protective film and so on. According to the present embodiment, since the sufficient distance is ensured between the electrodes Edc, Eda, the ink <b>9</b> in the mist state is prevented from being transmitted through the protective film and so on to form the bridge between the electrodes Edc, Eda. Therefore, the present embodiment makes a contribution to the inhibition of the short circuit between the electrodes Edc, Eda even when neither the separation nor the breakage occurs in the protective film and so on.</div>

However, on the other hand, since the irradiation range (e.g., the irradiation range R<b>1</b>) determined with respect to the same laser processing line is continuously affected by the heat due to the continuous irradiation with the laser, a high thermal stress is applied to the member (i.e., the piezoelectric substrate <b>411</b>Z) removed at the same time as the metal film, and a defect such as a lack occurs in the piezoelectric substrate <b>411</b>Z. Therefore, there is a possibility of increasing the variation in capacitance in the actuator plate <b>411</b>. When the variation in capacitance is increased in such a manner, it is concerned that the ejection of the ink is made unstable. Further, by the fact itself that the defect such as a lack occurs in the piezoelectric substrate <b>411</b>Z, it is also concerned that an undesigned ink infiltration path through the defect is formed, or that the adhesiveness of the adhesive or the protective film and so on with respect to the piezoelectric substrate <b>411</b>Z is deteriorated.
