<div class="description-paragraph">Patented Nov. 16, 1943 METHOD OF 'MAKINGTEAR. STRIP wnnrrnas Wilhelm B. Bronander, Montclair, N. J. I Application February 20, 1940, Serial No. 319,826 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2 Claims. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates to improvements in wrapping machine and method for fastening a. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">tear strip on the inside of a wrapper, without wrinkling same, and in such a manner that one end of the tear strip is projecting out from the similar material, but considerably stronger and usually of a different color is glued to the inside of the wrapper whereby the same may be easily torn oil. In the older types of such packages, see U. S. Patent No. 2,008,361, the tear strip extends only as far as the wrapper. The wrapper and tear strip are cut at one point and the resulting tab must extend over an edge of the package to make it possible to obtain a grip on same with the fingers. This type has several disadvantages especially for larger packages of various shapes. The new method eliminates these disadvantages by placing the tab on one side of the article and by devising a new way of cutting and glueingwhereby the tear strip extends beyond the wrapper. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> An important object of this invention is to provide means on a wrapping machine whereby the tear strip is automatically glued to the wrapper except near the end where it is cut off. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A further object of this invention is to provide a method of gluing the tear strip to the wrapper without producing fine wrinkles in the thin material of the wrapper. 1 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Still another object of the invention is to provide a method and means of cutting the wrapping material and the tear strip in such a way that a short tab of the tear strip will project outside the wrapper after this has been sealed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Other objects and advantages of my invention will be apparent during the course of the following description, </div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Figure 14 is an end view of same, and, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figures 15 and 16 represent, respectively, an end view and side view of the first cutter. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the drawings, wherein for the purpose 01' lllustration, is shown a'preferred embodiment of my invention, the numeral I'l designates the sheet of wrapping material, usually called the paper, coming on a reel ill, see Fig. 1. The wrapping material I1 is' ordinarily cellophane or similar cellulose acetate material. 'From reel la the pa? per [1 goes under roll I9 and then passes upward over roll 20 down between roll 2| and 22 and past roll 23 with cutter 24. The tear strip, or ribbon 25 comes from reel 26, goes over roll 21, through the tension device 28, over the solvent wick 29, over the solvent evaporator 30 and from thereon to roll." where it is glued on top of the paperl'l. The tear. strip 25 is also usually a cellulose acetate material similar, except as to color, to the wrapping material H. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A cutter 3| revolving on shaft 32 is arranged to out a substantially H-shaped cut in the paper [1, see'Fig. 2. The shaft 32 is geared to roll 20* and the cutter 3| thus makes one cut for every revolution of 20. The diameter of the roll 20 thus governs the length of each sheet of the wrapper. The cutter 3| cuts the lines a--d and b-c indicated in dotted lines in Fig. 2. A cut ting knife 33 which is fastened in a recess in roll 20 cuts the line e-f, in Fig. 2, see also Figures 4, 5 and 6. Figure 4 shows the roll 20 in the cutting position with the cutter 3| having finished the cut. The two tongues 34 and 35 formed between the cuts w--e-f-b and d--e-f-c are then pressed into the recess 36 in roll 20 by the cutter 3|. Due to the bending and wedging of the ends of the tongues 34 and 35 against the knife 33 and due to the springiness of the material I the tongues 34 and 35 are held in recess 36 while the paper II passes around roll 20, and the ribbon 25 is thus not glued to the tongues 34 and 35. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The roll 23 and the cutter 24 are geared to roll 20 and at the appropriate moment the cutter 24 cuts off the finished wrapping sheet. This second cut is made along line g-h, i-g' and Ic-l in Figure 2. For the purpose of clearly illustrating the procedure the lines g-h, i-i and k-Z are shown as double lines to distinguish same from the first cut which is shown in dotted lines. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is im ortant to note that the knife 24 may be adjusted so as to out only the ribbon 25 in the line 1 -4, if desired. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The ribbon 25 being now glued to the sheet, except to tongues 34 and 35 is also out along line #4 thus leaving a short free end 31 projecting beyond the paper II. In Figure 3 is shown a wrapped carton where the arrangement of the tear strip is clearly illustrated. y </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In Figures 8 and 9 is illustrated the construction of roll 20 which consists of three separate parts 20-a, 20-h and 20-0. ,These parts are joined on a common shaft and'are held in angular relationship by the dowel 38. The part 20-2) is further shown in Figures 10 and 11. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">slot 33 for knife 33 milled radially in the bottom of the recess 36. A set screw 40 holds knife 33 in position. The recess 36 may be placed at various positions in relation to parts 20-a and 20-0 by placing dowel 33 in any one of the holes 4| thus insuring longer wear of the cutting edges a-c and bc on parts 20a and 20-c, respectively. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">, Figures and 16 illustrate thecutter 3|. This cutter is mounted in shaft 32 by the shank 42 2 -4 of the cutter 24 and-the cut pierces both the ribbon 25 and the paper II. The length of the tab 31 is thus governed by the position at which the cutter 24 becomes operative and it is furthermore governed by the width of the overlap of the wrapper, as shown in Fig. 3. To obtain an airtight seal it is obviously necessary that the cut i-j should be located in such a manner as to bethoroughly covered by the overlap of the other end of the wrapper I! as indicated in Fig. 3, and it must of necessity be placed under the glued portion of the overlap and can not be under the loose flap 34. This is clearly evident by inspecting the two ends of the wrapper I! as illustrated in Fig. 7. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another important improvement is to be found in the method of gluing the ribbon to the paper so as not to wrinkle the latter. The paper is usually much thinner than the ribbon and when the two faces are softened by the solvent and glued together the unequal contraction of the two surfaces will produce small wrinkles on the paper along both sides of the ribbon. To eliminate this difficulty a new method of gluing has The re-. cess 35 is made in the face of the disc with the the ribbon before it touches the paper and the side of the ribbon which is to be glued to the paper stays soft and sticky until it is joined with the paper. No solvent is thus carried to the paper. The paper, therefore, does not expand and can not wrinkle. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The operation of my invention is obvious from the foregoing description. The cutter 3| makes the first cut in the shape of a letter H as shown in dotted lines in Fig. 2. The tongues 34 and 35 stay in recess 36,- as described supra, and do not become glued to ribbon 25 when passing over the roll 20. When the paper arrives at roll 23 the second cut is made by cutter 24. This cut leaves the tab 31 of the ribbon 25 free and projecting out from the wrapper as shown in Fig. 3. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is to be understood that the form of my invention, herewith shown and described, is to be taken as a preferred example of the same, and that various changes in the shape, size, and arrangement of parts may be resorted to, without departing from the spirit of my invention, or the scope of the subjoined claims. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Having thus described my invention I claim: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1. A method of making a tear strip wrapper of the character described in which a narrow continuuos ribbon of cellulose acetate material, forming the tear strip, is joined with a wider'continsubjecting one side of the tear strip to the action of a solvent, heating same and evaporating the solvent before joining the two strips; making a H-shaped perforation in the wider strip, causing the tongues formed by the H to be held away from the surface plane of the wrapper strip while joining the two strips, the tear strip being located centrally between the two vertical cuts of the H, and finally cutting the wrapper transversely near the horizontal bar of the H while cutting the tear strip at a distance away governed by the width of .the overlap of the wrapper, thereby producing a free tab of the tear strip extending outside the wrapper. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 2. A method of making a tear strip wrapper of the character described in which a narrow continuous ribbon of soluble material, forming the tear strip, is joined with a wider continuous ribbon of similar material, forming the wrapper, and comprising the following steps: straightening and tensioning said tear strip; softening one face of said tear strip by the action of a solvent; heating and evaporating said solvent before the tear strip is joined to the wrapper; cutting an H-shaped perforation in the wrapper; causing the tongues formed by the H to be held away from the surface plane of the wrapper' strip while joining the two strips; locating said tear strip centrally between the two vertical cuts of the H, and cutting the wrapper transversely near the horizontal bar of the H while cutting the tear strip at a distance away governed by the width of the overlap of the wrapper, thereby producing a free tab extending outside the wrapper. </div>
