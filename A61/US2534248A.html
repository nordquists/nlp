<div class="description-paragraph"> It is of course to be understood that the c -s'pringsof both sets may be put under initiefi mid various" compressions by means" of the 23djusti'ng; wedges 'or' otherwise, even to the; extent tnet s rings" 38' and 38* will he p111; under sueh eompiessi'on that the stroke of tl ie'1filun'ger"35 end-eonsequenfiy' the magnitude of-the movementor thepmng'er'will be limited. When only thes-spi ings ta ema are pl'ae'ed unfier' imam compression, and while the plunger is in its inactive position, the ends of the c-springs 38 and 38' will be slightly spaced from the adjacent faces of the wedge shaped ends 36 and 31 of this plunger 35 and the ends of .the c-springs 39 and 39' will be spaced from the adjacent faces of the wedge shaped ends 36 and 31 of the plunger a slightly less distance. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the plunger 35 moves in one of the reciprocating element which, is. attached to the member 34, the wedge shaped ends 36 or 31, as the case may be, separate the ends of the adjacent C-springs 40 or 40' against their resistance and will, after sufficient travel, contact the ends of the next adjacent C-springs 39 or 39 direction or the other under the influence of the" movement 4 34 be located vertically or horizontally and the other parts in their relative relationship, at the end of the movement against one of the retarders, the springs thereof tend gradually to urge the plunger and its load in the opposite direction, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">thus greatly shortening the period of rest between reciprocations. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">- We claim: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1. In a shock absorber, two relatively reciprocable elements, two nests of 'C-springs carried by one of said elements and arranged in spaced relation to eachother with spaces between the ends of said springs facing each other, each said nest comprising a plurality of independently acting C-springs arranged with their axes substantially parallel, a plunger carried by the other of and meeting the resistance of these springs andv operating against the same, will increasingly separate the ends thereof as the plunger continues its movement. Upon the further movement of the plunger the next C-springs- 38.38 will be engaged and, meeting the resistance of these springs and operating against it, will increasingly separate the ends thereof as the plunger con.- tinues its movement. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Thus the movement of the reciprocating'part which is attached to the bolt 34 will be cushioned and ultimately arrested by a series of elements. There are shown and described three G-springs, but a greater or lesser number may be used or the retarder may take other forms for successively and gradually increasing the resistance to take care-of variable dynamic impact loads. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It will be realized that when the adjustable wedges 45 and 4! are used the position of the springs 38, 33' and 40' will be shifted in respect of the housing in which they aremounted, while the positions of thee-springs 38, 39 and 40 will not be shifted. However, the sets of springs will bear the same relation to the plunger in any of the adjusted positions of the springs because the plunger will be shifted simultaneously along with the load to which it is attached. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In other words, regardless of the adjustment of the C-springs 38', 39 and 40', this set of springs and their counterparts 38, 39 and 40, will always exert, either initially or during the-reciprocating action of the load, equal forces on the plunger. r </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is of course to be understood that the resistance of the elements of each retarder may be varied to vary the effective operation of one retarder in respect to the other or the effective operation of one retarder element in relation to the corresponding element of the other retarder may be varied. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is here pointed out that after one set of springs or retarder elements, or any thereof, have been put under compression by the movement of the plunger 35, they will exert a reactant force on the plunger with the result that the pe-' riod of rest between changes of direction of motion of the plunger with its load will greatly be said elements and having cam shaped ends, means for securing said plunger to said carrying element" in position to pass between the ends of said C-springs or said nests upon the relative reciprocation of said elements and to successively forcibly engage the said ends of the springs of each nest. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 2. The combination of elements recited-in claim 1 wherein the cam shaped ends of said plunger are in the form of wedges. I </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 3. The combination of elements recited in claim 1 wherein the cam shaped ends of said plunger are in the form of wedges and the ends of the innermost spring of each nest are spaced closer together than the ends of another spring. 4. The combination of elements recited in the innermost spring of each nest are spaced closer together than the ends of another spring of said nest and. the resistance of the latter spring is greater than that of the innermost spring. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 5. In a. shock absorber, two relatively reciprocable elements, a plurality of C-shaped springs carried by one of said reciprocable elements and arranged in nested relation with their ends separated and the openings between said ends in register, the axes of said springs being substan tially parallel, means constructed and arranged to support said springs for independent action each ofthe other, and a plunger carried by the other 'of said reciprocable elements and having a wedge shaped end adapted to enter the spaces between the ends of said springs and to. successively-force the ends of. said springs. apart. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 6. The combination of elements recited .in claim 5 wherein the plunger is pivotally mounted for movement on an axis substantially parallel to the axis of said springs. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 7. The combination of elements recited .in claim 5 wherein the successive springs arelof different degrees of resistance. H </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 8. The combination of elements recited-in claim 5 wherein the plunger ispivotally mounted for movement on an axis substantially parallel to the axis of said springs and the successive spring are of different degrees of resistance. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' 9. In a shock absorber two relatively reciprocable element, a-plurality of C-springs having spaced ends with the openings therebetween in register each with the other, said springs being arranged in nested relation with their axes substantially parallel, means for supporting said springs for independent action each of the other. a second set of a plurality of o-springs arranged in nested relation with their axes substantially parallel and having their'ends spaced each from the other with the spaces between said ends in register each with the other and facing the spaces between the springs of the first mentioned set, a plunger mounted upon the other of said elements for movement therewith and having wedge-shaped ends adapted to alternately enter the spaces between the ends of the springs of each set, and means for adjusting one set of springs as a unit to vary the distance between the two sets of springs. </div>
