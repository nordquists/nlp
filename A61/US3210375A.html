Filed July 10, 1964, Ser. No. 381,884 Claims priority, application Switzerland, Sept. 10, 1959, 78,068/59 3 Claims. (Cl. 260-3405) This is a continuation-in-part of our application Ser. No. 54,581, filed September 8, 1960, now Patent No. 3,072,678, issued January 8, 1963. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The present invention provides new acetals which contain at least two epoxide groups and correspond to the in which X, .and X each represent a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; Z represents an organic radical containing at least one epoxide group; H. is a small whole number, and Y represents the radical of .a polyhydric alcohol with 20 free valences and, when n=l, the radical Y must contain at least one epoxide group. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The new acetals are obtained by the present process when: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> (A) An acetal, which contains at least one epoxidizable group, of the formula --in which X X and n have the same meanings as in Formula I; Z represents an organic radical which contains at least one epoxide group or an epoxidizable group; and Y represents the radical of a polyhydric alcohol with 2n free valences and, when n='1, the radical Y must contain at least one epoxide group or epoxidizable groups-As treated with an epoxidizing agent; or </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> (B) n Mols of a compound of the formula Z.OH are added on to one mol of an unsaturated acetal of the formula- Y CHO=CH Ii l l l -0 X1 X2 (III) Hi) I IaI (in which Hal represents a halogen atom), such as a ,8- methyl-glycerol-ot-monochlorohydrin radical or a glycerol a-monochlorohydrin radical. As is known, such a halohydrin group can likewise be converted into a 1:2 epoxide group by treatment with a dehydrohalogenating agent. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The acetals of the Formula II or III to be used as starting materials in the present process are obtained most 3,210,375 Patented Oct. 5, 1965 readily by acetalizing methacrolein or preferably crotonic aldehyde or acrolein with the dialcohol or polyalcohol. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this connection two cases have to be distinguished; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> (1) The polyalcohol used contains as such at least one unsaturated group which can be directly epoxidized in a second stage or after an additive reaction with an alcohol of the formula ZOH or Z'-OH can be converted into an epoxy compound. In this case there may be used polyalcohols containing at least two hydroxyl groups. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> (2) The polyalcohol is free from double bonds, in which case it must contain at least four hydroxyl groups. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In case (1) there may be mentioned as unsaturated polyalcohols, for example: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Butene-(2)-diol-1:4, glycerol monoallyl ether, butanetriol-(1:2:4)-monoallyl ether and the like, furthermore above all dialcoho-ls of the formula (I in which R to R each represent monovalent substituents, such as halogen atoms, alkoxy groups or aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, more especially alkyl radicals with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or hydrogen atoms, wherein R and R together may also represent an alkylene radical, such as a methylene group. As examples of such dialcohols IV there may be mentioned: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1: l-bis-[hydroxymethyl] cyclohexene (3), 1:1 bis- [hydroxymethyl]-6-methylcyclohexene-(3), 1:1-bis [hydroxymethyl]-2:4:6-trimethylcyclohexne (3), 1:1 bis: [hydroxymethyl]-2:5-endomethylene cyclohexene (3) and 1 l-bis- [hydroxymethyl] -4-chlorocyclohexene- (3 In case (2) there may be mentioned as polyalcohols containing at least four hydroxyl groupsthe following: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Erythritol, xylitol, arabitol, sorbitol, mannitol, dulcitol, talitol, iditol, adonitol and pentaerythritol, heptitols, 2121626 tetramethylolcyclohexanol (1); also polyalcohols that additionally contain other functional groups, for example sugars, such as glucose, galactose, mannose, fructose, sucrose and the like; sugar acids such as glucoronic acid, galacturonic acid, mucic acid and the like. Finally, there may be used as polyalcohol a polymer containing free hydroxyl groups, such as a polysaccharide and more especially polyvinyl alcohol or partially hydrolysed polyvinyl acetate. The acetalization may follow the usual pattern and consists for example, in heating an aldehyde of the formula H (V) together with the diol or polyol in the presence of an acid catalyst, such, for example, as hydrochloric or paratoluenesulfonic acid. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This procedure yields at first an unsaturated acetal of the formula Y CPI-0:011 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">I: I 0 X1 X2 11 (VI) To obtain the acetals of the Formula II an alcohol of the formula ZOH is added in a second stage on to the double bond of the unsaturated acetal IV. As a rule, the alcohol Z'-OH contains an epoxidizable group. There may be mentioned chlorohydrin, for example a-methylglycerola-monochlorohydrin, fi-methylglycerolu-monochlorohydrin, glycerol-fi-monochlorohydrin, glycerol-a-bromohydrin and more especially glycerol-Demonochlorohydrin as well as mixtures of such monochlorohydrins, for example the commercial mixture of glycerolfl-monochlorohydriu and glycerol-a-monochlorohydrin; furthermore unsaturated alcohols such as allyl alcohol, crotyl alcohol, octadecenyl alcohol, A -cyclohexanol-1, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">in which R to R each represent monovalent substituents such as halogen atoms, alkoxy groups or aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, more especially lower alkyl groups containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or hydrogen atoms, in which formula R and R together may also constitute an alkylene radical such as a methylene group. As examples of such alcohols VII there may be mentioned: A -tetrahydrobenzyl alcohol, 6- methyl-A -tetrahydrobenzyl alcohol, 2 :4 6-trimethyl-A tetrahydrobenzyl alcohol, 1:5-endomethylene-M-tetrahydrobenzyl alcohol and 4-chloro-A -tetrahydrobenzyl alcohol. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> When the unsaturated acetal VI is derived from an unsaturated polyol (n in Formula VI is preferably=1), x mols (x=not a whole number) of such an acetal can be added on to 1 mol of a polyhydroxy compound containing x hydroxyl groups. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As such polyhydroxy compounds there are suitable above all aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diols or polyols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, propanediol, polypropyleneglycols, butanediol, pentanediol, hexanediol; glycerol, 1:1:1-trimethylolpropane, sorbitol, mannitol, pentaerythritol; quinitol, resorcitol. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> This procedure gives rise to epoxidizable acetals, for example of the type (Gzradical of the diol) that is to say that the radical Z in Formula II is a radical of the formula As relevant examples may be mentioned the adducts of 2 mols of the acetal of acrolein and 1: l-bis-(hydroxymethyl)-cyclohexene-3 with 1 mol of a glycol or polyglycol such as ethylene glycol. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Instead of a diol or glycol there may be used water for the additive reaction of 2 mols of an unsaturated acetal VI derived from an unsaturated diol, whereby a simple ether of the formula is obtained, that is to say that the radical Z in the For- Inula II is in this case a radical of the formula Furthermore, 1 to (x-l) mols of an unsaturated acetal VI derived from an unsaturated diol may be added on to 1 mol of a polyhydroxy compound containing at hydroxyl groups. The free hydroxyl group(s) of the resulting adduct can then be further reacted with compounds containing in addition to epoxidizable groups such groups as can be condensed wtih hydroxyl groups, for example carboxyl or hydroxyl groups, halogen atoms or the like. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Thus, for example, in a first stage 1 mol of the acetal of acrolein and 1:l-bis-[hydroxymethyl]-cyclohexene-3 can be added on to 1 mol of a glycol or polyglycol, and in a second stage the resulting adduct is etherified, for example, with 1 mol of epichlorohydrin or A -tetrahydrobenzyl alcohol or dihydrodicyclopentadienol or esterifled with 1 mol of N-tetrahydrobenzoic acid. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> When the radical of the polyol contains additionally at least one epoxidizable group, acetals of the Formula II are also obtained when in a second stage an alcohol of the formula Z'-OH or ZOH which as such contains an epoxide group, is added on. As examples of such alcohols may be mentioned glycidol or more especially epoxidized hydroaromatic alcohols of the formula such as 3:4-epoxy-hexahydrobenzyl alcohol. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> By subjecting such an alcohol ZOH containing an epoxide group to an additive reaction wtih an acetal III there are obtained by the variant B of the present process directly the new epoxides of the Formula I. However, in this case the radical of the polyol no longer contains any epoxidizable groups; it contains either an epoxide group or is free from epoxide groups. The former is the case when the radical is that of a diol, the latter in general when the radical is that of a polyol containing at least four hydroxyl groups. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The additive combination of the alcohol Z-OH or ZOH with the carbon-to-carbon double bond of the aldehyde radical is advantageously carried out in the known manner, in the presence of a basic catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide, or more especially of an acid catalyst or a Lewis acid, such as sulfuric acid or boron trifluoride. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> According to the variant A of the present process the acetal II, which still contains at least one epoxidizable group such as an epoxidizable carbon-to-carbon double bond or a halohydrin group, is treated with an epoxidizlng agent. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The epoxidation of the carbon-to-carbon double bond yielding the compound of the present invention is carried out by a conventional method, preferably with the aid of an organic per-acid, such as peracetic, perbenzoic, peradipic, monoperphthalic acid or the like. Another suitable epoxidizing agent is hypochlorous acid; when this substance is used HOCl is added on to the double bond in a first stage, whereupon in a second stage, by treatment with a hydrogen chloride donor, for example a strong alkali, the epoxide group is formed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In correspondence with what has been said above with respect to the meaning of the term radical containing an epoxidizable group, the treatment according to the-v invention with the epoxidizing agent includes also the. treatment with an agent capable of splitting 01f hydrogen: halide (such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide) of halohydrin groups, for example the glycerol-- monochlorohydrin group, with formation of the corresponding 1:2-epoxide group or of a glycidyl group. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the acetal II contains epoxidizable carbon-to carbon double bonds as well as halohydrin groups, the such, for example, as dicarboxylic anhydrides, into clear, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">epoxidation is performed in two stages: advantageously, bright, cured products having excellent technical propthe carbon-to-carbon double bonds are first epoxidized erties, more especially an outstandingly high thermal and the halohydrin groups are then converted into stability according to Martens. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">epoxide groups. 5 Similarly valuable technical properties are also found The epoxidation may lead, in addition to the diepoxides in the diepoxide compounds of the formulae or polyepoxides respectively, to wholly or only partially hydrolysed epoxides stemming from side reactions, that OH is to say compounds in which the epoxide groups of the R R polyepoxide I have been wholly or partially hydrolysed 2 2 to hydroxyl groups. 0 CH2 0 C The present invention is based on the observation that H CH crnmcHmm-cfi c 0 in general the presence of such lay-products has a favourfi X able elfect on the technical properties of the cured poly- 2 1 2 epoxides; accordingly it is in general of advantage not to '7 isolate the pure polyepoxide from the reaction mixture. R7 0 R4 The epoxidized acetals of the present invention may 4 also contain, of course, other functional groups, depend- (XIII) ing on the polyols and on the alcohols Z--0H from which they are derived. More especially, there may be present and in addition to the acetalized hydroxyl groups of the polyol, free hydroxyl groups so that certain properties, n such as the adhesivity or hydrophilicity or the curing OH 2 speed of the epoXrde compounds of the lnvention can be modified extensively.

<div class="description-paragraph"> Acrolein or crotonic aldehyde is acetalized with a diol IV, whereby an acetal of the formula is obtained which is then subjected to an additive reaction with a hydroaromatic alcohol of the formula VII or with dihydrodicyclopentadienol-S, whereby the acetal XXIV is obtained. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The acetals of the Formula XXII are easiest to prepare in the following manner: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Acrolein or crotonic aldehyde is acetalized with a polyol which contains at least 4 hydroxyl groups, whereby a spirocyclic acetal of the formula X1 o 0 X1 (XXV) is obtained, of which 1 mol is added on to 2 mols of a hydroaromatic alcohol of the Formula VII. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In a similar manner there can be prepared the derivatives of dihydrodicyclopentadienol by adding on to 2 mols thereof 1 mol of acetal XXV. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The acetals of the Formula XXIII are easiest to prepare by an additive reaction of 2 mols of an acetal XXIV with 1 mol of water (p l) or 1 mol of a diol of the formula HOGOH (p=2). </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Instead of first preparing a hydroaromatic acetal of the Formula XX or XXII and treating it with an epoxidizing agent, the diepoxide compounds of the Formula XI or XV are also obtained by adding an epoxidized hydroaromatic alcohol X on to an acetal XXIV or XXV. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The epoxidized acetals of the present invention react with the conventional curing agents for epoxide compounds; with the aid of such curing agents they can be cross linked or cured in the same manner as other polyfunctional epoxide compounds or epoxy resins. Suitable relevant curing agents are basic or more especially acidic compounds. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Good results have been achievedwith amines or amides, such as aliphatic and aromatic primary, secondary and tertiary amines, for example monobutylamine, dibutylamine, tributylamine, para-phenylenediamine, bis-[paraaminophenylJ-methane, ethylcnediamine, NzN-diethylenediarnine, N:N-dimethylpropylenediamine, diethylene- 75 triamine, tetra- [hydroxyethyl] -diethylenetriamine, tri ethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethanolamine, Mannichs bases, piperidine, piperazine, guanidine and guanidine derivatives such as phenyldiguanidine, diphenylguanidine, dicyandiamide, aniline-formaldehyde resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, melamine formaldehyde resins, polymers of aminostyrenes, polyamides, for example those of aliphaticpolyamines and dimerized or trimerized unsaturated fatty acids, isocyanates, isothiocyanatesg.polyhydric phenols, for example resorcinol, hydroquinone, bis-[4-hydroxyphenyl1- dimethylmethane, quinone, phenolaldehyde resins, oilmodified phenolaldehyde resins, reaction products of aluminum alcoholates or phenolates with compounds of tautomeric reaction of the type of the acetoacetic ester, Friedel-Crafts catalysts, for example aluminum chloride, antimony pentachloride, tin tetrachloride, zinc chloride, boron trifluoride and complexes thereof with organic compounds, metal fluoborates, boroxines, or phos phoric acid. Preferably used curing agents are polybasic carboxylic acids and anhydrides thereof, for example phthalic anhydride, methylendomethylene-tetraa hydrophthalic anhydride, dodecenyl-succinic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, hexachlonoendomethylene-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride or endomethylene-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">or mixtures thereof; maleic or succinic anhydride; if desired, accelerators may be used additionally, such as tertiary amines or strong Lewis bases, such, for example, as alkali metal alcoholates, and advantageously polyhydroxy compounds such as hexanetriol, or glycerol. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It has been observed that in curing the epoxy resins of the invention with carboxylic anhydrides it is of advantage to use for every gram equivalent of epoxide groups only about 0.3 to 0.9 gram equivalent of anhydride groups. When a basic accelerator is used, such as an alkali metal alcoholate or an alkali metal salt of a carboxylic acid, up to 1.0 gram equivalent of anhydride groups may be used. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The term curing as used in this connection refers to the conversion of the epoxide compounds described above into insoluble and infusible resins. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Accordingly, the present invention also provides curable mixtures containing'the epoxidized acetals according to the invention as well as curing agents for epoxy resins, preferably an anhydride of a dicarboxylic or polycarboxylic acid. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The curable mixtures of the present invention further contain with advantage at certain share of otherwise suitable acetals whose epoxide groups, however, are wholly or partially hydrolysed to hydroxyl groups and/or other polyhydroxy compound-s displaying a cross-linking action, such as hexanetriol. It will be readily understood that. the curable epoxide compounds may also contain other epoxides such, for example, as monoor polyglycidyl ethers of monoor polyalcohols such as butanol, 1:4- butanediol or glycerol, or of monoor polyphenols such as resorcinol, bis-[4-hydroxyphenyl]-dimethylmethane or condensation products of aldehydes with phenol (novo laks); furthermore polyglycidyl esters of polycarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, and also aminopolyepoxides such as are obtained, for example, by dehydrohalogenating a reaction product of an epi-halohydrin with a primary or secondary amine, such as n-butylamine, aniline or 4:4- dimonomethylamino) -diphenylmeth ane. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The curable epoxide compounds or mixtures thereof with curing agents may also be treated before the curing at any desired phase with a filler, plasticizer, coloring matter or the like. Suitable extenders and fillers are, for example, asphalt, bitumen, glass fibers, mica, quartz meal, cellulose, kaolin, finely dispersed silicic acid (Aerosil) or metal powders. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The mixtures of the new epoxide compounds and ouring agents can be used With or without fillers, if desired in the form of solutions or emulsions, as textile assistants, laminating resins, paints, lacquers, dipping resins, casting resins, coating compositions, pore-fillers, putties, adhesives, moulding compositions or the like, as well as for the manufacture of such products. The new resins are particularly valuable as insulating compounds for the electrical industry. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the following examples parts and percentages are by weight, the relationship between parts by Weight and parts by volume being the same as that between the kilogram and the liter. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">EXAMPLE 1 (a) Acetal of acrolein and 1:1-bis-[hydroxymethyl1- cyclohexene-S A mixture of 118 parts of acrolein, 286 parts of 1:1- bis- [hydroxymethyl]-cyclohexene-3 and 3 parts by volume of sulfuric acid of 50% strength is heated for 20 minutes at 50 C. When all has passed into solution, 700 parts by volume of benzene and 2 parts of para-toluenesulfonic acid are added and the whole is boiled for 40 minutes in a circulation distillation apparatus until 40 parts of water have distilled over azeotropicallly. The solution is treated with 4 parts of anhydrous sodium carbonate, filtered and evaporated. The benzene is distilled off at 54-61 C. under a pressure of 0.2 mm.

In the course of 20 minutes 462 parts of per-acetic acid of 39.5% strength are stirred in in portions, While maintaining the temperature at about 35 C. by intensive cooling. When the mixture has reacted for another 2 hours at 30 C. with stirring, the reaction is complete and the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature.
