<div class="description-paragraph"> Drug abuse by thrill-seeking youth or by people looking for an escape from the realities of every day life has become more and more common place in our present society. One class of widely abused drugs are the narcotic analgetics such as codeine. morphine, meperidine, etc. It is because of the high addictive potential of these agents that much time and money are being expended by the pharmaceutical industry and by governments to try and discover and develop new nonaddieting analgetics and/or narcotic antagonists. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It was therefore an object of the present invention to develop low abuse analgetics and a synthesis that would not be dependent upon opium alkaloids as starting materials and yet would be commercially feasible. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The objectives of the present invention have been achieved by the provision of the compounds of formula L and by their total synthesis from the readily available starting material 7-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2[ lH naphthalenone (lla). </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The compounds of the instant invention have the basic tetramcthylenemorphinan nucleus which is numbered and represented by the following plane formula Although there are five asymetric carbons (asterisks) in the tetramcthylenemorphinan molecule, only the configuration at the l4 carbon is significant to this invention since the configurations at all the other asymmetric centers are fixed. The iminoethano system, attached to position 13 and 9, is geometrically constrained to a cis( l,3-diaxial )-fusion. The 6,7- tetramethylene ring is attached trans to the 6,7-carbons with the 6( l) bond cis and the 7 (4') bond trans to the iminoethano system. As such, these racemates can therefore differ only in the configuration of carbon 14. The only variable will be the cis and trans relationship of the l4( 8) carbon substituent to the iminoethano system. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> When in the compounds of the present invention the l 4( 8 )-bond is trans to the iminoethano system, we have the l4B-hydroxy-6,7-tetramethylenemorphinans. When the 14(8) bond is cis to the iminoethano system, we have the l4a-hydroxy-6J-tetramethyleneisomorphinans. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The use of a graphic representation ofa 6,7-tctramethylenemorphinan or isomorphinan is meant to include the dl racemic mixture and the resolved d and l isomers thereof. </div>

<div class="description-paragraph">6 7-tetramethylenemorphinan The present invention embodies the optical isomers in their resolved form. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The optical isomers can be separated and isolated by fractional crystallization of the diastereoisomeric salts formed, for instance, with d or I- tartaric acid or D- (+)-a-bromocamphor sulfonic acid. The levorotatory isomers of the compounds of the present invention are the most preferred embodiments. Other acids commonly used for resolution can be employed. </div>
