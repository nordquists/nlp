<div class="description-paragraph">Our copending applications, Ser. Nos. 220,729 and 219,780 both filed concurrently herewith and both assigned to the assignee hereof.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to the selective chlorination with gaseous chlorine of phenolic compounds which are substituted in the ortho positions with respect to the hydroxyl group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among the more important phenolic compounds which can be produced by chlorination of a phenolic compound which is substituted in the ortho positions, notable is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The usual process for the preparation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol consists of chlorinating 2,4-dichlorophenol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, a low proportion of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol is formed (on the order of 0.003 to 0.010% by weight of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol). 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol, which is an intermediate for the synthesis of other compounds, must contain only minimum trace amounts of this undesirable isomer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Need therefore exists for processes enabling the chlorination of 2,6-dichlorophenol, which would totally avoid the formation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol. 2,3,6-Trichlorophenol, which is the more likely to be formed in this case in trace amounts, is much less problematical than 2,4,5-trichlorophenol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Indeed, when 2,6-dichlorophenol is chlorinated using gaseous chlorine, it is observed that an excellent yield is not obtained. In particular, a large amount of 2,4,5,6,6-pentachlorocyclo-2-hexenone is formed, which renders the reaction mixture very unstable and difficult to purify.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Cf. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,160,114 and 4,223,166, FR-A-2,307,785, FR-A-2,584,068, Patent Abstracts of Japan, 11, No. 43 (C-402) [2490], Feb. 7, 1987, and JP-A-61/207,351.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, a major object of the present invention is the provision of an improved process for the para-chlorination, in good yields, of phenolic compounds having substituents in the ortho positions with respect to the hydroxyl group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Briefly, the present invention features the chlorination of phenolic compounds having the general formula (I): ##STR1## in which: the symbols X, which may be identical or different, are each a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, a methyl or ethyl group, a methoxy or ethoxy group, an acetoxy group, an NO<sub>2</sub> group or an acylamino group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">the symbol Y is a hydrogen atom, a methyl or ethyl group, a methoxy or ethoxy group; and which comprises conducting the chlorination reaction, using gaseous chlorine, in the presence of a selectivity-enhancing effective amount of at least one organic cation.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">More particularly according to the present invention, either a single organic cation or a mixture of several different organic cations can be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By the term "organic cation", as utilized herein, are intended the onium ions which are derived especially from nitrogen, from phosphorus, from arsenic, from sulfur, from selenium, from oxygen, from carbon or from iodine and which are coordinated with hydrocarbon moieties. The onium ions which are derived from nitrogen, from phosphorus or from arsenic will be tetracoordinated, the onium ions which are derived from sulfur, from selenium, from oxygen, from carbon, or from S═O will be tricoordinated, while the onium ions which are derived from iodine will be dicoordinated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The hydrocarbon moieties which are coordinated with these different elements are alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, cycloalkyl and aralkyl radicals which can optionally be substituted, with the proviso that 2 coordinated hydrocarbon moieties may together form a single divalent radical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The nature of the anions which are associated with these organic cations is not of critical importance. All of the "hard" or "borderline" bases are suitable as the anion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The terms "hard" or "borderline" connote any anion having the classical definition given by R. Pearson in Journal of Chem. Ed., 45, pages 581-587 (1968).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Exemplary onium ions which can be used in the present chlorination process are those having the following general formulae: ##STR2## in which: Z is N, P or As;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Y is S, O, Se, S═O or C;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>6</sup>, R<sup>7</sup>, R<sup>8</sup> and R<sup>9</sup>, which may be identical or different, are each a straight or branched chain alkyl radical which has 1 to 16 carbon atoms and can optionally be substituted by one or more phenyl groups, hydroxyl groups, halogen groups, nitro groups, alkoxy or alkoxycarbonyl groups, the alkoxy groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; a straight or branched chain alkenyl radical having 2 to 12 carbon atoms; an aryl radical which has 6 to 10 carbon atoms and can optionally be substituted by one or more alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alkoxy groups or alkoxycarbonyl groups, the alkoxy radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or halogen atoms, with the proviso that two of said radicals R<sub>6</sub> to R<sub>9</sub> may together form an alkylene, alkenylene or alkadienylene radical, which can be straight or branched chain and has from 3 to 6 carbon atoms;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>10</sub>, R<sub>11</sub>, R<sub>12</sub>, R<sub>13</sub>, which may also be identical or different, are each a straight or branched chain alkyl radical containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, with the proviso that the radicals R<sub>12</sub> and R<sub>13</sub> may together form an alkylene radical containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, and the radicals R<sub>11</sub> and R<sub>12</sub> or R<sub>11</sub> and R<sub>13</sub> may together form an alkylene, alkenylene or alkadienylene radical, containing 4 carbon atoms and, with the nitrogen atom, constitute a nitrogen-containing heterocycle;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>14</sub> is a divalent radical forming with the 2 nitrogen atoms a ring member which has 4 to 6 atoms and optionally containing one or more nitrogen, sulfur and/or oxygen heteroatoms, with the proviso that such heterocycle may be substituted by one or more radicals such as R<sub>6</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among the "hard" or "borderline" bases which can form the anion of said onium salts, representative are the ions: F<sup>-</sup>, ClO<sup>-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, PF<sup>-</sup> <sub>6</sub>, BF<sup>-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, SnCl<sup>-</sup> <sub>6</sub>, SbCl<sup>-</sup> <sub>6</sub>, B(Ph)<sup>-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, PO<sup>3-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, HPO<sup>2-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> PO<sup>-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub> SO<sup>-</sup> <sub>3</sub>, Ph-SO<sup>-</sup> <sub>3</sub>, HSO<sup>-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, NO<sup>-</sup> <sub>3</sub>, SO<sup>2-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup>, OH<sup>-</sup>, with Ph denoting a phenyl radical, as well as all the other anions corresponding to Pearson's definition of "hard" or "borderline" base.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For reasons of convenience of use, preferred such anions are PO<sup>3-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, HPO<sup>2-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> PO<sup>-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub> SO<sup>-</sup> <sub>3</sub>, Ph-SO<sup>-</sup> <sub>3</sub>, NO<sup>-</sup> <sub>3</sub>, SO<sup>2-</sup> <sub>4</sub>, PF<sup>-</sup> <sub>6</sub>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup>, with Ph being defined as above. The anions Cl<sup>-</sup> and Br<sup>-</sup>, and more especially the anion Cl<sup>-</sup>, are advantageously used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Exemplary of the organic cations corresponding to the formula (V), representative are:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">diphenyliodonium,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">4,4'-dimethoxydiphenyliodonium (or the compounds described in JACS, 81, 342 (1958)),</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">diphenyliodonium-2-carboxylate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among the organic cations which are useful according to the process of this invention, the quaternary ammonium ions, quaternary phosphonium ions, sulfonium ions and iodonium ions will most typically be the preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The onium salt may be introduced in the solid state, or in the form of a solution in one of the solvents therefor, typically water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The process according to the invention may be carried out in the absence of solvent: the reagents are then in molten state. This alternative embodiment of the invention typically provides the best results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The reaction can also be conducted in a liquid medium, especially in an aliphatic ether, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, a chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon, a chlorobenzene or a bromobenzene, or a carboxylic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferred aliphatic ethers are dipropyl oxide, diisopropyl oxide, methyl and tert-butyl oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferred aliphatic hydrocarbons are hexane, heptane, octane, nonane and decane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferred chlorinated hydrocarbons are perchlorinated hydrocarbons such as, in particular, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene, hexachloroethane, hexachloropropene and hexachlorobutadiene; also representative are the partially chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, dichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, trichloroethylene, 1-chlorobutane and 1,2-dichlorobutane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferred chlorobenzenes are monochlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene or mixtures of various chlorobenzenes; preferred bromobenzenes are monobromobenzene or mixtures of monobromobenzene with one or more dibromobenzenes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">And the preferred carboxylic acids are acetic acid and propionic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the process of the invention is carried out in a solvent medium, the concentration of the chlorophenol of formula (I) in the solvent is not critical. It will depend especially on the solubility of the chlorophenol in the solvent used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of organic cation used in the process of the invention may vary over very wide limits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It usually constitutes 0.005% to 25% by weight of onium salt relative to the weight of the phenolic compound of formula (I).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the reaction is carried out in the molten state, it is preferred to use 0.015% to 5% by weight of onium salt relative to the phenolic compound of formula (I) in order to be sufficiently effective, without having an excessive amount of onium salt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the reaction is carried out in a solvent medium, it will be preferable to use 5 to 25% by weight of onium salt relative to the phenolic compound of formula (I). In this case, it is preferable to express the amount of onium salt relative to the reaction mixture. For example, 0.01% to 2% by weight of onium salt relative to the reaction mixture will be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of chlorine used in the process according to the invention is essentially a function of the desired conversion rate of the phenolic compound (I).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In practice, most typically, chlorine is introduced by bubbling same into the reaction mixture. The pressure in the apparatus is therefore essentially equal or slightly higher than atmospheric pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The chlorine may be used alone or be diluted with an inert gas, such as nitrogen for example. The presence of an inert gas makes it possible, if required, to increase the gaseous flow rate without simultaneously increasing the amount of chlorine introduced over the course of a given period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The gaseous chlorine used in the present process may also be formed in situ, from hydrochloric acid, by addition of an oxidizing compound, such as, for example, hydrogen peroxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The temperature at which the process of the invention is carried out is usually less than or equal to 180° C. The lower limit is not critical. It is subject to the requirement of maintaining a liquid reaction mixture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When conducting the reaction in the molten state, this lower temperature will vary according to the phenolic compound (I) subjected to chlorination. Therefore, when 2,6-dichlorophenol is chlorinated, a temperature at least equal to 65° C. will be required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When conducting the reaction in a solvent medium, it will be possible for the temperature to be as low as, for example, 20° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, the temperature will preferably range from 40° C. to 120° C., when the reaction is carried out in a solvent medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When conducting the reaction in the molten state, the preferred temperature will range from 40° to 120° C., except of course for the phenolic compounds having a melting point which is higher than 40° C., for which the preferred temperature zone will range from the melting point of the compounds to 120° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among the phenolic compounds of formula (I) to which the process of the invention is applicable, especially representative are 2,6-dichlorophenol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, 2-chloro-6-methoxyphenol, 2-chloro-6-methylphenol, 2,6-di-chloro-3-methylphenol, 2,6-dichloro-3-methoxyphenol, 2-bromo-6-methoxyphenol, 2-chloro-6-nitrophenol and 2-chloro-6-acetamidophenol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is optionally possible to chlorinate mixtures of these phenolic compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The process of the invention is particularly well adapted for the chlorination of 2,6-dichlorophenol to produce 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, because it makes it possible to obtain the latter compound while greatly limiting, generally to less than 3% by weight, the formation of undesirable by-products such as 2,4,5,6,6-pentachloro-2-cyclohexenone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the process of the invention is applied to 2,6-dichlorophenol, the latter may be especially obtained by chlorination, with gaseous chlorine, of 2-chlorophenol, in the presence of an organic cation such as previously defined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is therefore possible to thus produce 2,4,6-trichlorophenol by chlorination of 2-chlorophenol using gaseous chlorine in the presence of an organic cation, which will initially catalyze the chlorination of 2-chlorophenol to produce 2,6-dichlorophenol, and then the chlorination of the latter to produce 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is also possible to conduct the chlorination of 2,6-dichlorophenol which has been prepared by chlorination of phenol with gaseous chlorine, in the presence of an organic cation such as previously defined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It appears that it is also possible to apply the process of the invention to crude mixtures from the chlorination of phenol, which contain 2,6-dichlorophenol as well as 2,4-dichlorophenol, orthochlorophenol and possibly small amounts of parachlorophenol and phenol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When it is applied to such industrial mixtures, the process of the invention makes it possible to obtain virtually only 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in excellent yields. Furthermore, practically very little 2,4,5-trichlorophenol is detected, this compound being undesirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The conditions described for the chlorination of the phenolic compounds of formula (I) and more particularly of 2,6-dichlorophenol, apply to the chlorination of phenol and/or 2-chlorophenol or of crude industrial mixtures from the chlorination of phenol, previously described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to further illustrate the present invention and the advantages thereof, the following specific examples are given, it being understood that same are intended only as illustrative and in nowise limitative.</div>
