<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES66045394">
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a vulcanizable elastomer composition. In more particular, it relates to an ethylene-copolymer type elastomer composition which can give vulcanizates having an excellent oil resistance and low-temperature resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is well known that marked advance in technology of various industries including automobiles, household electric appliances and machines in recent years requires a wide variety of properties to rubber materials used in various related parts and have developed various specialty elastomers which meet such requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Such specialty elastomers already known include crosslinkable elastomer composition which is mainly composed of an ethylene copolymer derived from ethylene and an acrylic ester.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specifically, JP-A-61-266407 through 266410 disclose ethylene copolymers obtained by modifying a copolymer derived from ethylene, alkyl acrylate and third component or ethylene, alkoxyalkyl acrylate and third component with an unsaturated amine, unsaturated alcohol, unsaturated carboxylic acid, etc. The ethylene copolymer disclosed therein is characterized in that it is obtained by modifying a copolymer comprising as monomer units ethylene, either an alkyl acrylate or an alkoxyalkyl acrylate, and further an acid anhydride group as the third component with an unsaturated amine, unsaturated alcohol, unsaturated carboxylic acid, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Having a polar group in the side chain, the crosslinked compositions prepared from the above ethylene copolymers have an excellent oil resistance. However, they are still unsatisfactory in low-temperature resistance, therefore crosslinked compositions having both two resistances in a good balance has been desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the present invention, there is provided a vulcanizable elastomer composition which can give vulcanizates having an improved low-temperature resistance together with an excellent oil resistance, which composition having been derived from ethylene, acrylic ester and third component. It was impossible to obtain a vulcanizable composition giving vulcanizates having an excellent low-temperature resistance without damaging the oil resistance. The present inventors are the first to find a vulcanizable composition satisfying the following limitations gives vulcanizates exhibiting an excellent low-temperature resistance and oil resistance that have been difficult to simultaneously satisfy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a vulcanizable elastomer composition which comprises 100 parts by weight of a copolymer containing</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(A) 50-85% by mole of ethylene unit,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(B) 10-45% by mole of an alkyl acrylate unit having the formula (I), ##STR4##  wherein R<sub>1</sub> is an alkyl having 1-8 carbon atoms, (C) 2-35% by mole of an alkoxyalkyl acryalte unit having the formula (II), ##STR5##  wherein R<sub>2</sub> is hydrogen or methyl, R<sub>3</sub> is an alkylene having 1-4 carbon atoms, and R<sub>4</sub> is an alkyl or alkoxyalkyl, each having 1-4 carbon atoms, and</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The copolymer used in the present invention is obtained by copolymerizing the monomers which become contained as a unit in the copolymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The proportion of each monomer to be copolymerized may be determined so as to give a copolymer having an intended composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The ethylene unit (A), one of the units constituting the copolymer, has the following formula</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">
</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">--CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 --</pre>
<div class="description-paragraph">The unit is derived from ethylene as a monomer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The alkyl acrylate unit having the formula (I) is derived from an alkyl acrylate monomer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific examples of alkyl acrylates are methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, tert-butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and the like. They may be used either alone or as in admixture thereof. Methyl acrylate is particularly preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The alkoxyalkyl acrylate unit having the formula (II) is derived from an alkoxyalkyl acrylate monomer. Specific examples of the alkoxyalkyl acrylates are methoxymethyl acrylate, methoxyethyl acrylate, ethoxyethyl acrylate, butoxyethyl acrylate, methoxypropyl acrylate, ethoxypropyl acrylate, methoxymethyl methacrylate, ethoxymethyl methacrylate, ethoxyethyl methacylate, methoxyethyl methacrylate and the like. They may be used either alone or as in admixture thereof. Methoxyethyl acrylate and ethoxyethyl methacrylate are particularly preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The glycidyl ester unit having the formula (III) is derived from an unsaturated glycidyl ester monomer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific examples of unsaturated glycidyl esters are, as disclosed for example in JP-B-46-45085, glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, diglycidyl itaconate, triglycidyl butenetricarboxylate, glycidyl p-styrenecarboxylate and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Particularly preferable is glycidyl methacrylate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The proportion of the ethylene unit (A) constituting the copolymer of the present invention is 50-85% by mole, preferably 55-75% by mole, more preferably 65-75% by mole. When the proportion of the ethylene unit is less than 50% by mole, the resulting vulcanizate is poor in low-temperature resistance, whereas when it is more than 85% by mole, the vulcanizate shows a high permanent set and permanent compression strain and a low rubber elasticity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The proportion of the alkyl acrylate unit (B) constituting the copolymer of the present invention is 10-45% by mole, preferably 12-35% by mole, more preferably 15-35% by mole. When the proportion of the alkyl acrylate unit is less than 10% by mole, the vulcanizate is poor in oil resistance, whereas when it is higher than 45% by mole, the vulcanizate is poor in low-temperature resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The proportion of the alkoxyalkyl acrylate unit (C) constituting the copolymer of the present invention is 1-35% by mole, preferably 2-25% by mole, more preferably 2-15% by mole. When the proportion of the alkoxyalkyl acrylate unit is less than 1% by mole, the vulcanizate is not improved in low-temperature resistance, whereas when it is more than 35% by mole, the vulcanizate is poor in oil resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The glycidyl ester (D), another unit constituting the copolymer of the present invention, may be introduced into the copolymer in a small proportion, for example up to 5% by mole, preferably 0.5-3% by mole, more preferably 0.5-1.5% by mole. The introduction of said glycidyl ester units enables to vulcanize the copolymer with agents other than organic peroxides, i.e. multifunctional organic amines, for example. When the glycidyl ester unit is not introduced, the copolymer is mainly vulcanized with organic peroxides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Aside from the above-mentioned monomers forming the copolymer, a small amount of other comonomers copolymerizable with ethylene may be copolymerized. Specific examples of the comonomers are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, isobutylene, styrene and the derivatives thereof, vinyl acetate, tetrafuloroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The copolymer of the present invention may be prepared by a known method. For example, it can be prepared by free radical-initiated mass polymerization, emulsion polymerization, or solution polymerization. Some typical methods of polymerization are described in JP-B-46-45085. For example, the preparation may be conducted in the presence of an initiator which generates a free radical under a pressure of 500 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> or more and at a temperature of 40°-300° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The copolymers suitably used in the present invention, which is obtained by copolymerizing the above-mentioned components, are those having a melt index at 190° C. of 0.5-500 g/10 minutes determined according to JIS K6791, preferably 0.5-50 g/10 minutes, and an intrinsic viscosity [η] of 0.50-2.0 dl/g determined in xylene at 70° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The elastomer composition of the present invention comprises 100 parts by weight of the abovementioned copolymer and 0.1-10 parts by weight, preferably 0.5-5 parts by weight of at least one vulcanizing agent. When the amount of the vulcanizing agent added exceeds 10 parts by weight, the tensile elongation percentage and the thermal resistance of the resulting product become unsatisfactory. When the amount of the vulcanizing agent added is less than 0.1 part by weight, no satisfactory crosslinking effect is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The vulcanization is carried out with at least one vulcanizing agent selected from the group consisting of organic peroxides, multifunctional organic amines or the salts thereof, organic carboxylic acid ammonium salts, dithiocarbamates, thiourea derivatives, and acid anhydrides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The organic peroxides usable in the present invention include those of peroxyketal type, hydroperoxide type, dialkyl peroxide type, diacryl peroxide type, and peroxyester type organic peroxides. Specific examples thereof are dicumyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, t-butylperoxycumene, benzoyl peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexane and the like. They are selected in consideration of safety in handling, odor and other factors. The amount of the organic peroxide to be compounded is 0.1-10 parts by weight, preferably 1-10 parts by weight, more preferably 0.5-5 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of the copolymer. And it may be varied depending upon the desirable properties of crosslinked product to be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The composition of the present invention may usually be incorporated, in order to enhance the crosslinking efficiency in the crosslinking effected by organic peroxides, with crosslinking assistants usually used in the art, for example p,p'-dibenzoylquinone dioxime, quinone dioxime, triallyl cyanurate, sulfur, ethylene dimethacrylate, N,N'-m-phenylene bismaleimide, triallyl isocyanurate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific examples of multifunctional organic amines and the salts thereof, organic carboxylic acid ammonium salts, dithiocarbamates, thiourea derivatives and acid anhydrides, which are useful vulcanizing agents for copolymers containing a glycidyl ester unit (D), are aliphatic amines such as polymethylenediamine and polyetherdiamine, ammonium benzoate, zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate, copper dimethyldithiocarbamate, phthalic anhydride, itaconic anhydride and the like. More specifically, the vulcanizing agents disclosed in JP-B-62-14568 may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The elastomer composition of the present invention may be optionally incorporated at need with additives well known in the rubber industry. Such additives include vulcanization accelerators, processing assistants, zinc white, stearic acid, reinforcements, fillers, antioxidants, softeners, defoaming agents and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Generally, to the elastomer composition of the present invention may be further added carbon black and/or plasticizers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable inorganic fillers include white fillers such as silica, talc, clay and the like. Suitable plasticizers are, for example, paraffinic plasticizers, polyester type plasticizers, polyether type plasticizers and the like. The amount of carbon black, inorganic fillers, and plasticizers to be added may be optionally selected depending upon the desirable properties of the product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The elastomer composition thus obtained can be vulcanized at a temperature of 150°-230° C. for 5-45 minutes, preferably at 160°-190° C. for 10-30 minutes, to exhibit practically useful properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The elastomer composition of the present invention can also be vulcanized in a press, steam autoclave, or in hot air. The vulcanization thus obtained has a better balance in oil resistance and low-temperature resistance than in prior art products, and can be suitably used for various hoses, diaphragms, packings, rolls, and belt materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The practice of the present invention will be specifically illustrated below with reference to Examples, but the invention should not be interpreted to be limited thereto. The properties of the elastomer composition were determined as follows.</div>
<heading>METHOD FOR DETERMINING PHYSICAL PROPERTIES</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The composition to be examined was vulcanized with a steam press at 170° C. for 20 minutes. The vulcanizate was then examined for physical properties and oil resistance and subjected to Gehman torsion test according to JIS K-6301. The oil resistance was examined by determining the degree of volume swelling after 70 hours of immersion at 150° C. in JIS No. 3 oil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The low-temperature resistance was evaluated by determining the glass transition point (Tg) of unvulcanized rubber with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and by Gehman torsion test of vulcanized rubber. The determination with a DSC was carried out under the following conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">DSC: Type DSC-2 (mfd. by The Perkin-Elmer Corp.) Temperature increasing rate: 20° C./min Sensitivity: 0.5 mcal/sec (in He atmosphere)</div>
