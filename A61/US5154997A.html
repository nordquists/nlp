<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to an electrophotographic light-sensitive material, and more particularly to an electrophotographic light-sensitive material which is excellent in electrostatic charging characteristics and pre-exposure fatigue resistance.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">An electrophotographic light-sensitive material may have various structures depending upon the characteristics required or an electrophotographic process being employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An electrophotographic system in which the light-sensitive material comprises a support having thereon at least one photoconductive layer and, if necessary, an insulating layer on the surface thereof is widely employed. The electrophotographic light-sensitive material comprising a support and at least one photoconductive layer formed thereon is used for the image formation by an ordinary electrophotographic process including electrostatic charging, imagewise exposure, development, and, if necessary, transfer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, a process of using an electrophotographic light-sensitive material as an offset master plate for direct plate making is widely practiced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Binders which are used for forming the photoconductive layer of an electrophotographic light-sensitive material are required to be excellent in the film-forming property by themselves and the capability of dispersing a photoconductive powder therein. Also, the photoconductive layer formed using the binder is required to have satisfactory adhesion to a base material or support. Further, the photoconductive layer formed by using the binder is required to have various excellent electrostatic characteristics such as high charging capacity, small dark decay, large light decay, and less fatigue due to pre-exposure and also have an excellent image forming properties, and the photoconductive layer stably maintaining these electrostatic properties in spite of the change of humidity at the time of image formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Binder resins which have been conventionally used include silicone resins (e.g., JP-B-34-6670, the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined published Japanese patent application"), styrene-butadiene resins (e.g., JP-B-35-1960), alkyd resins, maleic acid resins, polyamides (e.g., JP-B-35-11219), polyvinyl acetate resins (e.g., JP-B-41-2425), vinyl acetate copolymers (e.g., JP-B-41-2426), acrylic resins (JP-B-35-11216), acrylic acid ester copolymers (e.g., JP-B-35-11219, JP-B-36-8510, and JP-B-41-13946), etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, in the electrophotographic light-sensitive materials using these binder resins, there are various problems such as 1) the affinity of the binder with a photoconductive powder is poor thereby reducing the dispersibility of the coating composition containing them, 2) the charging property of the photoconductive layer containing the binder is low, 3) the quality (in particular, the dot image reproducibility and resolving power) of the image portions of duplicated images is poor, 4) the image quality is liable to be influenced by the environmental conditions (e.g., high temperature and high humidity or low temperature and low humidity) at the time of the formation of the duplicated image, and 5) the photoconductive layer is insufficient in film strength and adhesion, which causes, when the light-sensitive material is used for an offset master, peeling off of the photoconductive layer, etc. at offset printing to reduce the number of prints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to improve electrostatic characteristics of the photoconductive layer, various attempts have hitherto been made. For example, incorporation of a compound having an aromatic ring or a furan ring containing a carboxy group or a nitro group either alone or in combination with a dicarboxylic anhydride in a photoconductive layer is disclosed in JP-B-42-6878 and JP-B-45-3073. However, the thus improved electrophotographic light-sensitive materials are yet insufficient in electrostatic characteristics and, in particular, light-sensitive materials having excellent light decay characteristics have not yet been obtained. Thus, for compensating the insufficient sensitivity of these light-sensitive materials, an attempt has been made to incorporate a large amount of a sensitizing dye into the photoconductive layer. However, light-sensitive materials containing a large amount of a sensitizing dye undergo considerable deterioration of whiteness to reduce the quality as a recording medium, sometimes causing deterioration in dark decay characteristics, whereby satisfactory reproduced images are not obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, JP-A-60-10254 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") discloses a method of using a binder resin for a photoconductive layer by controlling the average molecular weight of the resin. That is, JP-A-60-10254 discloses a technique for improving the electrostatic characteristics (in particular, reproducibility at repeated use as a PPC light-sensitive material), moisture resistance, etc., of the photoconductive layer by using an acrylic resin having an acid value of from 4 to 50 and an average molecular weight of from 1×10<sup>3</sup> to 1×10<sup>4</sup> and an acrylic resin having an acid value of from 4 to 50 and an average molecular weight of from 1×10<sup>4</sup> to 2×10<sup>5</sup> in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, lithographic printing plate precursors using electrophotographic light-sensitive materials have been extensively investigated and various binder resins for a photoconductive layer have been prepared as satisfying both the electrostatic characteristics as an electrophotographic light-sensitive material and the printing characteristics as a printing plate precursor. For example, JP-B-50-31011 discloses a combination of a resin having a molecular weight of from 1.8×10<sup>4</sup> to 10×10<sup>4</sup> and a glass transition point (Tg) of from 10° to 80° C. obtained by copolymerizing a (meth)acrylate monomer and other monomers in the presence of fumaric acid and a copolymer composed of a (meth)acrylate monomer and a copolymerizable monomer other than fumaric acid, JP-A-53-54027 discloses a terpolymer containing a (meth)acrylic acid ester unit with a substituent having a carboxylic acid group at least 7 atoms apart from the ester linkage, JP-A-54-20735 and JP-A-57-202544 disclose a tetra- or pentapolymer containing an acrylic acid unit and a hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate unit, and JP-A-58-68046 discloses a terpolymer containing a (meth)acrylic ester unit with an alkyl group having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms as a substituent and a vinyl monomer containing a carboxyl group as effective for improving the oil-desensitization of the photoconductive layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, none of these resins proposed have proved to be satisfactory for practical use in charging property, dark charge retention characteristic, photosensitivity, and smoothness of the photoconductive layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, as the result of evaluations on the conventional binder resins which are said to be developed for electrophotographic lithographic printing plate precursors, it has been found that they have problems in the above-described electrostatic characteristics, background stains of prints, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For solving these problems, JP-A-63-217354 discloses that the smoothness and the electrostatic characteristics of a photoconductive layer can be improved and images having no background stains are obtained by using a low-molecular weight resin (molecular weight of from 1,000 to 10,000) containing from 0.05 to 10% by weight of a copolymerizable component having an acidic group in the side chain of the copolymer as the binder resin, JP-A-1-100554 discloses a binder further containing a curable group-containing copolymerizable component together with the above-described acidic group-containing copolymerizable component, JP-A-1-102573 discloses a binder resin using crosslinking agent together with the above-described acidic group-containing resin, JP-A-63-220149, JP-A-63-220148, and JP-A-64-564 disclose a binder resin using a high molecular weight resin having a weight average molecular weight of at least 1×10.sup.∝ in combination with the above-described acidic group-containing resin, and JP-A-1-102573 discloses a binder resin using a heat- and/or photo-curable resin in combination with the above-described acidic group-containing resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, as other binder resins for electrophotographic light-sensitive materials for solving the above-described problems, JP-A-1-70761 discloses a binder resin using a resin having a weight average molecular weight of from 1×10<sup>3</sup> to 1×10<sup>4</sup> having an acidic group at the terminal of the polymer main chain, JP-A-1-214865 discloses a binder resin using the above-described resin further containing a curable group-containing component as a copolymerizable component, JP-A-2-874 discloses a binder using a cross-linking agent together with the above-described resin, JP-A-1-280761, JP-A-1-116643, and JP-A-1-169455 disclose a binder resin using a high molecular weight resin having a weight average molecular weight of at least 1×10<sup>4</sup> in combination with the above-described resin, and JP-A-2-34859 discloses a binder resin using a heat- and photo-curable resin in combination with the above-described resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, it has been found that these resins still have problems in maintenance of the stable high performance when the electrophotographic light-sensitive materials are exposed to noticeably severe conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">More specifically, it has been found that, when a charging speed is increased in a charging step of the light-sensitive material, uneven charging occurs, which results in causing unevenness in the duplicated images, or, when a duplicating operation is carried out directly after irradiating the surface of the electrophotographic light-sensitive material with a fluorescent lamp, etc., as a supplemental operation for a copying machine, the duplicated images obtained are deteriorated (in particular, lowering of the image density, lowering of the resolving power, and the occurrence of background fog) (so-called pre-exposure fatigue).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, when the electrophotographic light-sensitive material described above is used as lithographic printing plate precursor by an electrophotographic system, the printing plate has the duplicated images having deteriorated image quality in the case of carrying out the duplication under the above-described condition, and, when printing is conducted using the plate, serious problems may occur such as lowering of image quality and the occurrence of background fog.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention has been made for solving the above described problems of conventional electrophotographic light-sensitive materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a CPC electrophotographic light-sensitive material having improved charging characteristics and pre-exposure fatigue resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object of the present invention is to provide a lithographic printing plate precursor by an electrophotographic system capable of providing a number of prints having clear images.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It has now been found that the above-described objects are accomplished by an electrophotographic light-sensitive material comprising a support having provided thereon a photoconductive layer containing at least an inorganic photoconductive substance, a spectral sensitizer, and a binder resin, wherein said binder resin contains at least one binder resin (A) described below and at least one binder resin (B):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Binder Resin (A):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a resin having a weight average molecular weight of from 1×10<sup>3</sup> to 1×10<sup>4</sup>, containing at least 30% by weight of a polymer component represented by formula (I) shown below and from 0.1 to 10% by weight of a polymer component containing at least one acidic group selected from --PO<sub>3</sub> H<sub>2</sub>, --SO<sub>3</sub> H, --COOH, ##STR1## (wherein R represents a hydrocarbon group or --OR' (wherein R' represents a hydrocarbon group) and a cyclic acid anhydride-containing group, and having at least one acidic group selected from the above-described acidic groups at one terminal of the main chain of the copolymer; ##STR2## wherein a<sub>1</sub> and a<sub>2</sub> each represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a cyano group or a hydrocarbon group, and R<sub>1</sub> represents hydrocarbon group;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Binder Resin (B):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a resin having a weight average molecular weight of from 3×10<sup>4</sup> to 1×10<sup>6</sup> and containing at least 30% by weight of a polymer component represented by following formula (III); ##STR3## wherein X represents (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub> COO--, (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub> OCO--, --O-- or ##STR4## (wherein n and m each represents an integer of from 0 to 3); and b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>2</sub> have the same meaning as a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>1</sub>, respectively, in formula (I).</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The binder resin which can be used in the present invention comprises at least a low molecular weight resin (A) containing a polymer component having the specific repeating unit and a polymer component having the specific acidic group (hereinafter, the term "acidic group" used in the present invention includes a cyclic acid anhydride-containing group, unless otherwise indicated) and having an acidic group at one terminal of the polymer main chain and a middle to high molecular weight resin (B) containing at least the repeating unit shown by formula (III).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, it is known that a resin containing an acidic group-containing polymer component and a resin having an acidic group at the terminal of the main chain thereof are known as a binder resin for an electrophotographic light-sensitive material, but, as shown in the present invention, it has been surprisingly found that the above-described problems in conventional techniques can be first solved by using the resin having not only an acidic group-containing polymer component, but having an acidic group also at the terminal of the polymer main chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the low molecular weight resin (A) is a low molecular weight resin having the acidic group at the terminal and containing the acidic group-containing component and a methacrylate component having a specific substituent containing a benzene ring or a naphthalene ring (hereinafter referred to as resin (A')) represented by the following general formula (IIa) or (IIb): ##STR5## wherein A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> each represents a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, --COD<sub>1</sub> or --COOD<sub>2</sub>, wherein D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> each represents a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms; and B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> represents a mere bond or a linking group containing from 1 to 4 linking atoms, which connects --COO-- and the benzene ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment, the middle to high molecular weight resin (B) is preferably a polymer further having at least one acidic group selected from --PO<sub>3</sub> H<sub>2</sub>, --SO<sub>3</sub> H, --COOH, ##STR6## (wherein R<sub>o</sub> has the same meaning as R described above) and a cyclic acid anhydride-containing group (hereinafter, the polymer is referred to as resin (B')).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, it has been found that, in the dispersion system existing at least an inorganic photoconductive substance and a spectral sensitizer, the low molecular weight resin (A) effectively adsorbs onto the stoichiometric defects of the photoconductive substance without hindering the adsorption of the spectral sensitizer onto the inorganic photoconductive substance, adequately improves the coating property on the surface of the photoconductive substance, compensates the traps of the photoconductive substance, compensates for the sensitivity increasing effect of the photoconductive substance with the spectral sensitizer, greatly improves the moisture resistance, and further sufficiently disperses the photoconductive particles to inhibit the occurrence of aggregation of the photoconductive substance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, the resin (B) sufficiently heightens the mechanical strength of the photoconductive layer which may be insufficient in case of using the resin (A) alone, without damaging the excellent electrophotographic characteristics attained by the use of the resin (A).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is believed that, by specifying the weight average molecular weight of each of the resin (A) and the resin (B) and the contents and the bonding positions of the acidic groups in the resins as the binder resin for the inorganic photoconductive substance according to the present invention, the strength of the interaction of the inorganic photoconductive substance, the spectral sensitizer, and the resins can be properly changed in the dispersed state of these components and the dispersion state can be stably maintained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, it is believed that, for the reasons described above, the charging characteristics are improved, uneven charging does not occur, and the pre-exposure fatigue resistance is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In case of using the resin (A'), the electrophotographic characteristics, particularly, V<sub>10</sub>, DRR and E<sub>1/10</sub> of the electrophotographic material can be furthermore improved as compared with the use of the resin (A). While the reason for this fact is not fully clear, it is believed that the polymer molecular chain of the resin (A') is suitably arranged on the surface of inorganic photoconductive substance such as zinc oxide in the layer depending on the plane effect of the benzene ring or the naphthalene ring which is an ester component of the methacrylate whereby the above described improvement is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, when the resin (B') is employed, the electrostatic characteristics, particularly, DRR and E<sub>1/10</sub> of the electrophotographic material are further improved without damaging the excellent characteristics due to the resin (A), and these preferred characteristics are almost maintained in the case of greatly changing the environmental conditions from high temperature and high humidity to low temperature and low humidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, in the present invention, the smoothness of surface of the photoconductive layer can be improved. When an electrophotographic light-sensitive material having a photoconductive layer of rough surface is used as a lithographic printing plate precursor by an electrophotographic system, since the dispersion state of inorganic particles as a photoconductive substance and a binder resin is not proper and the photoconductive layer is formed in a state of existing aggregates, whereby when the photoconductive layer is subjected to an oil-desensitizing treatment with an oil-desensitizing solution, the non-image areas are not uniformly and sufficiently rendered hydrophilic to cause attaching of a printing ink at printing, which results in causing background stains at the non-image portions of the prints obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of using the binder resin according to the present invention, the interaction of the adsorption and coating of the inorganic photoconductive substance and the binder resin is adequately performed, and the film strength of the photoconductive layer is maintained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Moreover, since the deterioration of the image quality and the formation of the background fog caused by uneven charging or pre-exposure fatigue do not occur, prints having very excellent images can be obtained when the electrophotographic light-sensitive material of the present invention is used as a lithographic printing plate precursor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the resin (A), the weight average molecular weight is from 1×10<sup>3</sup> to 1×10<sup>4</sup>, and preferably from 3×10<sup>3</sup> to 8×10<sup>3</sup>, the content of the copolymer component corresponding to the repeating unit represented by formula (I) is at least 30% by weight, and preferably from 50 to 97% by weight. The total content of the acidic groups in the acidic group-containing copolymer component and the acidic group bonded to the terminal of the main chain is preferably from 1 to 20% by weight. Furthermore, the content of the copolymer component containing the acidic group is preferably from 0.1 to 10% by weight, and more preferably from 0.5 to 8% by weight, and the content of the acidic group bonded to the terminal of the main chain is preferably from 0.5 to 15% by weight, and more preferably from 1 to 10% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, the content of the copolymer component of the methacrylate corresponding to the repeating unit represented by formula (IIa) and/or formula (IIb) in the resin (A') is at least 30% by weight, and preferably from 50 to 97% by weight, and the content of the copolymer component containing the acidic group is preferably from 0.1 to 10% by weight, and more preferably from 0.5 to 8% by weight. Also, the content of the acidic group bonded to the terminal of the polymer chain is preferably from 0.5 to 15% by weight, and more preferably from 1 to 10% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The glass transition point of the resin (A) is preferably from -20° C. to 110° C., and more preferably from -10° C. to 90° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, the weight average molecular weight of the resin (B) is from 3×10<sup>4</sup> to 1×10<sup>6</sup>, and more preferably from 5×10<sup>4</sup> to 5×10<sup>5</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, the content of the copolymer component corresponding to the repeating unit of formula (III) is at least 30% by weight, and preferably at least 50% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, the resin (B) may further contain an acidic group-containing component as a copolymer component and, when the resin (B) contains the acidic group-containing copolymer component, the content thereof is not more than 10% by weight, and more preferably not more than 5% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, in the resin (B'), the content of the acidic group bonded to the terminal of the main chain is preferably from 0.1 to 5% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, when the resin (B) contains the copolymer component containing the acidic group and the acidic group at the terminal of the main chain thereof, the total content of the acidic groups is preferably from 0.5 to 10% by weight, and more preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The glass transition point of the resin (B) is preferably from 0° C. to 110° C., and more preferably from 20° C. to 90° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If the molecular weight of the binder resin (A) is less than 1×10<sup>3</sup>, the film-forming property thereof is reduced, and a sufficient film strength cannot be maintained. On the other hand, if the molecular weight of the binder resin (A) is higher than 1×10<sup>4</sup>, the deviation of the electrophotographic characteristics (charging property and pre-exposure fatigue resistance) under the above-described severe condition changes somewhat largely, and the effect of the present invention for obtaining stable duplicated images is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If the total content of the acidic groups in the binder resin (A) is less than 1% by weight, the initial potential is low and a sufficient image density cannot be obtained. On the other hand, if the total acidic group content is larger than 20% by weight, the dispersibility is reduced even if the molecular weight of the binder resin (A) is low, the smoothness of the layer and the electrophotographic characteristics at high humidity are reduced, and further, when the light-sensitive material is used as an offset master plate, the occurrence of background stains is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, if the molecular weight of the binder resin (B) is less than 3×10<sup>4</sup>, the film strength becomes insufficient. On the other hand, if the molecular weight thereof is larger than 1×10<sup>6</sup>, the dispersibility is reduced, the smoothness of the layer is reduced, and the image quality of the duplicated images is reduced (in particular, the reproducibility of fine lines and letters is reduced). Further, when the light-sensitive material is used as an offset master, the occurrence of background stains becomes severe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, the resin (A) and the resin (B) which can be used in the present invention will be explained in detail below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Charge transporting material in the above-described laminated light-sensitive material include polyvinylcarbazole, oxazole dyes, pyrazoline dyes, and triphenylmethane dyes. The thickness of the charge transporting layer ranges from 5 to 40 μm, preferably from 10 to 30 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Resins to be used in the insulating layer or charge transporting layer typically include thermoplastic and thermosetting resins, e.g., polystyrene resins, polyester resins, cellulose resins, polyether resins, vinyl chloride resins, vinyl acetate resins, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer resins, polyacrylate resins, polyolefin resins, urethane resins, epoxy resins, melamine resins, and silicone resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The photoconductive layer according to the present invention can be provided on any known support. In general, a support for an electrophotographic light-sensitive layer is preferably electrically conductive. Any of conventionally employed conductive supports may be utilized in the present invention. Examples of usable conductive supports include a substrate (e.g., a metal sheet, paper, and a plastic sheet) having been rendered electrically conductive by, for example, impregnating with a low resistant substance; the above-described substrate with the back side thereof (opposite to the light-sensitive layer side) being rendered conductive and having further coated thereon at least one layer for the purpose of prevention of curling; the above-described substrate having provided thereon a water-resistant adhesive layer; the above-described substrate having provided thereon at least one precoat layer; and paper laminated with a conductive plastic film on which aluminum is vapor deposited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific examples of conductive supports and materials for imparting conductivity are described, for example, in Yukio Sakamoto, Denshishashin, 14, No. 1, pp. 2 to 11 (1975), Hiroyuki Moriga, Nyumon Tokushushi no Kagaku, Kobunshi Kankokai (1975), and M. F. Hoover, J. Macromol. Sci. Chem., A-4(6), pp. 1327 to 1417 (1970).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention will now be illustrated in greater detail with reference to the following examples, but it should be understood that the present invention is not to be construed as being limited thereto.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material was allowed to stand one day in the dark at 20° C., 65% RH. Then, the light-sensitive material subjected to the above described pre-exposure was charged to -5 kV, irradiated by scanning with a gallium-aluminum-arsenic semiconductor laser (oscillation wavelength: 780 nm) of 2.8 mW output as a light source in an exposure amount on the surface of 50 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>, at a pitch of 25 μm and a scanning speed of 330 meters/sec., and then developed using ELP-T (made by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) as a liquid developer followed by fixing. The duplicated image thus formed was visually evaluated for fog and image quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">*4) Printing Property:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Background Stains of Light-Sensitive Material:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After subjecting the photoconductive layer surface of the light-sensitive material to an oil-desensitizing treatment by passing once the light-sensitive material through an etching processor using a solution obtained by diluting twice an oil-desensitizing solution ELP-EX made by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.), the light-sensitive material was mounted on an offset printing machine (Oliver Type 52, manufactured by Sakurai Seisakusho K.K.) as an offset master plate for printing, and the extent of background stains formed on prints was visually evaluated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Printing Durability:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A printing plate was made from each light-sensitive material under the same condition as described above for the image-forming performance for testing pre-exposure fatigue resistance. Then, the photoconductive layer of the master plate was subjected to an oil-desensitizing treatment by passing twice the master plate through the etching processor using the oil-desensitizing solution EPL-EX. The plate was mounted on the offset printing machine in the same manner as described above as an offset master plate for printing, and the number of prints obtained without forming background stains on the non-image portions of the prints and without causing problems on the image quality of the image portions was determined (the larger the number of the prints, the better the printing property).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in Table 3, each of the electrophotographic light-sensitive materials according to the present invention had the photoconductive layer having a good smoothness. Also, at charging, uniform charging property was obtained without causing uneven charging. Also, under the condition of the light-sensitive material which had been pre-exposed prior to making a printing plate, the recovery was very good and the characteristics were almost the same as those under no light exposure. The actually duplicated images had no background fog and the duplicated image quality was clear. This is assumed to be based on that the photoconductive substance, the spectral sensitizer and the binder resin are absorbed each other in an optimum state and the absorbed state is stably maintained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, when the light-sensitive material is subjected to an oil-desensitizing treatment with an oil-desensitizing solution and the contact angle between the surface after the treatment and a water drop is measured, the contact angle is as small as 10 degree or below, which shows that the surface is sufficiently rendered hydrophilic. When printing was actually conducted, the background stain of the prints was not observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, when a printing plate precursor was prepared and used, each plate had good charging property and pre-exposed fatigue resistance, and duplicated image formed was clear and had no background fog. Thus, the oil-desensitization with an oil-desensitizing solution sufficiently proceeded and, after printing 10,000 prints, the prints had no background stains and showed clear image quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in Example 2, when the electrophotographic light-sensitive material of the present invention contained the resin (A') having the methacrylate component having the specific substituent, the charging property and the pre-exposure fatigue resistance were further improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, in Comparative Examples A and B using a known weight resin, uneven charging occurred under the severe condition. Also, the pre-exposure fatigue was large which influenced on the actual image forming performance to deteriorate the duplicated image (occurrence of background fog, cutting of fine lines and letters, lowering of density, etc.) Also, when the oil-desensitization by an oil-desensitizing solution was conducted, it was confirmed that the light-sensitive materials in the comparative examples showed no background stains on the prints, and the surface of the photoconductive layer was sufficiently rendered hydrophilic. However, when the printing plate prepared from the light-sensitive material was subjected to an oil-desensitizing treatment and used for printing as an offset master plate, prints showed background stains on the non-image portions from the first print and the image quality of the imaged portions was deteriorated (cutting of fine lines and letters, lowering of density, etc.). This shows that the reduction of the image quality of the master plate obtained by making printing plate appears on the prints as it is without being compensated by the oil-desensitizing treatment and, hence, the plate cannot be practically used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, in Comparative Example C using the conventionally known intermediate molecular weight resin, all the characteristics were inferior to the case of Comparative Examples A and B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, it can be seen that only the light-sensitive materials according to the present invention are excellent in all the points of the smoothness of the photoconductive layer, electrostatic characteristics, and printing property.</div>
