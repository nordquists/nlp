<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to an electrophotographic light-sensitive material, and more particularly to an electrophotographic light-sensitive material which is excellent in electrostatic characteristics and moisture resistance.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">An electrophotographic light-sensitive material may have various structures depending upon the characteristics required or an electrophotographic process to be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An electrophotographic system in which the light-sensitive material comprises a support having thereon at least one photoconductive layer and, if desired, an insulating layer on the surface thereof is widely employed. The electrophotographic light-sensitive material comprising a support and at least one photoconductive layer formed thereon is used for the image formation by an ordinary electrophotographic process including electrostatic charging, imagewise exposure, development, and, if desired, transfer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, a process using an electrophotographic light-sensitive material as an offset master plate precursor for direct plate making is widely practiced. In particular, a direct electrophotographic lithographic plate has recently become important as a system for printing on the order of from several hundreds to several thousands prints having a high image quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Binders which are used for forming the photoconductive layer of an electrophotographic light-sensitive material are required to be excellent in the film-forming properties by themselves and the capability of dispersing photoconductive powder therein. Also, the photoconductive layer formed using the binder is required to have satisfactory adhesion to a base material or support. Further, the photoconductive layer formed by using the binder is required to have various excellent electrostatic characteristics such as high charging capacity, small dark decay, large light decay, and less fatigue due to prior light-exposure and also have an excellent image forming properties, and the photoconductive layer stably maintains these electrostatic properties in spite of the change of humidity at the time of image formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, extensive studies have been made for lithographic printing plate precursors using an electrophotographic light-sensitive material, and for such a purpose, binder resins for a photoconductive layer which satisfy both the electrostatic characteristics as an electrophotographic light-sensitive material and printing properties as a printing plate precursor are required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, conventional binder resins used for electrophotographic light-sensitive materials have various problems particularly in electrostatic characteristics such as a charging property, dark charge retention characteristic and photosensitivity, and smoothness of the photoconductive layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to overcome the above problems, JP-A-63-217354, JP-A-1-70761 and JP-A-2-67563 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined Japanese patent application") disclose improvements in the smoothness of the photoconductive layer and electrostatic characteristics by using, as a binder resin, a resin having a low molecular weight and containing from 0.05 to 10% by weight of a copolymerizable component containing an acidic group in a side chain of the polymer, or a resin having a low molecular weight (i.e., a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of from 1×10<sup>3</sup> to 1×10<sup>4</sup>) and having an acidic group bonded at the terminal of the polymer main chain thereby obtaining an image having no background stains. Also, JP-A-1-100554 and JP-A-1 -214865 disclose a technique using, as a binder resin, a resin containing a polymerizable component containing an acidic group in a side chain of the copolymer or at the terminal of the polymer main chain and a polymerizable component having a heat- and/or photo-curable functional group; JP-A-1-102573 and JP-A-2-874 disclose a technique using a resin containing an acidic group in a side chain of the copolymer or at the terminal of the polymer main chain, and a crosslinking agent in combination; JP-A-64-564, JP-A-63-220149, JP-A-63-220148, JP-A-1-280761, JP-A-1-116643 and JP-A-1-169455 disclose a technique using the above-described resin having a low molecular weight (a weight average molecular weight of from 1×10<sup>3</sup> to 1×10<sup>4</sup>) and a resin having a high molecular weight (a weight average molecular weight of 1×10<sup>4</sup> or more) in combination; JP-A-1-211766 and JP-A-2-34859 disclose a technique using the above described low molecular weight resin and a heat- and/or photo-curable resin in combination; JP-A-2-53064, JP-A-2-56558 and JP-A-2-103056 disclose a technique using the above described low molecular weight resin and a comb-like polymer in combination; and JP-A-2-34860, JP-A-2-40660 and JP-A-2-96766 disclose a technique using the above-described low molecular resin and a resin previously crosslinked in combination. These references disclose that, according to the proposed technique, the film strength of the photoconductive layer can be increased sufficiently and also the mechanical strength of the light-sensitive material can be increased without adversely affecting the above-described electrostatic characteristics owing to the use of a resin containing an acidic group in a side chain of the copolymer or at the terminal of the polymer main chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, it has been found that, even in the case of using these resins, it is yet insufficient to keep the stable performance in the case of greatly changing the environmental conditions from high-temperature and high-humidity to low-temperature and low-humidity. In particular, in a scanning exposure system using a semiconductor laser beam, the exposure time becomes longer and also there is a restriction on the exposure intensity as compared to a conventional overall simultaneous exposure system using a visible light, and hence a higher performance has been required for the electrostatic characteristics, in particular, the dark charge retention characteristics and photosensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, when the scanning exposure system using a semiconductor laser beam is applied to hitherto known light-sensitive materials for electrophotographic lithographic printing plate precursors, various problems may occur in that the difference between E<sub>1/2</sub> and E<sub>1/10</sub> is particularly large and the contrast of the reproduced image is decreased, in addition to the insufficient electrostatic characteristics described above. Moreover, it is difficult to reduce the remaining potential after exposure, which results in severe fog formation in duplicated images, and when employed as offset masters, edge marks of originals pasted up appear on the prints.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention has been made for solving the problems of conventional electrophotographic light-sensitive materials as described above and meeting the requirement for the light-sensitive materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic light-sensitive material having stable and excellent electrostatic characteristics and giving clear good images even when the environmental conditions during the formation of duplicated images are changed to a low-temperature and low-humidity or to high-temperature and high-humidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object of the present invention is to provide a CPC electrophotographic light-sensitive material having excellent electrostatic characteristics and showing less environmental dependency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A further object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic light-sensitive material effective for a scanning exposure system using a semiconductor laser beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A still further object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic lithographic printing plate precursor having excellent electrostatic characteristics (in particular, dark charge retention reproducing, faithfully duplicated images to original, forming neither overall background stains, dotted background stains nor edgemarks of original pasted up on prints, and showing excellent printing durability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It has been found that the above described objects of the present invention are accomplished by an electrophotographic light-sensitive material comprising a support having provided thereon a photoconductive layer containing at least an inorganic photoconductive substance and a binder resin, wherein the binder resin comprises (1) at least one AB block copolymer (Resin (A)) having a weight average molecular weight of from 1×10<sup>3</sup> to 2×10<sup>4</sup> and composed of an A block comprising at least one polymer component containing at least one acidic group selected from --PO<sub>3</sub> H<sub>2</sub>, --COOH, --SO<sub>3</sub> H, a phenolic hydroxy group, ##STR4## (wherein R represents a hydrocarbon group or --OR' (wherein R' represents a hydrocarbon group)) and a cyclic acid anhydride-containing group, and a B block containing at least a polymer component represented by the following general formula (I): ##STR5## wherein R<sub>1</sub> represents a hydrocarbon group; and (2) at least one resin (Resin (B)) having a weight average molecular weight of 5×10<sup>4</sup> or more, containing a repeating unit represented by the general formula (III) described below, as a copolymerizable component, and having a crosslinked structure made before the preparation of a dispersion for forming the photoconductive layer: ##STR6## wherein T<sub>2</sub> represents --COO--, --OCO--, --CH<sub>2</sub> OCO--, --CH<sub>2</sub> COO--, --O--, or --SO<sub>2</sub> --; R<sub>3</sub> represents a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 22 carbon atoms; and d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub>, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a cyano group, a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, --COOZ<sub>4</sub>, or --COOZ<sub>4</sub> bonded through a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, wherein Z<sub>4</sub> represents a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The binder resin which can be used in the present invention comprises at least (1) an AB block copolymer (hereinafter referred to as resin (A)) composed of an A block comprising a component containing the above described specific acidic group and a B block comprising a polymerizable component represented by the above described general formula (I) and (2) a high molecular weight resin (hereinafter referred to as resin (B)) having the crosslinked structure previously made.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the low molecular weight resin (A) is a low molecular weight resin (hereinafter sometimes referred to as resin (A')) containing an acidic group-containing component and a methacrylate component having a specific substituent containing a benzene ring which has a specific substituent(s) at the 2-position or 2-and 6-positions thereof or a specific substituent containing an unsubstituted naphthalene ring represented by the following general formula (Ia) or (Ib): ##STR7## wherein A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> each represents a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, --COZ<sub>2</sub> or --COOZ<sub>2</sub>, wherein Z<sub>2</sub> represents a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms; and B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> each represents a mere bond or a linking group containing from 1 to 4 linking atoms, which connects --COO-- and the benzene ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the resin (B) is a resin in which at least one polymer main chain has at least one polar group selected from --PO<sub>3</sub> H<sub>2</sub>, --SO<sub>3</sub> H, --COOH, --OH, --SH, ##STR8## (wherein R<sub>0</sub> represents a hydrocarbon group or --OR<sub>0</sub> ', wherein R<sub>0</sub> ' represents a hydrocarbon group), a cyclic acid anhydride-containing group, --CHO, --CONH<sub>2</sub>, --SO<sub>2</sub> NH<sub>2</sub>, and ##STR9## (wherein e<sub>1</sub> and e<sub>2</sub>, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group) at only one terminal thereof (hereinafter sometimes referred to as resin (B')).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The resin (A) used in the present invention is an AB block copolymer, the A block is composed of at least one polymerizable component containing at least one acidic group selected from the above-described specific acidic groups and the B block is composed of a polymerizable- component containing at least one of the methacrylate components represented by the general formula (I) described above, and the resin (A) has a weight average molecular weight of from 1×10<sup>3</sup> to 2×10<sup>4</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above described conventional low molecular weight resin of acidic group-containing binder resins which were known to improve the smoothness of the photoconductive layer and the electrostatic characteristics was a resin wherein acidic group-containing polymerizable components exist at random in the polymer main chain, or a resin wherein an acidic group was bonded to only one terminal of the polymer main chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, the resin (A) used for the binder resin of the present invention is a copolymer wherein the acidic groups contained in the resin do not exist at random in the polymer main chain or the acidic group is not bonded to one terminal of the polymer main chain, but the acidic groups are further specified in such a manner that the acidic groups exist as a block in the polymer main chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is presumed that, in the copolymer (resin (A)) used in the present invention, the domain of the portion of the acidic groups maldistributed at one terminal portion of the main chain of the polymer is sufficiently adsorbed on the stoichiometric defect of the inorganic photoconductive substance and other block portion constituting the polymer main chain mildly but sufficiently cover the surface of the photoconductive substance. Also, it is presumed that, even when the stoichiometric defect portion of the inorganic photoconductive substance varies to some extents, it always keeps a stable interaction between the inorganic photoconductive substance and the copolymer (resin (A)) used in the present invention since the copolymer has the above described sufficient adsorptive domain by the function and mechanism as described above. Thus, it has been found that, according to the present invention, the traps of the inorganic photoconductive substance are more effectively and sufficiently compensated and the humidity characteristics of the photoconductive substance are improved as compared with conventionally known acidic group-containing resins. Further, in the present invention, particles of the inorganic photoconductive substance are sufficiently dispersed in the binder to restrain the occurrence of the aggregation of the particles of the photoconductive substance. In addition, the excellent electrophotographic characteristics are stably maintained even when the environmental conditions are greatly changed from high-temperature and high-humidity to low-temperature and low-humidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, the resin (B) serves to sufficiently heighten the mechanical strength of the photoconductive layer, which may be insufficient in case of using the resin (A) alone, without damaging the excellent electrophotographic characteristics attained by the use of the resin (A). Further, the excellent image forming performance can be maintained even when the environmental conditions are greatly changed as described above or in the case of conducting a scanning exposure system using a laser beam of low power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, according to the present invention, the smoothness of the photoconductive layer is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When an electrophotographic light-sensitive material having a photoconductive layer with a rough surface is used as an electrophotographic lithographic printing plate precursor, the dispersion state of inorganic particles such as zinc oxide particles as photoconductive substance and a binder resin is improper and thus a photoconductive layer is formed in a state containing aggregates of the photoconductive substance, whereby the surface of the non-image portions of the photoconductive layer is not uniformly and sufficiently rendered hydrophilic by applying thereto an oil-desensitizing treatment with an oil-desensitizing solution to cause attaching of printing ink at printing, which results in the formation of background stains at the non-image portions of prints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, it has been found that excellent photosensitivity can be obtained according to the present invention, as compared with the random copolymer resin containing the acidic groups in a side chain thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since spectral sensitizing dyes which are used for giving light sensitivity in the region of visible light to infrared light have a function of sufficiently showing the spectral sensitizing action by adsorbing on photoconductive particles, it can be assumed that the binder resin according to the present invention makes suitable interaction with photoconductive particles without hindering the adsorption of spectral sensitizing dyes onto the photoconductive particles. This effect is particularly remarkable in cyanine dyes or phthalocyanine pigments which are particularly effective as spectral sensitizing dyes for sensitization in the region of from near infrared to infrared.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is believed that the excellent characteristics of the electrophotographic light-sensitive material may be obtained by employing the resin (A) and the resin (B) as binder resins for the inorganic photoconductive substance, wherein the weight average molecular weight of the resins, and the content and position of the acidic groups therein are specified, whereby the strength of interactions between the inorganic photoconductive substance and the resins can be appropriately controlled. More specifically, it is believed that the electrophotographic characteristics and mechanical strength of the layer can be greatly improved as described above by the fact that the resin (A) having a relatively strong interaction to the inorganic photoconductive substance selectively adsorbs thereon; whereas, the resin (B) having the adequately crosslinked structure causes an interaction between the polymer chains and the resin (B') further having the polar group at only one terminal of the main chain further causes a weak interaction between the polar group and the inorganic photoconductive particle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In case of using the resin (A'), the electrophotographic characteristics, particularly, V<sub>10</sub> DRR and E<sub>1/10</sub> of the electrophotographic material can be furthermore improved as compared with the use of the resin (A). While the reason for this fact is not fully clear, it is believed that the polymer molecular chain of the resin (A') is suitable arranged on the surface of inorganic photoconductive substance such as zinc oxide in the layer depending on the plane effect of the benzene ring having a substituent at the ortho position or the naphthalene ring which is an ester component of the methacrylate whereby the above described improvement is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If the low molecular weight resin (A) according to the present invention is used alone as the binder resin, the resin can sufficiently adsorb onto the photoconductive substance and cover the surface thereof and thus, the photoconductive layer formed is excellent in the surface smoothness and electrostatic characteristics, provides images free from background fog and maintains a sufficient film strength for a CPC light-sensitive material or for an offset printing plate precursor giving several thousands of prints. When the resin (B) is employed together with the resin (A) in accordance with the present invention, the mechanical strength of the photoconductive layer, which may be yet insufficient by the use of the resin (A) alone, can be further increased without damaging the above-described high performance of the electrophotographic characteristics due to the resin (A). Therefore, the electrophotographic light-sensitive material of the present invention can maintain the excellent electrostatic characteristics even when the environmental conditions are widely changed, possess a sufficient film strength and form a printing plate which provides more than 8,000 prints under severe printing conditions, for example, when high printing pressure is applied in a large size printing machine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, the resin (A) used in the present invention will be described in more detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The content of the polymer component containing the specific acidic group in the AB block copolymer (resin (A)) of the present invention is preferably from 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, and more preferably from 3 to 15 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the copolymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If the content of the acidic group in the resin (A) is less than 0.5% by weight, the initial potential is low and thus satisfactory image density can not be obtained. On the other hand, if the content of the acidic group is larger than 20% by weight, various undesirable problems may occur, for example, the dispersibility is reduced, the film smoothness and the electrostatic characteristics under high humidity condition are reduced, and further when the light-sensitive material is used as an offset master plate, the occurrence of background stains increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The content of the methacrylate component represented by the general formula (I) in the block portion (B block) containing the methacrylate component represented by the general formula (I) is preferably from 30 to 100% by weight, and more preferably from 50 to 100% by weight based on the total weight of the B block.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The weight average molecular weight of the AB block copolymer (resin (A)) is from 1×10<sup>3</sup> to 2×10<sup>4</sup>, and preferably from 2×10<sup>3</sup> to 1×10<sup>4</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If the weight average molecular weight of the resin (A) is less than 1×10<sup>3</sup>, the film-forming property of the resin is lowered, thereby a sufficient film strength cannot be maintained. On the other hand, if the weight average molecular weight of the resin (A) is higher than 2×10<sup>4</sup>, the effect of the resin (A) of the present invention is reduced, thereby the electrostatic characteristics thereof become almost the same as those of conventionally known resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The glass transition point of the resin (A) is preferably from -10° C. to 100° C., and more preferably from -5° C. to 85° C.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in Table 7 above, each of the electrophotographic light-sensitive material according to the present invention had good electrostatic characteristics and provided the clear duplicated images having good image quality without background fog.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, in the electrophotographic light-sensitive materials in Comparative Examples A and B, the initial potential (V<sub>10</sub>) and the photosensitivity (E<sub>1/10</sub> and E<sub>1/100</sub>) were lowered, and the density (D<sub>M</sub>) of the duplicated images was lowered, whereby fine lines and letters were blurred and also background fog was formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In particular, the E<sub>1/100</sub> value of the light-sensitive material according to the present invention is quite different from that of the light-sensitive material for comparison.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The value of E<sub>1/100</sub> indicates an electrical potential remaining in the non-image areas after exposure at the practice of image formation. The smaller this value, the less the background stains in the non-image areas. More specifically, it is requested that the remaining potential is decreased to -10 V or less. Therefore, an amount of exposure necessary to make the remaining potential below -10 V is an important factor. In the scanning exposure system using a semiconductor laser beam, it is quite important to make the remaining potential below -10 V by a small exposure amount in view of a design for an optical system of a duplicator (such as cost of the device, and accuracy of the optical system).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above-described results indicate that, only when the binder resin according to the present invention is used, the electrophotographic light-sensitive materials having satisfactory electrostatic characteristics are obtained. Furthermore, in the case of using the binder resin according to the present invention, it has been noted that the electrophotographic light-sensitive material of Example 2 using the resin (A') containing methacrylate component having the specific substituent exhibits better electrostatic characteristics than the electrophotographic light-sensitive material of Example 1 and, in particular, the former case is more advantageous in the semiconductor laser light scanning exposure system.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The evaluations described in Table 8 were conducted as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">*3): Smoothness of Photoconductive Layer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The smoothness (sec/cc) of the electrophotographic light-sensitive material was measured using a Back's smoothness test machine (manufactured by Kumagaya Riko K.K.) under an air volume condition of 1 cc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">*4) Contact Angle with Water</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the photoconductive layer of the electrophotographic light-sensitive material was subjected to an oil-desensitizing treatment by passing once through an etching processor using a solution formed by diluting an oil-desensitizing solution ELP-EX (made by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) to a 2-fold volume with distilled water, a water drop of 2 μl of distilled water was placed on the surface and the contact angle with the water drop formed was measured with a goniometer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">*5): Printing Durability</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material was subjected to plate making in the same manner as the image-forming performance in the above-described *2) to form a toner image and then subjected an oil-desensitizing treatment under the same condition as in *4) above. The printing plate thus prepared was mounted on an offset printing machine (Oliver 52 Type manufactured by Sakurai Seisakusho K.K.) as an offset master plate followed by printing. The number of prints obtained without the occurrence of background stains at the non-image portions and problems on the image quality of the image portions of the prints was referred to as the printing durability. (The larger the number of prints, the better the printing durability.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in Table 8 above, the electrophotographic light-sensitive material according to the present invention has the good smoothness, of the photoconductive layer and the good electrostatic characteristics, and provides the clear duplicated images without background fog. This is presumed to be obtained by that the binder resin is sufficiently adsorbed onto particles of the photoconductive substance and the binder resin coats the surface of the particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, when the light-sensitive material is used as an offset master plate precursor, an oil-desensitizing treatment with an oil-desensitizing solution sufficiently proceeded and the contact angle between the non-image portion and a water drop was as small as less than 10 degree, which indicated the non-image portion was sufficiently rendered hydrophilic. When the plate was actually used for printing, no background stains was observed on the prints obtained and 10,000 prints having a clear image quality were obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above results indicate that the film strength is greatly improved by the action of the resin (B) without damaging the action of the resin (A).</div>
