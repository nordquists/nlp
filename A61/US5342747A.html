<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a silver halide color photographic material. More particularly, the present invention relates to a silver halide color photographic material which provides improvements in color reproducibility and preservability.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In general, a silver halide color photographic material comprises silver halide emulsion layers sensitive to three primary colors, i.e., red, green and blue, respectively. In such a silver halide color photographic material, a color image is reproduced in the so-called subtractive process in which three couplers in these emulsion layers are developed to colors complementary to the corresponding colors to which these layers are sensitive. The color image obtained by the photographic processing of such a silver halide color photographic material normally comprises an azomethine dye or indoaniline dye produced by the reaction of an oxidation product of an aromatic primary amine color developing agent with a coupler.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the silver halide color photographic material, a phenolic or naphtholic coupler is used to form a cyan dye image. However, since these couplers undesirablly exhibit absorption in the blue or green range, they have a great disadvantage in that they cause a remarkable drop in the color reproducibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a means of solving this problem, European Patent 249,453A2 has proposed use of 2,4-diphenylimidazoles as couplers. Dyes produced from these couplers exhibit less undesirable absorption in the short wavelength range than the conventional dyes and thus are preferable in color reproduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, these couplers, too, leave much to be desired in color reproducibility. These couplers also have practical problems in that they exhibit a low coupling activity and a remarkably low fastness to heat and light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, pyrazoloazole cyan couplers as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,183 exhibit less undesirable absorption in the short wavelength range than the conventional dyes but leave much to be desired in color development and color reproducibility as cyan couplers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the course of studies of eliminating the abovedescribed defects, it was found that when the color-forming ability of the couplers is improved, the unexposed portion tends to be cyan-colored (so-called "cyan stain") with a passage of time after development.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, these couplers leave much to be desired in the recent high requirements such as color development, color reproducibility and fastness.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a silver halide color photographic material having an excellent color reproducibility and an improved preservability after development.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is another object of the present invention to provide a silver halide color photographic material which exhibits reduced cyan stain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a silver halide color photographic material which exhibits improved color development and fastness and reduced yellow stain on the non-image portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a silver halide color photographic material which exhibits reduced fog.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention will be further described hereinafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Some explanation will now be given to Hammett's substituent constant σ<sub>p</sub> as used herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Hammett's rule is an empirical rule which was proposed by L. P. Hammett in 1935 to quantitatively discuss the effects of substituents on the reaction or equilibrium of benzene derivatives. This rule is now widely regarded as appropriate. Substituent constants determined by Hammett's rule include σ<sub>p</sub> value and σm value. These values can be found in many references. For example, J. A. Dean, "Lange's Handbook of Chemistry", 12th ed., 1979, McGraw-Hill, and "Kagaku no Ryoiki (Domain of Chemistry)", additional issue, No. 122, pp. 96-103, 1979, Nankodo, detail these substituent constants. In the present invention, each substituent is defined or explained by Hammett's substituent constant σp. However, this does not mean that each substituent is limited to those having known values found in these references. It goes without saying that there are included substituents whose substituent constant will fall within the above specified range as routinely determined on the basis of Hammett's rule even if their substituent constant values are unknown in these references.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compound of the present invention represented by the general formula (I) or (II) is not a benzene derivative. However, the σ<sub>p</sub> value will be used herein as a measure of the indication of the electronic effect of substituents regardless of the substitution position. The σ<sub>p</sub> value will be so defined hereinafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The term "lipophilic compound" as used herein means a "compound having a water solubility of 10 % or less at room temperature".</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The term "heterocyclic" as used herein refers to a ring having at least one hetero-atom as a member of the ring and includes an aromatic groups. The heterocyclic ring generally has 0 to 70 carbon atoms, preferably 0 to 50 carbon atoms and more preferably 0 to 30 carbon atoms, which may be substituted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The term "substituent group" where an aliphatic group, an aromatic group or a heterocyclic ring may be substituted means any group which can be attached as a substituent group to the aliphatic group, the aromatic group or the heterocyclic ring unless otherwise indicated. Examples of the substituent group include an aliphatic group, an aromatic group, a heterocyclic group, an acyl group, an acyloxy group, an acylamino group, an aliphatic oxy group, an aromatic oxy group, a heterocyclic oxy group, an aliphatic oxycarbonyl group, an aromatic oxycarbonyl group, a heterocyclic oxycarbonyl group, an aliphatic carbamoyl group, an aromatic carbamoyl group, an aliphatic sulfonyl group, an aromatic sulfonyl group, an aliphatic sulfamoyl group, an aromatic sulfamoyl group, an aliphatic sulfonamido group, an aromatic sulfonamido group, an aliphatic amino group, an aromatic amino group, an aliphatic sulfinyl group, an aromatic sulfinyl group, an aliphatic thio group, an aromatic thio group, a mercapto group, a hydroxyl group, a cyano group, a nitro group, a hydroxy amino group and a halogen atom.</div>

For example, color development, desilvering, and rinsing are conducted. In the desilvering process, a blix process with a blix solution can be conducted instead of a bleach process with a bleaching solution and a fixing process with a fixing solution. The bleach process, fixing process and blix process can be conducted in any order. Stabilizing may be conducted instead of or after rinsing. Alternatively, a monobath processing process in which color development, bleach and fixing are conducted in a single bath with a combined developing, bleaching and fixing solution can be used. In combination with these processing steps, a pre-hardening step, its neutralizing step, a stop-fixing step, an after-hardening step, an adjusting step, and an intensification step may be effected. An intermediate rinsing step may be arbitrarily provided between these steps. In these steps, the so-called activator processing step may be substituted for the color development step.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The results in Table A show that the couplers of the present invention exhibit a higher color density than the comparative couplers ExC, R-1 and R-2. It was visually confirmed that with respect to the hue of dyes thus formed, all the couplers of the present invention exhibit a clear hue with little turbidity as compared with the comparative coupler ExC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Both the comparative couplers R-1 and R-2 exhibit a low color density. The addition of the additives of the present invention tends to further lower the color density of these comparative couplers undesirably. The comparative specimens free of the additives of the present invention exhibit little improvement in the inhibition of stain shortly after processing and a slight improvement in the inhibition of stain with time during storage at 60° C. and 70% RH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The magenta-coloring pyrrolotriazole coupler (M-1) does not exhibit too great an improvement in the inhibition of stain shortly after processing and with time during storage at 60° C. and 70% RH, either.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, although the cyan coupler of the present invention exhibits a high color density, it is disadvantageous in that it gives much stain (particularly stain with time during storage at 60° C. and 70% RH) when used alone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The results in Table A show that when used in combination with the additives of the present invention, the cyan coupler of the present invention exhibits little drop in the color density as compared with the comparative couplers R-2 and R-3. It was also shown that when used in combination with the additives of the present invention, the cyan coupler of the present invention exhibits a remarkably great improvement in the inhibition of stain shortly after processing and with time during storage at 60° C. and 70% RH as compared with the comparative couplers R-2 and R-3. This demonstrates that the additives of the present invention are extremely effective for pyrrolotriazole cyan couplers.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Further, Specimens were prepared in the same manner as the above mentioned specimens except that the magenta coupler ExM-1 or ExM-2 to be incorporated in the 6th layer or 7th layer was replaced by ExM-3 shown below in an equimolecular amount and the yellow coupler ExY-1 to be incorporated in the 11th layer or 12th layer was replaced by ExY-5 shown below in an equimolecular amount. ##STR19##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These specimens were exposed to light, and then developed in the same manner as in Example 2 of JP-A-1-158431, and then evaluated for cyan stain in the same manner as in the present Example 1. As a result, it was shown that the combinations according to the present invention exhibit substantially no cyan stain. This demonstrates that the compounds of the present invention exert excellent effects also in this light-sensitive material system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned above, silver halide color photographic materials comprising a combination of a pyrrolotriazole cyan coupler of the present invention represented by the general formulae (I) or (II) and compounds of the present invention represented by the general formulae (A) to (D) exhibit reduced cyan fog and cyan stain with time and an excellent fastness of color image.</div>
