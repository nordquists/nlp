<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing an electrophotographic photoreceptor.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the electrophotographic photoreceptor used for a copying machine, a laser printer, and an LED printer, in which an electrophotographic system is used, there has so far been involved the problem that a charging performance is inferior and a stability in a repeated use is short when an organic compound is used as a charge generating material. Particularly in recent years, a process in which the surface of a conductive substrate is roughened by various means is applied in a photoreceptor for the laser printer in order to prevent the generation of an interference fringe. In this case, there used to be involved the problems that the coating defects such as a resist spot and a convex portion formed by foreign matter generate when a charge generating layer is coated on the roughened substrate surface and that the local injection of a charge from a substrate generates a black spot and a blank area on an image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is generally known as the means for solving these problems to provide a subbing layer between a conductive substrate and a charge generating layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">There are known as the material for forming the subbing layer, a thermoplastic resin such as polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl methyl ether, polyamide, thermoplastic polyester, a phenoxy resin, casein, gelatin, and cellulose nitrate, and a thermosetting resin such as polyimide, polyethyleneimine, an epoxy resin, a melamine resin, a phenol resin, and a polyurethane resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, in the case where these resins are used to form the subbing layer, the increase in a layer thickness to improve a charging performance, a coating performance, and a controlling performance for an image quality defect causes the reduction of a sensitivity and the increase in a residual potential in a repeated use. Meanwhile, in the case where the layer thickness is decreased in order to improve these characteristics, there is involved the problem that the charging performance, the coating performance, and the image quality defect can not sufficiently be controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, there has been tried the method in which the organic or inorganic conductive particles are dispersed in a resin in order to avoid the problems caused when the thickness of the subbing layer is increased but an expected performance has not been able to obtain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the contrary, it is known as shown in JP-A-61-94057 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application) that the use of the subbing layer containing an organic metal compound as a main component can control a coating defect and an image quality defect without causing the reduction of a sensitivity and the increase in a residual potential.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case where there is applied the method in which the coating solution comprising an organic metal compound and a silane coupling agent is used for coating and drying to form the subbing layer, the hardening degree of the subbing layer is under the control of an environment after coating to a large extent. That is, the subbing layer dried at a lower temperature after coating has the lower hardening degree. Further, it was found that in an electrophotographic photoreceptor comprising a photosensitive layer provided on this subbing layer, a residual potential at an initial stage is high under a low temperature and a low humidity and that a residual potential in a repeated use is markedly increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in case of the subbing layer containing only an organic metal compound as a main component, the layer obtained after coating and drying is liable to crack and therefore it is difficult to increase a layer thickness to about 0.3 μm or more. Meanwhile, in the case where a photosensitive layer is formed on the conductive substrate having the surface which is toughened for the measure to prevent an interference fringe as described above, the subbing layer is required to have a layer thickness thick enough to sufficiently cover an irregularity on a substrate surface. However, the subbing layer containing the above organic metal compound as the main component can not meet it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">There is disclosed in JP-A-2-59767, the subbing layer comprising an organic titanium compound, a silane coupling agent and a polyvinyl acetal resin, and the subbing layers having the thickness of 1 to 3 μm are shown in the examples. However, according to the investigations by the present inventors, it has been found that the reduction of a sensitivity particularly under a low temperature and a low humidity and the increase in a residual potential are notable at the added amount of the polyvinyl acetal resin shown there.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention has been made for the purpose to solve the above mentioned problems in the conventional techniques.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">A subbing layer-forming coating solution can be prepared by mixing the above organic metal compound and silane coupling agent and the binding resin according to necessity and then diluting with a solvent, wherein the organic metal compound, the silane coupling agent and the binding resin each may be used singly or in the mixture of two or more kinds.

<div class="description-paragraph">The above subbing layer-forming coating solution is applied on a conductive substrate by, for example, a spray coating method and a dip coating-method and then dried. In the present invention, it is required to carry out coating under an environment having a dew-point temperature in the range of from 5° C. to 10° C. and carry out drying under an environment having a dew-point temperature in the range of from 10° C. to 20° C. The environmental dew-point temperatures higher than the above ranges in coating and drying cause blushing (the phenomenon in which since a solvent absorbs a heat when it is vaporized and the surface temperature of a coated layer is lowered, moisture in air is condensed for dew formation and adsorbed on the surface of the layer to make the layer irregular or bore a hole and make the layer white). The temperatures lower than the above ranges increase the residual potential of the resulting electrophotographic photoreceptor and deteriorates the characteristics in a repeated use. In the present invention, the coating of the subbing layer-forming coating solution is carried out preferably in the temperature range of from 20° C. to 25° C. and the drying of the coated solution is carried out preferably in the temperature range of from 150° C. to 200° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The layer thickness of the subbing layer is arbitrarily set in the range of from 0.1 to 10 μm. The range of 0.5 to 1 μm is particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Subsequently, a photosensitive layer is formed on the subbing layer thus formed. In the case where the photosensitive layer consists of a charge generating layer and a charge transporting layer, either may be provided earlier in the laminating sequence thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">There are independently prepared and coated on the above mentioned subbing layer, a charge generating layer-forming coating solution obtained by dispersing and dissolving a charge generating material and a binder resin in a solvent and a charge transporting layer-forming coating solution obtained by dispersing and dissolving a charge transporting material and a binder resin in a solvent, followed by drying, whereby the charge generating layer and the charge transporting layer are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific examples of the solvent which can be used for preparing photosensitive layers such as a charge generating layer and a charge transporting layer include alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol); ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and cyclohexanone); amides (e.g., N,N-dimethylformamide, and N,N-dimethylacetoamide); dimethylsulfoxides; ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and ethylene glycol monomethylether); esters (e.g., methyl acetate and ethyl acetate); aliphatic hydrocarbonhalides (e.g., chloroform, methylene chloride, dichloroethylene, tetrachlorocarbon, and trichloroethylene); and aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene, toluene, monochlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">There can be used as the charge generating material, for example, an azo dye such as Chlorodian Blue, a quinone pigment such as anthoanthorone and pyrenequinone, a quinocyanine pigment, a perylene pigment, an indigo pigment, a bisbenzimidazole pigment, a phthalocyanie pigment such as a copper phthalocyanine, vanadyl phthalocyanine, and titanyl phthalocyanine, an azulenium salt, a squarylium pigment, and a quinacridone pigment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">There can be used as the charge transporting material, for example, a polycyclic aromatic compound such as anthracene, pyrene, and phenanthrene, a compound having a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, such as indole, carbazole, and imidazole, a pyrazoline compound, a hydrazone compound, a triphenylmethane compound, a triphenylamine compound, an enamine compound, and a stilbene compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Anyone can be applied as the binding resin as long as it has a layer-forming character, and there can be used, for example, polyester, polysulfone, polycarbonate, and polymethyl methacrylate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Anyone can be used as the solvent as long as it is publicly known.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above charge generating layer-forming coating solution and charge transporting layer-forming coating solution are coated on the subbing layer formed on a conductive substrate by, for example, a spray coating method and a dip coating method, and then dried. Similarly to the case in forming the above mentioned subbing layer, it is required to carry out the coating under an environment having a dew-point temperature in the range of 5° to 10° C. and carry out the drying under an environment having a dew-point temperature in the range of 10° to 20° C. The environmental dew-point temperatures higher than the above ranges in coating and drying cause blushing, and the temperatures lower than the above ranges increase the residual potential of the resulting electrophotographic photoreceptor and deteriorates the characteristics in a repeated use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In case of the charge generating layer formation, coating is carried out preferably in the temperature range of from 20° C. to 25° C. and drying is carried out preferably in the temperature range of from 80° C. to 120° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In case of the charge transporting layer formation, coating is carried out preferably in the temperature range of from 20° C. to 25° C. and drying is carried out preferably in the temperature range of from 100° C. to 150° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Usually, the layer thickness of the charge generating layer is arbitrarily set in the range of from 0.1 to 5 μm. The range of 0.2 to 2 μm is particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The layer thickness of the charge transporting layer is arbitrarily set in the range of from 5 to 30 μm. The range of 15 to 25 μm is particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the process of the present invention, a dew-point temperature controlling apparatus as shown in FIG. 2 may be used for controlling the dew-point temperature. In FIG. 2, the dew-point temperature controlling apparatus 11 is composed of filter 12 for removing a foreign matter from air which is taken into from outside, cooling means 13, heating coil 14, temperature controlling means 15 for controlling the heating temperature at the heating coil 14, humidifying/drying means 17, and humidity controlling means 18. Temperature in the apparatus can appropriately be controlled by monitoring the temperature of emission air with temperature sensor 16 which is set at the emission part. Further, humidity of the intake air can be controlled by means of 17 and 18, and the suitable dew-point temperature can be maintained by means of humidity sensor 19.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The dew-point temperature controlling apparatus 11 can be set at a coating/drying system so that the air controlled to a suitable dew-point temperature is supplied to the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, air having the above dew-point temperature ranges is used as the environment in applying the subbing layer-forming coating solution, the charge generating layer-forming coating solution and the charge transporting layer-forming coating solution and in drying the coated layers thus formed, whereby the resulting electrophotographic photoreceptor has excellent electrophotographic characteristics. That is, the electrophotographic photoreceptor does not cause the increase in a residual potential in a repeated use and shows a stable charging performance and a low residual potential at a high temperature and a high humidity through a low temperature and a low humidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention will be explained below in more details with reference to the examples and the comparative examples. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts are by weight.</div>
