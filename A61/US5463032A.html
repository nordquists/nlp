<div class="description-paragraph">Bisazo compounds having a vinyl sulfone reactive group are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,698,421 and EP-A-76782.

<div class="description-paragraph">Cellulose fibers can be also dyed with the compound of the present invention by a padding method. In this case, cellulose fibers are padded at a room temperature or elevated temperatures, dried and then subjected to steaming or dry heating to effect dye fixation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Cellulose fibers can also be printed with the compound of the present invention. Printing of cellulose fibers can be carried out, for example, in one-phase by printing the cellulose fibers with a printing paste containing the compound of the present invention and an acid binding agent such as sodium bicarbonate, and steaming the printed cellulose fibers at 95° to 160° C. Alternatively, printing of cellulose fibers can also be conducted in two-phase by printing the cellulose fibers with a neutral or weakly acidic printing paste containing the compound of the present invention, either passing the printed cellulose fibers through a hot alkaline bath containing an electrolyte or over-padding the printed cellulose fibers with an alkaline padding liquor containing an electrolyte, and carrying out steaming or dry-heating treatments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For preparation of the printing paste, a thickner or emulsifier, such as sodium alginate or starch ether, is used; and a conventional printing assistant, such as urea, and/or a dispersant may optionally be used incorporated therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Acid binding agents suitable for fixing the compound of the present invention onto cellulose fibers include water-soluble basic salts formed between an alkali or alkaline earth metal and an inorganic or organic acid, or a compound which liberates alkali in a heated state. Preferred are alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of inorganic or organic acids of weak or medium strength. Of these, sodium compounds and potassium compounds are particularly preferred. Specific examples of such acid binding agents are sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium formate, potassium carbonate, sodium primary, secondary and tertiary phosphates, sodium silicate, sodium trichloroacetate, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Synthetic and natural polyamide and polyurethane fibers also can be dyed with the compound of the present invention. Dyeing of these fibers can be carried out by performing exhaustion in an acidic or weakly acidic bath at a controlled pH value and then neutralizing the bath or, in some cases alkalifying the bath, to effect the fixation. The dyeing can be carried out usually at a temperature of 60° to 120° C. In order to achieve the level dyeing, there may be used a conventional level dyeing agent, such as a condensation product between cyanuric chloride and 3 times by mole of either aminobenzenesulfonic acid or aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid, or an addition product between stearylamine and ethylene oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compound of the present invention is characterized in that it exhibits excellent performances in dyeing and printing fiber materials. It is especially useful for dyeing cellulose fiber materials and gives a dyed product excellent in light fastness, perspiration-light fastness, wet fastness, such as washing resistance, peroxide-washing resistance, perspiration resistance, acid hydrolysis resistance and alkali resistance, and besides, in chlorine fastness, abrasion fastness and iron fastness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compound is further characterized by excellent build-up, level-dyeing and washing-off properties, high solubility as well as high exhaustion and fixation percentages. Moreover, it is characterized in that it is hardly affected by changes in dyeing temperature, the amount of neutral salts or acid binding agents and the dyeing bath ratio, so that a dyed product with a stable quality can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, the compound of the present invention is characterized in that the dyed product obtained therefrom is resistant to color change at the time of fixing treatment or resin finishing and resistant to the change due to contact with basic substances during storage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the compound of the present invention exhibits excellent build-up property and excellent alkali resistance in cold batch-up dyeing. It shows virtually no difference in concentration and hue between fixation at low temperature and that at 25° C., and is hardly hydrolyzed by an alkaline agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compound of the present invention can be used, if necessary, in admixture with other dyes to obtain an intended hue. The dyes to be used in admixture are not particularly limited and may be any reactive dyes known in the art.
