<div class="description-paragraph">This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/070,702 filed on Jun. 2, 1993, now abandoned.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a color photographic material and, more particularly, to a color photographic material which can provide color photographs wherein the color reproduction performed is highly satisfactory and the dyes formed have high stability.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Photosensitive materials, such as color photographic paper and the like, are generally provided with emulsion layers which comprise silver halide emulsions sensitive to rays of light in blue, green and red wavelength regions respectively, and therein are formed color images by incorporating into said emulsion layers so-called color couplers which can form their individual dyes by undergoing the coupling reaction with the oxidized developing agent which is produced upon development of the optically exposed silver halide emulsions. (In the incorporation of color couplers, each coupler is generally combined with the emulsion layer whose photosensitivity is in the wavelength region the color of which bears a complementary-color relationship to the dye formed from said color coupler.) As for the dye-forming couplers, pivaloylacetoanilides are examples of yellow dye-forming couplers, 5-pyrazolones and pyrazoloazoles are those of magenta dye-forming couplers, and phenols and naphthols are those of cyan dye-forming couplers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Of these dye-forming couplers, phenols or naphthols which have so far been used as a cyan dye-forming coupler have drawbacks such that the dyes formed therefrom absorb light in the green region also because the main absorption curve they have in the red region, by which they can assume the hue of cyan, is broad on the shorter wavelength side, the dyes formed therefrom have a side absorption in the blue region in addition to the main absorption, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With the intention of removing drawbacks as described above, there have been proposed various couplers, for instance, the imidazole type couplers disclosed in JP-A-63-226653 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application"), JP-A-03-61946, etc., the couplers having a structure formed by condensing a pyrazole ring and a nitrogen-containing 6-membered ring, which are disclosed in JP-A-02-135442, JP-A-02-136855, etc., and so on. However, they are not wholly satisfactory in view of the hue of developed colors, the color formability and the fastness of dye images.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For color prints in particular, though it goes without saying that the hue just after processing is important, it is also important to retain said hue forever (e.g., upon long-range storage). Under these circumstances, it has been sought the art to obtain cyan dyes which not only have excellent hue but also ensure excellent dye image stability even when stored under inferior conditions, e.g., under high humidity, exposure to light, or the like.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a color photosensitive material which has excellent color reproducibility and ensures color photographs having highly-fast color images even under a condition of high humidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a result of our intensive studies, it has been found that the foregoing object can be attained effectively with a silver halide color photographic material which has on a support at least one cyan coupler represented by the following general formula (Ia) and at least one compound having a molecular weight of at least 350 which is selected from compounds represented by the following general formula [A], compounds represented by the following general formula [B] or compounds of the following general formula [C]: ##STR1## wherein Za represents --NH-- or --CH(R<sub>3</sub>)--; Zb and Zc each represent --C(R<sub>4</sub>)= or --N=; R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> each represent an electron-withdrawing group having a Hammett's substituent constant σ<sub>p</sub> of at least 0.2, provided that the sum of the op values of R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> is at least 0.65; R<sub>4</sub> represents a hydrogen atom or a substituent group, and when two R<sub>4</sub> 's are present in the formula they may be the same or different; and X represents a hydrogen atom or a group capable of splitting off by the coupling reaction with the oxidization product of an aromatic primary amine color developing agent; or R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub> or X may be a divalent group by way of which the cyan coupler can form a dimer or higher polymer or combine with a high molecular chain to form a homo- or copolymer: ##STR2## wherein R<sub>A1</sub> represents a monovalent group; and i represents an integer of 1 to 4, and the R<sub>A1</sub> 's (in the case of i=2 to 4) may be the same or different: ##STR3## wherein R<sub>B1</sub> represents a monovalent group; j represents an integer of 1 to 6, and R<sub>B1</sub> 's, in the case of j=2 to 6, may be the same or different; k represents 2 or 3, and two --OH groups, in the case of k=2, are situated in a position wherein they are ortho or meta to each other, while three --OH groups, in the case of k=3, are situated in a position adjacent to one another; ---Q<sub>B</sub> --- represents that a naphthalene ring may form together with the benzene ring: ##STR4## wherein A represents --CO-- or --SO<sub>2</sub> --; R<sub>C1</sub> and R<sub>C2</sub> each represent an alkyl group, an aryl group, a heterocyclyl group or an amino group; R<sub>C3</sub> represents a monovalent group; m represents an integer of 0 to 2, and the two (--NH--A--R<sub>C2</sub>)'s, in the case of m=2, may be the same or different; n represents an integer of 0 to 2, provided that the sum of m and n is 1 or 2; at least either the moiety --NH--A--R<sub>C2</sub> or --OH group is situated in the position ortho or para to --NHSO<sub>2</sub> R<sub>C1</sub> ; p represents an integer of 0 to 6, and R<sub>C3</sub> 's, in the case of p=2 to 6, may be the same or different; ---Q<sub>C</sub> --- represents that a naphthalene ring may form together with the benzene ring.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Compounds used in the present invention are described below in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present cyan couplers of general formula (Ia) specifically include those represented by the following general formulae (IIa) to (VIIIa): ##STR5## wherein R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub> and X have the same meanings as in general formula (Ia), respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The cyan couplers which are preferable in the present invention are those represented by general formulae (IIa), (IIIa) and (IVa), especially those represented by general formula (IIIa).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the cyan couplers of the present invention, the substituents R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> all are electron-withdrawing groups having a Hammett's σ<sub>p</sub> value of at least 0.20, and the sum of the σ<sub>p</sub> value of R<sub>1</sub> and that of R<sub>2</sub> is at least 0.65. As for the σ<sub>p</sub> values of R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>, the sum thereof is preferably at least 0.70, and the upper limit of the sum is around 1.8.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> are each an electron-withdrawing group having a Hammett's substituent constant, or a Hammett's σ<sub>p</sub> value, of at least 0.2, preferably at least 0.35, and much preferably at least 0.60. With respect to the σ<sub>p</sub> value, the electron-withdrawing group has an upper limit of no greater than 1.0. The Hammett's rule is the empirical rule proposed by L. P. Hammett in 1935 in order to treat quantitatively the effects of substituent groups upon the reaction or the equilibrium of benzene derivatives, and its validity is universally appreciated in these times. The substituent constants determined by the Hammett's rule are σ<sub>p</sub> and σ<sub>m</sub> values. We can find the description of these values in many general books. For instance, there are detailed descriptions in J. A. Dean, Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, 12th edition, McGraw-Hill (1979), and Kagaku no Ryo-iki Zokan (which means special numbers of "Domain of Chemistry"), number 122, pages 96 to 103, Nankodo, Tokyo (1979). In the present invention, R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> are specified definitely using a Hammett's substituent constant σ<sub>p</sub>. Additionally, these substituents should not be construed as being limited to the substituents whose σ<sub>p</sub> values are already known through the references adopted in the above-cited books, but it is a matter of course that they include any substituents whose σ<sub>p</sub> values are within the range defined by the present invention when determined by the Hammett's rule even if they are not yet reported in literature.</div>

As for the copolymer, the copolymerizing component thereof may be constituted of identical or different ethylenic monomers which cannot form color because they cannot couple with the oxidation product of an aromatic primary amine developer, such as acrylic acid esters, methacrylic acid esters and maleic acid esters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific examples of the cyan coupler of the present invention are illustrated below. However, the invention should not be construed as being limited to these examples.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The present cyan couplers and intermediates thereof can be synthesized using known methods. Specifically, they can be synthesized according to the methods described, e.g., in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 80, 5332 (1958), J. Am. Chem. Soc., vol. 81, 2452 (1959), J. Am. Chem. Soc., 112, 2465 (1990), Org. Synth., 1270 (1941), J. Chem. Soc., 5149 (1962), Heterocycles., vol. 27, 2301 (1988), Rec. Trav. Chim., 80, 1075 (1961), and references cited therein; or methods analogous thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The synthesis of the present cyan couplers illustrated below with a concrete example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Synthesis of Compound (9):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Compound (9) was synthesized in accordance with the following reaction scheme: ##STR95##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To a solution containing 2-amino-4-cyano-3-ethoxycarbonylpyrrole (1a) (66.0 g, 0.4 mol) in dimethylacetamide (300 ml) was added 3,5-dichlorobenzoyl chloride (2a) (83.2 g, 0.4 mol) at room temperature. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, and then admixed with water. The resulting solution was extracted in two steps with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were collected, washed successively with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled away therefrom, and the residue was recrystallized from acetonitrile (300 ml). Thus, Compound (3a) (113 g, 84% yield) was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Potassium hydroxide powder (252 g, 4.5 mol) was added to a solution containing Compound (3a) (101.1 g, 0.3 mol) in dimethylformamide (200 ml) at room temperature, and stirred thoroughly. The resulting solution was cooled in an ice bath, and thereto was added hydroxylamine-o-sulfonic acid (237 g, 2.1 mol) in limited amounts with caution so as not to steeply raise the temperature of the reaction system. After the addition was completed, the reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. Then, it was neutralized by dropping thereinto a 0.1N aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid as the pH thereof was checked with test paper. The neutralized matter was extracted in three steps with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed successively with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled away under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by column chromatography (developer: hexane/ethyl acetate=2/1). Thus, Compound (4a) (9.50 g, 9% yield) was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To a solution containing Compound (4a) (7.04 g, 20 mmol) in acetonitrile (30 ml ), carbon tetrachloride (9 ml) first, and then triphenylphosphine (5.76 g, 22 mmol) were added at room temperature. The resulting mixture was heated for 8 hours under reflux. After cooling, it was admixed with water, and extracted in three steps with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed successively with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled away under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (developer: hexane/ethyl acetate=4/1). Thus, Compound (5a) (1.13 g, 17% yield) was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In 2.0 ml of sulforan were dissolved 1.8 g of Compound (5a) and 12.4 g of Compound (6a), and the solution was admixed with 1.5 g of titanium isopropoxide. The reaction was run for 1.5 hours as temperature was maintained at 110° C. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was admixed with ethyl acetate, and washed with water. The ethyl acetate layer was dried, and ethyl acetate was distilled away therefrom. The residue was purified by column chromatography. Thus, 1.6 g of the intended compound (9) was obtained. m.p. 97° to 98° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present cyan couplers represented by general formula (Ia) can be used in a silver halide color photographic material if only the photographic material has at least one layer in which the present couplers can be incorporated. Any layer may serve as the layer containing the present couplers as far as it is a hydrophilic colloid layer provided on a support. A general color photographic material can be constructed by providing on a support at least one blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, at least one green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and at least one red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, in this order. However, arrangement orders other than the above-described one may be adopted. Also, an infrared-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer can be used in place of at least one among the foregoing light-sensitive emulsion layers. Therein, color reproduction can be effected in accordance with the subtractive color process by incorporating into each of those sensitive emulsion layers the combination of a silver halide emulsion having sensitivity in its individual wavelength region and a so-called color coupler which can form a dye bearing a complementary color relationship to the colored light by which the emulsion is sensitized. However, the photographic material of the present invention may be designed so as not to have the above-described correspondence of each light-sensitive layer to the developed hue of the coupler incorporated therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In using the present cyan couplers represented by general formula (Ia) for photographic materials, it is desirable in particular that they be incorporated into a red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of the present couplers incorporated in a sensitive material ranges generally from 1×10<sup>-3</sup> to 1 mole, preferably from 2×10<sup>-3</sup> to 5×10<sup>-1</sup> mole, per mole of silver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Additionally, the present cyan couplers may be used as a mixture of two or more thereof, and they may be used together with other cyan couplers as far as the effects of the present invention are not impaired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, other cyan couplers are used in a proportion of at most 50 mol %, preferably at most 30 mol %, to the present cyan couplers.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The substituents specified in general formulae [A], [B] and [C] respectively are chosen so that the resulting compound may have a molecular weight of at least 350. This is because the effects of the present invention can be achieved to a considerable extent only when said compounds have a molecular weight of 350 or more. Though said compounds have no particular restriction as to molecular weight as far as their molecular weight is not less than 350, it is desirable that their molecular weight be less than about 800 when, they have the form of monomer. On the other hand, the compounds represented by general formulae [A], [B] and [C] respectively may be high molecular compounds formed by connecting a polymer chain to their respective substituents. Also, they may be a dimer or higher polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is desirable that the present redox compounds of general formulae [A], [B] and [C] be present in a color stain-inhibiting layer in the form of fine oil drops prepared by dissolving them in high boiling organic solvents and dispersing the resulting solutions through emulsification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the high boiling organic solvents used in the present invention, those having a dielectric constant of at least 3.5 are preferable. Much preferred as high boiling organic solvents are those having a dielectric constant of at least 5.0. These high boiling organic solvents may be used as mixture of two or more thereof. The dielectric constant of such a mixture is preferably at least 4.0, and more preferably at least 5.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable examples of the high boiling organic solvents as described above include esters having a dielectric constant of at least 3.5, such as phthalic acid esters, phosphoric acid esters, etc., organic acid amides and ketones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the dielectric constant, there was employed the value determined by the transformer bridge method through the measurement (with, e.g., TRS-10T, made by Ando Denki K.K.) under the condition of 25° C. and 10 kHz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is desirable that the boiling point of such high boiling organic solvents not be lower than 140° C., preferably 160° C., and the melting point thereof not be higher than 100° C., preferably 70° C. Also, the high boiling organic solvents used herein may be in a solid state at ordinary temperature. In this case, their dielectric constants are measured in a liquid state (i.e., a supercooled state).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver halide emulsions used in the present invention can contain a wide variety of compounds or precursors thereof for the purpose of preventing fog or stabilizing photographic functions during production, storage, or photographic processing. Specific examples of such compounds which can be preferably used in the present invention include those disclosed in JP-A-62-215272, at pages 39 to 72.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the magenta coupler, it is desirable that pyrazolotriazole type compounds be used in the present invention, though any known magenta couplers also can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among the pyrazoloazole type couplers, the imidazo[1,2-b]pyrazoles disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,630 are preferred in view of the low yellow side absorption of the developed dyes and light fastness thereof, and the pyrazolo[1,5-b] [1,2,4]triazoles disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,540,654 are especially favored in that regard.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, there can be preferably employed pyrazolotriazole type couplers in which the 2-, 3- or 6-position of the pyrazolotriazole ring is substituted by a branched alkyl group, as disclosed in JP-A-61-65245; pyrazoloazole type couplers which contain a sulfonamido group in a molecule, as disclosed in JP-A-61-65246; pyrazoloazole type couplers which contain an alkoxyphenylsulfonamido group as a ballast group, as disclosed in JP-A-61-147254; and pyrazolotriazole type couplers in which the 6-position is substituted by an alkoxy or aryloxy group, as disclosed in European Patents (laid open) 226,849 and 294,786.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific examples of those pyrazoloazole couplers include Couplers I-1 to 1-50 illustrated in EP-A2-0355660, at pages 9 to 28.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Silver halides which can be used in the present invention include silver chloride, silver bromide, silver chlorobromide, silver iodochlorobromide, silver iodobromide and so on. In particular, it is desirable for rapid processing to use a substantially iodide-free silver chloride or chlorobromide emulsion having a chloride content of at least 90 mole %, preferably at least 95 mole %, and particularly preferably at least 98 mole %. The expression "substantially iodide-free" as used herein means that the iodide content is preferably at most 1.0 mole %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is desirable that the silver halide grains of the present invention have bromide-rich localized phases of a layer form or nonlayer form, in which the bromide content is at least 10 mole %, inside and/or at the surface of the grains. In view of not only suitability for continuous processing but also pressure resistance, it is preferable that the bromide-rich localized phases be present in the vicinity of grain surface. The term "the vicinity of grain surface" as used herein is defined as the location which is within one-fifth the grain size of the outermost surface. It is much preferable that the bromide-rich localized phases be situated within one-tenth the grain size of the outermost surface and shorter than one-tenth the grain size. As for the configuration of the bromide-rich localized phases, it is most desirable that the localized phases having a bromide content of at least 10 mole % make epitaxial growth on the corners of cubic or detradecahedral silver chloride grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although it is desirable that the bromide contents in the bromide-rich localized phases not be lower than 10 mole %, too high bromide contents in the localized phases sometimes give the photosensitive materials undesirable characteristics such that desensitization tends to occur when stress is imposed on the photosensitive materials. In this respect the sensitivity and the gradation obtained in the final stage a continuous processing are different greatly from those in the initial stage thereof, and so on. Taking account into these points, the bromide content in the bromide-rich localized phase is preferably in the range of 10 to 60 mole %, most preferably 20 to 50 mole %. The bromide content in the bromide-rich localized phase can be determined by an X-ray diffraction method (described, e.g., in "Shin Jikken Kagaku Koza 6, Kozo Kaiseki" (which means "new lectures on experimental chemistry, vol. 6, structural analyses"), compiled by the Japanese Chemical Society and published by Marzen. It is preferable that the silver contained in the bromide-rich localized phases comprise 0.1 to 20 mole %, especially 0.2 to 5 mole %, of the whole silver contained in the individual silver halide grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The interfaces between these bromide-rich localized phases and other phases may have a clear phase boundaries, or may have a transformed range in which the halogen composition changes gradually.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Bromide-rich localized phases as described above can be formed using various methods. For instance, the localized phases can be formed by reacting a water-soluble silver salt with a water-soluble halide in accordance with a single jet method or a double jet method. As another method for forming the localized phases, mention may be made of a conversion method in which the silver halide of once formed silver halide grains are partly converted to another silver halide having a solubility product lower than that of the former halide. Also, it is advantageous to form bromide-rich localized phases by mixing host silver halide grains having a cubic or tetradecahedral crystal shape with fine grains of silver halide which have a smaller average grain size and a higher bromide content than the host grains, and then ripening the mixed grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An average size of the silver halide grains contained in the silver halide emulsions used in this invention (the grain size herein refers to the diameter of the circle having the same area as the projected area of the grain, and the number average is taken in expressing the grain size) ranges preferably from 0.1 to 2 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the distribution of sizes among grains, so-called monodisperse emulsions which have a variation coefficient (the value obtained by dividing the standard deviation of grain size distribution by the average grain size) of at most 20%, desirably at most 15%, are preferred. For the purpose of obtaining a wide latitude, it is advantageous to coat a blend of some monodisperse emulsions differing in average grain size in a single layer, or to coat them separately in a multiple layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Those silver halide grains contained in the present photographic emulsions may have a regular crystal form, such as that of a cube, a tetradecahedron or an octahedron; an irregular crystal form, such as that of a sphere, a plate or so on; or a composite form. Also, they may be a mixture of silver halide grains having various crystal forms. It is desirable in the present invention that the proportion of silver halide grains having such a regular crystal form as described above to the whole silver halide grains present in each photographic emulsion should be at least 50 mol %, preferably at least 70 mol %, and much preferably at least 90 mol %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, it is desirable in this invention to use such an emulsion as to contain tabular silver halide grains having an average aspect ratio (a ratio of a projected area diameter to a thickness) of at least 5, preferably at least 8, in a proportion of at least 50%, based on the projected area, to the whole silver halide grains present therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The emulsions of the present invention can be prepared using various methods as described in, for example, P. Glafkides, Chemie et Phisique Photographique, Paul Montel, Paris (1967); G. F. Duffin, Photographic Emulsion Chemistry, The Focal Press, London (1966), V. L. Zelikman et al, Making and Coating Photographic Emulsion, The Focal Press, London (1964); and so on. Specifically, any processes including an acid process, a neutral process and an ammoniacal process may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable methods for reacting a water-soluble silver salt with a water-soluble halide include, e.g., a single jet method, a double jet method, or a combination thereof. Also, a method in which silver halide grains are produced in the presence of excess silver ion (the so-called reverse mixing method) can be employed. On the other hand, the so-called controlled double jet method, in which the pAg of the liquid phase in which silver halide grains are to be precipitated is maintained constant, may be also employed. According to this method, a silver halide emulsion having a regular crystal form and an almost uniform distribution of grain sizes can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a process of producing silver halide grains or allowing the produced silver halide grains to ripen physically, various kinds of polyvalent metal ion dopants can be introduced. Examples of compounds usable as dopants include cadmium salts, zinc salts, lead salts, copper salts, thallium salts, and single or complex salts of Group VIII elements such as iron, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, platinum, etc. In particular, the complex salts of Group VIII elements are used to advantage. Amounts of these compounds to be added, though can be varied over a wide range depending on the purpose, are preferably within the range of 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-2</sup> mole per mole of silver halide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver halide emulsions to be used in the present invention are, in general, chemically and spectrally sensitized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the chemical sensitization process, a sensitization process using a chalcogen compound, such as sulfur sensitization, selenium sensitization, tellurium sensitization or the like, a sensitization process using a noble metal compound represented by a gold compound and a reduction sensitization process can be employed individually or as a combination of two or more thereof. Preferred compounds used for chemical sensitization are those disclosed in JP-A-62-215272, from the right lower column at page 18 to the right upper column at page 22.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Spectral sensitization to which silver halide emulsions used in the present invention are subjected is performed for the purpose of imparting spectral sensitivities in a desired wavelength region of light to an emulsion which constitutes each light-sensitive layer of the present photographic material. It is preferred in the present invention to effect the spectral sensitization by addition of dyes capable of absorbing light in the wavelength region corresponding to desired spectral sensitivities, that is to say, spectral sensitizing dyes. Spectral sensitizing dyes which can be used for the above-described purpose include those described, e.g., in F. M. Harmer, Heterocyclic compound--Cyanine dyes and related compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York and London (1964). Specific examples of compounds and spectral sensitization processes which can be employed to advantage in the present invention include those disclosed in JP-A-62-215272, from the right upper column on the page 22 to the page 38.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The so-called surface latent-image type emulsions, or silver halide emulsions of the kind which form a latent image predominantly at the surface of the grains, are preferred as the emulsions used in the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For the purpose of enhancement of image sharpness and the like, it is desirable (i) that dyes capable of undergoing decolorization by photographic processing (especially oxonol dyes), which are disclosed at pages 27 to 76 in EP-A2-0337490, be added to a hydrophilic colloid layer of the present photographic material in such an amount as to impart an optical reflection density of at least 0.70 at 680 nm to the resulting photographic material, and (ii) that titanium oxide grains which have undergone surface treatment with a di- to tetrahydric alcohol (e.g., trimethylolethane) be incorporated in a content of at least 12 wt % (preferably at least 14 wt %) into a waterproof resin coating of the support.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Photographic additives which can be used in the present invention, including cyan, magenta and yellow couplers, are preferably dissolved in a high boiling organic solvent. Such a high boiling organic solvent is a water-immiscible compound having a melting point of 100° C. or lower and a boiling point of 140° C. or higher and is a good solvent for couplers. The melting point of preferable high boiling organic solvents is 80° C. or lower and the boiling point thereof is 160° C. or higher, much preferably 170° C. or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Details of such high boiling organic solvents are described in JP-A-62-215272, from the right lower column at page 137 to the right upper column at page 144.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, a loadable latex polymer (as disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,203,716) impregnated with a cyan, magenta or yellow coupler in the presence or absence of a high boiling organic solvent as described above, or such a coupler dissolved in a high boiling organic solvent together with a polymer insoluble in water but soluble in an organic solvent, can be dispersed into a hydrophilic colloid solution in an emulsified condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polymers which can be preferably used therein include the homo- or copolymers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,857,449, from column 7 to column 15, and WO 88/00723, from page 12 to page 30. Much preferably, polymers of methacrylate or acrylamide type, particularly those of acrylamide type, are favored over others in view of color image stabilization and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, it is desirable for improving the keeping quality of color images that the compounds as disclosed in EP-0277589A2 be used together with couplers in the photographic material of the present invention. In particular, it is preferable that such compounds be used in combination with couplers of the pyrazoloazole type and those of the pyrroloazole type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, compounds of the kind which can produce chemically inert, substantially colorless compounds by combining chemically with an aromatic amine developing agent remaining after the color development-processing (Compound F) and/or compounds of the kind which can produce chemically inert, substantially colorless compounds by combining chemically with the oxidized aromatic amine developing agent remaining after the color development-processing (Compound G) are preferably used in combination or independently. By the use of these compounds, the generation of stains, which are due to the formation of dyes through the reaction between the couplers and the unoxidized or oxidized color developing agent remaining in the processed photographic film, and the occurrence of other side reactions upon storage after photographic processing, can be inhibited effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, it is desirable that the antimolds disclosed in JP-A-63-271247 be added to the photographic material of the present invention in order to prevent a deterioration of images from occurring through propagation of various kinds of molds and bacteria in hydrophilic colloid layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the support of the present photographic material, a support of reflection type and a transparent support may be both used. However, a support of the reflection type is desirable in particular for accomplishing the present purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For the display purpose, a support of the white polyester type or a support provided with a white pigment-containing layer on the same side as the silver halide emulsion layers may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The photographic material of the present invention may be exposed to either visible or infrared rays. For the exposure, not only low intensity exposure but also high intensity short-time exposure may be employed. In the latter case, a laser scanning exposure system in which the exposure time per picture element is shorter than 10<sup>-4</sup> second is preferred in particular.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Upon exposure, it is preferable to use the band stop filter disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,726. This filter can get rid of color stain of optical origin to improve color reproducibility to a great extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After exposure, photographic materials can be subjected to a conventional black-and-white or color photographic processing. In case of the color photographic materials, it is desirable for rapid processing that the materials be subjected to a bleach-fix step after color development. In a special case where a high chloride-content silver halide emulsion is used, it is desirable for promotion of the desilvering step that the pH of the bleach-fix bath be adjusted to about 6.5 or lower, preferably about 6 or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the silver halide emulsions and other ingredients (such as additives, etc.) and the photographic constituent layers (including their order of arrangement), those disclosed in the following patent specifications, especially EP0355660A2 (corresponding to JP-A-02-139544) can be preferably applied to the photographic material of the present invention.</div>

<heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The surface of a paper support laminated with polyethylene on both sides was subjected to a corona discharge operation, provided with a gelatin undercoat containing sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and further coated with various photographic constituent layers to prepare a multilayer color photographic paper having the following layer structure (Sample No. 101). Coating solutions used herein were prepared in the manner described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preparation of Coating Solution for Fifth Layer;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A cyan coupler (ExC) in the amount of 33 g, 18.0 g of an ultraviolet absorbent (UV-2), 2.0 g of a color image stabilizer (Cpd-9), 2.0 g of a color image stabilizer (Cpd-10), 1.0 g of a color image stabilizer (Cpd-6), 44 g of a solvent (Solv-6), 1.0 g of a color image stabilizer (Cpd-11), 1.0 g of a solvent (Solv-1) and 33 g of a color image stabilizer (Cpd-1) were admixed with 60.0 ml of ethyl acetate and dissolved thereinto. The solution obtained was added to 500 ml of a 20% aqueous gelatin solution containing 8 g of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and dispersed thereinto in an emulsified condition by means of a high-speed rotary homogenizer to prepare an emulsified dispersion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, two kinds of silver chlorobromide emulsions [both of which had a cubic crystal form; one of which had an average grain size of 0.50 μm and a variation coefficient of 0.09 with respect to the grain size distribution (large-sized Emulsion R1), and the other of which had an average grain size of 0.41 μm and a variation coefficient of 0.11 with respect to the grain size distribution (small-sized Emulsion R2); both of which were constituted of 0.8 mol % bromide, localized in part of each grain surface, and the remainder chloride] were prepared. Further, the red-sensitive dye E illustrated below was added to the large-sized Emulsion R1 and the small-sized Emulsion R2 in the amounts of 0.9×10<sup>-4</sup> mole and 1.1×10<sup>-4</sup> mole, respectively, per mole of silver. These emulsions R1 and R2 were mixed in a ratio of 1:4 by mole on a silver basis to obtain a silver chlorobromide Emulsion R. Furthermore, Compound F illustrated below was added to Emulsion R in the amount of 2.6×10<sup>-3</sup> mole per mole of silver. The resulting Emulsion R was chemically ripened by the addition of a sulfur sensitizer and a gold sensitizer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thus prepared red-sensitive silver chlorobromide emulsion R was mixed homogeneously with the foregoing emulsified Dispersion. Thereto were added other ingredients described below so as to obtain the coating solution for the fifth layer having the following composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Coating solutions for other layers were prepared respectively in the same manner as that for the fifth layer. In each layer, sodium salt of 1-oxy-3,5-dichloro-s-triazine was used as gelatin hardener.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, Cpd-14 and Cpd-15 were added to all layers so that their coverages were 25.0 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 50.0 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Spectral sensitizing dyes illustrated below were added to the silver chlorobromide emulsions for each light-sensitive emulsion layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Blue-sensitive Emulsion Layer ##STR105##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Sensitizing Dyes A and B illustrated above were added to the large-sized emulsion in the same amount of 2.0×10<sup>-4</sup> mole per mole silver, and to the small-sized emulsion in the same amount of 2.5×10<sup>-4</sup> mole per mole of silver.)</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">As can be seen from Table I, all the present samples using the present cyan couplers and the present redox compounds were very slight in both Y-component and M-component, that is, excellent in hue; and displayed high fastness to light under both conditions, namely under high and low humidities. In addition, the difference between the light fastness under the high humidity condition and that under the low humidity condition was slight in every present sample (that is to say, the humidity dependence of light fastness was slight in every present sample). On the other hand, the samples using couplers other than the present ones were inferior in hue to the present samples, and the samples using redox compounds other than the present ones were decidedly inferior in light fastness, particularly under the high humidity condition, when compared to the present samples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In accordance with the present invention, color photographs which are excellent in color reproduction and have color images fast to light under both high and low humidity conditions can be obtained by the combined use of a cyan coupler specified herein and a redox compound specified herein.</div>
