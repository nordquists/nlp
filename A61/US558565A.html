<div class="description-paragraph">To all whom it may concern.- </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Be it known that I, XVILLIAM G. RooME, of Jersey City, in the county of Hudson and State of New Jersey, have invented a certain new and useful Improvement in Railway- Signals, of which the following is a specification. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> I will describe my improvement in detail, and then point out the novel features in the claims. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view of a portion of a rail- .way and appurtenances embodying my improvement. Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic view illustrating a modification of the main circuit. Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic view illustrating a modification of the circuits. Fig. 4 is a diagrammatic view illustrating a modification of the circuits. Fig. 5 isa diagrammatic view of a single-track railway having two systems of signaling devices for protecting in different directions. Fig. 6 is a diagrammatic representation of two tracks upon which trains are intended to run in the same direction, and they are shown as combined with appurtenances embodying my improve ment. These two tracks are intended to form part of a four-track railroad. Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic view illustrating the application of my improvement to railroad-tracks crossing each other. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Similar letters of reference designate corresponding parts in all the figures. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring first to Fig. 1, A designates a railway-track of ordinary or any suitable construction. It may be regarded as one of the tracks of a double-tracked railroad. B designates an arbitrary representation of a dynamo-electric machine. The machine I use may be of any desired type. This dynamo is intended to supply current for certain signaling devices employed in a block system. The track A comprises a number of sections a a (L The section a may be regarded as a section extending from a depot orstation. The rails comprised in each trackscction are intended to be made continuous electrically. This may be done by means of fish-plates, chairs, or other devices made of metal and electrically connecting the ends of abutting rail-sections. A simple way of connecting adjacent rail-sections comprised in the track-section is to fasten the ends of a wire between each pair of adjacent rail-sections. The rails comprised in each track-section are in this example of my inventionelectrically independent of those comprised in any other track-section. Their electrical independence may be secured by employing chairs or fish-plates of insulating material, such as wood, between the rails comprising one track-section and those comprised in each adjacent track-section.- </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In my improvement I use what may be regarded as a main circuit comprising all the signals and also protecting devices if such be used, and I also use a track circuit or circuits. In each track-circuit the rails of one of the track-sections is comprised. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">I will first describe the main circuit and its I appurtenances. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> C designates a wire leading from one pole or electrode of the dynamo-electric machine B to the ground. As here shown it is represented as connecting with a ground-plate G. O designates another wire extending from the other pole or electrode of the machine. This wire extends to a point where the main circuit branches, one branch 0 extending to one terminal or contact-point of a resistance device E and the other branch 0 extending to one end of the coil of an electromagnet s belonging to a danger-signal S. The electromagnet s will preferably be of the solenoid type or one capable of producing a long range of movement. The signal S is represented as consisting of a lever fnlcrumed between its ends on a pin 25. One end is provided with a signal-board or other signal contrivance and the other is connected to. the armature of the magnet. The magnet represented being of the solenoid type; its armature is consequently made in the form of amovable core. Aweight a is combined with the magnet-armature and signal-lever for moving the latter in the opposite direction to that in which it will be moved by the magnet. It is intended that the magnet shall normally influence the signal and henceset it and maintain it at the position indicative of safety, and that whenever the magnet is deenergized the weight shall set'the signal to the position indicative of danger. When the signal-lever is tilted out of horizontal position, it indicates safety, and to indicate danger it is adjusted to a horizontal position. From the other end of the coil of the electromagnet s a wire C extends to a circuit-changer II, here shown as consisting of a lever fulcrumed at one end to a pin 7L and having at the other end a contact-piece which is adapted to coact with the contact-piece i, a magnet I being employed for maintaining the lever II in contact with the contact-piece e" and a spring J being employed to adjust the lever I-I, so as to withdraw it from the contactpiece 2" whenever the magnet I is deenergized. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It may be remarked in passing that the magnet I is not in the main circuit, but in a track-circuit. From the contact-piece i a wire (3 extends to one end of the coil of an electromagnet s belonging to a signal S The signal S and the electromagnet 3 may be exactly like the correspondingparts of the signal S already described and similarly combined with a weight. The other end of the coil of the electromagnet s is connected to a wire G which is united with a wire C extending from the resistance device E. From the wire C 0 a wire 0 extends. Before proceeding further I may remark that the signal S is intended to be a cautionary signal and the signal S a danger-signal. Owing to this it is desirable that the signal boards or devices of these two signals should be distinctive either in shape or color or both. I have indicated a difference in shape and would add that ordinarily to conform to existing practices the signal board or device of the cautionary signal S would be green and that of the danger-signal S red. The signal S would be located adjacent to the first section a of the track A at a considerable distance from the second section a of said track. The signal S will preferably be located at about the junction of the two sections a (0 In order that the function of the circuit changer H may be readily understood, 1 will remark here that the magnet I has the two ends of its coil connected by wires with the rails comprised in the track-section (L2. The details of this local or track circuit, which comprises the rails of the track-section 0. and the coil of the magnet I, and the manner of supplying the same with current I will presently explain. Obviously while there is no train, car, or locomotive upon the track-see tion a the magnet I will be energized and the circuit-changer II will be caused to impinge upon the contactpiece i, thus continuin g the signal-circuit. As the electromagnets 8 s of the signals S S will be energized, these signals will be maintained at the positions indicative of safety. This will be the normal condition of the signals, and reference to the drawings will show that is the condition in which they are illustrated, there being no train, car, or locomotive represented as located upon the track-section a I may add as a further explanation of the conditions in which the track-sections a a? and their appurtenances are illustrated that the engineer of a train passing over the tracksection a will be informed first by the cantionary signal S long before his train reaches the second track-section a and later by the danger-signal S at the time his train arrives at the second track-section a that there is no train upon the second track-section (t and consequently that he may proceed in safety. The resistance device E in that branch of the main circuit comprising the wires 0 C is employed to make this circuit branch approximately correspond in resistance with the other branch of the main circuit consisting of the wires C, C C, and (J and comprising the coils of the magnets s a belonging to the signals S S and the circuit-changer II. From the wire 0" a wire 0 extends to one of the coils of a transformer K. This transformer may be of any suitable construction comprising low and high potential coils. It may be remarked here that if a direct-current dynamo be used a dynamotor or direct-cnrrent transformer (sometimes called a motor-dynamo would be preferable. In other cases the ordinary circuit alternating-current transformer would suffice. 'As it is employed to furnish current of low potential to the track-circuit comprising the rails of the track-section a, the wire 0 is connected with one extremity of the high-potential coil of the transformer, and wires are extended from the extremities of the low-potential coil of the transformer to the ends of the rails comprised in the tracksection (t From the other extremity of the high-potential coil of the transformer a Wire C extends. From the wire 0, at a point whence the wire C extends from it, a wire 0 extends to one end of the coil of an electromagnet belonging to a signal S This is a cautionary signal intended to indicate to the engineer of a train, car, or locomotive passing along the second track-section a whether any train, car, or locomotive is located upon the third track-section a This signal may be like the signal S, fulcrumed in the same manner to a pin i and combined with an electromagnet s and weight a like the corresponding appurtenances of the signal S. From the other end of the coil of the electromagnet s of the signal S a wire 0 extends to a circuitchanger I 1 This circuit-changer consists of a lever corresponding with that forming the circuit-changer II, is similarly fulcrumed at one end to a pin 71/2, and is adapted at the other end to coact with a contact-piece 21 This lever is combined with a spring J and an electromagnet 1 The magnet I has its coils connected with the rails comprised in the track-section a". </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> From the contact-piece a wire 0 extends to one end of the coil of an electromagnet s belonging to a signal S. From the other end of the coil of the magnet s a wire 0 extends. The wire 0 joins the wire C and from these two wires the main circuit is continued by wire C The signal S* is intended to be a danger-signal like the dangensignal S and IIO capable of indicating 'to the engineer of a train, car, or locomotive reaching the end of the second track-section a whether any train, car, or locomotive is located upon the third track-section a This signal S is fulcrumed to a pin 25 and combined with a weight it". Normally the magnet I will hold the circuitchanger lever H against the contact-piece 2' but whenever a train, car, or locomotive is located upon the track-section a it will form a short circuit between the parallel rails of this track-section and so deenergize the magnet I whereupon the spring J 2 will move the circuit II away from the contact-piece i and deenergize the magnet s of the cautionary signal S and the magnet s of the dangersignal S. This is the condition of things illustrated in connection with the third track-section a and the signals appertaining thereto, I being an arbitrary representation of a train, car, or locomotive. The engineer of a train, car, or locomotive passing while this condition of things exists along the second tracksection a will be informed by the cautionary signal S that a train, car, or locomotive is located upon the third track-section a and will thus receive such information before arriving at the beginning of the third tracksection a when it will be seen that he will again receive this information from the danger-signal S when he arrives at the beginning of the third track-section a Obviously the electrical resistance of that branch of the main circuit consisting of the wires 0 and 0 including the hi gh-potential coil of the transformer K, should be made by properly proportioning the transformer or by any other means to approximately correspond with the other branch of the main circuit consisting of the wires 0 G O C and including the coils of the magnets s s and the circuit-changer H The main-circuit wire C extends to one extremity of the high-potential coil of the transformer K From the other end of this coil a wire 0 extends. The extremities of the low-potential coil of the transformer K are connected with the parallel rails of the traok-secion a near their forward extremities and thus a current of low potential is furnished to the track-circuit comprising the rails of this track-section a together with the coil of the electromagnet 1 The wire 0 will extend to the appurtenances of another track-section in advance of the track-section a At the end of the system connection will be made with the ground. To illustrate this I have shown the wire 0 extending to a ground-plate G It will be seen that in this example of my improvement there is a main circuit comprising the mag nets of all the signals and furnishing them with electricity from a common source, also that there are a number of track-circuits which are practically independent of the main circuit and are supplied with electricity of low potential, so as to render it practicable to utilize the rails of the several track-sections. These track-sectionscontrol the signals. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In Fig. 2, A designates a track comprising sections a" a B designates a dynamo having one pole or electrode connected by a wire 0 with a ground-plate G and having its other pole or electrode connected by a wire 0 with one of the coils of the transformer K From the other extremity of the coil of this transformer a wire 0 extends to one extremity of the high-potential coil of a transformer K. From the other extremity of this coil a Wire C extends to a ground-plate G The extremities of the low-potential coil of the transformer K are connected with the adjacent ends of the rails comprised in the track-section cf, the other ends of these rails being connected with the extremities of the coils of the magnet I. S designates a cautionary signal arranged adjacent to the track-section a at some distance from the track-section a It is pivoted between its ends to a pin and combined with a Weight to as well as with amagnet s. S designates a danger-signal pivoted between its ends to a pin t and combined with a magnet s and a weight M. As this figure illustrates a single-track railroad requiring signals for trains running in both directions, I employ signals S S on the opposite side of the track from the signals S S v The signal S- is fulcrumed to a pin i and combined/with a magnet s and a weight a The signal S is fulcrumed on a pin 25 and combined with a magnet s and a Weight u. From one end of that coil of the transformer K which is not connected with the wires C C a wire 0 extends to one end of the coil of the magnet s. .From the other end of the coil of this magnet a wire 0 leads to a circuitchanger H, which is combined with the magnet I and with the spring J and a contactpiece 2". From the contact-piece t" a Wire 0 extends to one end of the coil of the magnet 3 A wire 0 extends from the other end of the coil of this magnet to one end of the coil of the magnet 8 From the other end of the latter a wire 0 extends to one end of the coil of the magnet The other end of the coil of this magnet is connected by a wire 0 with the same coil of the transformer K as that from which the wire C extends. In this example of my improvement there is a main circuit and an independent circuit supplying electricity derived from the first-mentioned circuit to the signal through the medium of transformer K From a main circuit electricity is also supplied to an independent track-circuit through medium of transformer K. Of course there may be any number of such track-circuits. An independent dynamo or batteries may obviously be employed for supplying the track-circuits. In this example, as in my former examples, if a direct current dynamo be used. a direct-current transformer or motor-dynamo would be preferable. In other cases the ordinary alternating transformer will suffice. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In Fig. 3 I have shown a modification of my invention, in which I have connected my transformers with my dynamo B in multiple are. The other connections are very similar to those in Fig. 2, except that I have in the present figure shown the system as applying to a double-track railroad. Referring to the drawings, B represents a dynamo of any ordinary or suitable construction, from which extend wires to supply electricity to the various sections of the system, here represented as wires C and C. These wires may extend the length of the system, and wherever necessary power is supplied to local transformers, here represented as K K K K which are connected to the main supply-wires C and (l by wires O and C 0 and 0 C and 0 C and 0 respectively. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> I may remark here that the transformers K' and K are intended to supply power to operate the signals protecting the track-circuits of the track-sections a a respectively, which form with the track-section a" the railway-track A, on which trains are indicated to traverse in the direction indicated by the arrow V. K and K are transformers intended to supply power to the rails of the track-sections a and (0 respectively. These transformers as well as the dynamo B may be of any of the ordinary types; but if a direct-current dynamo be used it would be preferable to use a dynamotor (sometimes called a motor-dynamo) or direct-current transformer. In other cases the alternating transformer or any other kind may be used. The wires C" (J C C and the coils of the cautionary signal S and the danger-signal S together with the contact-piece i of the circuit-changer H and that coil of the transformer K which is not connected by the wires (3 O with the wires 0 0 form a local circuit controlling the signals protecting the track-section a The signals S and S may be similar to the other signals heretofore described and the circuit-changer II with its contact-piece may also be similar to others described heretofore. The wires O C C and O and the coils of the cautionary signal S and the danger-signal S together with the contact-piece i of the cireuit-changer H and that coil of the transformer K which is not connected by the wires G and C to the wires C and C form alocal circuit controlling the signals protecting the track-section a". The high-potential coil of the transformer K is connected by wires 0 and O to the wires C C, and the low-potential coil of this transformer is connected by wires 0 C with the rails of the tracksection a the opposite ends of the rails of this section being connected with the coil of the circuit-changer H The high-potential coil of the transformer K is connected by wires 0 (P to the wires 0 C and the low-potential coil of this transformer is connected by wires C C with the rails of the track-section a the opposite ends of the rails of this section being connected with the coil of the circuit-changer II". The signals S and S may be similar to the other signals heretofore de scribed and the circuit-changer II with its contact-piece i may also be similar to others described heretofore. The cautionary signal S is intended to be located in proximity to the track-sections a at some considerable distance from the meeting ends of the traeksections a (L The danger-signal S and the cautionary signal S are intended to be located in proximity to the meeting ends of the track-sections a (L2. The danger-signal S is intended to be located in proximity to the meeting ends of the track-sections a a". In this example of my improvement it will be seen that all my transformers are connected to the main supply-wires O and C in mul' tiple are. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 4 is similar to Fig. 3, with the exception that traek-batteries L L are used in place of the transformers K and K respectively, for supplying the track-circuits a a, respectively. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In Fig. 5 I have illustrated my invention as applied to a single-track railroad having two sets of signaling devices for trains running in reverse directions. In this figure A designatesa track composed of track-sections a a a a a 13 designates a dynamo c011- neeted through one of its poles or electrodes to the ground by a wire 0 represented as extending to the ground-plate G The other pole or electrode of the dynamo has a wire 0 connected to it. From the wire 0 a wire C extends to a resistance device E, and a wire 0 extends from the wire C to one end of the coil of the electromagnet s belonging to a cautionary signal S. This signal is fulerumed between its ends upon a pin 25 and has combined with it a weight 10 Preferably the magnet s will be of the solenoid type or one aifording a long range of movement. It is intended that the magnet shall normally hold the signal in the position indicative of safety, and that whenever the magnet is de energized the weight will adjust the signal to indicate danger. All the signals in my system may operate in this manner. From the other end of the coil of the electromagnet s a wire C extends to a circuit-changer I1 represented as consisting of a pivoted lever, the wire C extending to the pivot of the lever. The circuit-changer lever H coacts with a contact-piece 2' from which a wire 0 extends to one end of the coil of an electromagnet s belonging to a danger-signal S The circuit changer H has combined with it a spring J 3 for moving it away from the contact-piece and a magnet I for moving it to the said eontact-piece. The ends of the coil of the magnet I are connected with the adjacent ends of the rails comprised in the track-section (L The signal S is fulerumed to a pin i and combined with a weight a From the resistance device E a wire 0 extends. In this example of my improvement the wire 0 connects directly with the transformer K and also communicates directly with a wire leading to one end of the coil of the electromagnets belongingto the cautionary signal S. The other end of the coil of the electromagnets is connected bya wire 0 with a circnit-chan gerH. The signal S is fulcrumed between its ends to a pin and combined with a weight 169. From the transformer K a wire C extends. This transformer is connected with the adjacent ends of the rails comprised in the tracksections (L The low-potential coils of the transformer will be connected with these rails and the high-potential coil with the wires C C From the other end of the coil of the magnet s belonging to the danger-signal S a wire C extends to one end of a coil of a magnet s" belonging to a danger-signal S", arranged on the opposite side of the track A. This signal is fulcrumed between its ends to a pin and combined with a weight it From the other end of the coil of the electromagnet s belonging to the danger-signal S a wire C extends to one end of the coil of an electromagnet s belonging to a signal S The signal S is fulcrumed between its ends to a pin i and combined with a weight o From the other end of the coil of the magnet 3 a wire 0 extends to awire C The Wire 0 extends to one end of the high-potential coil of a transformer K the ends of whose low-potential coil are connected with the adj acent ends of the rails comprised in the track a The other ends of the rails are connected by wires with the ends of the coil of an electromagnet 1 which is combined with the circuit-changer H. A spring J 4 is also combined with this circnitchanger. This circuitchanger coacts with a contact-piece From the contact-piece i awire C extends to one end of the coil of a magnet s belonging to a danger-signal S The signal S is fulerumed to a pin i and combined with a weight 11 From the other end of the coil of the magnet s a wire 0 extends to one end of the coil of an electromagnet 5 belonging to a danger-signal S. From the'wire G a wire 0 extends to one end of the coil of an electromagnet s belonging to a cautionary signal S. This signal S is fulcrumed upon a pin 25 and combined with a weight it. A wire 0 extends from the other end of the coil of the magnet s to a circuitchanger II", which coacts with a contact-piece i and has combined with it a spring J 5 and a magnet 1 This magnet I has the ends of its coil connected with the rails comprised in the track-section a the other ends of these rails being connected with the ends of the lowpotential coil of the transformer K From the hi gh-potential coils of the transformer K a wire 0 extends to one extremity of the high-potential coil of the transformer K". The other end of the high-potential coil of the latter transformer is shown as connected to a wire C, which is represented as extending to a ground-plate G. From the other end of the coil of the electromagnet s belonging to the signal S a wire 0 extends to and connects with one of the ends of the coil of an electromagnet s belonging to a cautionary signal S. This signal is fnlcrumed between its ends to a pin if and combined with a weight it. From the other end of the coil of the magnet s a wire (J extends to the wire 0 From the contact-piece 2' a wire 0" extends to one end of the coil of an electromagnet s belonging to a danger-signal 6*", which is fulorumed between its ends to a pin 75 and combined with a weight U15 From the other end of the coil of the electromagnet S a wire C extends to one end of the coil of an electromagnet s belonging to a danger-signal-S which is fulcrumed between its ends to a pin and combined with a weight 10 From the other end of the coil of the electromagnet of the signal S a wire 0' extends to one end of the coil of an electromagnet s belonging to a cautionary signal S, which between its ends is fulcrumed to apin t" and has combined with it a weight it". From the other end of the coil of the magnet s a wire 0 extends to the wire 0 To facilitate an understanding of the different branch circuits comprised in the main circuit, I have delineated certain wires differently. It will be observed that the signals S S S S S S are on one side of the track and that the signals S S S S S and S are on the other side of the track. These two series of signals are intended for trains running in opposite directions. The signals S, S S S S and S are intended for trains running in the direction indicated by the arrow 7', and the signals 8, S S S S and S for trains running in the direction indicated by the arrow W The signal S is intended to be located adjacent to the track-section a at some considerable distance from the meeting ends of the tracksections a a The signals S S are intended to be located adjacent to the meeting ends of these track-sections a 61- The signals S S are intended to be located adjacent to the meeting ends of the track-sections a a The signal S is intended to be located adjacent to the meeting ends of the track-sections a" or. The signal S" is intended to be arranged adjacent to the track-section a at a considerable distance from the track-section (1 The signals S S are intended to be located adjacent to the meeting ends of the tracksections a a and the signals S S are intended to be located adjacent to the ends of the track-sections a a The signal S is intended to be located adjacent to the meeting ends of the track-sections a a It will be seen that in this example of my improvement, aswell as in the one previously described, all the signals are supplied from a common source and in this example are in a single main circuit. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It will also be observed that in this example of my improvement I have represented practically independent track-circuits. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> I do not wish to be confined to the use of transformers K K. As already illustrated in connection with a former example of my improvement, the track-circuits may be supplied with electricity from batteries, or, if so desired, from an independent dynamo-electric machine giving a circuit of low potential. Normally the electromagnets I I I will be in the track-circuit, and consequently energized. This is represented in connection with the magnets I l belonging to the track-sections a a. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> T is an arbitraryrepresentation of a train located upon the track-section a As represented, this short-circuits out the magnet I, and, by deenergizing such magnet, causes the circuit-changer H to interrupt the communication between the wires C This has the eifect of deenergizing the magnet belonging to the danger-signal S and that belonging to the danger-signal S, which are located adjacent to the different ends of the tracksection a. It will also have the effect of deenergizing the magnets belonging to the cantionary signals S S, located, respectively, adjacent to the different ends of the track a a Manifestly a danger-signal and a cantionary signal are given in front of the train, and a danger-signal and a cautionary signal are given at the rear of the train, the dangersignal in each case being given at the end of the track-section (L3 and the cautionary signal at the distant end of the next adjacent tracksection in each direction. Thus safety will be insured to trains running in opposite directions or in the same direction upon a single track. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Turning now to Fig. (3, A A designate two parallel tracks for trains running in the same direction. Each of these tracks comprises a number of electrically independent tracksections a a a a 13 is a dynamo-electric machine having one of its poles or electrodes connected by a wire 0 with a ground-plate G and its other pole or electrode connected with a wire 0 leading to a resistance device E From the resistance device 1 1 a wire 0 extends to one extremity of the high-potential coil of a transformer K the ends of whose low-potential coils connect with the adjacent ends of the rails comprised in the traclesection a of the track A. From the other end of the high-potential coil of this transformer a wire C extends to one extremity of the high-potential coil of a transformer K the ends of whose low-potential coils are connected with the adjacent ends of the rails comprised in the track-section a of the track A From the other extremity of the highpotential coil of the transformer K a wire C extends to one extremity of the high-potential coil of a transformer K, the ends of whose low-potential coil are connected with the adjacent ends of the rails comprised in the track-section a of the track A. From the other extremity of the high-potential coil of the transformer K a wire 0 extends to one extremity of a high-potential coil of a transformer K, the ends of whose low-p0 tential coil are connected with the adjacent ends of the rails comprised in the track-section a of the track A From the other extremity of the high-potential coil of the transformer K a wire C extends to a groundplate G. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The track-section a of the track A has those ends of its rails which are more distant from the transformer K connected with the ends of the coil of an electromagnet I, which is combined with a circuit-changer II.
