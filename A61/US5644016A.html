<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Switching and display devices containing ferroelectric liquid-crystal mixtures (FLC displays) are disclosed, for example, in EP-B 0 032 362 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,367,924). Liquid-crystal displays are devices which, as a consequence of electrical switching, modify their optical transmission properties in such a way that incident (and possibly re-reflected) light is modulated in intensity. Examples are the known watch and calculator displays or liquid-crystal displays in the OA (office automation) or TV sectors (see also Liquid Crystal Device Handbook, Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Tokyo, 1989; ISBN 4-526-02590-9C 3054 and the papers cited therein).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These FLC displays are constructed in such a way that a ferroelectric liquid-crystal layer is enclosed on both sides by layers which are usually, in this sequence starting from the FLC layer, at least one alignment layer, electrodes and a limiting plate (for example made of glass). In addition, they contain one polarizer if they are operated in guest-host or reflective mode or two polarizers if the transmissive birefringence mode is used. The switching and display elements may contain further auxiliary layers, such as diffusion barrier or insulation layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The alignment layers, which comprise an organic (for example polyimide, polyamide and polyvinyl alcohol) or inorganic (for example SiO) material, together with a separation between the limiting plates which is chosen to be sufficiently small, bring the FLC molecules of the mixture into a configuration in which the molecules lie with their long axes parallel to one another and the smectic planes are arranged perpendicular or inclined to the alignment layer. In this arrangement, the molecules, as is known, have two equivalent orientations, between which they can be switched by pulse-like application of an electric field, i.e. FLC displays are capable of bistable switching. Response times are inversely proportional to the spontaneous polarization of the FLC mixture and are in the region of microseconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Surprisingly, it has now been found that polymers containing maleimide monomer units can advantageously be employed as alignment layers in liquid-crystal displays, in particular ferroelectric displays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polymers of this type have hitherto been employed as binders in photoresist materials, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 720,445, EP 0 140 273 and EP 0 234 327. However, their use as an alignment layer in LC displays, in particular FLC displays, has not previously been described.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention thus relates to the use of a polymer containing maleimide units of the formula I ##STR2## in which R<sup>1</sup> is hydrogen, an acyclic or cyclic, aliphatic, aromatic or araliphatic radical which is chiral or achiral, can be monosubstituted or polysubstituted by functional groups and in which one or more CH<sub>2</sub> groups can be replaced by functional groups,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">as an alignment layer in liquid-crystal displays, preferably in ferroelectric liquid-crystal displays.</div>
<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>1</sup> is preferably hydrogen, an aromatic, aliphatic or araliphatic ring having 6 to 24 carbon atoms or a branched or unbranched aliphatic radical having 1 to 40 carbon atoms, which may also contain chiral centers and in which one or more hydrogen atoms, independently of one another, may be replaced by --OH, --F, --Cl, --Br, --CN, --NR<sup>2</sup> R<sup>3</sup>, --COOR<sup>2</sup>, --OR<sup>2</sup>, --OSi(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, --SiR<sup>2</sup> <sub>2</sub> R<sup>3</sup>, --Si(OR<sup>2</sup>)<sub>2</sub> R<sup>3</sup>, --Si(OR<sup>2</sup>)<sub>2</sub> (OR<sup>3</sup>) or --OOC--NR<sup>2</sup> R<sup>3</sup>, where R<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>3</sup>, independently of one another, are hydrogen or an alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and in which one or more CH<sub>2</sub> groups may be replaced by --O--, --SO<sub>2</sub> --, --CO--, --CONR<sup>2</sup> --, --HC═CH-- or --C.tbd.C--.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>1</sup> is particularly preferably hydrogen, a branched or unbranched alkyl radical having 1 to 20 carbon atoms in which one CH<sub>2</sub> group may be replaced by --O-- or --CO--, and in which one or more hydrogen atoms may be replaced by fluorine, or is --CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)--CH<sub>2</sub> --(O--CH<sub>2</sub> --CH<sub>2</sub> --)<sub>n</sub> X, --CH<sub>2</sub> --CH<sub>2</sub> --(O--CH<sub>2</sub> --CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub> X, --CH<sub>2</sub> (CH<sub>3</sub>)--CH<sub>2</sub> --(O--CH<sub>2</sub> --CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)--)<sub>n</sub> X or --CH<sub>2</sub> --CH<sub>2</sub> (O--CH<sub>2</sub> --CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)--)<sub>n</sub> X, where n=1 to 10 and X=--NH<sub>2</sub> or --OH, or the ##STR3## The maleimide units of the formula I are preferably in the main chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The polymer to be employed according to the invention can comprise, as a homopolymer, only maleimide units of the formula I having identical R<sup>1</sup> radicals or, as a copolymer or higher polymer, maleimide units of the formula I containing different radicals R<sup>1</sup> or maleimide units of the formula I and units derived from polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated compounds of the formula II ##STR4## in which R<sup>4</sup> to R<sup>7</sup> are hydrogen, or aliphatic and/or aromatic radicals, which can be monosubstituted or polysubstituted by functional groups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>4</sup> to R<sup>7</sup> are preferably hydrogen, an aromatic radical having 6 to 10 carbon atoms or a branched or unbranched alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, in which one or more non-adjacent CH<sub>2</sub> groups may be replaced by --O--, --OOC--, --COO--, --Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> -- or --O--CO--NR<sup>8</sup>, or are --OH, --Cl, --Br, --NO<sub>2</sub>, --CN, --COOR<sup>9</sup>, --OR<sup>10</sup>, --O--Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> or --O--CONR<sup>11</sup> R<sup>12</sup>, where R<sup>8</sup>, R<sup>9</sup>, R<sup>10</sup>, R<sup>11</sup> and R<sup>12</sup> are hydrogen or an alkyl radical having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Particularly preferred olefinic monomers of the formula II are styrenes, vinyl and allyl ethers, vinyl and allyl esters, vinyl- or allyltrimethylsilane, acrylonitrile, cinnamic esters and cinnamonitrile, acrylic and methacrylic esters, acrylamides, methacrylamides and vinylnaphthalenes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Particularly preferred olefinic monomers are styrenes of the formula III and/or vinyl ethers/esters of the formula IV ##STR5## in which R<sup>13</sup> is hydrogen or methyl, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>14</sup> and R<sup>15</sup> are hydrogen, acyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, --OH, --Cl, --Br, --F, --CN, --NO<sub>2</sub>, --NR<sup>17</sup> R<sup>18</sup>, --COOR<sup>19</sup>, --OOC--R<sup>20</sup> or --O--COOR<sup>21</sup>,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">where R<sup>17</sup>, R<sup>18</sup>, R<sup>19</sup>, R<sup>20</sup> and R<sup>21</sup> are hydrogen or an alkyl radical having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, in which one or more hydrogen atoms may be substituted by --OH, --Cl, --Br, --F, --CN or --NO<sub>2</sub>, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>16</sup> is alkyl having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, in which one or more H atoms may be substituted by --OH, --Cl, --Br, --F, --CN or --NO<sub>2</sub>, acyl having 1 to 5 carbon atoms or an aromatic group having 6 to 10 carbon atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polymers comprising units of the formulae I and II contain at least 5%, preferably from 25 to 75%, particularly preferably from 40 to 60%, of maleimide units of the formula I.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The polymers to be employed according to the invention are particularly advantageously copolymers or terpolymers comprising 50% of maleimide units of the formula I and a total of 50% of units of a styrene of the formula III and/or units of a vinyl ether of the formula IV, where R<sup>1</sup> is hydrogen, --CH<sub>2</sub> OH or --C<sub>6</sub> H<sub>4</sub> --OH, R<sup>10</sup> and R<sup>11</sup> are hydrogen, R<sup>12</sup> is hydrogen or C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>6</sub> -alkyl, and R<sup>13</sup> is C<sub>6</sub> -C<sub>24</sub> -alkyl. The ratio between the number of units of the formulae III and IV is preferably from 100:0 to 0:100, particularly preferably from 100:0 to 50:50.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is particularly advantageous to employ a polymer of the formula V below, ##STR6##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The polymers to be employed according to the invention, in particular of the formula V, can have a molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>) of from 3000 to 300,000, preferably from 5000 to 100,000, particularly preferably from 10,000 to 50,000. The molecular weight is determined by GPC (gel permeation chromatography).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The polymer can be prepared in a manner known per se by free-radical polymerization using AIBN or DBPO as free-radical initiator, in concentrations of from 1 to 5 mol %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is possible to vary the radical R<sup>1</sup> on the imide nitrogen in various ways. For example, it is possible, as described above, to start from monomers which already contain the desired radical R<sup>1</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is also possible subsequently to modify the maleimide component in the copolymers and terpolymers listed here. This can be effected, for example, by deprotonating the imide (if R<sup>1</sup> =H) by means of a suitable base and subsequently reacting the product with an acyl halide. This type of reaction is known per se and described, for example, in Organikum, 15th Edn., p. 257, VEB Dt. Vlg. d. Wissenschaften, Berlin, 1981. During the reaction of the deprotonated imide with acyl halides, rearrangement reactions can occur, in particular under the conditions for the production of the alignment layer, so that the structure of the novel compound in the finished liquid-crystal cell need not necessarily be identical to the primary product of the above reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The imide component can furthermore be modified under the conditions of the Mitsunobu reaction (O. Mitsunobu, Synthesis, 1981, 1). In this reaction, a novel maleimide copolymer is reacted with an alcohol in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate with elimination of water. If optically active alcohols are used, the chirality is retained during the reaction, so that chirally modified alignment layers are obtained in this way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is also possible subsequently to introduce the maleimide component claimed into the copolymer or terpolymer mentioned here by starting from a copolymer or terpolymer containing a maleic anhydride in place of maleimide. This polymer can then, in a second step, be converted into the maleimide copolymer claimed here in a known manner (Houben-Weyl, Vol. 8/p. 657, G. Thieme Verlag, 1952) by reaction with ammonia or primary amines (R<sub>1</sub> --NH<sub>2</sub>) with removal of the water liberated during the reaction. In this case, it is unnecessary to achieve complete conversion of the maleic anhydride units into maleimide units, since a residual content of maleic anhydride in the polymer does not interfere. However, it is advantageous to convert at least 30%, preferably 50%, of the anhydride groups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is furthermore possible to start from a commercially available copolymer comprising only maleic anhydride and compounds of the formula II and, after application, to convert the resultant alignment layer into maleimide units only at the surface by reaction with a primary amine. In this case, it is also possible to carry out the imidation using diamines, preferably relatively long-chain and/or terminal diamines, which result in crosslinking or loop formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is furthermore possible to use chiral compounds, for example amino acid esters, where the chirality is also retained in this procedure. Chiral alignment layers of this type enable a particularly high degree of order to be obtained. If the surface modification is carried out using amines which contain at least one further amino group and a carboxyl, sulfonyl or phosphonyl group and which therefore form zwitterions, ionically modified alignment layers are obtained. Examples of such compounds are lysine, arginine, α, β-diaminobutyric acid, ornithine, hydroxylysine and/or citrulline.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">All the mono-, di- or polyamino compounds mentioned can be employed individually or as a mixture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Use may be made according to the invention of homo-polymers which comprise only maleimide units of the formula I containing identical R<sup>1</sup> radicals or of copolymers and higher polymers comprising maleimide units of the formula I containing different radicals R<sup>1</sup> or comprising maleimide units of the formula I and units derived from polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated compounds of the formula II, which are described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention furthermore relates to a polymer containing maleimide units of the formula I which has been rendered amphiphilic, and to the use thereof as alignment layer in liquid-crystal displays, preferably in ferroelectric liquid-crystal displays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polymers which have been rendered amphiphilic are prepared by applying or linking by covalent bond compounds, for example, of the coronand, cryptand or podand type. The polymer which has been rendered amphiphilic can be employed as alignment layer and results in significantly increased contrast in FLC displays and in greater image brightness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The substances causing the amphiphilicity can either be chemically bonded to the alignment layer or applied simply as a strongly or weakly physisorbed coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The display component causing the amphiphilicity of the alignment layer can thus be applied as an additional layer between the alignment layer and the FLC layer or added to the material of the alignment layer as a simple mixture component. A further possibility comprises coupling the substance to the material of the alignment layer by chemical reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The effective intermediate layer can be applied, for example, from a solution of suitable compounds in acetone, toluene, cyclohexanone, isopropanol, N-methyl-pyrrolidone, dioxane or the like by printing, dipping, spraying and spin-coating methods or the like. Also suitable are vacuum deposition methods, such as simple vapor deposition or reactive vapor-deposition methods (for example chemical vapor deposition (CVD)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The effective intermediate layer can be applied during various steps in the FLC display production process, for example directly after the curing or drying of the alignment layer, before the rubbing step or immediately before the bonding of the cell. The substances or substance mixtures can likewise be applied to the wet alignment layer film and cured, i.e. heated, simultaneously with the alignment layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is also advantageous to mix the active substances or substance mixtures with the polymer or polymer precursor solution prepared for the production of the alignment layer and then to apply them together with the latter in one step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The active compounds can in principle be either monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric compounds. In general, they have a moderate to strong lipophilic character with low polarity, or are distinguished by the fact that the compound has separately localized regions of relatively high and low polarity/hydrophilicity. Cyclic compounds can also have an exosphere having a rather lipophilic nature and an endosphere having a rather hydrophilic nature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is furthermore preferred, in LC displays containing the novel alignment layer, to use insulation layers in order to avoid short circuits, where the layer sequence is</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) glass,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) ITO electrode,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) insulation layer,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) alignment layer, if desired with additive admixed or chemically or physically bonded to the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to suppress the surface memory effect, it may be advantageous for the electrical capacitance of the insulation and aligrunent layers to be as high as possible (in this respect, cf. C. Escher, H. -R. Dubal, T. Harada, G. Illian, M. Murakami and D. Ohlendorf, 2nd Int., Symp. on FLC, Gothenburg, 1989, Ferroelectrics 113 (1991) 269.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For adequate insulation capacity, the thickness of the insulation layer should be at least from 50 to 100 nm. In order to achieve sufficiently high capacitances at this layer thickness, insulation layers having high dielectric constants, such as Ta<sub>2</sub> O<sub>5</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>, must be used (see also JP-A 61/170 726, JP-A 61/078 235, Y. Inabe, K. Katagiri, H. Inone, J. Kanbe, S. Yoshihara and S. Iijima, Ferroelectrics (1988), 85, pp. 255 to 264).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Particularly suitable compounds which render the alignment layer emphiphilic are macrocyclic compounds, cryptands, coronands, podands, mercapto compounds and ionophoric compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Macrocyclic compounds to be employed according to the invention are described in EP-A-0 451 822 and are reproduced here by means of the formula VI ##STR7## where a, b, c, d, e and f, independently of one another, are integers from zero to 4, where a+b+c+d+e+f is ≧7, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">-A-, -B-, -C-, -D-, -E- and -F- are identical or different and are ##STR8## where R is alkyl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R' is alkyl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in which one --CH<sub>2</sub> -- group may be replaced by --O-- or --CO O--, or is phenyl or Cl, F or CN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Cryptands and coronands, as proposed in DE-A 4 011 803, are likewise particularly suitable as compounds providing a amphiphilic effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For a classification of said complex ligands, reference is made to E. Weber and F. Vogtle, Inorganica Chimica Acta, Vol. 45, (1989), L65-L67. The ligand topo-logies listed therein are reproduced below: ##STR9##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The cryptands or coronands to be employed can be represented by the formula VII or VIII: ##STR10## where Z is --O-- or --S--,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">m and n are integers greater than zero, where m+n=2 to 6,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">--X<sup>1</sup> -- and --X<sup>2</sup> -- are identical or different and are ##STR11## or --X<sup>1</sup> -- and --X<sup>2</sup> -- together are</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">--R is alkyl or alkanoyl having 1 to 15 carbon atoms, phenyl, benzyl or benzoyl, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">t is 1 or 2; ##STR12## where --R<sup>1</sup>, --R<sup>2</sup>, --R<sup>3</sup> and --R<sup>4</sup>, independently of one another, are ##STR13## and p, q, r and s, independently of one another, are an integer from 2 to 4, where p+q+r+s=8 to 16.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferred coronands are: ##STR14##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Mercapto compounds to be employed according to the invention are represented by the formula IX below: ##STR15## where R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>3</sup> and R<sup>4</sup>, independently of one another, are a hydrogen atom, alkyl having 1 to 8 carbon atoms or alkoxy having 1 to 8 carbon atoms,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">--X-- is --O--, --S-- or --NH--,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">k and m, independently of one another, are 1, 2 or 3, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">t is zero or 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ionophoric compounds, as presented in EP-A-0 451 821, are also particularly suitable for increasing the contrast in the display by rendering of the alignment layer amphiphilic. The ionophores are defined in greater detail by the formula X: ##STR16## where R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>3</sup> and R<sup>4</sup>, independently of one another, are alkyl having 1 to 15 carbon atoms in which one --CH<sub>2</sub> -- group may be replaced by --COO-- or --CO-- or a CH<sub>2</sub> -- group which is not bonded directly to the nitrogen atom may be replaced by --O--, or are cyclohexyl, phenyl or benzyl, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">X is alkylene having 2 to 9 carbon atoms in which one or two non-adjacent --CH<sub>2</sub> -- groups may be replaced by --O--, two adjacent CH<sub>2</sub> -- groups may be replaced by 1,2-phenylene or 1,2-cyclohexylene, two adjacent --CH<sub>2</sub> -- groups may be replaced by --CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)--CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)--, and one hydrogen atom of a CH<sub>2</sub> group may be substituted by R<sup>5</sup> or R<sup>6</sup>, where R<sup>5</sup> is alkyl having 1 to 15 carbon atoms and R<sup>6</sup> is alkyl having 1 to 15 carbon atoms or --CH<sub>2</sub> --O--CH<sub>2</sub> --CO--NR<sup>1</sup> R<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Very generally, said compounds can be coupled to or in the alignment layer in, for example, the following ways:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">I Chemical coupling--i.e. the compound providing a amphiphilic effect is preferably bonded to/in the alignment layer via covalent bonds. The compound to be bonded on has the formula</div>

</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">C.sub.y --G--R.sub.g</pre>
<div class="description-paragraph"> where</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">C<sub>y</sub> is one of the abovementioned compounds providing a amphiphilic effect;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">G is a straight-chain or branched alkylene unit having 0 to 18 carbon atoms in which, in addition, one or more --CH<sub>2</sub> -- groups may be replaced by ##STR17##  cycloalkanediyl, arenediyl or heteroarenediyl in which, in addition, one or more hydrogen atoms of the CH<sub>2</sub> groups may be replaced by F;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>g</sub> is a reactive group (coupling functionality), for example --OH, --CO<sub>2</sub> H, --CO<sub>2</sub> R, --NH<sub>2</sub>, --NHR', --SH, ##STR18##  --CH═CH<sub>2</sub>, --Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> Cl, --Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> OR', --Si(OR)<sub>3</sub>, --N<sub>3</sub>, halide, --N.tbd.C or SO<sub>2</sub> CH═CH<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preference is given to compounds in which C<sub>y</sub> is the macrocyclic compounds, cryptands or coronands described at the outset.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Very particular preference is given to compounds in which C<sub>y</sub> has the following meaning: ##STR19##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Most preference is given to compounds in which C<sub>y</sub> is ##STR20## G is --O--(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub> -- or --(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub> --, Y is --O-- or N-alkyl or N-aryl,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>g</sub> is --CO<sub>2</sub> R', --N═C═O, --Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> OR', --NH<sub>2</sub> or --OH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">II Physisorption</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compounds providing the amphiphilic effect are adducted onto the surface of the alignment-layer molecules by relatively weak or relatively strong intermolecular attractive forces. The strength of the coupling to the surface can be increased by binding polar or polarizable groups into the compounds providing the amphiphilic effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The positive effect of the compounds providing a amphiphilic effect on the alignment layer can be further reinforced by the liquid-crystal mixtures which likewise contain these compounds, in particular coronands and cryptands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In displays, the alignment layer treated according to the invention has the effect, in particular, of suppressing twist states and ghost images and thus of improving the optical contrast.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, the alignment layer rendered amphiphilic can be used to produce a shock-resistant liquid-crystal switching and display device. Addition of the compounds to be employed according to the invention, in particular coronands and cryptands, to alignment layers allow the FLC mixtures to be brought into a uniform and twist-free bookshelf or quasi-bookshelf alignment by applying a continuous periodic electric voltage (explanation of terms: Dubal et at., Proc. 6th Intl. Symp. of Electrets, Oxford, England (1988); Y. Sato et al., Jap. J. Appl. Phys. 28 L 483 (1989)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It has thus been found that the polymers containing the maleimide units described can advantageously be employed as alignment layer in liquid-crystal displays which can be operated at high temperatures, preferably from 30° to 70° C., in particular from 40° to 60° C., as occur, for example, in projection applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Shock-damaged liquid-crystal displays can be re-generated using the substances providing an amphiphilic effect in alignment layers by applying a continuous, periodic voltage, as has already also been proposed in EP-A 0 451 820 using the substances in FLC mixtures.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">5 g of maleic anhydride-styrene copolymer having a styrene content of 50 mol %, M<sub>w</sub> 350,000, is refluxed for 18 hours with 2.5 g of hexylamine (=3.3 ml) in 100 ml of toluene, where the toluene runs out over a Soxleth [sic] apparatus filled with CaCl<sub>2</sub> as desiccate and mounted on top of the apparatus, and is thus kept dry. The toluene is removed by vacuum distillation in a rotary evaporator, and the flask contents are subsequently freed from any residues of hexylemine in a high vacuum. The residue is dried in vacuo over conc. H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub>, giving about 7 g of polymer having an N content of 4.5%, calculated 4.8%. The infra-red spectrum shows a C═O band at 1650-1700 cm<sup>-1</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further amines are reacted with a maleic anhydride-styrene copolymer analogously to the processes described in Examples 1 and 2. Since temperatures of above 110° C., better &gt;150° C., are necessary for the reaction, a pressure vessel must be used for low-boiling amines (Example 7). In the case of higher-boiling amines, the process can be carried out under reflux in toluene, with the water liberated during the reaction being removed, for example as described in Example 8.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Table A below shows amines as reactants which are reacted with the above-mentioned copolymer (M<sub>w</sub> 350,000, 50 mol % of styrene) in toluene by the methods of Examples 7 or 8. Also shown are the reaction temperature and duration and the nitrogen content determined by elemental analysis, if appropriate also the fluorine content. For work-up, the polymer product precipitated at low temperature is filtered off via a suction filter, the precipitate is washed with methanol and the precipitate is dried in vacuo for 48 hours over conc. H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> to constant weight. The conversion to the N-alkylimide compound can be monitored in the IR through the disappearance of the anhydride and at 1810/1750 cm<sup>-1</sup> and the appearance of the imide carbonyl band at 1700 cm<sup>-1</sup>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Construction of Test Cells</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to demonstrate the advantageous properties of the alignment layers according to the invention, test cells are produced, filled with ferroelectric liquid-crystal mixtures and then tested.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To this end, glass plates coated with indium-tin oxide (ITO) are cut and treated photolithographically so that small glass substrates having an electrode area of about 8×8 mm<sup>2</sup> are formed. These glass substrates are then cleaned first in an aqueous surfactant solution and subsequently twice in Millipore water (=demineralized water which has been substantially freed from particles via a Millipore filter unit) at about 60° C. in an ultrasound bath. After the glass substrates have been dried by means of hot air, they are coated with a wet film of a 0.5% strength by weight solution of P1 in cyclohexanone. The coating is carried out by means of a spin coater, but it can also be carried out by means of other methods, for example printing or immersion. The solution is dripped onto the glass substrate until it covers the latter completely and is pre-spun for 5 seconds at 500 rpm, after which the main spinning is carried out for 30 seconds at 4000 rpm. The wet film is dried at 160° C. for 30 minutes. The remaining layer thickness of P1 is approximately 15 nm. This alignment layer is then rubbed with a velvet-like material on a rubbing machine (bench speed: 100 mm/min; roller speed 500 rpm; power consumption: 0.4/A). The 1.8 μm spacers are then applied by means of the spin coater (0.05% strength by weight solution in isopropanol; 20 sec, 2000 rpm). The adhesive frame is printed by means of a plotter, and the liquid-crystal test cells are then bonded with the rubbing directions parallel using a membrane press (adhesive conditions: Epoxy 304 (5 parts)+curing agent 310 B (1 part) (both from E.H.C. Japan). Ethyl acetate is then added to the mixture in a ratio of 1:4. Curing temperatures: 20 min/60° C., 20 min/90° C., 40 min/150° C.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The resultant test cells are investigated with respect to their electro-optical characteristics by means of various liquid-crystal mixtures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a further embodiment, an addition layer Z1 is applied in addition to the aligrunent layer P1 according to the invention. To this end, a 0.5% strength by weight solution of Z1 in 1,4-dioxane is spin-coated onto the alignment layer at 500 rpm for 5 seconds and at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. This wet film is then dried at 120° C. for 30 minutes, giving chemical fixing of the additive. The excess additive is then, after the drying, washed off with 2-propanol in an ultrasound bath (1 min). After this step, the test cell is again constructed in the manner described above (rubbing etc).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The alignment layers P2 to P6 and the addition layer Z2 are processed analogously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to characterize the alignment layers according to the invention, ferroelectric liquid-crystal mixtures are used. The following are assessed: the alignment of liquid crystal in the test cell containing the alignment layer according to the invention; the switching behavior of the liquid crystal on application of short addressing pulses; the switching behavior of the liquid crystal on application of addressing pulse sequences which simulate operation of a matrix display; and the optical contrast, which is the ratio between the transmissions in the bright and dark switching states.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The alignment layers according to the invention are used both in the chevron structure described at the outset and in the bookshelf or quasi-bookshelf structure. The bookshelf structure is induced from the chevron structure by application of a rectangular voltage of about 10 Hz at an amplitude of from about 10 to 15 V/μm. The cells are positioned in the ray path of a polarizing microscope to which, in addition, a photodiode is attached. The photodiode is connected to a storage oscilloscope and enables recording of the optical transmission of the liquid-crystal cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A freely programmable function generator with subsequent voltage amplifier provides the switching pulses necessary for switching to the test cell. A variety of pulse shapes can be input into the function generator via a computer interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The pulse shape used simulates matrix-display operation of the 1-pixel test cells employed. The line voltage/column voltage ratio (data pulses) is an important parameter which is defined as the bias ratio. This ratio should be as large as possible, since correspondingly high contrast is only possible for a low data-pulse amplitude.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The contrast is determined via the signals from the photodiode as the ratio between the bright and dark transmissions. A distinction can further be made between the contrast of the memory states (without data pulses) and the contrast in the matrix display (with data pulses), the latter always having lower values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A further important parameter used to characterize the alignment layers is the effective tilt angle. Twice the tilt angle is identical to the switching angle. The effective tilt angle in the chevron structure is smaller than the molecular tilt angle (inclination of the molecules to the layer perpendiculars) as a consequence of the angled layer structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the occurrence of twist or bend states results in a further reduction in the effective tilt angle. The bluish color observed here for the dark switching state and the low transmission in the bright state result in low contrast.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The effective tilt angle in the bookshelf structure is significantly larger, and the bright state is thus distinguished by greater brightness. However, the occurrence of twist states again results in considerable losses in contrast. The alignment layers employed should therefore substantially suppress the formation of twist states. These properties are characterized using the tilt angle in the chevron structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The FLC mixture M1 employed has the following composition (in mol %): ##STR31## and the phase sequence S<sub>c</sub> * 65 S<sub>A</sub> * 73 N* 86 I, with a spontaneous polarization of 38 nC·cm<sup>-2</sup> at a temperature of 25° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The FLC mixture M2 employed has the following composition (in mol %)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">99.5 mol % of FLC mixture M1</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">0.5 mol % of ##STR32## and the phase sequence S*<sub>C</sub> 62 S*<sub>A</sub> 70 N* 83 I, with a spontaneous polarization of 34 nC·cm<sup>-2</sup> at a temperature of 25° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The FLC mixture M3 employed had the following composition (in mol %)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">99.5 mol % of FLC mixture M1</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">0.5 mol % of ##STR33## and the phase sequence S*<sub>C</sub> 63 S*<sub>A</sub> 69 N* 86 I, with a spontaneous polarization of 33 nC·cm<sup>-2</sup> at 25° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The effective tilt angle and the alignment of the liquid crystal are assessed in the chevron structure, which is formed immediately after the cells are filled. By contrast, the multiplexing and switching properties are measured in the bookshelf or quasi-bookshelf structure, which is obtained from the chevron structure by applying rectangular voltages (10-15 V/μm at 10 Hz, 30 s).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Compared to the reference layer, the novel alignment layer used significantly higher contrast values as a consequence of lower residual transmission in the dark switching state. This lower residual transmission is attributable to improved stability of the structure, which becomes particularly significant at high temperatures.
