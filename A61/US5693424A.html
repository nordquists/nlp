<div class="description-paragraph">This is a Divisional application of Ser. No. 08/073,310 filed Jun. 8, 1993 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,462.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1) Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition and laminates thereof, and more particularly to a thermoplastic resin composition useful as a raw material for moldings having distinguished characteristics such as mechanical strength, impact strength, elasticity, gas barrier property, adhesiveness, antistaticability, low temperature heat sealability, transparency, coatability, miscibility, moldability, radiation resistance, etc., and to laminates thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2) Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thermoplastics have been widely used in fields of industrial materials, structural materials, medical instrument materials, packaging materials for food, medicines, cosmetics, industrial articles, etc., laminated steel plates, automobile materials, etc., on the basis of their characteristics. However, they still have problems due to recent increasing demands for higher quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polyolefins have been used in various fields owing to their low cost, high mechanical strength, good sanitation, and good moldability. However, polyolefins have poor oil resistance and gas barrier property, and when they are used as containers for food such as mayonnaise, soy sauce, etc., it is impossible to preserve these kinds of food for a long time. When they are used as gasoline containers, there are such drawbacks as a large amount of gasoline leakage and swelling of containers leading to container deformation. To overcome the drawbacks, it has been so far proposed to laminate the polyolefins with polyester (which may be hereinafter referred to as PET), polyamide (which may be hereinafter referred to as PA), a saponification product of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (which may be hereinafter referred to as EVOH), aluminum foils, glass or the like through an adhesive layer, or to vapor-deposit a gas barrier material of metal, metal oxide or the like onto the polyolefins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, it is known to conduct lamination by applying a dry lamination adhesive such as a polyurethane-based adhesive, a polyacrylic adhesive or a polyester-based adhesive, or to conduct co-extrusion laminating polyolefins graft-polymerized or copolymerized with an unsaturated carboxylic acid or its anhydride as an adhesive resin for lamination. Furthermore, it is known to use olefins graft-polymerized with an acrylic resin derivative or the like as an adhesive resin for the polyolefin and EVOH (JP-A 60-165242), to use a mixture of the graft-polymerized polyolefins with carboxy-modified olefinic polymers or copolymers (JP-A 60-187550), or to use a mixture of olefinic polymers or copolymers with the grafted polyolefins (JP-A 60-184839). However, delamination of the laminates obtained even by these processes has been often observed owing to unsufficient adhesion strength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polypropylene is generally cheap and is used in various fields on the basis of its distinguished characteristics such as distinguished transparency, mechanical strength, heat resistance, gloss, chemical resistance, oil resistance, rigidity, flex fatigue resistance, etc. Among polypropylene (which may be hereinafter referred to as PP), homo PP has a high glass transition temperature and thus has such drawbacks as high brittleness at a low temperature, easy breakage, poor transparency, etc. PP has such drawbacks as a poor coatability, a high susceptibility considerable deterioration of physical properties when subjected to irradiation of radiation, or a poor heat sealability at a low temperature. In attempts to overcome these drawbacks, for example, in attempts to improve the transparency, it is known to add a dibenzylidene sorbitol derivative as a nucleating agent to PP and obtain the transparency due to the effect of the nucleating agent, as disclosed in Polymer Digest, July issue (1984), page 116 and Polymer Digest, June issue (1985) page 43. However, these procedures still have such problems as decomposition of the nucleus-making agent during the molding, emission of disagreeable odor, decrease in the impact resistance due to the effect of the nucleus-making agent, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, it is known to use special molding procedures, for example, to add hydrogenated terpene resin and a nucleating agent to PP, followed by molding and quenching, thereby to obtain a transparent sheet (JP-A 1-171833 and JP-A 1-171834) or to add an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer to PP, followed by molding and quenching below 60° C. (JP-A 1-299851). However, these procedures require a special molding machine, because it is difficult to readily obtain a molding of high transparency by ordinary molding machines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In attempts to improve the impact resistance, it is known to add 5 to 20% of polyisobutene to PP (JP-B 35-10640), to add 5 to 20% of ethylene/propylene copolymer (JP-B 35-7088), to add a lower pressure process polyethylene of high molecular weight to PP (JP-B 37-6975), or to add polyethylene (which may be hereinafter referred to as PE) and ethylene/propylene rubber to PP, thereby making the so called propylene/ethylene block copolymer  Kuroda: Kobunshi (Polymer), Vol. 28, No. 10, page 714 (1979)!. However, these procedures still have such problems as poor luster and poor transparency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, it has been proposed to add an ethylene-vinyl ester copolymer and/or ethylene-acrylate copolymer to PP (JP-A 51-145553), or to add a modified specific ethylene-propylene copolymer obtained by graft polymerization with an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride to PP (JP-A 61-89239). These procedures still have such problems as a poor effect on the improvement of coatability and a poor compatibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among polyolefins, PP has an excellent flexing characteristic (hinge characteristic), but the flex crease turns white, or when a tension is applied to PP, the site on which the tension has been applied turns white. That is, a phenomenon of local whitening, so called stress whitening, appears.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To prevent the whitening of PP, it has been so far proposed to add a lubricant or a plasticizer to PP, followed by kneading. However, this procedure has such problems as appearance of bleeding and blooming and deterioration of transparency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, in the field of medical packaging, PP moldings are usually irradiated with gamma ray of cobalt 60 or electron beams as a sterilizing means. However, such a sterilization treatment of PP deteriorates PP, that is, lowers the physical properties such as impact resistance, stretching elongation, etc. To solve the problems, various procedures including modification of PP have been proposed (JP-A 60-215047 and JP-A 61-73711). However, all these procedures have such drawbacks as insufficient transparency, and insufficient effect of control on decreases in physical properties such as impact resistance and stretching elongation after the irradiation with radiation beams.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, it has been proposed to improve the heat sealability of PP at a low temperature by adding polybutene-1, or an ethylene/propylene elastomer, or an ethylene/propylene/butene-1 copolymer to PP (JP-A 54-28351 and JP-A 54-603498). However, these procedures still have such a drawback as insufficient heat sealability at a low temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since polyvinyl alcohol (which may be hereinafter referred to as PVA) has a melting temperature and a heat decomposition temperature very close to each other, it has been impossible to conduct melt-extrusion molding of PVA. The PVA film is soft and tough under a high humidity, but loses the flexibility under a low humidity to become brittle and thus readily breakable. It has been proposed to solve these problems, for example, by adding EVOH to PVA (JP-A 49-33945) or by adding other polymers than polyolefins to modified PVA (JP-A 49-117536) or by other means (JP-A 50-123151). However, all these procedures still have insufficient melt moldability and a poor gas barrier property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Generally, PA is tough, but an impact resistance as one of indicators of toughness is considerably increased by moisture adsorption. The impact resistance of PA right after the molding or in the dry state during the winter season or at a low temperature is not always satisfactory. That is, cracks are often generated on the PA moldings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In attempts to improve the impact resistance of PA, it is known to add a copolymer resin of polyolefin and α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid or its ester, graft-modified polyolefin resin with an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid represented by maleic anhydride, ionomer copolymer resin of ethylene and methacrylic acid or its ester ionized by Na, Zn, Mg, or the like, or graft-modified ethylene/propylene/diene copolymer rubber with maleic anhydride to PA (JP-A 51-70254, JP-B 44-29262, U.S. Pat. No. 3,845,163 and JP-B 54-44108). However, these procedures still have such problems as (1) poor compatibility with PVA, (2) local generation of gel by an organic peroxide during the graft modification, (3) generation of much gel by reaction with PA, when the polymer contains unreacted monomers, resulting in yellow discoloring, and (4) decrease in the gas barrier property by blending, which follows the addition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">EVOH is used as packaging materials for food, cosmetic or medicines, which require a gas barrier property particularly to oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, EVOH is hard, very brittle and readily breakable. Since EVOH has hydroxyl groups in the molecule, it can readily absorb moisture such as water and water vapors, and its gas barrier property is much more deteriorated by moisture absorption. To overcome these drawbacks, EVOH is used as a multilayer laminate by laminating EVOH with one or more thermoplastic resins, such as polyolefins (for example, PE, PP, etc.), PET, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The lamination procedure includes co-extrusion molding process or extrusion lamination molding process for extruding a thermoplastic resin such as polyolefins, etc., EVOH and resin for bonding these polymers, thereby making a laminate, a dry lamination molding process for individual molding of these polymers, followed by lamination, a solution coating molding process, where the resulting laminate is in the form of sheets, films or bottles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The laminate sheets are used to serve as container packages, and thus the raw sheets of multilayer laminates are subjected to a secondary heat molding processing including high temperature stretching such as vacuum molding or compressed air molding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the secondary processing, the molding conditions mostly depend on the polymer resin having an intermediate melting point among the constituent materials for the multilayer laminates. That is, the secondary heat molding processing is carried out under these molding conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, EVOH, which usually belongs to the material species having a high melting point, is often subjected to the secondary processing under in appropriate molding conditions, and thus fine spaces (so called voids) or cracks are liable to form in the layers. Furthermore, such voids, cracks or local unevenness in the thickness, etc. are liable to form due to higher crystallization rate of EVOH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The laminate films undergo flexing movements in the pouch-making step, packaging step, distribution steps, etc., resulting in occurrence of pinholes or cracks in the EVOH layer. Thus, the gas barrier property or EVOH is often deteriorated considerably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In attempts to solve these problems, a method for blending EVOH with PA (JP-A 59-20345), a method for mixing EVOH with glycerin (JP-A 53-88067), a method for blending EVOH with lithium chloride, etc. (JP-A 61-281147), etc. have been proposed. However, the blending of EVOH with PA has a problem that PA reacts with EVOH during the melt molding, resulting in formation of gel or fish-eyes. The blending with a plasticizer such as glycerin, etc. has a problem that the plasticizers have a poor compatibility with EVOH and thus bleeding of these compounds takes place with time, i.e. the plasticizers move towards the boundary surface to the adhesive resin layer and the bonding strength to the layer is lowered with time. Furthermore, the blending of EVOH with lithium chloride, etc. has a problem that the distribution is often poor at the blending, or more cracks or pinholes are generated due to voids formed when the added compounds are subjected to heat stretching treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, pinholes, cracks, unevenness in thickness, etc. are very liable to appear when a multilayered laminate of EVOH is formed or processed into containers, and consequently the gas barrier property is largely deteriorated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, the multilayered laminate has another problem of effective utilization of scraps. For example, when a multilayered laminate film is processed into containers, burrs are formed up to about 40%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a process for recovering such scraps, it has been attempted to reuse a regrind obtained by grinding the foregoing scraps. For example, there are suggested a process for providing a regrind layer composed of the regrind on the multilayer laminate or a process for mixing the regrind in the outermost polyolefin layer, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, since polyolefin and gas barrier resin generally have a poor miscibility between both, and polyolefin and gas barrier resin in the regrind form an unhomogenous mixture, the following troubles during mold-processing at the time of recovery occur. That is, when a regrind layer is provided, adhesion between the regrind layer and gas barrier layer is inferior, so that peeling readily takes place, or the part of gas barrier resin in regrind is readily peeled off as fine fibrous pieces, or foreign matters readily result from uneven interlayer separation. Such foreign matters increase in a prolonged operation, resulting in formation of projections or granular structures on the ultimate products, when observed from the outermost layer side of multilayered laminate, and thus the projections or granular structures considerably deteriorate the appearance of the multilayered laminate, or in the worst case these projections or granular structures break through the resin layers at the outer side or lower the mechanical strength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the coextrusion molding, a known adhesive resin is generally used as a miscibility agent for the regrind component. However, such use of the known resin is not satisfactory yet, because of poor miscibility with EVOH or PA, and unreacted monomers, if present in the adhesive resin, readily react with EVOH or PA, resulting in much formation of gels and yellow discoloring as problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Multilayered laminates using a hygroscopic gas barrier of EVOH, PA, PVA or the like have such characteristics that permeation of a gas such as oxygen, etc. can be sufficiently suppressed at a low humidity to prevent oxidation of contents in containers, and the quality of the contents can be stabilized for a prolonged time. However, when the multilayered laminates are used in boiling water at 90° to 135° C. as in the form of retort food packages, water permeates into the multilayered laminates from the outermost layer and is absorbed into the gas barrier layer. As a result, the gas permeation resistance of the gas barrier layer is abruptly lowered. That is, the multilayered laminates cannot be used in the pouch food application, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, when a multilayered laminate consisting of a PP layer, an adhesive resin layer and an EVOH layer and having a total thickness of about 100 μm is subjected to a retort treatment in boiling water at least at 120° C., water absorption of the EVOH layer amounts to 7% by weight or more, and the oxygen permeation increases to 1,000 times as much as that before the retort treatment in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In attempts overcome these problems, it is proposed, for example, to add a drying agent comprising an inorganic metal salt to the adhesive layer that binds the gas barrier layer to the outer layer so that the adhesive layer can capture the permeated water, thereby preventing the deterioration of the gas barrier property (European Patent No. 59274, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,407,897 and 4,464,443; JP-A 57-170748). However, even in this proposed procedure, the interlayer bonding strength is decreased between the adhesive layer and the gas barrier layer, or the use is inevitably limited due to the presence of the inorganic metal salt as foreign matters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, a method for adding a phenol compound to improve the water resistance (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,347,337 and 4,289,830), and a method for forming the outermost layer of polycarbonate resin having a good water vapor permeability or PA or its mixture in close proximity to the EVOH layer (JP-A 1-253442; JP-A 1-308626; European Patent No. 322891) are known. However, these methods may be effective for thin products such as films, but not for thick product such as sheets, bottles, etc. and they are costly. In case of polycarbonate resin, it is difficult to conduct multilayered extrusion and thus a special extruder is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, in multilayered laminates containing an EVOH layer, attempts have been made to provide an EVOH layer at the outer side to accelerate restoration of the gas barrier property after the retort treatment  Paper, Film &amp; Foil Converter, October issue, page 54 (1985); Food Package, November issue, page 82 (1984); ibid, December issue, page 67 (1985); COEX '89, page 267 (1989), held by Scotland Business Research, Inc. (USA)!. However, in these attempts, the resulting laminates take an asymmetrical multilayer structure in the thickness direction, and thus requires an additional extruder in the molding, in contrast to the coextrusion molding for producing a symmetrical multilayer structure in the thickness direction, which requires only one extruder for the outer layer resin. Thus, the molding is costly and the restoration of the gas barrier property is not satisfactory yet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Recently, an attempt has been made to use EVOH having a high content of ethylene units and set the EVOH layer to a large thickness in advance in anticipation of a deterioration of the gas barrier property due to the retort treatment  Future-Pak '90, page 125 (1990), Ryder Associates, Inc. (USA)!. However, the attempt has such a disadvantage as an inevitable high cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Still furthermore, a method for blending a polymer reticular structure such as a reticular structure of vinyl alcohol-acrylate copolymer, etc. into any one of the oxygen barrier layer, the outer layer and the adhesive layer (JP-A 62-182030; JP-A 62-208344), and a method for blending an inorganic powder such as mica powder, sericite powder, etc. into the outer layer and the EVOH layer (JP-A 2-47139) have been proposed. However, the former has a problem in the molding due to poor melt moldability and heat stability of the polymer reticular structure, whereas the latter has problems due to the hardness and the resulting brittleness caused by the blending of inorganic powder.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">As a result of extensive studies to solve the problems of prior art, the present inventors have found that a thermoplastic resin composition comprising an ethylenic copolymer containing at least one of acrylamide derivative units and methacrylamide derivative units, and other thermoplastic resin can solve the problems and have established the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the present invention, there is provided a thermoplastic resin composition, which comprises:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(A) an ethylenic copolymer containing at least one of acrylamide derivative units and methacrylamide derivative units, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(B) other thermoplastic resin.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">(C) a hydroscopic gas barrier layer as an intermediate layer, laid one upon another.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ethylenic copolymers containing at least one of acrylamide derivative units and methacrylamide derivative units for use as component (A) in the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention can be prepared according to the ordinary procedures disclosed in Kobunshi Ronbunshu (Polymer Articles), Vol. 35, No. 12, page 795 (1978); U.S. Pat. No. 3,629,209; JP-B 43-21655; JP-B 44-19537; JP-B 43-23766; JP-B 43-9063; JP-A 63-304010. The procedures include bulk polymerization, solution polymerization, suspension polymerization, emulsion polymerization, etc. Bulk copolymerization is the most popular procedure, where the ethylenic copolymer is prepared by radical polymerization at a temperature of 100° to 300° C. and a pressure of 700 to 3,000 atmospheres. A preferable pressure range is 1,000 to 2,500 atmospheres and a preferable temperature range is 150° to 270° C. as an average temperature in the reactor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Melt flow rate (which will be hereinafter referred to as MFR) at 190° C. of the ethylenic copolymers for use in the present invention is preferably less than 300 g/10 minutes. To improve the bendability with other thermoplastic resin, a portion of the thermoplastic resin can be used as blended therewith in advance, and in that case basically it is not objectionable that MFR exceeds 300 g/10 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Acrylamide derivatives and methacrylamide derivatives that constitute the ethylenic copolymers means N-alkyl derivatives and N,N-dialkyl derivatives, and specifically include, for example, N-methylacrylamide, N-ethylacrylamide, N-n-propylacrylamide, N-isopropylacrylamide, N-n-butylacrylamide, N-isobutylacrylamide, N-t-butylacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N,N-diethylacrylamide, N-ethylmethacrylamide, N-n-propylmethacrylamide, N-t-butylmethacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N,N-diethylmethacrylamide, etc., which can be used alone or in mixture. Above all, N-ethylacrylamide, N-isopropylacrylamide, N-t-butylacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N,N-diethylacrylamide, N-n-propylacrylamide, and N-t-butylacrylamide are preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Content of acrylamide derivative units and methacrylamide units in the ethylenic copolymer is usually 0.01 to 50% by weight, preferably 1 to 45% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The ethylenic copolymer for use in the present invention can contain ethylene, at least one of acrylamide and methacrylamide and units derived from other polymerizable monomer. The other polymerizable monomer includes, for example, ester compounds, acid compounds, ether compounds, hydrocarbon compounds, etc., each having an unsaturated bond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ester compounds having an unsaturated bond include, for example, vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, octyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, benzyl acrylate, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, octyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, methyl fumarate, ethyl fumarate, propyl fumarate, butyl fumarate, dimethyl fumarate, diethyl fumarate, dipropyl fumarate, dibutyl fumarate, methyl maleate, ethyl maleate, propyl maleate, butyl maleate, dimethyl maleate, diethyl maleate, dipropyl maleate, dibutyl maleate, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Acid compounds having an unsaturated bond include, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, etc. Ether compounds having an unsaturated bond include, for example, methylvinyl ether, ethylvinyl ether, propylvinyl ether, butylvinyl ether, octadecylvinyl ether, phenylvinyl ether, etc. Hydrocarbon compounds having an unsaturated bond include, for example, styrene, norborene, butadiene, and further acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrolein, crotonaldehyde, trimethoxyvinylsilane, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Basically it is preferable that the polymerizable monomer will not react with the amide groups of acrylamide derivatives and methacrylamide derivatives, but when its amount is selected in view of the stoichiometric amount, it is possible to use monomers reactable with these derivatives. One or more of such polymerizable monomers can be used in accordance with desired applications. Content of the polymerizable monomer or monomers is not more than 40% by weight. Above 40% by weight, the characteristics proper to the ethylenic copolymer will be deteriorated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The resin composition can contain other thermoplastic resin as component (B). The other thermoplastic resin (B) includes, for example, polyolefin including PE, PP and EVOH, halogen-containing polymers, thermoplastic resin containing unsaturated carboxylic acid or its anhydride, PVA, PA, PET, polyacetal, polycarbonate, polyphenylene oxide, polysulfone, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) In Case that the Component (B) is Polyolefin:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferable polyolefin includes, for example, PE, PP, polyisoprene, polybutene, poly-3-methylbutene-1, poly-4-methylpentene-1, polybutadiene, copolymers containing constituent units of the foregoing polymers, such as ethylene/propylene copolymer, block copolymers of straight chain, low density polyethylene or propylene/ethylene containing butene-1, 4-methylpentene-1, hexene-1, octene-1, or the like as a comonomer, or copolymer of ethylene/vinyl acetate, or mixtures of these polymers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention, which comprises (A) ethylenic copolymer and (B) polyolefin, has a higher bonding strength per se than that of the so far employed copolymer of ethylene and unsaturated carboxylic acid or its anhydride, or graft polymer obtained by graft modification of the polyolefin with an unsaturated carboxylic acid or its anhydride in the presence of an organic peroxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is necessary that the total resin composition of the present invention contains 0.05 to 40% by weight of acrylamide derivative units and methacrylamide derivative units, which constitute the ethylenic copolymer. Below 0.05% by weight, no such a high bonding strength is obtained, whereas above 40% by weight the water absorption is increased, resulting in an extrusion molding trouble.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, the present thermoplastic resin composition can contain a rubbery substance. Particularly when PP is used as component (B) thermoplastic resin, the bonding strength is more improved by use of the rubbery substance. Examples of the rubbery substance include styrene/butadiene rubber or its hydrogenated rubber, acrylonitrile/butadiene rubber or its hydrogenated rubber, butyl rubber, chloroprene rubber, silicone rubber, acryl rubber, urethane rubber, polybutadiene rubber, ethylene/propylene rubber, ethylene/propylene/diene terpolymer, polyisobutylene rubber, polybutene-1 rubber, etc. Furthermore, copolymers of ethylene with α-olefin such as propylene, butene-1, 4-methylpentene-1, octene, etc., for example, low crystalline polyethylene having a lower density (which may be hereinafter referred to as ULD or VLDPE) than that of the ordinary low density polyethylene can be used as a rubbery substance. Above all, copolymer rubber of ethylene with α-olefin such as propylene, butene-1, or 4-methylpenten-1 is preferable in the field of food package from the sanitary viewpoint. In the field of industrial packages, the ethylene/α-olefin/diene terpolymer is preferable. Still furthermore, it is preferable that the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer rubbery substances contain not more than 0.2% by weight of very low molecular weight components having a molecular weight of particularly not more than 2,000.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present resin composition contains usually 3 to 50% by weight, preferably 5 to 40% by weight, more preferably 10 to 30% by weight of the rubbery substance. The content of the rubbery substance is selected in view of the improvement effect on the bonding strength between the resin layers of the laminate, practical physical properties, moldability, etc. Below 3% by weight, the improvement effect on the bonding strength is not satisfactory, whereas above 50% by weight the characteristics of the adhesive layer such as stiffness, heat resistance, etc. are lost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present resin composition has a good bonding strength particularly between polyolefin and EVOH, PA, PET or metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) In Case of Thermoplastic Resin Containing an Unsaturated Carboxylic Acid or its Anhydride as Component (B):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thermoplastic resin containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid or its anhydride is the component (B) mentioned in (1) polyolefin case, which are further copolymerized into the polymer molecular chains or graft-modified with dicarboxylic acids or their anhydrides such as maleic acid or maleic anhydride, or monocarboxylic acids such as methacrylic acid or acrylic acid. In this case, the resulting thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention has a distinguished bonding strength and also can be blended with a rubbery substance as in (1) polyolefin case.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) In Case of PP as Component (B):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">PP as component (B) in the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention includes homo PP, ethylene/propylene random PP, ethylene/propylene block PP and their mixtures. When ethylene/propylene random PP or ethylene/propylene block PP is used rather than homo PP, a better miscibility with the ethylenic copolymer as component (A) can be obtained, whereas, when homo PP is used, better transparency can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is necessary that the present thermoplastic resin composition contains (A) 1 to 70% by weight of ethylenic copolymer and (B) 99 to 30% by weight of PP. Below 30% by weight of PP, the characteristics proper to PP may be deteriorated in some cases, whereas above 99% by weight no improvement effects are obtained on the transparency, impact resistance, radiation resistance, coatability, etc. Thus, PP is not practical outside the above-mentioned range. On the other hand, below 1% by weight of ethylenic copolymer, no improvement effects are obtained on the transparency, impact resistance, radiation resistance, coatability, etc., whereas above 70% by weight the characteristics proper to PP are deteriorated and thus the ethylenic copolymer is not practical outside the above-mentioned range. 2 to 60% by weight of ethylenic copolymer and 40 to 98% by weight of PP are preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, not more than 50% by weight of other thermoplastic resin such as polyethylene can be blended with the present thermoplastic resin composition on the basis of the total mixture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, a thermoplastic resin composition useful as a raw material for moldings having distinguished impact resistance, mechanical strength, transparency, coatability, low temperature sealability, radiation resistance, etc. can be obtained without any deterioration of characteristics proper to PP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) In Case of PVA as Component (B):</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The thus obtained PVA has a degree of polymerization of preferably 50 or more, more preferably 200 to 2,000 from the viewpoint of melt fluidity and mechanical strength. On the other hand, the saponification degree of vinyl acetate in the polyvinyl acetate or vinyl acetate copolymer is 50% by more or more, preferably 70% by mole or more from the viewpoint of gas barrier property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present thermoplastic resin composition can provide good melt moldability, gas barrier property and mechanical strength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(5) In Case of PA as Component (B):</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The present thermoplastic resin composition can contain other thermoplastic resin besides the components (A) and (B).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As to the mixing ratio of the components (A) and (B) in the present thermoplastic resin composition, it is necessary that the present thermoplastic resin composition has (A) 2 to 85% by weight of ethylenic copolymer and (B) 98 to 15% by weight of PA. Below 2% by weight of ethylene copolymer, no such effect of the present invention will be obtained, when blended with PA, whereas above 85% by weight characteristics proper to PA, such as gas barrier property, etc. will be unpreferably deteriorated. It is preferable that the present thermoplastic resin composition contains 5 to 70% by weight of ethylenic copolymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In case of adding other thermoplastic resins besides the components (A) and (B), 1 to 90% by weight, preferably 5 to 80% by weight, of the other thermoplastic resin can be added to the thermoplastic resin composition containing PA and the ethylenic copolymer on the basis of the thermoplastic resin composition. The other thermoplastic resin can be merely blended with the thermoplastic resin composition containing PA and the ethylenic copolymer. From the viewpoint of gas barrier property, the present thermoplastic resin composition must contain at least 10% by weight, preferably at least 15% by weight, of PA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, a thermoplastic resin composition useful as a raw material for moldings having a distinguished gas barrier property, a good balance between the impact resistance and the rigidity, a high mechanical strength, etc. can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(6) In Case of EVOH as Component (B):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, saponification products of olefin-vinyl acetate copolymer (which may be thereinafter referred to merely as "saponification product") refer to saponification products of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVOH), saponification products of propylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, etc., among which EVOH is preferable for use in the present invention due to its ready preparation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, EVOH containing 15 to 60% by mole of ethylene component and having a saponification degree of vinyl acetate component of at least 90% is used. Below less than 15% by mole of ethylene component the melt moldability is lowered, and below a saponification degree of vinyl acetate component of 90% the gas barrier property is deteriorated. Preferably EVOH containing 25 to 50% by mole of ethylene component and having a saponification degree of vinyl acetate component of at least 96% is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">EVOH may contain, besides ethylene and vinyl acetate (or vinyl alcohol derived from saponification of vinyl acetate), unsaturated acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, etc. or their alkyl esters, or α-olefins such as propylene, butene, α-decene, α-octadecene, etc. as comonomers in such a small amount as not to deteriorate the major characteristics of saponification products.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As to the mixing ratio of the present thermoplastic resin composition comprising (A) ethylenic copolymer and (B) saponification product, the present thermoplastic resin composition contains (A) 90 to 1% by weight of ethylenic copolymer and (B) 10 to 99% by weight of saponification product. Below 10% by weight of saponification product no gas barrier property will be obtained, whereas above 99% by weight no effects will be obtained on prevention of pinhole and crack development, prevention of uneven thickness, improvement of heat stretchability, etc. Preferably, 20 to 96% by weight of saponification product is used in the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Melt index (MFR under a load of 1.16 kg at 230° C. according to JIS-K 6758) of the present thermoplastic resin composition is not particularly limited, and is appropriately in a range of 0.1 to 50 g/10 min. for a resin composition for extrusion molding, though dependent on type of molding procedures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present thermoplastic resin composition, better flexibility, impact resistance and gas barrier property can be obtained than those of single EVOH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, it is preferable that the thermoplastic resin composition comprises (A) ethylenic copolymer comprising ethylene and at least one of acrylamide derivative unit and methacrylamide derivative unit, (B) at least one of saponification product and PA, and a thermoplastic resin containing 0.001 to 20% by weight of a unit derived from unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride, and another thermoplastic resin. In this thermoplastic resin composition, at least one of saponification product and PA is used as component (B) to improve the compatibility of the respective components. The saponification product used in this case includes, for example, EVOH, saponification products of ethylene/propylene/vinyl acetate copolymer, saponification products of propylene/vinyl acetate copolymer, etc. among which EVOH is preferably used particularly from the viewpoint of ready polymerization. It is also preferable that EVOH contains at least 15% by mole, preferably 15 to 60% by mole, of ethylene component and has a saponification degree of vinyl acetate component of at least 90%. Below 15% by mole of ethylene component, the melt moldability will be unsatisfactory, whereas above 60% by mole the gas barrier property will be deteriorated. When the saponification degree is less than 90%, the gas barrier property will be also deteriorated. EVOH containing 25 to 50% by mole of ethylene component and having a saponification degree of vinyl acetate component of at least 90% is particularly preferable. EVOH can contain, besides the ethylene component and the vinyl acetate component or vinyl alcohol unit derived by saponification of the vinyl acetate, unsaturated acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, moleic acid, etc. or their alkyl esters, α-olefins such as propylene, butene, α-decene, α-octadecene, etc., as comonomer components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, it is desirable that the content of ethylenic copolymer as component (A) is 1 to 40% by weight, preferably 2 to 35% by weight, more preferably 4 to 20% by weight. Below 1% by weight, the thermoplastic resin composition will be non-uniform, whereas above 40% by weight the thermoplastic resin will be soft, causing a trouble in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case a thermoplastic resin composition containing a thermoplastic resin containing 0.01 to 20% by weight of unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride as a third component besides the components (A) and (B) is used. The thermoplastic resin is usually used as an adhesive resin for EVOH or PA. The content of the unit derived from unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride in the thermoplastic resin of the third component is preferably in a range of 0.01 to 20% by weight. Below 0.01% by weight the mechanical strength of the resin composition will be unsatisfactory, and the compatibility of EVOH or PA with the thermoplastic resin will be decreased, whereas above 20% by weight the reaction with EVOH or PA will excessively proceed, resulting in undesirable coloring or gel formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferable content of the unit derived from unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride is in a range of 0.2 to 10% by weight. Unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride includes, for example, maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, endic anhydric, citraconic anhydride, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thermoplastic resin as the third component may further contain a polymerizable monomer unit besides the unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride. The polymerizable monomer includes ester compounds, acid compounds, ether compounds, hydrocarbon compounds, etc. each containing an unsaturated bond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Besides the thermoplastic resin containing the unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride, other thermoplastic resins such as polyolefins, e.g. PE, PA, copolymers of ethylene with α-olefin having 3 to 12 carbon atoms, etc.; polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate; polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonate, etc. can be used as a fourth component thermoplastic resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present thermoplastic resin composition can contain various additives and compounding agents, if required. Examples of additives and compounding agents include an antioxidant (heat stabilizer), an ultraviolet absorber (light stabilizer), an antistatic agent, an anti-mist agent, a flame retardant, a lubricating agent (slip agent and antiblocking agent), inorganic and organic fillers, a reinforcing agent, a coloring agent (dye and pigment), a foaming agent, a cross-linking agent, a perfume, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Procedure for blending to prepare the present thermoplastic resin composition is not particularly limited, and it is preferable to conduct pelletizing, for example, by a ribbon blender, a higher speed mixer, a kneader, a pelletizer, mixing rolls, etc. and then dry the resulting pellets. The respective components of the present thermoplastic resin composition can be directly charged into a molding machine to conduct molding. Additives and compounding agents can be added to the component polymers of the resin composition in the production line for pelletization or to the resin composition when pelletized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Multilayered laminate of the present invention will be described below:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present multilayered laminate is a laminate, which comprises:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(A) at least one resin layer comprising an ethylenic copolymer containing ethylene units and at least one of acrylamide derivative units and methacrylamide derivative units,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(B) a layer of other thermoplastic resin, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(C) a hygroscopic gas barrier layer as an intermediate layer, laid one upon another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present multilayered laminate, component (A) is the same as component (A) in the present thermoplastic resin composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Content of the acrylamide derivative units and methacrylamide derivative units in the ethylenic copolymer is usually 0.1 to 50% by weight, preferably 1 to 45% by weight. Below 0.1% by weight, the effect on the prevention of gas barrier property from a decrease in the retort treatment will not be satisfactory, whereas above 50% by weight the copolymer will lose the flexibility and the rigidity will not be enough when made into multilayered laminates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present multilayered laminate, a hygroscopic gas barrier layer (C) is used as an intermediate layer. For the hygroscopic gas barrier layer, at least one of saponification products of olefin-vinyl acetate copolymer, and PA is preferably used. The saponification products of olefin/vinyl acetate copolymer include, for example, EVOH, saponification products of propylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, etc. Particularly, EVOH is preferably used due to the ready polymerization. EVOH containing at least 15% by mole, preferably 15 to 60% by mole, of ethylene units and having a saponification degree of vinyl acetate component of at least 90% is preferable. When the content of ethylene units is below 15% by mole, the melt moldability will be unsatisfactory, whereas above 60% by mole the gas barrier property is deteriorated. When the saponification degree is less than 90%, the gas barrier property will be deteriorated. EVOH containing 25 to 50% by mole of ethylene units and having a saponification degree of at least 96% is particularly preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Besides the ethylene units, vinyl acetate units and vinyl alcohol units formed by saponification of vinyl acetate, such unsaturated acids as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, etc., or their alkyl esters, or such α-olefins as propylene, butene, α-decene, α-octadecene, etc. may be contained as monomer units.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of PA include polycondensation products of lactam, ε-amino acids, and dibasic acids and diamines, as mentioned before.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present multilayered laminate, a layer of other thermoplastic resin is provided as a layer (B). Examples of the other thermoplastic resin include polyolefins typical of e.g. PP and PE, polycarbonate, PA, etc. The polyolefins refers to medium and high density PE, PP, ethylene/propylene random copolymer, ethylene-propylene block copolymer, copolymers of ethylene with α-olefin having 3 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of copolymers of ethylene with α-olefin having 3 to 12 carbon atoms include ethylene/butene-1 copolymer, ethylene/4-methylpentene-1 copolymer, ethylene/hexene-1 copolymer, modified PP prepared by blending ethylene/butene-1 copolymer with ethylene/propylene rubber, modified polybutene, modified ethylene/4-methylpentene, etc. Furthermore, the polyolefins include copolymers of the polyolefinic polymer grafted with an unsaturated carboxylic acid or its anhydride in the presence of an organic peroxide or copolymerized with other monomers (e.g. methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">From the viewpoint of a sterilizing means used for packaging of food, medicaments, etc. i.e. so called retort treatment, PP such as ethylene/propylene random copolymer, ethylene/propylene block copolymer, etc. and polyester are preferable among them. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of cost and feasibility, PP is particularly preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the layer structure of the present multilayered laminate it is necessary to provide at least one resin layer (A) comprising an ethylenic copolymer containing ethylene units and at least one of acrylamide derivative units and methacrylamide derivative units. Without the layer (A), the effect of the present invention is not be obtained. The layer (A) may be provided in close proximity to the hygroscopic gas barrier layer (C), or distant therefrom. When the layer (A) is provided in close proximity to the layer (C), and when the layer (C) has a good miscibility with the ethylenic copolymer, as EVOH or PA, only ethylenic copolymer is used as layer (A) and provided in direct contact with the layer (C).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the layer (A) is provided distant from the layer (C) on the other hand, the ethylenic copolymer may be mixed into the adhesive resin layer in case of coextrusion molding. In that case, the peel strength to EVOH or PA is improved. The ethylenic copolymer may be also mixed into a layer containing scraps, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In these cases, the content of the ethylenic copolymer is desirably in a range of 2 to 80% by weight. Below 2% by weight, the effect on capturing the water permeated therein during the retort treatment or boiling sterilization treatment will be reduced, whereas above 80% by weight the rigidity will be undesirably lowered. Preferable range is 5 to 70% by weight. When the layer (A) is provided at the outside of the layer (C), the effect of the present invention will be more remarkable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present multilayered laminate can be prepared generally by simultaneous extrusion molding of resins in a multilayered state of molten resin flows from a corresponding number of extruders to the number of the resins, i.e. by the so-called coextrusion molding (feed block, multimanifold).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present multilayered laminate can be also prepared by coinjection molding, coextrusion pipe molding, dry laminate molding using a polyethyleneimine or titanate coupling agent or an adhesive for dry laminate such as isocyanate-acryl-based adhesive, etc. or sandwich lamination molding, or by other molding procedures such as coextrusion lamination molding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thus obtained multilayered laminate can be further subjected to reheating and stretching by a vacuum molding machine, a compressed air molding machine, a stretching blow molding machine, etc., or to heating and stretching by a uniaxial or biaxial stretching machine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present multilayered laminate can maintain the gas barrier property proper to the gas barrier layer without any deterioration of the gas barrier property, because it seems that the water permeated therein during the retort treatment, etc. is absorbed into the ethylenio copolymer of layer (A), which is composed of similar hydroscopic material, before the water is absorbed into the hygroscopic gas barrier layer (C) as an intermediate layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present multilayered laminate has distinguished gas barrier property and mechanical strength and can well preserve the content, when formed in pouches, even if subjected to a retort treatment or boiling treatment.</div>
