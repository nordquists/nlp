<div class="description-paragraph">This is a division of application Ser. No. 08/576,909, filed Dec. 22, 1995 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,575,957.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to acicular electroconductive fine particles of tin oxide, a process for producing the same, and a method for using the same, more particularly to an acicular electroconductive fine particles of tin oxide capable of providing excellent, highly functional articles with an increased range of applications and increased values added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Various materials have been proposed as an electroconductivity-imparting agent or antistatic agent for plastics, rubbers, fibers, etc., or as an electroconductivity-imparting agent for a support of recording materials such as electrophotographic copying papers, static recording papers, etc. For example, there are known acicular or fibrous electroconductive tin oxide particles (e.g., see JP-A-56-120519, JP-A-62-158199 and JP-A-5-117906), antimony-containing tin oxide spherical particles (e.g., see JP-A-4-77317), electroconductive stannic oxide fibers (e.g., see JP-A-61-17421), electroconductive particles comprising titanium dioxide powder the surface of which is coated with an electroconductive layer comprising tin oxide or tin oxide and antimony oxide (e.g., see JP-A-56-41603), fibrous potassium titanate the surface of which is coated with stannic oxide (e.g., see JP-B-61-26933), etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since the above-mentioned tin oxide particles, titanium dioxide particles or potassium titanate electroconductive particles have a so-called electronic conduction type electroconductive function, they have a higher stability of electroconductivity against humidity and temperature as compared with ionic conduction type materials such as polyelectrolytes and they have recently been noticed to be utilized as a functional materials such as an electroconductivity imparting agents for rendering materials and articles antistatic in various fields, such as paints, inks, plastics and fibers, and, furthermore, as reinforcing fillers. Their application has been rapidly attempted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The electroconductivity-imparting agent is incorporated in rubbers, plastics, papers, etc. or dispersed in a solution containing a binder to prepare a coating solution, followed by coating this solution on various films, sheets, supports, vessels, etc. In order to obtain superior electroconductivity, the content of the particles must be increased so that at least adjacent particles intimately contact with each other. Therefore, it is difficult to produce electroconductive materials or electroconductive layers requiring transparency by using such particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, if an acicular or fibrous electroconductivity-imparting agent is used, electroconductive paths can effectively be formed even with a small amount of the electroconductivity-imparting agent per unit area or volume. However, when, for example, carbon fibers, metal wools, metal whiskers, etc. are used, since these are all colored, they are not suitable for the use requiring transparency or requiring whiteness such as paper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to solve these problems, for example, a white electroconductive materials has been proposed which comprises a fibrous potassium titanate coated with a conductive layer of tin oxide. This has no problem in the shape of particles, but is high in powder resistance and is unsatisfactory in strength. Even when the conductive layer comprises tin oxide and antimony oxide, there is a problem that a desired materials having a low powder resistance hardly produced owing to the influence of potassium contained therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, it is known that conventional electroconductive stannic oxide fibers are produced by a process of very slowly heating and firing tin oxalate (JP-A-56-120519), the process of evaporating tin oxide using copper as a solvent and introducing the vapor into a low-temperature zone to precipitate the tin oxide (JP-A-62-158199), a process of spinning a spinning solution prepared using a tin compound (JP-A-5-117906), etc. However, the products obtained by these processes are thick and long, for example, 0.5 μm in diameter and about 3 mm in length, and, furthermore, cannot be used in the fields requiring transparency. In addition, the processes comprise melting the starting material in an electric furnace and precipitating a fibrous product from the melt and they need a long time and are unsuitable for industrial production.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above-mentioned uses or applications of electroconductive powders, recently, they are required to have an ability to impart the desired electroconductivity, for example, in antistatic treatment for avoiding static charging of OHP films, CRT windows, IC packages and containers of electronic equipments and for use in a liquid crystal display and transparent electrodes such as EL body and, simultaneously, required to cause substantially no absorption of light by the surface of materials to be treated and to be able to form an ultra-thin electroconductive film.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The object above has been attained by a process for producing an acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles having a mean diameter of 0.005-1 μm and a mean length of 0.05-10 μm and an aspect ratio of 3 or higher which process comprises firing a starting material containing tin, silicon and an alkali metal halide at 700°-1200° C. and removing soluble salts from the resulting fired product; a process for producing the above-mentioned acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles additionally containing antimony, which process comprises adding a solution of an antimony compound to a suspension of the above-mentioned acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles, then carrying out neutralization to deposit hydrous antimony oxide on the surface of the tin oxide fine particles, and, thereafter, firing the filtrated and recovered product at 700°-1000° C.; acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles having a mean diameter of 0.005-1 μm and a mean length of 0.05-10 μm and an aspect ratio of 3 or higher; the above-mentioned acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles which additionally contain antimony; an aqueous dispersion obtained by dispersing the above-mentioned acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles in an aqueous medium; an aqueous dispersion obtained by dispersing the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles containing antimony in an aqueous medium; and an electroconductive composition which comprises 100 parts by weight of a resin based on solid matter and 3-200 parts by weight of the above-mentioned acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles or the above-mentioned acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine powder containing antimony.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In an attempt to provide an electroconductivity-imparting agent which solves the above-mentioned problems and satisfy the above performances, the inventors have conducted researches on efficient impartation of electroconductivity by adding tin oxide fine particles in a small amount by making the tin oxide fine particles acicular for easily continuously contacting the particles with each other in a medium used. As a result, it has been found that (1) when tin oxide fine particles have an acicular shape with a specific mean length, a specific mean diameter and an aspect ratio of greater than a specific value, the tin oxide fine particles can be an optimum high-functional material which can impart markedly excellent conductivity, transparency and surface smoothness, (2) when tin oxide fine particles are prepared by firing a tin component in the presence of an alkali metal halide, unexpectedly the tin oxide can become acicular only when a silicon component is present, and the acicular tin oxide fine particles of an optimum length of the above (1) can be industrially very advantageously produced, and, in addition, the product which is subjected to a treatment for removal of soluble salts is excellent in performances such as electroconductivity, transparency, surface smoothness and adhesion in various uses, and, furthermore, when the silicon component is allowed to remain in a given amount, the resulting fine particles are excellent in dispersibility in water, and an aqueous dispersion suitable for various uses can easily be produced, (3) when an antimony component is additionally present in the firing step for preparing the acicular tin oxide fine particles of the above (2), there can be obtained acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles containing antimony which have a superior electroconductivity to that of the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles containing no antimony, and (4) acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles containing antimony which have substantially no bluish color and a high lightness, excellent electroconductivity and transparency, and good acicularity can be obtained by producing hydrous antimony oxide on the surface of the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles produced in the above (2), filtrating and recovering the particles and firing them. Thus, the present invention has been accomplished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, the present invention relates to acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles having a mean diameter of 0.005-1 μm and a mean length of 0.05-10 μm and an aspect ratio of 3 or higher, preferably acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles having a mean diameter of 0.005-0.05 μm and a mean length of 0.1-3 μm and an aspect ratio of 5 or higher. The present invention further relates to the above acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles containing antimony. The present invention further relates to a process for producing the tin oxide fine particles and a method for using the fine particles. The "mean particle size" (the mean diameter and length) used in the present invention is a 50 wt % mean particle size obtained by observing an electron photomicrograph (×100,000). Furthermore, the "acicular particles" used in the present invention includes fibrous particles, columnar particles, rod-like particles and particles of similar shapes within the above-mentioned ranges of the sizes in addition to the acicular particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles of the present invention can be obtained by firing a starting material containing tin, silicon and an alkali metal halide at 700°-1200° C. and, then, removing soluble salts in the resulting fired product. Alternatively, the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles containing antimony can be obtained by firing a starting material containing tin, antimony, silicon and an alkali metal halide and, then, removing soluble salts in the resulting fired product or by depositing hydrous antimony oxide on the surface of the acicular tin oxide particles as substrate and then firing them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The starting materials in the present invention contain tin, silicon and an alkali metal halide or contain tin, antimony, silicon and an alkali metal halide. Among them, those which do not contain one or more components other than tin are called precursors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The starting materials may be those which are obtained by adding a silicon compound and an alkali metal halide to a precursor comprising hydrous tin oxide or a dehydrated product thereof; those which are obtained by adding an alkali metal halide to a precursor comprising hydrous tin oxide or a dehydrated product thereof containing silicon; those which are obtained by depositing hydrous silicon oxide on the surface of a precursor comprising hydrous tin oxide or a dehydrated product thereof and then adding an alkali metal halide thereto; those which are obtained by adding an alkali metal halide to a precursor comprising hydrous tin oxide or a dehydrated product thereof containing antimony and silicon; those which are obtained by adding at least one of an antimony compound and a silicon compound and an alkali metal halide to a precursor comprising hydrous tin oxide or a dehydrated product thereof containing at least one of antimony and silicon; or those which are obtained by depositing hydrous silicon oxide on the surface of a precursor comprising hydrous tin oxide or a dehydrated product thereof containing antimony and then adding an alkali metal halide thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The precursor comprising a tin compound and a silicon compound or a tin compound, an antimony compound and a silicon compound can be prepared by various processes using particles of the respective compounds or solutions of the respective compounds. For example, mention may be made of the following processes: (a) an aqueous solution of a tin compound and an aqueous solution of a silicon compound, and an aqueous alkali solution are added in parallel to a hot water of 70°-90° C. to carry out neutralization or an aqueous solution of a tin compound and an aqueous solution of an antimony compound, and an aqueous solution of a silicon compound and an aqueous alkali solution are added in parallel to a hot water of 70°-90° C. to carry out neutralization, (b) an aqueous alkali solution is added to an aqueous solution of a tin compound or a mixed aqueous solution of an aqueous solution of a tin compound and an aqueous solution of an antimony compound to carry out neutralization and then an aqueous solution of a silicon compound is added to adjust the pH to a given value or colloidal silica is added, and (c) an aqueous solution of a tin compound is added to an aqueous alkali solution or an aqueous solution of a tin compound and an aqueous solution of an antimony compound are added to an aqueous alkali solution to carry out neutralization and then an aqueous solution of a silicon compound is added to adjust the pH to a given value or colloidal silica is added. Of these processes, the process (a) is industrially preferred, and, in this case, the pH of the neutralization reaction solution is kept at 3 or more, preferably 5-10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The precursors are preferably those which are prepared by parallel addition of a stannic chloride solution or a stannic chloride solution and an antimony chloride solution with a sodium silicate solution. The antimony component in the precursors is preferably hydrous antimony oxide obtained by treating an antimony chloride solution with an alkali in the system of producing hydrous tin oxide by neutralizing or hydrolyzing a tin chloride solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The system of producing the hydrous tin oxide in the present invention means the step of producing the hydrous tin oxide by neutralizing or hydrolyzing the aqueous solution of a tin compound in the above processes (a)-(c), but it further includes the cases of producing a co-precipitate of hydrates of tin oxide and silicon oxide by neutralizing the solutions of a tin compound and a silicon compound and of producing a co-precipitate of hydrates of tin oxide, antimony oxide and silicon oxide by neutralizing the solutions of a tin compound, an antimony compound and a silicon compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thus obtained precursor is subjected to ordinary washing, drying, pulverizing, etc. and fired at 700°-1200 C. in the presence of an alkali metal halide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the precursor and the alkali metal halide are mixed, this can be carried out by various methods. For example, the precursor treated as mentioned above and an alkali metal halide can be mixed by a mixing stirrer such as Henschel mixer, and when the resulting mixture is pulverized by a dry-type pulverizer, more preferred product in acicularity can be obtained. At this time, various adjustors can be added for adjusting the properties of the final product. For example, in order to adjust the acicularity of the acicular fine particles, phosphoric acid compounds such as potassium phosphate can be added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The firing can be carried out at 700°-1200° C., preferably 800°-1100° C. If the firing temperature is lower than 700° C., the acicularity is insufficient and if it exceeds 1200° C., the diameter of the particles becomes longer and the transparency is apt to be damaged. The firing time is suitably 30 minutes to 5 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Various alkali metal halides can be used, and examples are sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and lithium chloride. These may be used each alone or in admixture. The amount of the alkali metal halide is 1% or more, preferably 10-100% based on the total weight of SnO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> or SnO<sub>2</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> of the precursor. If the amount is smaller than the above range, the acicularity is insufficient, and if it is too large, this is economically disadvantageous and, further, the productivity is inferior. When halides of alkaline earth metals such as BaCl<sub>2</sub> are used in place of the alkali metal halides, the particles can be made acicular to some extent, but this is not sufficient as compared with using of the alkali metal halides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the fired product is treated with water or an aqueous acid medium to remove soluble salts. As the acid, various acids can be used, such as inorganic acids or organic acids, and preferred are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The product treated to remove soluble salts is, if necessary, subjected to centrifugal settling treatment or various classifying means to remove the particles of insufficient acicularity and then subjected to usual filtration, washing, drying, finishing pulverization, etc. to obtain an acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles or an acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles containing antimony which have a mean diameter of 0.005-1 μm and a mean length of 0.05-10 μm and an aspect ratio of 3 or higher, and preferably a mean diameter of 0.005-0.05 μm and a mean length of 0.1-3 μm and an aspect ratio of 5 or higher, more preferably at least 70% of the total weight of the powder having a mean diameter of 0.003-1 μm and a mean length of 0.05-5 μm and an aspect ratio of 5 or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The acicular tin oxide particles as the substrate can be obtained by the above-mentioned process of the present invention, and deposition of hydrous antimony oxide on the acicular tin oxide can be carried out, for example, by dispersing the acicular tin oxide in a solvent such as water or an alcohol to prepare a suspension and adding thereto an aqueous or alcoholic solution of an antimony compound with stirring to carry out neutralization. The substrate particles desirably have a mean diameter of 0.005-1 μm, preferably 0.005-0.2 μm, a mean length of 0.05-10 μm, preferably 0.1-3 μm, and an aspect ratio of 3 or higher, preferably 5 or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As examples of the tin compounds used as the tin component in the present invention, mention may be made of tin halides such as tin chloride, tin oxide, tin hydroxide, inorganic acid salts of tin such as tin sulfate and tin nitrate (stannous salts and stannic salts), etc. These compounds may be used each alone or in admixture of two or more. Use of an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of tin chloride is industrially preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the silicon compounds used as the silicon components, there may be used various silane coupling agents, silicone oils, colloidal silica, etc. in addition to sodium silicate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of the silicon compound mixed with the tin compound is preferably 0.3-20%, more preferably 0.5-15% (in terms of SiO<sub>2</sub>) based on the weight of SnO<sub>2</sub>. If the amount is less than 0.3%, the acicularity cannot be obtained and even when it is added in an amount of more than 20%, the effect of addition does not increase and is economically not advantageous. Furthermore, the silicon compound is preferably added in a large amount to some extent in order to obtain a good acicularity, and, especially, when the antimony compound is added in a large amount within the above-mentioned rang for obtaining higher conductivity, it is preferred to add the silicon compound also in the larger amount within the above-mentioned range. However, if a large amount of the silicon compound remains in the final product, the electroconductivity is adversely affected, and, therefore, it is preferred to remove the unnecessary amount of the silicon compound by the treatment for removing soluble salts by immersing in hydrofluoric acid, etc. When the silicon compound remains in an amount of 0.1-10%, preferably 0.3-6% (in terms of SiO<sub>2</sub>) based on the weight of SnO<sub>2</sub> in the product after subjected to the treatment for removal of soluble salts, the electroconductivity of the product is excellent, and the dispersibility of the product in water is excellent, and aqueous dispersions suitable for various uses can easily be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the alkali of the aqueous alkali solution, mention may be made of, for example, hydroxides and carbonates of alkali metals such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and ammonia. These compounds may be used each alone or in admixture of two or more. The neutralization reaction can be carried out in water, hot water or an alcohol, and preferably carried out in hot water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the antimony compound as the antimony component, mention may be made of, for example, antimony halides such as antimony chloride, antimony oxide, antimony hydroxide, and inorganic acid salts such as antimony sulfate. These compounds may be used each alone or in admixture of two or more. An aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of antimony chloride is industrially preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the mixing ratio of the tin compound and the antimony compound, the amount of the antimony component in the starting material is 0.1-8%, preferably 0.3-5% (in terms of Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>) based on the weight of SnO<sub>2</sub>. It is desired that the resulting product contains antimony in an amount of 0.1/100-8/100, preferably 0.3/100-5/100 as Sb/Sn. If Sb/Sn&lt;0.1/100, the desired conductivity cannot be obtained, and if Sb/Sn&gt;8/100, the desired acicular fine particles having a small diameter and a high aspect ratio suitable for obtaining sufficient transparency cannot be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, when hydrous antimony oxide is deposited on the surface of acicular tin oxide particles as the substrate, the deposited amount is 0.1-20%, preferably 1-15% (in terms of Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>) based on the weight of SnO<sub>2</sub>. It is desired that the resulting product contains antimony in an amount of 0.1/100-20/100, preferably 1/100-15/100 in atomic ratio of Sb/Sn. If Sb/Sn&lt;0.1/100, the desired conductivity cannot be obtained, and if Sb/Sn&gt;20/100, the acicular fine powder having a sufficient conductivity cannot be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Deposition of the hydrous antimony oxide on the acicular tin oxide fine particles by neutralizing a solution of the antimony compound can be carried out by various processes, such as the following ones: 1) an aqueous solution of an antimony compound and an aqueous alkali solution are added in parallel to a tin oxide dispersed slurry to carry out neutralization, 2) an aqueous solution of an antimony compound is added to a tin oxide dispersed slurry and then an aqueous alkali solution is added to carry out neutralization, and 3) an aqueous solution of an antimony compound is added to a tin oxide dispersed slurry, followed by heating to boiling point to carry out hydrolysis. In the above processes 1)-2), addition to the tin oxide dispersed slurry may be carried out at room temperature, but when it is carried out under heating, for example, at 70°-90° C., hydrous antimony oxide can be deposited more uniformly and this is preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the alkali of the aqueous alkali solution used for neutralization of the solution of antimony compound, mention may be made of, for example, hydroxides and carbonates of alkali metals such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and ammonia. These compounds may be used each alone or in admixture of two or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, the resulting product having hydrous antimony oxide deposited thereon is filtrated, washed and recovered, and by sufficiently washing and removing the alkali metal component used as the neutralizing agent, electroconductivity can be more effectively developed by the action of the antimony component in the firing step referred to hereinafter. The recovered product is, if necessary, subjected to drying and pulverization, and then fired. The firing can be carried out at 700°-1000° C. If the firing temperature is lower than 700° C., electroconductivity is insufficient and if it is higher than 1000° C., the diameter of the fine particles is large and the original shape cannot be maintained. The firing time is suitably 30 minutes to 5 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles or the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles containing antimony according to the present invention are incorporated in plastics, rubbers, fibers, etc. as an electroconductivity-imparting agent or as a substrate to utilize them as electroconductive compositions such as electroconductive plastics, electroconductive paints, magnetic paints, electroconductive rubbers, and electroconductive fibers. In the case of electroconductive plastics, various plastics such as so-called general-purpose plastics and engineering plastics can be used. Examples of general-purpose plastics are a polyethylene, vinyl chloride resin, polystyrene, polypropylene, methacrylic resin, and urea•melamine resin. Examples of general-purpose plastics included in engineering plastics are a phenolic resin, unsaturated polyester resin, rigid vinyl chloride resin, ABS resin, and AS resin. Examples of engineering plastics are an epoxy resin, polyacetal, polycarbonate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate, polyphenylene ether, polyphenylene sulfide, polysulfone, and fluorocarbon resin. Examples of super-engineering plastics are a diallyl phthalate resin, silicone resin, polyimide resin, polyamideimide, bismaleimidetriazine, polyaminobismaleimide, olefin-vinyl alcohol copolymer, polyoxybenzylene, polymethylpentene, polyether sulfone, polyether imide, polyarylate, and polyether ketone. The amount of the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles added to the above molding resins is 3-200 parts by weight, preferably 10-100 parts by weight for 100 parts by weight of the resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles or the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles containing antimony according to the present invention is utilized as electroconductive paints or magnetic paints, it is incorporated in various binders, such as a polyvinyl alcohol resin, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate resin, acrylic resin, epoxy resin, urethane resin, alkyd resin, polyester resin, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, acryl-styrene copolymer, cellulosic resin, phenolic resin, amino resin, fluorocarbon resin, silicone resin and petroleum resin, and natural resins such as shellac, rosin derivative and rubber derivative, and the resulting mixture is dispersed in water or solvents. The amount of the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles added to the binder resin is 3-200 parts by weight, preferably 10-100 parts by weight for 100 parts by weight of solid matter of the binder. In the case of electroconductive paints, the paint is coated on an insulating substrate such as a paper or polymer film to form an electroconductive coat which is light in weight and excellent in transparency, surface smoothness and adhesion, and, thus, various antistatic films, static recording papers, electrophotographic copying papers, etc. are obtained. When the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles are applied to an aqueous paint, it is preferred to prepare an aqueous dispersion by dispersing the tin oxide fine particles or a cake obtained by removing soluble salts from the tin oxide fine particles in the production step of the tin oxide fine particles in an aqueous medium and to use the resulting aqueous dispersion as a paint for saving the dispersing energy needed in preparation of paint, and dehydration and drying energy needed at the step of producing the tin oxide fine particles. The solid concentration of the aqueous dispersion is 1-70% by weight, preferably 10-50% by weight, and the pH value of the aqueous dispersion is 4-12, preferably 5-10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the tin oxide fine particles are applied to the paints used for preparation of magnetic recording mediums, they are useful for improvement of adhesion between a non-magnetic support and a magnetic layer, prevention of static charging of the magnetic recording mediums, enhancement of a film strength, thinning of the magnetic layer, improvement of dispersibility of a lower non-magnetic layer for surface smoothening and improvement of surface smoothness. Especially, recently, there are marked tendencies for magnetic recording to increase a recording density and, further, to shorten a recording wavelength. For this purpose, it is more strongly demanded to the thin the magnetic layer of the magnetic recording media. However, when the magnetic layer is thinned, the influence of the support is apt to appear on the surface of the magnetic layer and electromagnetic conversion characteristics are unavoidably deteriorated. Therefore, a non-magnetic undercoat layer is provided on the surface of the non-magnetic support, and the magnetic layer is provided thereon as an upper layer, whereby the influence of the surface roughness of the support is dissolved and, further, the magnetic layer is thinned to increase an output. The proportion of the acicular electroconductive tin oxide fine particles of the present invention incorporated in the lower non-magnetic layer is about 20-80% by volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of electroconductive rubbers, the tin oxide fine powder is incorporated in the conventionally known rubbers such as silicone rubber, isoprene rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, butadiene rubber, butyl rubber, butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber, ethylene-propylene-diethane polymer, ethylene-propylene rubber, fluororubber, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, chlorinated polyethylene, acrylic rubber, chloroprene rubber, urethane rubber, polysulfide rubber, chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber, and epichlorohydrin rubber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of utilizing as electroconductive fibers, the tin oxide fine particles are incorporated in spinnable fibers of polyamide resin, polyester resin, polyolefin resin, polyvinyl resin, polyether resin, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thus obtained electroconductive compositions can give a high conductivity with addition in a smaller amount to the resin binder than the conventional electroconductive compositions comprising spherical electroconductive particles, and, furthermore, are superior in transparency and economically advantageous. Since the amount of the acicular tin oxide fine particles of the present invention can be smaller, the particles can be utilized without causing reduction in the strength of the binder. Furthermore, in the case of an electroconductive paint of high concentration, the desired conductivity can be obtained even with a thin coat. Especially, when the acicular tin oxide fine particles containing antimony obtained by depositing hydrous antimony oxide on the acicular tin oxide particles is used, the products are unexpectedly diminished in a bluish color tone with an excellent conductivity and transparency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention will be illustrated by the following examples.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading>

<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention provides acicular electroconductive fine particles or an acicular electroconductive fine particles containing antimony which can give the same conductivity with addition in a smaller amount as conventional electroconductive fine particles and a process for producing the fine particles without using special apparatuses and expensive starting materials. Furthermore, the acicular electroconductive fine particles of the present invention which contains antimony are markedly lower in powder resistance than potassium titanate fibers coated with a conductive layer comprising tin oxide and antimony oxide. In addition, resin compositions or binders containing the fine particles of the present invention have a very excellent conductivity and excellent transparency. Especially, the finer particles of 0.005-0.05 μm in diameter are excellent in transparency. Moreover, the acicular electroconductive fine particles containing antimony which are obtained by depositing hydrous antimony oxide on the acicular tin oxide particles has little bluish tone and a high lightness and excellent transparency and conductivity.</div>
