<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a toner for developing electrostatic images in image forming methods, such as electrophotography and electrostatic printing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Hitherto, a large number of electro-photographic processes have been known, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,297,691; 3,666.,363; 4,071,361 and others. In these processes, an electrostatic latent image is formed on a photosensitive member comprising a photoconductive material by various means, then the latent image is developed and visualized with a toner, and the resultant toner image is, after transferred onto a transfer(-receiving) material such as paper etc., as desired, fixed by heating, pressing, or heating and pressing, or with solvent vapor to obtain a toner image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accompanying development of digital copying machines and reduction in size of toner particles in recent years, it has been desired to develop copying machines having multiplicity of functions, capable of providing high-quality copy images, and having a shorter first copy time through an improvement in a fixing system in view of energy saving as measures against environmental problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, the development of a toner of a smaller particle size for improving resolution and clarity of images and reduction of a first copy time results in new problems accompanying it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">More specifically, a smaller toner particle size leads to an increase in surface area of toner particles per unit weight, whereby the toner chargeability is more liable to be affected by the environment. Particularly, in case where such toner particles are left standing in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment for a long period, the toner particles are susceptible to moisture, thus being liable to result in a lowering in image density after the standing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A recent digital copying machine is even required to provide a combination of a character image which is clear and a photographic image which faithfully reproduces the density gradation of the original. As a general tendency in a copy of a photographic image with characters, an increase in line image density for providing clearer characters not only impairs the density gradation characteristic of the photographic image but results in remarkable roughness in the halftone portion. On the other hand, in the case of improving the density gradation characteristic of the photographic image the line density of the character image is lowered and the clarity of the character image is impaired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In recent years, it has become possible to provide an image with improved density gradation to some extent by reading the image density at respective portions of an image and digitally converting the read density data, but a further improvement is desired at present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Such further improvements largely depend on improvements in developing characteristics of a developer. Image densities do not usually satisfy a linear relationship with developing potentials (differences between potentials of a photosensitive member and a developer-carrying member) but show a tendency of projecting downwardly at low developing potentials and projecting upwardly at higher developing potentials as indicated by a solid curve in FIG. 3. Accordingly, in a halftone region, the image density varies greatly corresponding to a slight change in developing potential. As a result, it is difficult to provide a good density gradation characteristic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to obtain a clear copy of a line image, it is practically sufficient to have a maximum density on the order of 1.30 at a solid image part not readily affected by an edge effect as the contrast of a line image is generally enhanced by the edge effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a photographic image, however, an original image per se has a very large maximum density of 1.90-2.00 while the impression thereof is largely affected by a surface gloss. Accordingly, in a copy of such a photographic image having a generally large area and not causing a density increase owing to the edge effect, it is necessary to retain a maximum image density of about 1.4-1.5 at a solid image part even if the surface gloss is suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, in copying a photographic image with characters, it is very important to satisfy a linear relationship between the developing potential and the image density and retain a maximum image density of 1.4-1.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For the above purpose, it is critical to control the toner chargeability as uniformly as possible. Further, it is also particularly critical to prevent possible lowerings in toner chargeability and toner flowability in a high-temperature/high-humidity environment in view of structural demands for the copying machine at present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As methods of stabilizing the toner charge, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A) 58-66951, JP-A 59-168458 to JP-A 59-168460 and JP-A 59-170847 have proposed the use of electroconductive zinc oxide and tin oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">JP-A 60-32060 has proposed a method wherein two kinds of inorganic fine powder are used to remove paper dust and ozone adduct formed on or attached to the surface of a photosensitive member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">JP-A 2-110475 has proposed a method wherein two kinds of inorganic fine powder are used in combination with a toner comprising styrene-acrylic resin crosslinked with a metal to remove paper dust and ozone adduct formed on or attached to the surface of a photosensitive member, and alleviate toner scattering, image flow and image density decrease in a high temperature--high humidity environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">JP-A 61-236559 and JP-A 63-2073 have disclosed methods wherein cerium oxide particles are used to improve the toner chargeability. According to this method, the toner chargeability can be surely increased but, when an organic photosensitive member is used, the surface layer of the photosensitive member can be gradually abraded due to an abrasive effect of the cerium oxide, thus resulting in inferior copy images.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, accompanying the development of a smaller particle size toner, a toner capable of being uniformly charged and retaining its chargeability even if the toner is left standing for a long time in a high temperature--high humidity environment is still desired.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">There is generally a charge distribution with respect to the toner chargeability. The charge distribution of a one-component type developer is affected by the dispersion state of materials (e.g., a magnetic material, a colorant, etc.) constituting the toner and the toner particle size distribution. In case where the toner-constituting materials are uniformly dispersed in respective toner particles, the charge distribution is principally affected by the toner particle size distribution. A small-particle size toner generally has a large charge, and a large particle size toner generally has a small charge. A toner having a larger charge generally has a broader charge distribution, and vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to stabilize the toner chargeability, there is known a method of attaching electroconductive powder to the toner to lower the charge as described above. According to this method, however, a sufficiently high maximum image density is not obtained and a deterioration in image quality in successive copying cannot be satisfactorily suppressed. We have considered the reason as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the method of attaching electroconductive powder to a toner to lower the charge, electroconductive powder is preferentially attached to smaller particle size (per unit weight) toner (i.e., a toner having a large chargeability) according to electrostatic force, whereby white background fog can be alleviated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, small toner particles (to which electroconductive powder having a large effect of lowering the toner charge is attached) are preferentially consumed for development. In case where such a small particle size toner is fixed, the small toner particles can cover only a smaller area of a fixation-supporting material, such as transfer paper, than larger toner particles so that the maximum image density obtained thereby is lower than that obtained by larger toner particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, small toner particles are preferentially consumed for development, so that the image quality is good at the initial stage but becomes inferior, as represented by roughening, in successive copying due to the increase in toner particle size in the developer container.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Contrary with reduction of the charge of the toner as in the above method, a method of triboelectrically charging a toner fraction by contact of the toner with a metal oxide within a developer container can surely allow increase and uniformization in toner chargeability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, it becomes difficult to quickly charge the toner so as to have a prescribed charge within the developer container in a shorter waiting time by using this method in the case of a shorter first copy time required for an apparatus body of the copying machine. Particularly, this is not satisfactory in a high temperature--high humidity environment. This may be attributable to a lowering in flowability of a toner accompanying a small particle size toner, particularly lowerings in flowability and chargeability in a high temperature--high humidity environment due to moisture absorption (hygroscopicity) of the toner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a conventional copying machine, a hot fixation roller is employed as a fixation system, so that it is possible to impart a toner to a flowability and chargeability to some extent by stirring and mixing the toner within a developer container in a time up to a start of first copying operation, i.e., a time (heat-up time) from connection of power to the copying machine until the fixation roller is warmed up to a prescribed fixation temperature. However, in recent years, an improvement in a fixation system is advanced whereby a heat-up time is reduced and becomes zero with respect to a so-called surf fixation system (or film fixation system).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In such a surf fixation system, the above-described stirring (and mixing) of the toner cannot be performed satisfactorily, thus failing to impart the toner to a flowability and chargeability. As a result, resultant copy images are liable to have a lower image density and be accompanied with fogs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">JP-A 5-333590 filed by our research group has proposed a toner containing metal oxide powder. Metal oxide powder having a substantial particle size relative to a certain particle size of toner frequently repeats attachment to the toner and separation from the toner due to a shearing force within the developer container, thus reversely increasing the charge of a rather large toner fraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, the metal oxide powder is liable to lower a toner flowability. Accordingly, as described above, particularly in the case of using the surf fixation system, fully satisfactory copy images are not readily obtained in a high temperature--high humidity environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this respect, we have directed our attention to the following points (a) and (b).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) A flowability-improving agent (flowability improver) not only attains an improvement in flowability of a toner but also improves developing performances. This is presumably because a generally known flowability improver (e.g., fluorinated compound, SiO<sub>2</sub>, surface-treated SiO<sub>2</sub>, etc.) has a polarity, so that the flowability improver affects charging characteristics of the toner. From a viewpoint of image density, a large addition amount is generally advantageous to the flowability improver. However, if an excessive amount of the flowability improver is used, a state of the flowability improver attached to the toner particle surface is liable to be changed and accordingly, it is difficult to retain uniform triboelectrification among the toner particles, thus being liable to result in an occurrence of fogs. For this reason, by only effecting an increase in addition amount of the flowability improver, the above-mentioned requirements for the toner cannot be met satisfactorily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) It is possible to improve a flowability of double oxide particles per se by blending double oxide particles with a flowability improver in advance of blending with toner particles. In addition by using the double oxide particles, a lowering in flowability of a toner in a high temperature--high humidity environment can be prevented. However, in this case, the double oxide particles are lowered in its charge-imparting ability, per se, as an original function, resulting from triboelectric charging with the toner particle, so that difficulties such a lowering in image density and an occurrence of fogs are liable to arise. This is presumably because charge transfer occurs between the flowability improver and the double oxide particles in addition to triboelectric charging originally effected between the toner particles and the double oxide particles, so that a charge of the entire toner is reduced compared with the case of not adding the double oxide particles. Consequently, the toner is liable to be lowered in developing performances, image density and cause fogs. For this reason, the above-mentioned requirements for the toner cannot be satisfactorily met by only adding the flowability improver to the double oxide particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, based on a concept that triboelectric charging of toner particles with double oxide particles provides a larger charge without impairing a toner flowability, we have investigated various double oxide particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a result, we have found that it is possible to improve a flowability of a toner and provide the toner with a large triboelectric charge by using double oxide particles containing silicon (Si) in a triboelectric charging between toner particles and the double oxide particles within a developer container, thus attaining a high image density even in a severe high temperature--high humidity environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By incorporating Si element in double oxide particles, a resultant toner has a flowability better than that in the case of incorporating another element since Si element is considered to be excellent in flowability in view of the fact that silica is generally used as a flowability improver. Further, certain Si-containing double oxide particles exhibits a high charge-imparting ability in triboelectric charging with toner particles thus increasing a charge (chargeability) of a resultant toner. For this reason, the Si-containing double oxide particles can provide the toner particles with a charge sufficient to provide a satisfactory developing characteristic even in the case of less contact with the toner particles while suppressing a lowering in toner flowability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, we have found that, in order to provide a sufficient developing characteristic even in a high temperature--high humidity environment, particularly to provide a high image density after being left standing in such an environment, it is important to use particles comprising a double oxide (A), represented by the formula (1) shown below, capable of preventing a lowering in toner flowability resulting from moisture absorption thereof and exhibiting a large charge-imparting ability in the triboelectric charging.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">In this connection, referring to FIG. 3, the alternate long and short dash line represents a relationship between developing potential and copy image density obtained by using a toner containing the particles comprising the double oxide (A) of the above formula (1) according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above formula (1), a may preferably be 1-3, b may preferably be 1 or 2, and c may preferably be 3-7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, from a viewpoint of stoichiometry, a, b and c in the formula (1) satisfy the following relationship of na+4b=2c wherein n represents a valence of the metallic element (M).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, the double oxide (A) of the above formula (1) may preferably comprise strontium silicate (Sr<sub>a</sub> Si<sub>b</sub> O<sub>c</sub>) since it can more effectively bring about the above-described advantageous effects. Specific examples of strontium silicate may include SrSiO<sub>3</sub>, Sr<sub>3</sub> SiO<sub>5</sub>, Sr<sub>2</sub> SiO<sub>4</sub>, SrSi<sub>2</sub> O<sub>5</sub> and Sr<sub>3</sub> Si<sub>2</sub> O<sub>7</sub>. Among these, SrSiO<sub>3</sub> may preferably be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">From a similar viewpoint, a ratio between the metallic element (M) and Si (i.e., a/b) in the formula (1) may preferably be 1/9-9.0, more preferably 0.5-3.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The particles comprising the double oxide (A) used in the present invention may preferably be produced by sintering (process), followed by mechanical pulverization and pneumatic classification to adjust so as to have a desired particle size distribution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The resultant particles comprising the double oxide (A) may include those comprising at least one species of the double oxide (A) represented by the above formula (1). In case where the particles comprises two or more species of the double oxide (A) are used, such particles comprising two or more species of the double oxide (A) may preferably be produced at the same time by sintering but may be prepared by simply mixing them each obtained by sintering separately with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The particles comprising the double oxide (A) may preferably be used (externally added) in an amount of 0.05-15 wt. parts, more preferably 0.1-5.0 wt. parts, per 100 wt. parts of toner particles, and may preferably have a weight-average particle size (D<sub>4</sub>) of 0.5-5 μm, which may desirably be smaller than that of the toner particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the particles comprising the above-described double oxide (A) of the formula (1) further comprises a double oxide (B) represented by the following formula (2):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">
</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">M.sup.2.sub.d Ti.sub.e O.sub.f                             (2),</pre>

<div class="description-paragraph">The toner according to the present invention is effective in providing a high image density while suppressing an image flow (image dropout) or a lowering in image quality during successive image formation through removal of matter attached to and remaining on the surface of a photosensitive drum even in a severe high temperature--high humidity environment by using the double oxide (B) containing Ti element for achieving an abrasive effect in combination with the double oxide (A) containing Si element for improving a toner flowability and a triboelectric charge characteristic. Thus, the abrasive effect and flowability of the toner can be improved by using the double oxide (A) containing Si element and the double oxide (B) containing Ti element in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the double oxide (A) containing Si element has a small abrasive effect, a resultant toner has little effect with respect to removal of matter attached to a photosensitive drum of a (drum) heaterless system. Such an abrasive effect is compensated or supplemented by using the double oxide (B) containing Ti element, so that we have found that a resultant toner is capable of meeting recent demands for a drum heaterless system as a mode of a copying machine and a reduction of first copy time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, in the present invention, it is preferred to use the double oxide (B) not only having a sufficient abrasive effect without being adversely affected by growing matter attached to the photosensitive drum even in a copying machine system free from a drum heater therein and in a high temperature--high humidity environment but also not marring the drum surface and to use the double oxide (A) capable of preventing a lowering in toner flowability resulting from e.g., moisture absorption for providing a sufficient developing characteristic, particularly a high image density, and capable of exhibiting a high charge-imparting ability at the same time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The double oxide (B) of the formula (2) described above may preferably comprise strontium titanate (particularly SrTiO<sub>3</sub>) in order to effectively bring about the above-described effects.

<div class="description-paragraph">The particles comprising the double oxide (A) and the double oxide (B) used in the present invention may preferably be produced by sintering (process), followed by mechanical pulverization and penumatic classification to adjust so as to have a desired particle size distribution. In the sintering process the double oxides (A) and (B) may preferably be produced at the same time. Further, the particles comprising the double oxides (A) and (B) may be prepared by mixing particles of the double oxide (A) produced by sintering with those of the double oxide (B) produced by sintering separately from the double oxide (A), followed by pulverization and classification in the same manner as in the above case.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The particles comprising the double oxide (A) and the double oxide (B) may preferably be used (externally added) in an amount of 0.05-15 wt. parts, more preferably 0.1-5.0 wt. parts., per 100 wt. parts of toner particles, and may preferably have a weight-average particle size (D<sub>4</sub>) of 0.5-5 μm, which may desirably be smaller than that of the toner particles.</div>

The vinyl copolymer obtained by the bulk polymerization or suspension polymerization may be further converted into anhydride units by heat-treating it. It is also possible to esterify a part of the acid anhydride unit with a compound, such as an alcohol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Reversely, it is also possible to cause ring-opening of the acid anhydride units of the thus obtained vinyl copolymer to convert a part thereof into dicarboxylic units.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, it is also possible to convert a vinyl copolymer obtained by using a dicarboxylic monoester monomer into anhydride by heat-treatment or into dicarboxylic acid by hydrolyzation. The vinyl copolymer obtained through bulk polymerization or solution polymerization may be further dissolved in a polymerizable monomer, followed by suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization to obtain a vinyl polymer or copolymer, during which a part of the acid anhydride units can be subjected to ring-opening to be converted into dicarboxylic acid units. At the time of the polymerization, another resin can be mixed in the polymerizable monomer. The resultant resin can be subjected to conversion into acid anhydride by heat treatment, ring-opening of acid anhydride by treatment with a weak alkaline water, or esterification with an alcohol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Dicarboxylic acid and dicarboxylic anhydride monomers have a strong tendency of alternate polymerization, a vinyl copolymer containing functional groups, such as acid anhydride and dicarboxylic acid units in a random dispersed state may be produced in the following manner as a preferable method. A vinyl copolymer is formed from a dicarboxylic monoester monomer in solution polymerization, and the vinyl copolymer is dissolved in a monomer, followed by suspension polymerization to obtain a binder resin. In this process, all or a part of the dicarboxylic monoester units can be converted into anhydride units through de-alcoholic cyclization by controlling the condition for solvent removal after the solution polymerization. During the suspension polymerization, a part of the acid anhydride units may be hydrolyzed to cause ring-opening, thus providing dicarboxylic acid units.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The conversion into acid anhydride units in a polymer can be confirmed as a shift of infrared absorption of carbonyl toward a higher wave-number side than in the corresponding acid or ester. Thus, the formation or extinction of acid anhydride units may be conveniently confirmed by FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thus-obtained binder resin contains carboxyl group, acid anhydride group and dicarboxyl group uniformly dispersed therein, thus being able to provide a toner with satisfactory chargeability.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Various physical parameters referred to herein may be measured or determined according to the following methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) X-ray diffraction pattern</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The X-ray diffraction pattern of particles comprising a double oxide may be obtained by using the following apparatus:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">X-ray diffraction apparatus CN2013(available from Riaaku Denki K. K.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Molding machine ("PX-700", available from Sarmonics K. K.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A powdery sample is prevented by compression-pressing particles comparison a double oxide by means of the above molding machine. The molded sample is set in the above X-ray diffraction apparatus and subjected to measurement of X-ray intensity under the following conditions:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Target, Filter: Cu, Ti</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Voltage, Current: 32.5 KV, 15 mA</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Counter: Sc</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Time Constant: 1 sec.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Scatter Slit: 1 deg.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Angle Range: 60-20 deg.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">From the thus-obtained peak intensities and corresponding Bragg angles (2θ), the structure of the sample can be identified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Double oxide content (within toner Particles)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The double oxide content in toner particles may be determined by using a calibration curve and the following apparatus:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Fluorescent X-ray spectrometer 3080 (available from Rigaku Denki K. K.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Press Molding machine ("MAEKAWA Testing Machine", available from MFG Co., Ltd.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(i) Preparation of calibration curve</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Prescribed toner particles are blended with prescribed proportions (shown below) of double oxide particles in a coffee mill to prepare seven powdery samples for a calibration curve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">0 wt. %, 0.5 wt., %, 1.0 wt. %, 2.0 wt. %, 3.0 wt. %, 5.0 wt. %, 10.0 wt. %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thus-prepared 7 samples are press-molded by using the above press molding machine, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Based on 2θ table, a Kα peak angle (a) of a metallic element  M! within the double oxide particles is determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The respective samples for the calibration curve is set in a sample chamber of the above fluorescent X-ray spectrometer and the sample chamber is reduced in pressure to provide a vacuum state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The calibration curve is prepared by obtaining X-ray intensities of the respective samples under the following conditions:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Measurement voltage (potential) and current: 50 kV, 50 mA</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2θ angle (bragg angle): a</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Crystal plate: LiF</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Measurement time: 60 sec.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(ii) Quantification of double oxide within toner particles</div>

From the measured X-ray intensity, the double oxide content is determined by using the above-prepared calibration curve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) Particle size distribution</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The particle size distribution of a powdery sample is measured by means of a Coulter counter in the present invention, while it may be measured in various manners.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Coulter counter Multisizer Type-II (available from Coulter Electronics Inc.) is used as an instrument for measurement, to which an interface (available from Nikkaki K. K.) for providing a number-basis distribution, and a volume-basis distribution and a personal computer CX-1 (available from Canon K. K.) are connected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For measurement, a 1%-NaCl aqueous solution as an electrolytic solution is prepared by using a reagent-grade sodium chloride. Into 100 to 150 ml of the electrolytic solution, 0.1 to 5 ml of a surfactant, preferably an alkylbenzenesulfonic acid salt, is added as a dispersant, and 2 to 20 mg of a sample is added thereto. The resultant dispersion of the sample in the electrolytic liquid is subjected to a dispersion treatment for about 1-3minutes by means of an ultrasonic disperser, and then subjected to measurement of particle size distribution by using the above-mentioned Coulter counter Multisizer Type-II with a 100 μm-aperture for a toner sample or a 13 μm-aperture for an inorganic fine powder sample to obtain a volume-basis distribution and a number-basis distribution. From the results of the volume-basis distribution and number-basis distribution, parameters characterizing the toner or inorganic fine powder of the present invention may be obtained. More specifically, the weight-basis average particle size (D<sub>4</sub>) may be obtained from the volume-basis distribution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) Acid value of vinyl-type resin</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Qualitative and quantitative analysis of functional groups may be performed, for example, by application of infrared absorption spectrum, acid value measurement according to JIS K-0070 and acid value measurement by hydrolysis (total acid value measurement).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, in the infrared (IR) absorption, the presence of an acid anhydride fraction can be confirmed by an absorption peak in the neighborhood of 1780 cm<sup>-1</sup> attributable to the carbonyl group in the acid anhydride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Herein, the IR-absorption spectrum peak refers to a peak which is recognizable after 16 times of integration by FT-IR having a resolution of 4 cm<sup>-1</sup>. A commercially available example of the FT-IR apparatus is "FT-IR 1600" (available from Perkin-Elmer Corp.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The measurement of acid value according to JIS K-0070 (hereinafter referred to as "JIS acid value") provides an acid value of an acid anhydride which is about 50% of the theoretical value (based on an assumption that a mol of an acid anhydride provides an acid value identical to the corresponding dicarboxylic acid).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, the total acid value (A) measurement provides an acid value which is almost identical to the theoretical value. Accordingly, the acid value attributable to an acid anhydride group per g of a resin can be obtained in the following manner:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">
</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">total acid value (B)= total acid value (A)-JIS acid value!×2.</pre>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, in the case of preparing a vinyl-type copolymer composition used as a binder resin by using maleic acid monoester as an acid component through solution polymerization and suspension polymerization, the total acid value (B) of a vinyl-type copolymer formed in the solution polymerization can be calculated by measuring the JIS acid value and the total acid value (A) of the vinyl copolymer, and the amount (e.g., in terms of mol. %) of the acid anhydride formed during the polymerization step and the solvent removal step can be calculated from the total acid value and the vinyl monomer composition used in the solution polymerization. Further, the vinyl copolymer prepared in the solution polymerization is dissolved in monomers, such as styrene and butyl acrylate to prepare a monomer composition, which is then subjected to suspension polymerization. In this instance, a part of the acid anhydride groups causes ring-opening. The contents of dicarboxylic acid group, acid anhydride group and dicarboxylic acid monoester group of the vinyl copolymer composition after the suspension polymerization used as the binder resin can be calculated from the JIS acid value, total acid value (A) of the vinyl copolymer composition obtained by the suspension polymerization, the monomer composition for the suspension polymerization and amount of the vinyl copolymer prepared in the solution polymerization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The total acid value (A) of a binder resin used herein is measured in the following manner. A sample resin in an amount of 2 g is dissolved in 30 ml of dioxane, and 10 ml of pyridine, 20 mg of dimethylaminopyridine and 3.5 ml of water are added thereto, followed by 4 hours of heat refluxing. After cooling, the resultant solution is titrated with 1/10 N-KOH solution in THF (tetrahydrofuran) to neutrality with phenolphthalein as the indicator to measure the acid value, which is a total acid value (A). Under the condition for the measurement of the total acid value (A), an acid anhydride group is hydrolyzed into dicarboxylic acid groups, but an acrylic ester group, a methacrylic ester group or a dicarboxylic monoester group is not hydrolyzed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above-mentioned 1/10 N-KOH solution in THF is prepared as follows. First, 1.5 g of KOH is dissolved in about 3 ml of water, and 200 ml of THF and 30 ml of water are added thereto, followed by stirring. After standing, a uniform clear solution is formed, if necessary, by adding a small amount of methanol if the solution is separated or by adding a small amount of water if the solution is turbid. Then, the factor of the 1/10 N-KOH/THF solution thus obtained is standardized by a 1/10 N-HCl standard solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The binder resin may have a total acid value (A) of 2-100 mgKOH/g, but it is preferred that the vinyl copolymer containing an acid component in the binder resin has a JIS acid value of below 100. If the JIS acid value is 100 or higher, the functional group such as carboxyl group and acid anhydride group are contained at a high density, so that it becomes difficult to obtain a good balance of chargeability and the dispersibility thereof is liable to be problematic even when it is used in a diluted form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(5) Acid value of polyester resin</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2-10 g of a sample resin is weighed in a 200 to 300 ml-Erlenmeyer flask, and about 50 ml of a methanol/toluene (=30/70) mixture solvent is added thereto to dissolve the resin. In case of poor solubility, a small amount of acetone may be added. The solution is titrated with an N/10 KOH/alcohol solution standardized in advance with the use of a 0.1% indicator mixture of bromothymol blue and phenolphthalein. The acid value is calculated from the consumption of the KOH/alcohol solution based on the following equation:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">
</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">Acid value=vol. (ml) of KOH/alcohol×N15×56.1/sample weight,</pre>
<div class="description-paragraph">wherein N denotes the factor of the N/10 KOH/alcohol solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(6) Glass transition temperature Tg</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Measurement of Tg of the binder resin may be performed in the following manner by using a differential scanning calorimeter (e.g., "DSC-7", available from Perkin-Elmer Corp.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A sample in an amount of 5-20 mg, preferably about 10 mg, is accurately weighed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The sample is placed on an aluminum pan and subjected to measurement in a temperature range of 30°-200° C. at a temperature-raising rate of 10° C./min in a normal temperature--normal humidity environment in parallel with a black aluminum pan as a reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the course of temperature increase, a main absorption peak appears in the temperature region of 40°-100° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this instance, the glass transition temperature is determined as a temperature of an intersection between a DSC curve and an intermediate line pressing between the base lines obtained before and after the appearance of the absorption peak.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described more specifically based on Production Examples and Example.</div>

Thereafter, the magnetic toner (X-9) was subjected to image formation of 1000 sheets by using a digital copier ("GP-55", mfd. by Canon) remodeled to employ a drum heaterless system and replace a hot fixation roller with a surf fixation sheet, and then was subjected to measurement of image density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the developer container was detached from the digital copier and was left standing overnight (for 12 hours) in a high temperature--high humidity room (30° C., 80%). Immediately after the developer container was returned to the normal temperature--normal humidity room, the magnetic toner (X-9) was subjected to image formation of 20 sheets, followed by measurement of image density with respect to the first sheet in a similar manner. Evaluation was performed based on a difference in image density between the 1000-th sheet (the last sheet of the previous day) and the first sheet (after being left standing overnight) according to the following valuation levels (ranks) A-F. The smaller density difference provided a better performance.</div>
