<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to an image formation method by using silver halide photographic materials and, more particularly, to a method capable of ensuring a high photographic speed, a low fog density and rapid processing suitability in the image formation under short-duration exposure with high illumination intensity.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">An image formation method of utilizing the so-called scanner system as an exposure system for silver halide photographic materials is known. Therein, a photographic material undergoes the exposure based on image signals obtained by scanning an original, and therethrough forms therein a negative or positive image corresponding to the original image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Various recording apparatuses in which the image formation methods of utilizing the scanner system are embodied are used. Therein, the so-called dot generator system prevails at present. Such a scanner-utilized recording apparatus uses as the light source for recording a glow lamp, a xenon lamp, a mercury lamp, a tungsten lamp, a light emitting diode and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">All the light sources cited above, however, are inferior in practicality because they have weak power and short life. In order to remove these drawbacks of the above-cited light sources, coherent laser beams, such as beams emitted from He-Ne, argon, and semiconductor laser devices, are used as the light source of a scanner system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Various characteristics are required for photosensitive materials to which a scanner system using coherent laser beams is applicable. Since the exposure time of such a scanner system is particularly short, that is, in the range of 10<sup>-3</sup> to 10<sup>-8</sup> second, it becomes essential for the photosensitive materials to ensure high photographic speed and high contrast even under such a short exposure. In addition, highly sensitive photosensitive materials are of greater advantage when the output is reduced for lengthening the life of a laser tube. For obtaining satisfactory halftone dots, on the other hand, it becomes necessary to properly adjust the shape of a laser beam with a slit or the like. The shape adjustment causes a reduction of the laser output, and in order to cope therewith a photosensitive material having high sensitivity is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Moreover, recent graphic arts industry has been strongly desirous of an improvement in working efficiency, or speeding-up of working. Accordingly, the speeding-up of scanning and for reduction in processing time of a photosensitive material is comprehensively needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to meet the needs of graphic arts, it is desirable that the exposure device (scanner, plotter) be designed such that the scanning may be speeded up and high image quality may be achieved by increasing the number of scanning lines and by narrowing down the beam emitted therefrom. As for the silver halide photographic materials, on the other hand, it is desirable that they have high sensitivity and processing stability and can be developed rapidly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Besides the photosensitive materials for scanner system, photosensitive materials for photograph-taking use are also required to form therein satisfactory halftone dot images and line original images. Therefore, it is desirable for these materials also to have high sensitivity, excellent processing stability and rapid development suitability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For desirable reproduction of continuous tone images with halftone dots or that of line original images in the field of graphic arts, there is the need of an image-forming system which can provide photographic properties including ultra-high contrast (especially a gamma value (γ) of at least 10).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a method of achieving high contrast which is one of photographic characteristics, a lithographic development system making use of the so-called "infectious development effect" has been employed from old times. However, such a system has a defect that the developers usable therein are difficult to handle because of their instability. Therefore, development of another image formation system capable of providing the photographic characteristic of being ultra-high contrast through development with a sufficiently stable processing solution has been needed. Methods of embodying such a system are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,166,742, 4,168,977, 4,221,857, 4,224,401, 4,243,739, 4,269,922, 4,272,606, 4,311,781, 4,332,878, 4,618,574, 4,634,661, 4,681,836, 5,650,746. Therein, a silver halide photographic material of the kind which forms a latent images predominantly at the surface of the grains, and to which a hydrazine derivative is added, is developed with a stable MQ or PQ developer adjusted to pH 11.0-12.3, and thereby is produced a very high contrasty negative image having a gamma value greater than 10. According to those methods, the photographic characteristic of being ultra-high contrast and high sensitivity can be achieved, and the stability of the developer to aerial oxidation can be made higher by far than those of conventional lithographic developers since a sulfite can be added thereto in a high concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, conventional development systems use dihydroxybenzenes as developing agent, and therefore have some disadvantages from viewpoints of ecology and toxicology. For instance, hydroquinone is an undesirable agent because of its allergenic effect, and 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidones are hard to undergo biological decomposition. In addition, sulfites added in a high concentration cause high COD (chemical oxygen demand).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, enediols such as ascorbic acid are known to function as a developing agent, and deserve notice as the developing agent free from ecological and toxicological problems. For instance, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,668,549 and 3,826,654 disclose that those compounds enable the image formation under a high alkaline condition such that the pH is higher than at least 12. In the image formation method of this type, however, the developability is rather low and the development proceeds slowly as compared with the method of using a dihydroxybenzene developing agent. That is, the image formation method of using enediols as developing agent has the problem of lack of rapid processing suitability. The term rapid processing as used herein refers to the processing in which it takes 15 to 60 seconds for the top end of a photosensitive material to travel from the insertion slit of an automatic developing machine to the exit of the drying part of the machine via the developing tank, the fixing tank, the washing tank and the drying part in succession.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although raising the silver chloride contents in silver halide emulsions used in a photosensitive material is already known to be effective for speeding the progress of development, that is to say, for conferring rapid processing suitability on the photosensitive material, it causes the lowering of sensitivity and the aggravation of unevenness due to physical development. Further, it tends to cause a rise in fog density.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an image formation method by using a silver halide photographic material wherein high photographic speed is ensured to the photographic material and reduced fog and no unevenness caused by physical development are ensured to the image formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object of the present invention is to provide a development-processing method wherein a silver halide photographic material for high illuminance and short duration exposure can provide satisfactory image quality with a high photographic speed even when it undergoes rapid processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A further object of the present invention is to provide a new image formation method which uses a developer harmless to an ecosystem and work environment and ensures high photographic speed and sufficiently high image quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a new image formation method wherein high contrasty images can be obtained using a developer harmless to an ecosystem and work environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present inventor has found that chemical sensitization with at least one of a selenium compound and a tellurium compound can resolve the problems and can confer high photographic speed and rapid processing suitability on the photosensitive material. When a developer containing a dihydroxybenzene compound as developing agent was used, however, it has turned out that the chemical sensitization described above caused an increase in fog and a decrease in gradation to impair the image quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These and other objects have been achieved by an image formation method, which comprises the steps of imagewise exposing a silver halide photographic material comprising a support having thereon at least one layer of a silver halide emulsion chemically sensitized with at least one selenium or tellurium compound, and then subjecting the material to development-processing with a developer containing substantially no dihydroxybenzene developing agent but containing a developing agent represented by the following formula (I): ##STR2## wherein R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are the same or different and each represents a hydroxyl group, an amino group, an acylamino group, an alkylsulfonylamino group, an arylsulfonylamino group, an alkoxycarbonylamino group, a mercapto group or an alkylthio group; P and Q are the same or different and each represents a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, an alkoxy group, a hydroxyalkyl group, a carboxyalkyl group, a sulfo group, a sulfoalkyl group, an amino group, an aminoalkyl group, an alkyl group, an aryl group or a mercapto group, or P and Q may represent an atomic group capable of forming a 5- to 8-membered ring by combined with each other and further by associating with two vinyl carbon atoms to which R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are attached respectively and one carbon atom to which Y is attached; and Y represents ═O or ═N--R<sub>3</sub>, wherein R<sub>3</sub> represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an alkyl group, an acyl group, a hydroxyalkyl group, a sulfoalkyl group or a carboxyalkyl group.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific constitutions of the present invention are described below in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver halide emulsion of the present invention is chemically sensitized. In particular, it is chemically sensitized with at least one of a selenium compound and a tellurium compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Selenium sensitizers which can be used in the present invention include those disclosed in known patents. In general, selenium sensitization can be effected by adding an unstable selenium compound and/or a stable selenium compound to the silver halide emulsion and agitating the resulting emulsion at a high temperature of 40° C. or more for a definite time. Suitable examples of the unstable selenium compounds include those disclosed in JP-B-44-15748 (the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication), JP-B-43-13489, JP-A-4-25832 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means a "unexamined published Japanese patent application"), JP-A-4-109240, Japanese Patent Application No. 3-82929 and JP-A-4-271341. Specific examples of a unstable selenium sensitizer include isoselenocyanates (e.g., aliphatic isoselenocyanates such as allylisoselenocyanate), selenoureas, selenoketones, selenoamides, selenocarboxylic acids (e.g., 2-selenopropionic acid, 2-selenobutyric acid), selenoesters, diacylselenides (e.g., bis(3-chloro-2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)selenide), selenophosphates, phosphinoselenides, and colloidal metallic selenium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although suitable examples of unstable selenium compounds are cited above, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to those compounds. Talking of unstable selenium compounds as a sensitizer for photographic emulsions, it is generally understood by those skilled in the art that the structure of a selenium compound is not particularly important so far as the selenium atom therein is unstable, that is to say, the organic moiety of a selenium sensitizer molecule has no function except that it holds a selenium atom and renders the sensitizer molecule unstable in a photographic emulsion. In the present invention, any of unstable selenium compounds falling under such a wide conception can be used to advantage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, examples of the stable selenium compounds which can be used in the present invention include those disclosed in JP-B-46-4553, JP-B-52-34492 and JP-B-52-34491. Specific examples of such stable selenium compounds include selenious acid, potassium selenocyanide, selenazoles, quaternary salts of selenazoles, diaryl selenides, diaryl diselenides, dialkyl selenides, dialkyl diselenides, 2-selenazolidinedione, 2-selenoxazolidinethione and derivatives thereof.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The tellurium sensitizers used in the present invention are compounds of the kind which can produce silver telluride, which is presumed to function as sensitizing nucleus, on the surface or inside of silver halide emulsion grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The production rate of silver telluride in a silver halide emulsion can be examined by the method described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When a tellurium sensitizer is added to a silver halide emulsion in a large amount (e.g., 1×10<sup>-3</sup> mole/mole Ag), the silver telluride produced shows its absorption in the visible region. Therefore, the method proposed for sulfur sensitizers by E. Moisar in Journal of Photographic Science, vol. 14, p. 181 (1966) and ibid., vol. 16, p. 102 (1968) can be applied to tellurium sensitizers. Specifically, that method consists in determining the quantity of silver sulfide produced in a silver halide emulsion by the use of the Kubelka-Munk function in which the concentration of silver sulfide in the emulsion is correlated with the infinite reflectivity of the emulsion in the visible region (at the wavelength of 520 nm), and so the relative production rate of silver telluride can be easily determined using the same method as the above. Further, since the foregoing reaction is seemingly comparable to the first-order reaction, the pseudo first-order kinetic constant thereof can be determined. For instance, a silver bromide emulsion having the crystal form of an octahedron and an average grain size of 0.5 μm (in which 0.75 mole of AgBr and 80 g of gelatin are contained per Kg of emulsion) is thermostated at 50° C. as the pH and the pAg thereof are maintained at 6.3 and 8.3, respectively, and thereto is added a tellurium compound dissolved in an organic solvent (e.g., methanol) in an amount of 1×10<sup>-3</sup> mole/mole Ag. The emulsion is placed in a cell having a thickness of 1 cm, and its reflectivity (R) at the wavelength of 520 nm was measured at regular intervals with a spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere by reference to a blank emulsion. The pseudo first-order kinetic constant k (min<sup>-1</sup>) can be evaluated by substituting the successively measured reflectivities in the Kubelka-Muck function (1-R<sup>2</sup>)/2R and examining changes in value of that function. Since R is constantly one (R=1) unless silver telluride is not produced, the value of the Kubelka-Muck function is kept at 0, which is the same as in the case of tellurium compound-free emulsions. As for the tellurium compounds used as a sensitizer, it is preferable in the present invention that they have a first-order kinetic constant k of from 1×10<sup>-8</sup> to 1×10<sup>0</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, measured under the same condition as the testing method described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When a tellurium sensitizer is added in such a reduced amount as to make it difficult to detect the absorption of silver telluride in the visible region, on the other hand, the silver telluride produced can be determined by separating it from the unreacted tellurium sensitizer. For instance, silver telluride is separated out by soaking the emulsion in an aqueous halide solution or an aqueous solution of a water-soluble mercapto compound, and then undergoes the quantitative analysis for a trace amount of tellurium according to atomic absorptiometry or the like. The reaction rate in this case varies greatly in the range of several orders of magnitude depending upon not only the type of the tellurium compound used but also the halide composition, the temperature, the pAg and the pH of an emulsion as the subject. The tellurium sensitizers used preferably in the present invention are those capable of producing silver telluride when they are added to a concrete silver halide emulsion having intended halide composition and crystal habit. In the present invention, there can be generally used to advantage such tellurium compounds as to produce silver telluride when they are added to a silver bromide emulsion which is under a temperature ranging from 40° C. to 95° C. or has its pH in the range of 3 to 10 or its pAg in the range of 6 to 11. Within this scope, the tellurium compounds which have their pseudo first-order kinetic constant k in the range of 1×10<sup>-7</sup> to 1×10<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, determined by the foregoing testing method are more preferred as tellurium sensitizers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present tellurium compounds represented by formulae (V), (VI) and (VII) can be synthesized according to conventional methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">More specifically, they can be synthesized by the methods described in J. Chem. Soc. (A), 2927 (1969); J. Organomet.

The average grain size of the silver halide are preferably in the range of 0.1 to 0.7 μm, particularly preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 μm. As for the distribution of grain sizes, it is preferable that the distribution be so narrow as to correspond to a variation coefficient of 15% or less, preferably 10% or less, wherein the variation coefficient refers to the value obtained by dividing the standard deviation regarding the grain sizes of silver halide grains by the average grain size and then multiplying the quotient by 100.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver halide grains may be uniform throughout, or differ between the inner part and the surface layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Photographic emulsions used in the present invention can be prepared using methods described, e.g., in P.

<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable methods for reacting a water-soluble silver salt with a water-soluble halide include, e.g., a single jet method, a double jet method, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, a method in which silver halide grains are produced in the presence of excess silver ion (the so-called reverse mixing method) can be employed. On the other hand, the so-called controlled double jet method, in which the peg of the liquid phase wherein silver halide grains are to be precipitated is maintained constant, may be employed. Further, it is preferable to carry out the grain formation using the so-called silver halide solvent, such as ammonia, thioethers and tetrasubstituted thioureas.

<div class="description-paragraph">When the 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidones or p-aminophenols as cited above are used in combination with the compound represented by formula (I), it is preferable that the amount thereof is from 10<sup>-3</sup> to 0.1 mole/l, and more preferably 10<sup>-3</sup> to 0.06 mole/l.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The expression "containing no dihydroxybenzenes developing agent" as used in the present invention means that the concentration of dihydroxybenzenes in the developer is negligible, compared with those of the compound represented by formula (I) and the foregoing auxiliary developing agents (for example, 5×10<sup>-4</sup> mole/l or less). It is preferable for the developer of the present invention to be completely free from dihydroxybenzenes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To the developer of the present invention, there may be added sulfites as preservatives, such as sodium sulfite, potassium sulfite, lithium sulfite, sodium hydrogen sulfite, potassium metabisulfite and formaldehyde sodium bisulfite. Such sulfites are used in an amount of 0.01 mole/l or more. However, the addition amount thereof should be minimized so far as it can satisfy the need. This is because the addition thereof in a large amount causes the dissolution of silver halide emulsion grains to generate silver stain, and further it is responsible for raising COD (chemical oxygen demand).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The pH of the developer used for the development-processing of the present invention is preferably from 10.0 to 12.0, and more preferably from 10.4 to 12.0. The pH values higher than 12.0 are undesirable because the non-image area suffers a sudden increase in stain, or black spots. When the developer has pH of lower than 10.0, on the other hand, satisfactorily high contrast cannot be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable examples of alkali agents used for pH adjustment include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the developer of the present invention, pH buffers such as the sugars disclosed in JP-A-60-93433 (e.g., saccharose), oximes (e.g., acetoxime), phenols (e.g., 5-sulfosalicylic acid), silicates, sodium tertiary phosphate and potassium tertiary phosphate can be used. The concentration of the pH buffers is preferably 0.3 mole/l or less. However, it is undesirable to use boron compounds, including boric acid and sodium metaborate, as the pH buffers of the present developer because there is a risk that they react with the compound of the present invention represented by formula (I) to deactivate it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The developer of the present invention may further contain development restrainers such as potassium bromide, potassium iodide, etc., organic solvents such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, dimethylformamide, methyl cellosolve, hexylene glycol, ethanol, methanol, etc., antifoggants including indazole compounds such as 5-nitroindazole, etc., benzimidazole compounds such as sodium 2-mercaptobenzimidazole-5-sulfonate, etc., and benzotriazole compounds such as 5-methylbenzotriazole, etc., and the development accelerators described in Research Disclosure, Vol. 176, No. 17643, Item XXI (December, 1978). Also, it may contain the amine compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,269,929, JP-A-61-267759 and JP-A-2-208652. Further, it may contain toning agents, surfactants, hardeners and so on, if needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, the amino compounds, including alkanolamines, disclosed in EP-A-0136582, British Patent 958,678, U.S. Pat. No. 3,232,761 and JP-A-56-106244 can be used in the developer of the present invention for the purposes of accelerating the development and increasing the contrast.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The fixer used in the present invention is an aqueous solution containing a thiosulfate, and the pH thereof is 3.8 or more, preferably from 4.2 to 7.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the fixing agent, sodium thiosulfate and ammonium thiosulfate are examples thereof. In particular, ammonium thiosulfate is preferable from the viewpoint of fixing speed. The amount of the fixing agent can be properly chosen, and it is generally set in the range of about 0.1 to about 6 mole per liter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The fixer may contain a water-soluble aluminum salt as a hardener. Suitable examples of such an aluminum salt include aluminum chloride, aluminum sulfate and potassium alum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the fixer, tartaric acid, citric acid, gluconic acid or derivatives thereof can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more thereof. These acids are effective when added in an amount of 0.005 mole or more, preferably from 0.01 to 0.03 mole, per liter of fixer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the fixer can optionally contain preservatives (e.g., sulfites, hydrogen sulfites), pH buffers (e.g., acetic acid, boric acid), pH adjusters (e.g., sulfuric acid, ammonia), chelating agents having an ability to soften hard water, surfactants, wetting agents, fixation accelerators, and the compounds disclosed in JP-A-62-78551.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the fixation accelerators, the thiourea derivatives disclosed in JP-A-45-35754, JP-A-58-122535 and JP-A-58-122536, triple bond-containing alcohols and the thioether compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,126,459 are examples thereof. Also, the compounds disclosed in JP-A-2-44355 may be used as fixation accelerators.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, the fixer can contain as a dye elution accelerator the compounds disclosed in JP-A-64-4739.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the photographic processing method of the present invention, the photographic material is processed with washing water or a stabilizing solution after the development and fixation steps, and then dried. It is possible to perform the washing or stabilizing step using washing water or a stabilizing solution at a replenishment rate of at most 3 liter of a replenisher per m<sup>2</sup> of silver halide photographic material (including the replenishment rate of zero, namely the washing with stored water). That is, not only economizing water in the washing step but also making a piping work unnecessary in setting up an automatic developing machine becomes possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a method for reduction in replenishment of washing water, the multistage (e.g., two-stage or three-stage) counter current process has been known for a long time. If this process is applied to the present invention, the fixation-processed photographic material is processed as it is brought into contact with successive, more and more cleaned processing solutions, that is, processing solutions less and less contaminated with the fixer. Accordingly, more efficient washing can be carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the washing step is performed with a small amount of water, it is preferable to use a washing tank equipped with squeeze rollers or crossover rollers, as disclosed in JP-A-63-18350 and JP-A-62-287252. Further, the addition of various kinds of oxidizing agents and the filtration may be supplemented for the purpose of reduction in pollution load. An increase in pollution load is a big problem that the washing with little water faces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the water-saved or pipeless processing, it is preferable that some means of proofing against molds are applied to the washing water or stabilizing solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of means of proofing against molds include the ultraviolet irradiation method described in JP-A-60-263939, the magnetic field-using method described in JP-A-60-263940, the method of using water purified with an ion exchange resin described in JP-A-61-131632 and the method of using antibacteria disclosed in JP-A-62-115154, JP-A-62-153952, JP-A-62-220951 and JP-A-62-209532.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the foregoing methods can be used in combination with antibacteria, antimolds, surfactants and so on described, e.g., in L. F. West, "Water Quality Criteria", Photo. Sci. &amp; Eng., Vol. 9, No. 6 (1965); M. W. Reach, "Microbiological Growths in Motion Picture Processing", SMPTE Journal, Vol. 85 (1976); R. O. Deegan, "Photo Processing Wash Water Biocides", J. Imaging Tech., Vol. 10, No. 6 (1984); JP-A-57-8542, JP-A-57-56143, JP-A-58-105145, JP-A-57-132146, JP-A-58-18631, JP-A-97530, and JP-A-57-157244.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, the washing or stabilizing bath can contain as microbiocides the isothiazolidine compounds described in R. T. Kreiman, J. Imaging Tech., 10(6), p. 242 (1984); the compounds disclosed in Research Disclosure, Vol, 205, No. 20526 (1981, No. 4).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the bath may contain the compounds as described in Hiroshi Horiguchi, Bohkin Bohbai no Kagaku (which means "Antibacterial and Moldproof Chemistry"), Sankyo Shuppan (1982), and Bohkin Bohbai Gijutsu Handbook (which means "Handbook of Antibacterial and Moldproof arts), Nippon Bohkin Bohbai Gakkai (1986).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the washing is carried out with a small amount of water in the present method, it is also preferable that the constitution of the washing process disclosed in JP-A-63-143548 be adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention also, part or all of the overflow generated from the washing or stabilizing bath by replenishing the bath with the water, which is rendered moldproof by the above-cited means, in proportion as the processing proceeds can be used in the prior step wherein the processing solution having a fixability is used, as described in JP-A-60-235133.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the development processing of the present invention, it is preferable that the development time is from 5 seconds to 3 minutes, more preferably from 8 seconds to 2 minutes, and the development temperature is from 18° C. to 50° C., preferably from 24° C. to 40° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the fixation processing, it is preferable that the fixation time is from 5 seconds to 3 minutes at a temperature of from 18° C. to 50° C. More preferably, the fixation time and temperature is from 6 seconds to 2 minutes and from 24° C. to 40° C., respectively. Sufficient fixation can be effected within the above-described temperature and time ranges, and so the sensitizing dyes can be eluted to such an extent as not to generate color stains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The temperature and time in the washing or stabilizing step are preferably from 5° C. to 50° C. and from 6 seconds to 3 minutes, respectively, and it is more preferable for them to be from 15° C. to 40° C. and from 8 seconds to 2 minutes, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The developed, fixed and washed (or stabilized) photographic materials are dried after being passed between a pair of squeeze rollers. They are dried at a temperature of from 40° C. to 100° C. Though it can be properly varied depending on the surrounding condition, the drying time is generally from 4 seconds to 3 minutes. In particular, it is preferable for them to be dried at a temperature of from 40° C. to 80° C. for a time of from 5 seconds to 1 minute.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In performing the photographic processing on condition that the dry-to-dry time is 100 seconds or less, it is preferable to take the following means for prevention of developer mark characteristic of rapid processing. That is, there are adopted such means that the rubber rollers disclosed in JP-A-63-151943 are employed as rollers fixed on the exit of the developing tank; the speed of jetting the developer components into the developing tank is set at 10 m/min or more in order to vigorously agitate the developer, as disclosed in JP-A-63-151944; and the developer is more vigorously agitated at least during development-processing than under standing-by, as disclosed in JP-A-63-264758. For achieving more rapid processing, it is particularly desirable that rollers installed in a fixing tank be constructed of counter rollers to accelerate the fixation speed. Owing to the counter-roller construction, the rollers can be reduced in number and the fixing tank can be diminished in size. That is, it becomes possible to make an automatic developing machine more compact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The image formation method according to the present invention can achieve especially good results in such a system that a hydrazine derivative as a nucleating agent, which urges the system to produce an image of ultra-high contrast, is contained in the silver halide emulsion layer as described above or other hydrophilic colloid layers.

<div class="description-paragraph">The group represented by J<sub>2</sub> may have one or more substituents. Suitable examples of such substituents include those recited above with respect to J<sub>1</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As for the G<sub>1</sub> in formula (II), the group --CO-- is most preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, J<sub>2</sub> may be a group such that it can split the G<sub>1</sub> -J<sub>2</sub> moiety off the residual molecule and thereby cause the cyclization reaction to form a cyclic structure containing the atoms of the G<sub>1</sub> -J<sub>2</sub> moiety. Specific examples of such a group include those disclosed in JP-A-63-29751.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are most preferably a hydrogen atom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Moreover, J<sub>1</sub> or J<sub>2</sub> in formula (II) may be a group into which a ballast group used commonly in immobile photographic additives, such as couplers, etc., or a polymeric moiety is introduced.

<div class="description-paragraph">Production of Silver Halide Photographic Material:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Emulsions were made in the following manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Emulsion A:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An aqueous silver nitrate solution and an aqueous potassium bromide solution containing (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>  RhCl<sub>5</sub> (H<sub>2</sub> O)! in the amount corresponding to 1.0×10<sup>-7</sup> mole per mole of silver and K<sub>3</sub> IrCl<sub>6</sub> in the amount corresponding to 3.5×10<sup>-7</sup> mole per mole of silver were added to an agitated aqueous gelatin solution containing sodium chloride and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinethione in accordance with a double jet method, and thereby was prepared a silver chlorobromide emulsion having an average grain size of 0.02 μm and a chloride content of 70% by mole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thereafter, a KI solution was added to the foregoing emulsion in an amount of 1×10<sup>-3</sup> mole per mole of silver to effect the conversion. The resulting emulsion underwent the washing step according to a conventional flocculation method, and then gelatin was added thereto in an amount of 40 g per mole of silver. Further, sodium benzenethiosulfonate and benzenesulfinic acid were added thereto in amounts of 7 mg and 2 mg, respectively, per mole of silver. Then, the thus obtained emulsion was divided into equal portions, and these portions were subjected to chemical sensitization under the following conditions respectively. To each of the chemically sensitized emulsion portions were added 150 mg of 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,3,3a,7-tetrazaindene as a stabilizer and 100 mg of Proxel as an antiseptic. The thus formed emulsion grains were cubic silver iodochlorobromide grains having an average size of 0.25 μm and a chloride content of 69.9% by mole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Condition (a) for Chemical Sensitization:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The emulsion was adjusted to pH 6.0 and peg 7.8, and then chemically sensitized by adding thereto 3 mg/mole silver of 1,3,3-triethyl-2-thiourea and 4 mg/mole silver of chloroauric acid and ripening it at 65° C. so as to acquire the optimal sensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Condition (b) for Chemical Sensitization:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The emulsion was adjusted to pH 5.3 and peg 8.5, and then chemically sensitized by adding thereto 1 mg/mole silver of sodium thiosulfate, 1 mg/mole silver of Compound (K-1) illustrated below and 4 mg/mole silver of chloroauric acid and ripening it at 55° C. so as to acquire the optimal sensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Condition (c) for Chemical Sensitization:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Chemical sensitization was carried out under a condition such that the proportion of the chemical sensitization due to Compound (K-1) was increased but that due to sodium thiosulfate was reduced, compared with the foregoing condition (b).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">More specifically, the emulsion was adjusted to pH 5.3 and peg 8.5, and then chemically sensitized by adding thereto 0.4 mg/mole silver of sodium thiosulfate, 2.3 mg/mole silver of Compound (K-1) illustrated below and 4 mg/mole silver of chloroauric acid and ripening it at 55° C. so as to acquire the optimal sensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Condition (d) for Chemical Sensitization:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The emulsion was adjusted to pH 5.3 and peg 8.5, and then chemically sensitized by adding thereto 1 mg/mole silver of sodium thiosulfate, 1 mg/mole silver of Compound (K-2) illustrated below and 4 mg/mole silver of chloroauric acid and ripening it at 55° C. so as to acquire the optimal sensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Condition (e) for Chemical Sensitization:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">According to the method of forming images using the present compound, as can be seen from Table 2, the sensitivity achieved was high, the image formed had high contrast and good quality, the fog density was low, and the unevenness due to physical development was hard to generate.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">To Emulsion A obtained in Example 1 were added 5×10<sup>-4</sup> mole/mole Ag of Sensitizing Dye (K-6) illustrated below, 3×10<sup>-4</sup> mole/mole Ag of Mercapto Compound (K-7) illustrated below, 4×10<sup>-4</sup> mole/mole Ag of Triazine Compound (K-9) illustrated below, 2×10<sup>-3</sup> mole/mole Ag of 5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline, 0.5 mmole/mole Ag of Hydrazine Derivative II-34 and 1 mmole/mole Ag of Nucleation Accelerator (K-12). Thereto were further added 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of Water-soluble Latex (K-10) illustrated below, 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of a polyethylacrylate dispersion, 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of a latex copolymer prepared from methylacrylate, sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate and 2-acetoacetoxyethylmethacrylate (having a ratio of 88:5:7 by weight) and 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of 1,3-divinylsulfonyl-2-propanol as a hardener. The resulting composition was adjusted to pH 6.0. The thus obtained composition was coated so as to have a silver coverage of 3.0 g/m<sup>2</sup> on a polyethylene terephthalate film having a moisture proofing undercoat on both sides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the emulsion layer thus formed was coated a protective layer containing 1.0 g/m<sup>2</sup> of gelatin, 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> measuring about 3.5 μm in average particle size as a matting agent, 0.1 g/m<sup>2</sup> of methanol silica, 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of polyacrylamide, 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of sodium ethylsulfonate, 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of hydroquinone, 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of silicone oil, and coating aids constituted of 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of Fluorine-containing Surfactant (K-11) illustrated below and 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate. ##STR16## Exposure and Development:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Samples thus obtained were each exposed to tungsten light through a step wedge, and then developed at 35° C. for 30 seconds using as a developer the aforementioned Developer D-1 or D-3, followed by, in sequence, fixation, washing and drying operations. Herein, GR-F1 (products of Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) was used as a fixer, and the photographic processing was performed with an automatic developing machine, FG-680A, products of Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The reciprocal of the amount of exposure required for providing the density of 1.5 was adopted in determining the sensitivity. The sensitivities shown in Table 3 are relative values, with Sample No.1 being taken as 100. The greater value therein means that the higher sensitivity the sample has. As for the indication of the image contrast (γ), there was adopted as the γ value a slope of the straight line connecting the density points fog+0.3 and fog+3.0 on a characteristic curve. Namely, γ=(3.0-0.3)/ log(the amount of exposure required for providing the density of 3.0)-log(the amount of exposure required for providing the density of 0.3)!. The greater γ value signifies that the sample has the more highly contrasty photographic characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The areas in which black spots appeared were observed under a microscope, and the samples processed in the above-described manner were evaluated by grading them by the extent of black spots in accordance with the following criterion: The grade 5 is given to a state such that the generation of black spots is not observed at all, so the sample is on the most excellent level; while the grade 1 is given to a state such that black spots generate to a considerable extent, so the sample is decidedly inferior in image quality. For practical it is required of the sample that the grade be at least 3.</div>
