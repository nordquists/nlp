<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material. Further, the invention is concerned with improvements in the art of spectrally sensitizing tetradecahedral, octahedral or tabular silver halide grains having (111) faces, wherein the halogen composition of the silver halide is chlorobromide, chloroiodide or chloroiodobromide each containing a high proportion of chloride.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Hitherto, considerable efforts have been exerted to heightening the sensitivities of silver halide photographic materials. The sensitivity of a silver halide photographic material depends on both the latent image forming efficiency, including the light absorption and spectral sensitization factors of silver halide grains, and the minimum latent image size.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With the intention of increasing the light absorption factor of silver halide grains, number of arts as described below have so far been proposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For instance, the art of tabular emulsion grains having a high aspect ratio as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,789 enables an increase in the quantity of dye adsorption per grain through an increase of grain surface area; as a result, an increase in the light absorption factor becomes possible. There is however a limit to the increase in grain surface area by the heightening of aspect ratio, and so the increase in light absorption factor per grain requires an increase of grain size also.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other examples of a method for increasing the per grain surface area include the method of making holes in a certain part of each grain as described in JP-A-58-106532 and JP-A-60-221320 (The term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") and the method of forming ruffled grains as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,643,966. However, the grains according to those methods have unstable forms, so that it is quite difficult to put them to practical use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 5,302,499 discloses an increase in light absorption factor by the formation of a layer structure which can optimize the spectral sensitization characteristics and the grain thickness. However, the increase in light absorption factor by such a method is of the order of 10% at the greatest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, it is thought that the light absorption factor of sensitizing dyes are increased to promote the efficiency in transferring the energy of light to silver halide; as a result, the heightening of spectral sensitivities is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, there is a limit to the quantity of sensitizing dyes adsorbed to the surfaces of silver halide grains, and it is difficult to make sensitizing dyes be adsorbed to the grain surfaces in a quantity greater than that required for saturating the grain surfaces with the sensitizing dyes adsorbed in a monolayer. Accordingly, the absorption factor of the photons incident upon each silver halide grain in the spectrally sensitized region is very low under the present conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The methods proposed for solving the aforementioned problems are described below:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The adsorption of a cationic dye as the first layer and an anionic dye as the second layer through th e electrostatic force of attraction was proposed by P. B. Gilman, Jr. et al. in Photographic Science and Engineering, vol. 20, No. 3, p. 97 (1976).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The method proposed by G. B. Bird et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,622,316 consists in that the silver halide adsorbed by a plurality of dyes in a multilayer is sensitized through the contribution of the excitation energy transfer of Forster type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The spectral sensitization through energy transfer from luminescent dyes was proposed by Sugimoto et al. in JP-A-63-138341 and JP-A-64-84244.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R. Steiger et al. tried the spectral sensitization through energy transfer from gelatin-substituted cyanine dyes in Photographic Science and Engineering, vol. 27, No.2, p. 59 (1983).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ikegawa et al. carried out the spectral sensitization through energy transfer from cyclodextrin-substituted dyes in JP-A-61-251842.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The dyes in which two separate chromophores are coupled via covalent bonds without forming a conjugated system, or the so-called coupled dyes, are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,393,351, 2,425,772, 2,518,732, 2,521,944 and 2,592,196, and European Patent No. 565,083. Therein, however, those dyes did not make it their aim to heighten the light absorption factor. With respect to the dyes with a positive aim of increasing the light absorption factor, G. B. Bird, A. L. Borror, et al. disclose in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,622,317 and 3,976,493 the sensitizing dyes of the coupled dye type which have a plurality of cyanine chromophores in a molecule, and therein the increase of the light absorption factor by adsorption of those dyes and the resultant sensitization through contribution of the energy transfer are proposed. Also, Ukai, Okazaki and Sugimoto proposed in JP-A-64-91134 the binding of at least one substantially non-adsorptive dye having at least two sulfo and/or carboxyl groups to a spectral sensitizing dye capable of being adsorbed to silver halide grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, M. R. Roberts et al. proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,959,587 the spectral sensitization by the use of cyanine dye polymers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned above, many proposals have been advanced on the method of increasing the light absorption factor, but all of them are insufficient in sensitivity heightening effect and attended by problems of causing an increase in intrinsic desensitization, retarding the development and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, novel spectral sensitization arts which enable the sensitivity to be heightened through an increase in the light absorption factor of silver halide photographic materials have been searched for.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver halide-utilized photographic materials have underwent a growing development in recent years; as a result, color images of high quality can be obtained simply and easily at present. Even now, the proposal of improved arts is continued in large number. In particular, various arts of using the so-called high silver chloride content grains having a high silver chloride content (more specifically, the term "high silver chloride content grains" as used hereinafter refers to the grains having a silver chloride content of no lower than 50%) have been proposed with the intention of simplifying and speeding up the development-processing. The use of high silver chloride content grains has advantages in that it can increase the developing speed, heighten the reusability of processing solutions, and so on. Therefore, the sensitive materials of the type which use high silver chloride content grains now came to prevail among the sensitive materials for printing use, including color photographic printing paper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The high silver chloride content grains have a tendency to become grains having (100) faces as their outer surfaces (hereinafter referred to as "(100) grains") when they are formed under ordinary condition, and practically used grains also have a cubic crystal shape. In recent years, (100) grains having tabular crystal shapes have also been developed, and they have advantages, e.g., in that they can undergo effective spectral sensitization and provide a great covering power after development because of their great specific surface area (the surface area/volume ratio). Such tabular grains are disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,320,938, 5,264,337 and 5,292,632.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, (100) high silver chloride content grains had a drawback of tending to be fogged, compared with silver bromide grains of common use. In order to remedy this drawback, the grains having a high silver chloride content and (111) faces as their outer surfaces (hereinafter referred to as "(111) high silver chloride content grains") were used. For instance, the use of such grains is disclosed in JP-A-6-138619.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The production of (111) high silver chloride content grains requires special measures. For instance, Wey discloses in U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,215 the method of producing tabular high silver chloride content grains in the presence of ammonia. According to this method, it is difficult to produce grains having sizes small enough to be used practically. This is because the use of ammonia compels silver chloride grains, which originally have high solubility, to be produced under a condition that their solubility is further heightened. In addition, the foregoing method has a disadvantage in that the grains are produced under a high pH condition (pH 8-10) to have a tendency to be fogged. Maskasky discloses in U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,617 the (111) high silver chloride content grains produced in the presence of thiocyanates. Similarly to ammonia, the thiocyanates increase the solubility of silver chloride. For the purpose of forming the high silver chloride content grains having (111) faces as outer surfaces without heightening the solubility, the methods of using additives (crystal habit control agent) during the grain formation are known. The following are examples of such a method:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Although the development of techniques has been progressed as mentioned above, the crystal habit control agent used during the grain formation is known to remain on the grain surface after the grain formation, thereby inhibiting the adsorption of spectral sensitizing dyes to the grain surface. Accordingly, spectral sensitizing dyes which are weak in adsorbing power cannot confer sufficient spectral sensitivities upon the grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a means to make up for the spectral sensitivities, the method of using streptocyanine dyes has hitherto been known. These dyes can adsorb in a large quantity because of their small adsorption area per molecule; as a result, the light absorption factor per emulsion grain can be improved. For instance, such a method is disclosed in JP-A-9-127637. However, the dyes used therein cannot ensure a satisfactory rise in spectral sensitization efficiency although they can increase the quantity of absorbed light. Therefore, it has been desired to introduce improvements in the foregoing method in the case of silver chloride grains which are weak in dye adsorbing power, especially the grains formed using a crystal habit control agent.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Synthesis of Exemplified Compound (7)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The intended compound is synthesized in accordance with the following reaction scheme; ##STR8##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specifically, 0.21 g (0.00241 mole) of Compound (b) was added to 2 g (0.00483 mole) of Compound (a) and 30 ml of ethanol, and heated on a steam bath under reflux for 1 hour. The reaction mixture obtained was cooled to deposit a crystal-line precipitate. The precipitate was filtered off with suction, and the powder thus obtained was dissolved in a mixture of 100 ml of methanol with 100 ml of chloroform by heating under reflux and then subjected to natural filtration. The filtrate obtained was evaporated under atmospheric pressure to remove 100 ml of the solvent. The residue liberated a crystalline precipitate on standing. The precipitate was filtered off with suction, and dried. Thus, 0.95 g of Compound (7) was obtained as a yellow powder in a 61% yield. λ<sub>max</sub> =449 nm, ε=114000 (in methanol), mp.: decomposed at a temperature higher than 280° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the next place, silver halide photographic materials according to the present invention are illustrated below in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In silver halide photographic materials, the compounds represented by formulae (I), (II), (III) and (IV) according to the present invention (hereinafter referred to as the present methine compounds) can be incorporated individually or in combination with other sensitizing dyes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The time for the present methine compounds (and other sensitizing dyes, too) to be added to the silver halide emulsions for use in the present invention may be in any stages of emulsion-making process as far as they have hitherto been admitted to be useful for addition of spectral sensitizing dyes. For instance, the present methine compounds can be added in the stage of forming silver halide grains or/and in a period before desalting, or in the desalting stage and/or the period after desalting and before the beginning of chemical ripening, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,735,766, 3,628,960, 4,183,756 and 4,225,666, JP-A-58-184142 and JP-A-60-196749; or they can be added just before or in the stage of chemical ripening, or in any stage or step during the period from the completion of chemical ripening to the emulsion coating, as disclosed in JP-A-58-113920. In addition, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,225,666 and JP-A-58-7629, the same compound alone or in combination with a compound having a different structure may be added in separate periods, for example, in the grain formation stage and the chemical ripening stage or the period after the completion of chemical ripening, or before or in the stage of chemical ripening and in the period after the completion of chemical ripening. Further, in such separate additions, different compounds or different combinations with compounds may be used respectively. Furthermore, in the case of grain formation using a crystal habit control agent, the present methine compounds adsorb to silver halide grains in competition with the crystal habit control agent; as a result, the crystal habit control agent is desorbed from the grain surface. Desirably, the desorbed crystal habit control agent is removed from the emulsions. For the removal thereof, a washing operation is effective. Thus, it is desirable that the present methine compounds be added before the washing step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Appropriate amounts of the present methine compounds added to silver halide emulsions, though depend on the shape and size of silver halide grains, are within the range of 1×10<sup>-6</sup> to 8×10<sup>-3</sup> mole per mole of silver halide. When the grain size of silver halide is from 0.2 to 1.3 μm, for instance, it is desirable to add the compounds for use in the present invention in an amount of from 2×10<sup>-6</sup> to 3.5×10<sup>-3</sup> mole, preferably from 7.5×10<sup>-6</sup> to 1.5×10<sup>-3</sup> mole, per mole of silver halide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present methine compounds can be dispersed directly into silver halide emulsions. Also, they are first dissolved in appropriate solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, methyl cellosolve, acetone, water, pyridine or a mixture of two or more thereof, and then added to the emulsions. Herein, additives, such as a base, an acid and a surfactant, can be present. For the dissolution, supersonic waves may be used. On the other hand, the present methine compounds can be incorporated into emulsions using various methods, e.g., the method as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,469,987 wherein a dye is dissolved in a volatile organic solvent, dispersed into a hydrophilic colloid, and then added to an emulsion; the method as described in JP-B-46-24185 wherein a water-insoluble dye is dispersed into a water-soluble solvent, and then added to an emulsion; the method as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,822,135 wherein a methine compound is dissolved in a surfactant and then added to an emulsion; the method as described in JP-A-51-74624 wherein a dye is dissolved with a red shift compound and then added to an emulsion; and the method as described in JP-A-50-80826 wherein a methine compound is dissolved in a substantially water-free acid, and then added to an emulsion. In addition to those methods, the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,912,343, 3,342,605, 2,996,287 and 3,429,835 can be used for the addition of the present methine compounds to emulsions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present methine compounds can also be used as filter dyes, irradiation inhibiting dyes, antihalation dyes and the like for the purpose of achieving improvements in sharpness and color separability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The methine compounds used as such dyes can be incorporated in coating solutions for forming constituent layers of a silver halide photographic material, a filter layer and/or an antihalation layer, in a conventional manner. The amounts incorporated may be sufficient amounts for coloring the desired photographic layers, which can be easily determined by persons skilled in the art depending on the purposes in using those dyes. In general, it is desirable for the dyes to be used in such an amount as to provide an optical density of from 0.05 to 3.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The time of incorporation may be at any stage before the coating are applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, polymers having electric charges opposite to dye ions may be present as mordants in the layers containing the aforementioned dyes. Through the interaction with such polymers, the dyes can be localized in particular layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of such a polymer mordant include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,548,564, 4,124,386, 3,625,694, 3,958,995, 4,168,976 and 3,445,231.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of a supersensitizer useful for the spectral sensitization in the present invention include the pyrimidylamino compounds, the triazinylamino compounds and the azolium compounds described, e.g., in U.S. Pat.

<div class="description-paragraph">Each crystal habit control agent may be added at any stage of the nucleation, physical ripening or growth process of silver halide grains. The (111) face formation is initiated by the addition of the crystal habit control agent. The crystal habit control agent may be placed in advance in a reaction vessel, or added to a reaction vessel with the progress of the grain growth, if desired, while increasing the concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of grains having (111) surfaces include the grains having a regular crystal shape (such as octahedron or tetradecahedron) and the grains having a tabular shape. Whether the grains formed is the regular grains or the tabular grains depends mainly on the nucleation method adopted, and the addition time and amount of the crystal habit control agent.

<div class="description-paragraph">(1) Formation of Grains having Regular Crystal Shape</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is desirable for t he nucleation to be carried out in the absence of a crystal habit control agent. The chloride concentration during nucleation is controlled to 0.6 mole/l or below, preferably 0.3 mole/l or below, particularly preferably 0.1 mole/l or below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Formation of G rains having Tabular Crystal Shape</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Tabular grains are obtained by forming two parallel twin planes. As the formation of twin planes depends on the temperature, the dispersion medium (gelatin), the halogen concentration and so on, the se conditions should be chosen properly. In a case where a crystal habit control agent is present in the step of nucle a tion, it is desirable that the gelatin concentration be from 0.1 to 10% and the chloride concentration be at least 0.01 mole/l, preferably at least 0.03 mole/l.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the other case where a crystal habit control agent is not used in the step of nucleation, the gelatin concentration is chosen from the range of 0.03 to 10%, preferably 0.05 to 1.0%, and the chloride concentration is chosen from to the range of 0.001 to 1 mole/l, preferably 0.003 to 0.1 mole/l. The nucleation temperature can be chosen from the range of 2° C. to 90° C. However, it is desirable that the nucleation temperature be from 5° C. to 80° C., preferably from 5° C. to 40° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the nuclei formed are physically ripened, and made to grow by the addition of a silver salt and a halide in the presence of a crystal habit control agent. Herein, the chloride concentration is adjusted to a value of no higher than 5 mole/l, preferably from 0.05 to 1 mole/l. The temperature during the grain growth can be chosen from the range of 10° C. to 90° C., but it is desirable to choose the temperature from range of 30° C. to 80° C. When the quantity of a dispersion medium used in the step of nucleation is insufficient for the grain growth, it is necessary to add the dispersion medium for supplement. For the grain growth, it is desirable that gelatin be present in a concentration of from 10 to 60 g/l.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The pH during the grain formation, though may be chosen arbitrarily, is preferably adjusted to neutral or chosen from the acidic range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The expression "high silver chloride content grains" as used in the present invention refers to the grains having a chloride content of at least 50 mole %. It is preferable for such grains to have a chloride content of at least 80 mole %, particularly at least 95 mole %. The other silver halides present in those grains are silver bromide and/or silver iodide. The silver iodobromide layer can be localized at the grain surface. This localization is desirable for the adsorption of sensitizing dyes. Also, the high silver chloride content grains may be the so-called core/shell grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver iodide content is from 0.1 to 20 mole %, preferably 0.1 to 5 mole %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver halide grains for use in the present invention have surfaces having (111) faces in a proportion of at least 50%, preferably at least 75%, particularly preferably at least 90%, to the total surface area. The proportion of (111) faces can be determined from the electron photomicrograph of the silver halide grains formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the silver halide grains for use in the present invention are regular crystals, they have no particular limitation as to the average grain size (sphere-equivalent diameter). However, it is desirable for them to have an average grain size of from 0.1 to 5 μm, particularly from 0.2 to 3 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the silver halide grains for use in the present invention are tabular grains, their diameter is preferably from 0.3 to 5.0 μm, particularly from 0.5 to 3.0 μm. The term "diameter of a silver halide grain" used herein refers to the diameter of the circle having the same area as the projected area of a grain on the electron photomicrograph. Further, the tabular grains have a thickness of 0.4 μm or less, preferably 0.3 μm or less, particularly preferably 0.2 μm or less. The volume weighted average volume of tabular grains is preferably 2 μm<sup>3</sup> or less, particularly preferably 1 μm<sup>3</sup> or less. In addition, the diameter/thickness ratio of tabular grains is preferably at least 2, particularly preferably from 2 to 20.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In general each tabular grain has two parallel surfaces, so that the term "thickness" as used herein is defined as the distance between the two parallel surfaces of each tabular grain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The size distribution of the silver halide grains for use in the present invention may be polydisperse or monodisperse. However, it is preferable for the grains for use in the present invention to have a monodisperse size distribution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The presence of a crystal habit control agent on the grain surface after the grain formation has effect on the adsorption of sensitizing dyes and the development. Accordingly, it is desirable that the crystal habit control agent be removed after the grain formation. When the crystal habit control agent is removed, however, it is difficult for the high silver chloride content grains to maintain (111) faces under ordinary condition. Therefore, it is desirable to keep the grain form by replacement with a photographically useful compound such as a sensitizing dye. The methods for such replacement are described, e.g., in JP-A-9-80656, JP-A-9-106026, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,221,602, 5,286,452, 5,298,387, 5,298,388 and 5,176,992.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The crystal habit control agent desorbed from the grain surface using the foregoing methods is desirably removed from the emulsion by a washing treatment. The washing treatment is carried out at such a temperature as not to cause the coagulation of gelatin generally used as a protective colloid. For the washing treatment, known various arts, such as flocculation and ultrafiltration, can be adopted. When pyridinium salts are used as crystal habit control agent, the washing treatment is desirably carried out at a temperature of 40° C. or higher, especially 50° C. or higher. In a case where the flocculation method is adopted, it is necessary to use a sedimentation agent. Examples of a sedimentation agent which can be used include those containing sulfonic acid groups and those containing carboxylic acid groups. However, there is strong interaction between a pyridinium salt as crystal habit control agent and a sulfonic acid group, and so a sedimentation agent containing a sulfonic acid group reacts with the pyridinium salt desorbed from grains to form the corresponding salt. This makes it difficult to remove the pyridinium salt by washing. Accordingly, sedimentation agents containing carboxylic acids are preferred. Examples of a sedimentation agent containing a carboxylic acid are disclosed in GB Patent 648,472.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The desorption of a crystal habit control agent from grains is promoted under a low pH condition. Therefore, it is desirable to lower the pH for the washing treatment so far as excess condensation of grains is not caused thereby.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The emulsion grains for use in the present invention may be silver halide grains of the kind which mainly form latent image inside the grains or silver halide grains of the kind which form latent image predominantly at the surface of the grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In producing the silver halide emulsion grains for use in the present invention, a silver halide solvent may be used. As a silver halide solvent, thiocyanates (as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,222,264, 2,448,534 and 3,320,069), thioether compounds (as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,271,157, 3,574,628, 3,704,130, 4,297,439 or 4,276,374), thione compounds and thiourea compounds (as described, e.g., in JP-A-53-144319, JP-A-53-82408 or JP-A-55-77737) and amine compounds (as described, e.g., in JP-A-54-100717) have frequently been used. These silver halide solvents can be used herein, too. In addition, ammonia can be used in such amount as not to affect adversely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a process of forming silver halide grains or allowing the formed silver halide grains to ripen physically, cadmium salts, zinc salts, lead salts, thallium salts, iridium salts or complexes, rhodium salts or complexes, iron salts or complexes and/or the like may be present. In particular, the presence of iridium salts or rhodium salts is preferred therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In adding a silver salt solution (e.g., an aqueous solution of AgNO<sub>3</sub>) and a halide solution (e.g., an aqueous solution of NaCl) for the purpose of accelerating the grain growth during the production of the silver halide grains for use in the present invention, it is desirable to adopt methods of increasing the addition speed, the addition amount or/and the addition concentration as the time spent for addition increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For details of those methods the descriptions, e.g., in GB Patent 1,335,925, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,672,900, 3,650,757 and 4,242,445, JP-A-55-142329, JP-A-55-158124, JP-A-58-113927, JP-A-58-113928, JP-A-58-111934 and JP-A-58-111936 can be referred to.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The tabular silver halide grains for use in the present invention, though may be chemically unsensitized grains, can be chemically sensitized, if needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For chemical sensitization, the so-called gold sensitization method using gold compounds (as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,448,060 and 3,320,069), sensitization methods using such metals as iridium, platinum, rhodium and palladium (as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,448,060, 2,566,245 and 2,556,263), sulfur sensitization methods using sulfur-containing compounds (as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 2,222,264), selenium sensitization methods using selenium compounds, and reduction sensitization methods using tin salts, thiourea dioxide, polyamines and the like (as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,487,850, 2,518,698 and 2,521,925) can be employed individually or as a combination of two or more thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In particular, gold sensitization, sulfur sensitization, or the combination thereof is used to advantage in chemically sensitizing the silver halide grains for use in the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Besides the silver halide grains for use in the present invention as mentioned above, usual silver halide grains can be contained in the emulsion layers of silver halide photographic materials according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In each of the photographic emulsions containing high silver chloride content grains according to the present invention, it is desirable that the proportion of the high silver chloride content grains to the total silver halide grains present therein be least 50%, preferably at least 70%, particularly preferably at least 90%, on the projected area basis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a case where a photographic emulsion according to the present invention and other photographic emulsions are used as a mixture, it is desirable to mix them so that high silver chloride content grains according to the present invention be present in a proportion of at least 50% in the mixed emulsion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, it is preferable for the other photographic emulsions mixed with a photographic emulsion according to the present invention to be high silver chloride emulsions having a silver chloride content of at least 50 mole %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the spectral sensitization of photographic emulsions according to the present invention, conventional methine dyes and other dyes may be used in combination with the present methine compounds. Suitable spectral sensitizing dyes which may be used include cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, complex cyanine dyes, complex merocyanine dyes, holopolar cyanine dyes, hemicyanine dyes, styryl dyes and hemioxonol dyes. Especially useful dyes are cyanine dyes, mercocyanine dyes and complex merocyanine dyes. Any nuclei usually present in cyanine dyes can be the basic heterocyclic nuclei of these dyes. More specifically, basic heterocyclic nuclei include pyrroline, oxazoline, thiazoline, pyrrole, oxazole, thiazole, selenazole, imidazole, tetrazole, pyridine and like nuclei; nuclei formed by fusing together one of the above-recited nuclei and an alicyclic hydrocarbon ring; -and nuclei formed by fusing together one of the above-recited nuclei and an aromatic hydrocarbon ring. Examples of these fused nuclei include indolenine, benzindolenine, indole, benzoxazole, naphtoxazole, benzothiazole, naphthothiazole, benzoselenazole, benzimidazole and quinone nuclei. These nuclei each may have substituents on carbon atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The merocyanine and complex merocyanine dyes can contain 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic nuclei, e.g., pyrazoline-5-one, thiohydantoin, 2-thioxazolidine-2,4-dione, thiazolidine-2,4-dione, rhodanine, thiobarbituric acid and like nuclei, as ketomethylene structure-containing nuclei.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">More specifically, the compounds described, e.g., in Research Disclosure, Item 17643, page 23, section IV (December, 1978) and the references cited therein can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The time for these dyes to be added to the silver halide emulsions for use in the present invention may be in any stages of emulsion-making process as far as they have hitherto been admitted to be useful for addition of spectral sensitizing dyes. Preferably, those dyes are added subsequently to or simultaneously with the addition of the present methine compounds. Although the sensitizing dyes are generally added during the period from the conclusion of chemical sensitization to the beginning of emulsion-coating, they can be added in the same period as that for chemical sensitizers to effect chemical sensitization and spectral sensitization at the same time, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,628,969 and 4,225,666, or the spectral sensitization can be initiated by adding them prior to chemical sensitization or before the precipitation of silver halide grains is completed, as described in JP-A-58-113928. In addition, the foregoing dyes may be added in separate stages, for example, one portion thereof is added before chemical sensitization and the other portion is added after the chemical sensitization, as taught by U.S. Pat. No. 4,225,666. Further, the foregoing dyes may be divided into some portions and added separately at any different stages during the grain formation, as taught, e.g., by U.S. Pat. No. 4,183,756.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Those dyes can be added in an amount of from 4×10<sup>-6</sup> to 8×10<sup>-3</sup> mole per mole of silver halide. However, the amount added should be controlled so as not to impair spectral sensitizing effect of the present methine compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver halide emulsions prepared in accordance with the present invention can be used for both color photographic materials and black-and-white photographic materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Color photographic materials for which the silver halide emulsions for use in the present invention are preferably used are color paper, color taking films and color reversal films; while X-ray films, taking films for amateur use and sensitive films for photomechanical process are preferred as black-and-white photographic materials for which the silver halide emulsions for use in the present invention are used. In particular, color paper is favored over the others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The photographic materials in which the emulsions according to the present invention are employed have no particular limitations as to the other additives.

<div class="description-paragraph">Non-diffusible color couplers having hydrophobic groups called ballast groups or polymeric color couplers are preferably used in the present invention. These couplers each may be equivalent to either two or four silver ions. Also, colored couplers having color compensating effects or couplers capable of releasing development inhibitors upon development (the so-called DIR couplers) may be used. Further, non-color-forming DIR coupling compounds capable of producing colorless compounds and releasing development inhibitors upon coupling reaction may be employed.</div>

Also, metal complexes represented by (bissalicylaldoximato)nickel complexes and (bis-N,N-dialkyldithiocarbamato)nickel complexes can be used as discoloration inhibitor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The photographic processing of the photographic materials of the present invention can be performed using any known methods and any known processing solutions. The processing temperature is generally chosen from the range of 18° C. to 50° C., but it may be lower than 18° C. or higher than 50° C. Either development-processing for forming silver image (black-and-white photographic processing) or color photographic processing which involves the development-processing for forming dye images may be applied to the photographic materials of the present invention in answer to their purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a black-and-white developer, known developing agents, such as dihydroxybenzenes (e.g., hydroquinone), 3-pyrazolidones (e.g., 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone) and aminophenols (e.g., N-methyl-p-aminophenol) can be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In general a color developer is an alkaline aqueous solution containing a color developing agent. As the color developing agent can be used-known aromatic primary amines, such as phenylenediamines (e.g., 4-amino-N,N-diethylaniline, 3-methyl-4-amino-N,N-diethylaniline, 4-amino-N-ethyl-N-β-hydroxyethylaniline, 3-methyl-4-amino-N-ethyl-N-β-hydroxyethylaniline, 3-methyl-4-amino-N-ethyl-N-β-methanesulfoamidoethylaniline, 4-amino-3-methyl-N-ethyl-N-β-methoxyethylaniline).</div>

No. 4,083,723 and antioxidants described in West German Patent Publication (OLS) No. 2,622,950, if needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of color photographic processing, the photographic materials are generally bleached after color development. The bleach processing may be carried out simultaneously with fixing or separately therefrom. Examples of a bleaching agent which can be used therein include polyvalent metal compounds such as iron(III), cobalt(III), chromium(IV) or copper(II) compounds, peracids, quinones, and nitroso compounds. Specifically, ferricyanides, bichromates, and iron(III) or cobalt(II) complexes of organic acids, such as aminopolycarboxylic acids (e.g., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, 1,3-diamino-2-propanoltetraacetic acid), citric acid, tartaric acid and malic acid; persulfates and permanganates; and nitrosophenols. Of these compounds, potassium ferricyanide, sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetato ferrate, ammonium ethylenediaminetetraacetato farrate are particularly useful. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-iron(III) complexes are useful in both an independent bleaching bath and a combined bleaching and fixing bath.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The bleaching or bleach-fix bath also can contain various additives, such as the bleach accelerators described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,042,520 and 3,241,966, JP-B-45-8506 and JP-B-45-8836, and the thiol compounds described in JP-A-53-65732. After the bleach or bleach-fix processing, the photographic materials may be washed with water or processed with a stabilizing bath alone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The photographic materials of the present invention can be utilized as the heat developable photosensitive material as described in JP-A-6-138619.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In constituting a photosensitive material in which an original scene can be recorded and reproduced as the corresponding color images, the color reproduction using a subtractive color process is basically employed. More specifically, the color information of an original scene can be recorded by forming a photosensitive material provided with at least three kinds of light-sensitive layers having their sensitivities in blue, green and red wavelength regions respectively, and incorporating in these layers respectively color couplers capable of forming yellow, magenta and cyan dyes, the colors of which are complementary to the colors of the wavelength regions in which the foregoing layers have their individual sensitivities. And a photographic color paper, which has the same complementary relationship as the foregoing photosensitive material between the light-sensitive wavelength and the hues of developed colors, is exposed to light via the dye images formed in the foregoing photosensitive material, thereby reproducing the original scene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, the information on dye images obtained by photographing an original scene can be read with a scanner, and the thus read information can be reproduced as visual images. Herein, it is also possible to form a relationship other than the color complementary relationship between the wavelength regions in which emulsions have their individual sensitivities and the hues of colors developed in these emulsions. In this case, the image information taken in is subjected to some image processing, e.g., hue conversion, and thereby the original color information can be reproduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In reading image information with a scanner, the information on dye images can be taken in without removing developed silver and undeveloped silver halide, as well as after removing them. In the latter case, a means to remove them can be applied simultaneously with or subsequently to the development-processing. In order to remove the developed silver from the light-sensitive element and complex or solubilize the silver halide at the same time as development, a silver oxidation or re-halogenation agent functioning as a bleaching agent and a silver halide solvent functioning as a fixing agent are incorporated in advance in a processing element, and these agents are made to react with the developed silver and the undeveloped silver halide upon heat development. Also, the removal of developed silver or the complexation or solubilization of silver halide can be effected by pasting another element containing a silver oxidation or re-halogenation agent or a silver halide solvent on the photosensitive material after the development for image formation. In the present invention, it is desirable that the residual developed silver and undeveloped silver halide be reduced to an extent that they do not interfere with the reading of image information by carrying out the aforementioned processing after photographing and image forming development subsequent thereto. In particular, since the undeveloped silver halide generates an appreciable haze in the gelatin film to raise the background density of image, it is preferable to reduce the haze by complexing the undeveloped silver halide or to remove all or part of the undeveloped silver halide from the film through the solubilization. In this respect, the grains having a higher silver chloride content are of the greater advantage. This is because the light scattering and absorption in the visible region become less and the solubilization becomes easier the higher the grains are in silver chloride content to result in a greater reduction of haze.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, it is desirable to use at least two kinds of silver halide emulsions having their individual sensitivities in the same wavelength region but differing from each other in average projected area of emulsion grains. The above expression "having their individual sensitivities in the same wavelength region" indicates that their individual sensitivities are in effectively the same wavelength region. More specifically, as far as the wavelength regions in which emulsions have their individual main sensitivity peaks overlap, these emulsions are regarded as the emulsions having their individual sensitivities in the same wavelength region even if they are subtly different in spectral sensitivity distribution. With respect to the difference in the average projected area of grains between the emulsions used, it is desirable that the average projected area of grains in one emulsion be at least 1.25 times preferably at least 1.4 times, particularly preferably at least 1.6 times, that in another eemulsion. When three or more of those emulsions are used, it is desired that the aforesaid relationship be held between the emulsion having the smallest average grain projected area and the emulsion having the greatest one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In using two or more emulsions which have their individual sensitivities in the same wavelength region but differ in average grain projected area, these emulsions may be formed into separate light-sensitive layers, or the mixture thereof may be formed into one light-sensitive layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a case where those emulsions are incorporated in separate layers, it is desirable that the emulsion having the greatest average grain projected area be incorporated in the uppermost layer (on the incidence side).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of incorporating the foregoing emulsions in separate layers, it is desirable that color couplers used in combination with the emulsions have the same hue. However, it is also possible to make the hues of developed colors differ from layer to layer by using mixtures of couplers capable of forming different hues of colors, or couplers which can form colors having hues different in absorption profile can be used in separate layers, too.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention will now be illustrated in more detail by reference to the following examples, but it should be understood that these examples are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Emulsions 1, 2 and 3 were prepared in the following manners respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) Preparation of Emulsion 1</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An aqueous solution containing 7.0 g of gelatin having an average molecular weight of 15,000 and 4.5 g of KBr in 1,200 ml of water was kept at 30° C. with stirring, and thereto aqueous AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution having a concentration of 1.9 M and aqueous KBr solution having a concentration of 1.9 M were added at a rate of 25 ml/min over a period of 70 seconds in accordance with a double jet method, thereby obtaining nuclei of tabular grains. 400 ml out of the thus obtained emulsion was used for seed crystals, and then admixed with 650 ml of an aqueous inert gelatin solution (containing 20 g of gelatin and 1.2 g of KBr), heated up to 75° C., and ripened for 40 minutes. Thereto, an aqueous solution containing 1.7 g of AgNO<sub>3</sub> was added over a period of 90 seconds, and successively 7.0 ml of a 50 wt % aqueous solution of NH<sub>4</sub> NO<sub>3</sub> and 7.0 ml of a 25 wt % aqueous ammonia were added, and further ripened for 40 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the pH of this emulsion was adjusted to 7 with HNO<sub>3</sub> (3N). After 1.0 g of KBr was added to the neutralized emulsion, 366.5 ml of aqueous AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution having a concentration of 1.9 M and an aqueous KBr solution were added, and successively 53.6 ml of aqueous AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution having a concentration of 1.9 M and aqueous KBr solution containing 33.3 mole % of KI were added, and further 160.5 ml of aqueous AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution having a concentration of 1.9 M and aqueous KBr solution were added while keeping the pAg at 7.9. Thus, Emulsion 1 was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thus formed emulsion grains were grains having a triple layer structure wherein the highest silver iodide content region was present in the middle shell, and the average aspect ratio of these grains was 2.8. The proportion of tabular grains having an aspect ratio of 3 or above to the total emulsion grains was 26% on the projected area basis. The coefficient of variation in the grain size was 7%, and the average grain size was 0.98 μm, expressed in terms of sphere-equivalent diameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the Emulsion 1 was desalted using a conventional flocculation method, each of the sensitizing dyes hereinafter set forth in Table 2 was added thereto in an amount of 4.1×10<sup>-4</sup> mole per mole of silver and, in the presence of each sensitizing dye, the resulting emulsion was subjected to gold-sulfur-selenium sensitization under optimum conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Preparation of Emulsion 2</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An aqueous solution containing 7.0 g of gelatin having an average molecular weight of 15,000 and 4.5 g of KBr in 1,200 ml of water was kept at 30° C. with stirring, and thereto aqueous AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution having a concentration of 1.9 M and aqueous KBr solution having a concentration of 1.9 M were added at a rate of 25 ml/min over a period of 70 seconds in accordance with a double jet method, thereby obtaining nuclei of tabular grains. 350 ml out of the thus obtained emulsion was used for seed crystals, and then admixed with 650 ml of an aqueous inert gelatin solution (containing 20 g of gelatin and 1.2 g of KBr), heated up to 75° C., and ripened for 40 minutes. Thereto, an aqueous solution containing 1.7 g of AgNO<sub>3</sub> was added over a period of 90 seconds, and successively 6.2 ml of a 50 wt % aqueous solution of NH<sub>4</sub> NO<sub>3</sub> and 6.2 ml of a 25 wt % aqueous ammonia were added, and further ripened for 40 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the pH of this emulsion was adjusted to 7 with HNO<sub>3</sub> (3N). After 1.0 g of KBr was added to the neutralized emulsion, 366.5 ml of aqueous AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution having a concentration of 1.9 M and an aqueous KBr solution were added, and successively 53.6 ml of aqueous AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution having a concentration of 1.9 M and aqueous KBr solution containing 33.3 mole % of KI were added, and further 160.5 ml of aqueous AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution having a concentration of 1.9 M and aqueous KBr solution were added while keeping the pAg at 8.3. Thus, Emulsion 2 was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thus formed emulsion grains were grains having a triple layer structure wherein the highest silver iodide content region was present in the middle shell, and the average aspect ratio of these grains was 6.7. The proportion of tabular grains having an aspect ratio of 6 or above to the total emulsion grains was 80% on the projected area basis, and the proportion of tabular grains having an aspect ratio of from 3 to 100 to the total emuls-ion grains was about 95% on the projected area basis. The coefficient of variation in the grain size was 11%, and the average grain size was 1.00 μm, expressed in terms of sphere-equivalent diameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the Emulsion 2 was desalted using a conventional flocculation method, each of the sensitizing dyes hereinafter set forth in Table 2 was added thereto in an amount of 5.4×10<sup>-4</sup> mole per mole of silver and, in the presence of each sensitizing dye, the resulting emulsion was subjected to gold-sulfur-selenium sensitization under optimum conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) Preparation of Emulsion 3</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To 1.5 liter of a 0.8% low molecular (molecular weight: 10,000) gelatin solution containing 0.05 mole of potassium bromide, 15 ml of a 0.5 M silver nitrate solution and 15 ml of a 0.5 M potassium bromide solution were added over a period of 15 seconds with stirring in accordance with a double jet method. During the addition, the gelatin solution was kept at 40° C., and the pH thereof was 5.0. After the addition, the resulting solution was heated up to 75° C., admixed with 220 ml of a 10% trimellitated gelatin solution (trimellitation degree: 95%), ripened for 20 minutes and then admixed with 80 ml of a 0.47 M silver nitrate solution. After the emulsion obtained was ripened again for 10 minutes, 150 g of silver nitrate and a potassium bromide solution containing 5 mole % of potassium iodide in the amount to keep the pBr at 2.55 were added thereto at an increasing flow rate (so that the flow rate at the end was 19 times the flow rate at the beginning) in accordance with a controlled double jet method while keeping the electric potential at 0 mV. After the addition, 30 ml of a 10% KI solution was further added. Then, the resulting emulsion was adjusted to pH 7.2 by the addition of 1N NaOH. Thereto, 327 ml of a 0.5 M silver nitrate solution and 327 ml of a 0.5 M potassium bromide solution, to which 16.4 ml of 10<sup>-2</sup> M hexacyanoferrate(II) solution was added in advance, were added over a period of 20 minutes in accordance with a double jet method while keeping the electric potential at 0 mV. Thereafter (after the shell formation), the emulsion was cooled to 35° C., and washed using a conventional flocculation method. Thereto, 80 g of deionized alkali-processed ossein gelatin and 40 ml of 2% Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> were added at 40° C. After the gelatin was dissolved, the emulsion was adjusted to pH 6.5 and pAg 8.6, and stored in cold and dark room. The thus obtained Emulsion 3 comprised tabular iodobromide grains having a variation coefficient of 15% with respect to projected area circle-equivalent diameter (hereinafter referred to as "circle-equivalent diameter"), a circle-equivalent diameter of 2.5 μm, an average thickness of 0.10 μm (aspect ratio: 25) and a silver iodide content of 5.7 mole %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the Emulsion 3 was desalted using a conventional flocculation method, each of the sensitizing dyes hereinafter set forth in Table 2 was added thereto in an amount of 9.3×10<sup>-4</sup> mole per mole of silver and, in the presence of each sensitizing dye, the resulting emulsion was chemically sensitized with sodium thiosulfate, potassium chloroaurate and potassium thiocyanate at 60° C. under optimum conditions.</div>

After a 5-minute lapse from the end of addition, each of the crystal habit control agents set forth in Table 3 was added. After a 5-minute lapse from the addition of each crystal habit control agent, 300 ml of an aqueous solution containing 112.5 g of silver nitrate and 300 ml of an aqueous solution containing 40.14 g of sodium chloride were further added over a period of 60 minutes.</div>
