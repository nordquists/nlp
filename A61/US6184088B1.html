<div class="description-paragraph">This application is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/825,109, filed Mar. 27. 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,936,883.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates generally to a split gate type transistor and a method for manufacturing the same. Particularly, the present invention relates to a split gate type transistor employable as memory cells in non-volatile semiconductor memory devices and also to a method for manufacturing the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Recently, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices such as ferro-electric Random Access Memory, Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) and EEPROM have become increasingly popular. EPROMs and EEPROMs have a plurality of memory cells having floating gates and control gates. EEPROMs include flash EEPROMs which can perform data erasure for all of the memory cells or partial data erasure for each of a plurality of block memory cells. Split gate type cells and stacked gate type cells are present in the memory cells of the flash EEPROM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the flash EEPROM, the stacked gate type memory cell has no selector transistor, and thus it cannot make an ON-OFF selection by itself. Accordingly, when excess charges are extracted from the floating gate electrode in performing data erasure, a problem of excess erasure arises. For example, even if 0V is applied to control gate electrodes so as to deenergize the memory cells, those memory cells which were subject to excess erasure are energized. Consequently, electric current constantly flows into the memory cells making it impossibe to read data stored in the memory cells. In order to prevent such excess erasure from occurring, the erasing procedures in the memory device are preferably controlled precisely by a peripheral circuit or an external circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Split gate type memory cells include a selector transistor which obviates the problem of excess erasure. International Patent Publication WO92/18980 discloses a flash EEPROM employing split gate type memory cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of an example of a prior art split gate type memory cell <b>1</b>. The split gate type memory cell (split gate type transistor) <b>1</b> has an N-type conductive source area <b>3</b> and an N-type conductive drain area <b>4</b> which are defined on a P-type conductive single crystal silicon substrate <b>2</b>, a floating gate <b>7</b> disposed on a gate insulating film <b>6</b> on a channel <b>5</b> present between the source area <b>3</b> and the drain area <b>4</b>, and a control gate electrode <b>9</b> disposed on an insulating film <b>19</b> and a tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> on the floating gate electrode <b>7</b>. The arrow B in FIG. 1 shows movement of electrons from the floating gate <b>7</b> to the control gate electrode <b>9</b> in the erasure mode; while the arrow C shows movement of electrons from the channel area <b>5</b> to the floating gate electrode <b>7</b> in the write mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The insulating film <b>19</b> is formed with a Local Oxidation on Silicon (LOCOS) process. The floating gate <b>7</b> has lips <b>7</b> <i>b </i>formed to extend upward from the upper edges thereof. The control gate electrode <b>9</b> has a first part serving as a selector gate <b>10</b> disposed on the channel <b>5</b> and the insulating films <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> and a second part disposed on the floating gate electrode <b>7</b> and the insulating films <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>. The selector gate <b>10</b>, the source area <b>3</b> and the drain area <b>4</b> comprise a selector transistor <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the split gate type memory cell <b>1</b> has the transistor consisting of the floating gate electrode <b>7</b>, the control gate electrode <b>9</b>, the source area <b>3</b> and the drain area <b>4</b>, connected in series with the selector transistor <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2A is a schematic cross-sectional view showing a part of a memory cell array having a plurality of the split gate type memory cells <b>1</b>, as disclosed in WO92/18980. The memory cells <b>1</b> are arranged in the form of a matrix on the silicon substrate <b>2</b>. FIG. 2B is a schematic plan view showing a part of the memory cell array. FIG. 2A is a cross section taken along the line <b>2</b>A—<b>2</b>A in FIG. <b>2</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each pair of adjacent memory cells <b>1</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1</b> <i>b </i>share the source area <b>3</b>. The floating gate electrode <b>7</b> and the control gate electrode <b>9</b> of one memory cell <b>1</b> <i>a </i>and those of the other memory cell <b>1</b> <i>b </i>are arranged symmetrically on each side of the source area <b>3</b>. Such symmetrical arrangement reduces the area to be occupied by the memory cells on the substrate <b>2</b>. As shown in FIG. 2B, a field insulating film <b>13</b> for separating the memory cells <b>1</b> from one another is formed on the substrate <b>2</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3A is a schematic cross-sectional view showing a part of memory cell array having a plurality of split gate type memory cells disclosed in U.S. Pat.

FIG. 3B is a schematic plan view showing a part of the memory cell array.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A method for manufacturing a memory cell array <b>150</b> is described with reference to FIGS. 4A to <b>4</b>G.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 1 (FIG. <b>4</b>A): The silicon oxide gate insulating film <b>6</b> is formed on a device forming area of the substrate <b>2</b> according to the thermal oxidation method, and then a doped polysilicon film <b>31</b> is formed on the gate insulating film <b>6</b>. A silicon nitride film <b>32</b> is formed over the entire surface of the doped polysilicon film <b>31</b> employing the Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. After a resist is applied over the entire surface of the silicon nitride film <b>32</b>, the resist is partially removed by known photolithographic procedures to form an etching mask <b>33</b> for forming the floating gate <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 2 (FIG. <b>4</b>B): After the silicon nitride film <b>32</b> is etched by means of anisotropic etching employing the etching mask <b>33</b>, the etching mask <b>33</b> is removed. Next, the doped polysilicon film <b>31</b> is partly oxidized by means of LOCOS employing the partially etched silicon nitride film <b>32</b> as a mask to form the insulating film <b>19</b>. In this process, the insulating film <b>19</b> intrudes into the edge portions of the silicon nitride film <b>32</b> to form bird's beaks <b>19</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 3 (FIG. <b>4</b>C): After the silicon nitride film <b>32</b> is removed, the doped polysilicon film <b>31</b> is etched by means of anisotropic etching employing the insulating film <b>19</b> as an etching mask. Thus, the doped polysilicon film <b>31</b> remaining after etching constitutes the floating gate electrodes <b>7</b>. In this process, since the insulating film <b>19</b> has bird's beaks <b>19</b> <i>a </i>formed thereon, the sharp lips <b>7</b> <i>b </i>are formed along the upper edges of the floating gate <b>7</b> below the bird's beaks <b>19</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 4 (FIG. <b>4</b>D): The silicon oxide tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> is formed by thermal oxidation, LPCVD or a combination thereof over the entire surface of the device formed in Step 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 5 (FIG. <b>4</b>E): A doped polysilicon film <b>34</b> is formed over the entire surface of the device formed in Step 4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 6 (FIG. <b>4</b>F): After a resist is applied over the entire surface of the device formed by in Step 5, an etching mask <b>35</b> is formed by means of photolithography.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 7 (FIG. <b>4</b>G): The doped polysilicon film <b>34</b> is etched by anisotropic etching employing the etching mask <b>35</b> to form the control gate electrodes <b>9</b>. Then, the etching mask <b>35</b> is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 5, at the initial stage of forming the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> in Step 4, an incomplete silicon oxide film <b>8</b> <i>a </i>attributed to native oxide film, structural transition layer, etc. is formed. This incomplete silicon oxide film <b>8</b> <i>a </i>contains not only silicon oxide having the complete O—Si—O bond but also dangling bonds not having the O—Si—O bond. While the process proceeds from Step 3 to Step 4, since lateral faces of the floating gate electrode <b>7</b> are exposed to the outside air, a native oxide film is formed on the surface of the lateral faces. The native oxide film contains dangling bonds not having the O—Si—O bond. Further, the structural transition layer is present at the border between the floating gate electrode <b>7</b> and the silicon oxide tunnel insulating film <b>8</b>. In the structural transition layer, dangling bonds not having the O—Si—O bond are likely to exist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 6 is a schematic cross-sectional view showing the memory cell <b>1</b> having an incomplete silicon oxide film <b>8</b> <i>a. </i>The data stored in the memory cell <b>1</b> is erased when electrons in the floating gate electrode <b>7</b> flow to the control gate electrode <b>9</b> side as indicated by the arrow B. In this process, when the electrons accelerated by a high electric field pass through the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> having such incomplete silicon oxide film <b>8</b> <i>a, </i>the films <b>8</b>, <b>8</b> <i>a </i>undergo great stress. Accordingly, stress is repeatedly applied to the films <b>8</b>, <b>8</b> by repeating a write operation and an erase operation to form and accumulate electron traps in the incomplete silicon oxide film <b>8</b> <i>a. </i>In other words, an increase in the number of repeating write and erase operations (i.e. the number of data rewritings) increases electron traps. The thus formed electron traps inhibit migration of electrons from the floating gate electrode <b>7</b> to the control gate electrode <b>9</b>. As a result, it becomes difficult to sufficiently withdraw the electrons in the floating gate electrode <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, electron traps induce a phenomenon which is shown in FIG. <b>7</b>. More specifically, in the read mode, although the electric current flowing into the memory cell (assuming the written state) is maintained at a constant level as shown, the current flowing into the memory cell <b>1</b> (assuming the erased state) attenuates, so that the difference between the electric current flowing into the memory cell <b>1</b> in the written state and the electric current flowing into the memory cell in the erased state becomes small as the number of data rewrites increases. This makes it difficult for a sense amplifier to read the data stored in the cell by detecting the level of the cell current. Thus, as it is difficult to read the data from the memory cell, the intended function of the memory cell cannot be expected. As described above, the incomplete silicon oxide film <b>8</b> <i>a </i>makes it difficult to increase the number of data rewrites and also to reduce the operating life of the flash EEPROM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, as shown in FIG. 8, in Step 4, when the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> is formed according to the thermal oxidation method, the edges of the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> intrude under the lower edges of the floating gate electrode <b>7</b> to form bird's beaks (gate bird's beaks) <b>8</b> <i>b. </i>The bird's beaks <b>8</b> <i>b </i>cause recession of the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> on the opposite surface from the bird's beaks <b>8</b> <i>b </i>to form gaps <b>8</b> <i>c. </i>As shown in FIG. 9, in Step 5, the doped polysilicon film <b>34</b> intrudes into the gaps <b>8</b> <i>c </i>to form sharp fins <b>9</b> <i>a </i>corresponding to the profile of the gaps <b>8</b> <i>c </i>along the lower edges of the control gate electrode <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The control gate electrode <b>9</b> permits, in the write mode, release of electrons from the fins <b>9</b> <i>a </i>to induce a phenomenon called reverse tunneling such that electrons are injected from the control gate <b>9</b> into the floating gate <b>7</b>. This reverse tunneling causes a problem in that data is written in memory cells <b>1</b> which were not selected for writing in the write mode. Consequently, it becomes impossible to write independent data in the respective memory cells <b>1</b>, and the EEPROM cannot perform its intended function. As described above, the bird's beaks <b>8</b> <i>b </i>cause reverse tunneling to make the flash EEPROM difficult to exhibit its function.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a method for manufacturing the memory cell array according to the first embodiment will be described referring to FIGS. 12A to <b>12</b>J.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 1 (FIG. <b>12</b>A): The field insulating film <b>13</b> (not shown) is formed on the substrate <b>2</b> preferably according to the LOCOS process except for the area where a device is to be formed. The silicon oxide gate insulating film <b>6</b> is formed on the device-forming area of the substrate <b>2</b> preferably according to the thermal oxidation method. Subsequently, a doped polysilicon film <b>31</b> is formed on the gate insulating film <b>6</b>. The silicon nitride film <b>32</b> is formed over the entire surface of the doped polysilicon film <b>31</b>, preferably according to the LPCVD process. Next, a resist is applied over substantially the entire surface of the silicon nitride film <b>32</b>. The silicon nitride film <b>32</b> is then partly removed using known photolithographic procedures to form the etching mask <b>33</b> for forming the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 2 (FIG. <b>12</b>B): After the silicon nitride film <b>32</b> is etched for by means of anisotropic etching employing the etching mask <b>33</b>, the etching mask <b>33</b> is removed in a conventional manner. Next, the doped polysilicon film <b>31</b> is partly oxidized by means of LOCOS employing the partially etched silicon nitride film <b>32</b> as a mask to form an insulating film <b>19</b>. In this process, the insulating film <b>19</b> intrudes into the edge portions of the silicon nitride film <b>32</b> to form bird's beaks <b>19</b> <i>a. </i>As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art this substep of forming the insulating film <b>19</b> may be omitted as necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 3 (FIG. <b>12</b>C): After the silicon nitride film <b>32</b> is removed, the doped polysilicon film <b>31</b> is etched by means of anisotropic etching employing the insulating film <b>19</b> as an etching mask. Thus, the doped polysilicon film <b>31</b> remained after etching constitutes floating gate electrodes <b>70</b>. In this process, since the insulating film <b>19</b> has bird's beaks <b>19</b> <i>a </i>formed thereon, sharp lips <b>70</b> <i>b </i>are formed along the upper edges of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b> locating below the bird's beaks <b>19</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 4: The lateral faces of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b> are subjected to nitrogen ion implantation over the entire surface to form a nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a. </i>In this process, an implantation method called rotational oblique ion implantation is preferably employed so as to achieve uniform nitrogen implantation into the four lateral faces of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>. According to this method, nitrogen ion is implanted at an angle of about 60° with respect to a normal line (not shown) extending perpendicular to the surface of the substrate <b>2</b>, while a silicon wafer (not shown) having the substrate <b>2</b> formed thereon is rotated. This rotational oblique ion implantation permits high-accuracy control of the amount of nitrogen ion to be implanted and facilitates formation of the nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conditions of nitrogen ion implantation are as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Implantation energy: ca. 10 keV</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Dose: 1×10<sup>15</sup>−5×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Implantation energy: The projection range (RP) of nitrogen ion having an energy of 10 keV in the polysilicon film is about 0.02 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, since the nitrogen ions implanted to the floating gate electrode <b>70</b> are introduced only to the portion very close to the surface of the lateral faces of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>, the nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a </i>has a relatively small thickness. A dose of more than the range of 1×10<sup>15</sup>−5×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>permits formation of silicon nitride on the lateral faces of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>. It is possible to inhibit formation of the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> by the silicon nitride. A dose of less than the range of 1×10<sup>15</sup>−5×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>makes it difficult to give merits to be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 5 (FIG. <b>12</b>D): A silicon oxide tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> is formed by means of thermal oxidation, LPCVD or a combination of them over the entire surface of the device having undergone in Step 4. Thus, the laminated gate insulating film <b>6</b> and the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> are integrated into one body. The gate insulating film <b>6</b> and the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> may be of a film formed using as a major component at least one silicon preferably selected from silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride and silicon nitride. Such insulating film is formed preferably employing at least one method selected from thermal oxidation, thermal nitration, thermal oxynitration and CVD. The insulating films <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> may be formed by laminating a plurality of insulating film layers of different materials as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since the floating gate electrode <b>70</b> has a nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a </i>formed on all lateral faces, it has no incomplete silicon oxide film attributed to native oxide film or structure transition layer at the initial stage of forming the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the process proceeds from Step 4 to Step 5, the lateral faces of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b> may be exposed to the outside air containing oxygen. However, since the nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a </i>is formed on them, it is possible to control the forming of a native oxide film, which contains dangling bonds and does not have the O—Si—O bond on the surface of lateral faces of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, a structural transition layer where dangling bonds are likely to be formed is present at the border between the polysilicon film floating gate electrode <b>70</b> and the silicon oxide tunnel insulating film <b>8</b>. However, the dangling bonds are terminated the trivalent nitrogen atoms contained in the nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a. </i>Accordingly, occurrence of dangling bond in the structural transition layer can be minimized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a </i>prevents, when the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> is formed employing the thermal oxidation method, the edges of the insulating film <b>8</b> from intruding into the lower edge portions of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>. Thus, no bird's beak (gate bird's beak) is formed on the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 6 (FIG. <b>12</b>E): A doped polysilicon film <b>34</b> is formed over the entire surface of the device of Step 5. The doped polysilicon films <b>31</b>, <b>34</b> can be formed according to the following methods:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Method 1: A polysilicon film is formed by means of LPCVD in an atmosphere of impurity-containing gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Method 2: An undoped polysilicon film is formed by means of LPCVD, and then an impurity diffusion source layer is formed on the polysilicon film by using POCl<sub>3 </sub>or the like. The impurity is diffused from the impurity diffusion source layer into the polysilicon film to form a doped polysilicon film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Method 3: An undoped polysilicon film is formed by means of LPCVD, followed by impurity ion implantation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 7 (FIG. <b>12</b>F): After a resist is applied over the entire surface of the device underwent Step 5, an etching mask <b>35</b> is formed by means of photolithography.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 8 (FIG. <b>12</b>G): The doped polysilicon film <b>34</b> is etched by anisotropic etching employing the etching mask <b>35</b> to form the control gate electrode <b>9</b>. Then, the etching mask <b>35</b> is removed in a conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 9 (FIG. <b>12</b>H): After a resist is applied over the entire surface of the device of Step 8, a mask <b>42</b> for defining the source area <b>3</b> is formed by means of photolithography. The mask <b>42</b> is formed on the substrate <b>2</b> preferably such that at least the area on which the drain area <b>4</b> is to be defined is covered and that the edges of the mask <b>42</b> may be substantially aligned with the edge of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>. Next, phosphorus ion (P<sup>+</sup>) is implanted to the surface of the device by means of the known ion implantation method to define a source area <b>3</b>. In this process, the location of the source area <b>3</b> is defined by the edges of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>. Then, the mask <b>42</b> is removed. The impurity ion to be implanted so as to define the source area <b>3</b> is not limited to phosphorus ion, but other N-type impurity ions, such as of arsenic and antimony may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 10 (FIG. <b>12</b>I): After a resist is applied over the entire surface of the device of Step 9, a mask <b>43</b> for defining the drain area <b>4</b> is formed by means of photolithography. The mask <b>43</b> is preferably formed such that at least the source area <b>3</b> may be covered. Next, arsenic ion (As<sup>+</sup>) is implanted to the surface of the device by means of the known ion implantation method to define the drain area <b>4</b>. The impurity ion implanted to define the drain area <b>4</b> is not limited to arsenic ion, but other N-type impurity ion such as of phosphorus and antimony may be employed. In the case where an N-type single crystal silicon substrate or an N-type well is employed, a P-type impurity ion such as of boron and indium is preferably implanted so as to define the source area <b>3</b> and the drain area <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 11 (FIG. <b>12</b>J): The mask <b>43</b> is then removed, and split gate type memory cells <b>41</b> <i>a, </i> <b>41</b> <i>b </i>according to the first embodiment are completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, according to the first embodiment, the lateral faces of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b> all have a nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a. </i>Accordingly, at the initial stage of forming the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> in Step 5, formation of incomplete silicon oxide film does not occur. This prevents electron traps from being formed in the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> even when stress is repeatedly applied thereto by repeating writing and erasing operations in the memory cells <b>41</b>. Therefore, in the erasure mode, it is possible to withdraw electrons in the floating gate electrode <b>70</b> sufficiently to enable an increase in the number of data rewrites. As a result, memory cells having elongated operational lives, i.e., a flash EEPROM, can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, if the number of data rewrites is increased, there occurs no drop in the electric current flowing into the memory cells assuming the erased state. This permits a sense amplifier to perform secured determination of the data value based on the difference between the cell current of the memory cells assuming the written state and those of the erased state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a </i>further prevents bird's beaks from being formed at the lower edge portions of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>. This avoids formation of the fins <b>9</b> <i>a, </i>attributed to the bird's beaks, along the lower edges of the control gate electrode <b>9</b>, so that no reverse tunneling phenomenon occurs. Accordingly, in the write mode, data are not erroneously written in unselected memory cells, but the data can be written in the desired memory cells only.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the first embodiment, the nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a </i>may be formed only on a lateral face through which electrons are emitted in the erasure mode. In this case, the nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a </i>is formed employing the ordinary oblique ion implantation method in place of the rotational oblique ion implantation method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The nitrogen-containing layer <b>70</b> <i>a </i>may be formed according to the following methods: (a) The lateral faces of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b> are exposed to nitrogen plasma; or (b) After formation of the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>, it is subjected to thermal treatment in an atmosphere containing nitrogen (NH<sub>3 </sub>or the like).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A second embodiment of the present invention is now described. To avoid a redundant description, like or same reference numerals are given to those components which are the same as the corresponding components of the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 13A is a schematic cross-sectional view showing a part of a memory cell array <b>252</b> having a plurality of split gate type memory cells <b>61</b> <i>a, </i> <b>61</b> <i>b </i>according to the second embodiment. FIG. 13B is a schematic plan view showing a part of that memory cell array <b>252</b>. FIG. 13A is a cross section taken along the line <b>13</b>A—<b>13</b>A in FIG. <b>13</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIGS. 13A and 13B, a plurality of split gate type memory cells (split gate type transistors) <b>61</b> <i>a, </i> <b>61</b> <i>b </i>are arranged on a substrate <b>2</b>. The memory cells <b>61</b> <i>a, </i> <b>61</b> <i>b </i>each contain a source area <b>3</b>, a drain area <b>4</b>, a channel area <b>5</b>, a floating gate electrode <b>70</b>′ and a control gate electrode <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each pair of adjacent memory cells <b>61</b> <i>a </i>and <b>61</b> <i>b </i>share a common source area <b>3</b> so as to reduce the area occupied by the memory cells <b>61</b> <i>a, </i> <b>61</b> <i>b </i>on the substrate <b>2</b>. The floating gate electrode <b>70</b>′ and the control gate electrode <b>9</b> of one memory cell <b>61</b> <i>a </i>and those of the other memory cell <b>61</b> <i>b </i>are arranged symmetrically on each side of the source area <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the second embodiment, the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>′ contains no nitrogen atom, but the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> contains nitrogen atoms. FIGS. 14 to <b>16</b> each show the relationship between the distribution and concentration of the nitrogen contained in the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 14 (a) to (i), the nitrogen concentration of the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> shows a peak value near the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>′.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 15 (a) to (i), the nitrogen concentration of the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> shows a peak value near the control gate electrode <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 16 (a) to (i), the nitrogen concentration of the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> shows peak values forming local maximum values near the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>′ and the control gate electrode <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, (a) to (c) in each of FIGS. 14 to FIG. 16 are cases where the nitrogen concentration is relatively high; whereas (g) to (i) are cases where the nitrogen concentration is relatively low; and (d) to (f) are cases where the nitrogen concentration is between that of (a) to (c) and that of (g) to (i). In FIGS. 14 to <b>16</b>, (a), (d) and (g) are cases where the nitrogen distribution is narrow; whereas (c), (f) and (i) are cases where the nitrogen distribution is broad; and (b), (e) and (h) are cases where the nitrogen distribution is between that of (a), (d) and (g) and that of (c), (f) and (i).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the structural transition layer present at the border between the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>′ and the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b>, dangling bonds not having the O—Si—O bond are liable to occur. However, since the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> contains nitrogen atoms at a part corresponding to the structural transition layer, the unbound bonds of the dangling bonds are terminated by trivalent nitrogen atoms. Thus, dangling bonds are eliminated from the structural transition layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 14 or <b>16</b>, when the nitrogen concentration of the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> shows a peak value near the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>′, the dangling bonds in the structural transition layer are advantageously eliminated. The nitrogen concentration is preferably set at the optimum value such that the following demerits may be avoided. If the nitrogen concentration is higher than the optimum value, the stress in the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> is increased; whereas if it is lower than the optimum value, it will be difficult to achieve full termination of the unbound bonds of the dangling bonds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 15 or <b>16</b>, when the nitrogen concentration of the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> shows a peak value near the control gate electrode <b>9</b>, electron traps are advantageously prevented from occurring in the erasing operation. Further, in the case where the nitrogen distribution is broad, formation of electron traps in the area other than the area near the interface between the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>′ and the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> can be controlled. Accordingly, in order to control formation of electron traps, it is preferred that the nitrogen distribution is broad or that the nitrogen concentration shows a peak value near the control gate electrode <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a method for manufacturing the memory cell <b>252</b> according to the second embodiment will be described. In the second embodiment, Step 4 in the first embodiment is omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After completion of Steps 1 to 3 and Step 5 in the same manner as in the first embodiment, the resulting device is subjected to thermal treatment in an atmosphere containing nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>O, NO, NH<sub>3 </sub>or a gaseous mixture thereof) to impregnate the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> with nitrogen atoms, prior to Step 6. In this process, the desired distribution and the desired concentration of nitrogen incorporated into the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> can be achieved, as shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, by adjusting the thickness of the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> and the thermal treatment conditions. Subsequently, Steps 6 to 11 are carried out in the same manner as in the first embodiment to complete the split gate type memory cell <b>61</b> of the second embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the second embodiment, since the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> contains nitrogen atoms, the same effects as in the first embodiment are exhibited. Further, the thermal treatment in an atmosphere containing nitrogen to impregnate the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> with nitrogen atoms facilitates achievement of the desired nitrogen distribution and nitrogen concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The following three methods may be employed to impregnate the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> with nitrogen atoms;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) The tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> is exposed to nitrogen plasma;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) The tunnel insulating film <b>8</b> is implanted with nitrogen ion; and/or</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(c) The doped polysilicon film <b>34</b> which is etched to form the control gate electrode <b>9</b> is impregnated with nitrogen atoms, and the nitrogen atoms in the doped polysilicon film <b>34</b> are diffused into the tunnel insulating film <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 17 is a block diagram showing a flash EEPROM <b>151</b> having a plurality of split gate memory cells <b>41</b> <i>a, </i> <b>41</b> <i>b </i>or <b>61</b> <i>a, </i> <b>61</b> <i>b. </i>The flash EEPROM <b>151</b> includes a memory cell array <b>152</b> (or <b>252</b>), a row decoder <b>153</b>, a column decoder <b>154</b>, an address pin <b>155</b>, an address buffer <b>156</b>, an address latch <b>157</b>, a data pin <b>158</b>, an input buffer <b>159</b>, a sense amplifier group <b>160</b>, an output buffer <b>161</b>, a source line bias circuit <b>162</b> and a control core circuit <b>163</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The memory cell array <b>152</b> has a matrix of split gate memory cells, a plurality of word lines WLa to WLz each commonly connected to the control gate electrodes <b>9</b> of an associated row of memory cells, a plurality of bit lines BLa to BLz each commonly connected to the drains <b>4</b> of an associated column of memory cells, and source lines RSLa to RSLm each connected to the common source <b>3</b> of each odd row of memory cells and each even row of memory cells. The individual source lines RSLa-RSLm are connected to a common source line SL. The word lines WLa-WLz are connected to the row decoder <b>153</b>, and the bit lines BLa-BLz are connected to the column decoder <b>154</b>. The common source line SL is connected to the source line bias circuit <b>162</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The address pin <b>155</b> receives a row address and a column address supplied from an external unit (not shown) and then supplies those addresses to the address buffer <b>156</b>. The address buffer <b>156</b> transfers the row address and column address to the address latch <b>157</b>. The address latch <b>157</b> latches those addresses and transfers the row address to the row decoder <b>153</b> and the column address to the column decoder <b>154</b>. The row decoder <b>153</b> selects one word line in accordance with the row address and controls the voltage applied to the selected word line WLm in accordance with the individual operation modes. The column decoder <b>154</b> selects one bit line in accordance with the column address and controls the voltage applied to the selected bit line in accordance with the individual operation modes. The source line bias circuit <b>162</b> controls the voltage applied to the individual source lines RSLa-RSLm via the common source line SL in accordance with the individual operation modes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The data pin <b>158</b> receives data supplied from the external unit (not shown) and supplies the data to the input buffer <b>159</b>. The input buffer <b>159</b> transfers the data to the column decoder <b>154</b>. The column decoder <b>154</b> controls the voltage applied to any selected one of the bit lines BLa-BLz according to that data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Data read from an arbitrary memory cell is transferred from the selected bit line to the sense amplifier group <b>160</b> via the column decoder <b>154</b>. The sense amplifier group <b>160</b> includes a plurality of sense amplifiers (not shown). The column decoder <b>154</b> connects the selected bit line to the sense amplifiers. The sense amplifier group <b>160</b> discriminates the data and supplies it to the output buffer <b>161</b>. The output buffer <b>161</b> supplies the data to the data pin <b>158</b>. The thus read data is supplied from the data pin <b>158</b> to an external unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The control core circuit <b>163</b> controls the operations of the row decoder <b>153</b>, the column decoder <b>154</b>, the address pin <b>155</b>, the address buffer <b>156</b>, the address latch <b>157</b>, the data pin <b>158</b>, the input buffer <b>159</b>, the sense amplifier group <b>160</b>, the output buffer <b>161</b> and the source line bias circuit <b>162</b> in a conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The individual operation modes (erase mode, write mode and read mode) of the flash EEPROM <b>151</b> will now be discussed with reference to FIG. <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) Erase Mode</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In erase mode, a voltage of the ground level (=0 V) is applied to all the source lines RSLa-RSLm and all the bit lines BLa-BLz. A voltage of +14 to +15 V is applied to a selected word line WLm and a voltage of the ground level is applied to the other, non-selected word lines WLa-WLl and WLn-WLz. Therefore, data is erased from all the memory cells <b>41</b> <i>a</i>/<b>61</b> <i>a </i>that are connected to the selected word line WLm as the electric potentials of the control gate electrodes <b>9</b> of those memory cells <b>4</b>l<i>a</i>/<b>61</b> <i>a </i>are pulled up to +14 to +15 V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the electric potential of the control gate electrode <b>9</b> is +14 to 15 V and the electric potential of the drain is 0 V, a high electric field is produced between the control gate <b>9</b> and the floating gate electrode <b>70</b> so that a Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunnel current flows between those gates. Consequently, electrons in the floating gate <b>70</b> are pulled out to the control gate <b>9</b>, resulting in data erasure. At this time, the floating gate <b>70</b> has sharp lips <b>70</b> <i>b </i>so that electrons are released from the sharp lips <b>70</b> <i>b </i>and move to the control gate <b>9</b>. The sharp lips <b>70</b> <i>b </i>make electrons move easily, and it is possible to effectively pull out electrons in the control gate <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This erasing operation is based on the fact that the electrostatic capacitance between the source <b>3</b> and the substrate <b>2</b> and the floating gate <b>70</b> is significantly greater than that between the control gate <b>9</b> and the floating gate <b>70</b>. Simultaneous selection of a plurality of word lines WLa-WLz allows for data erasure of all the memory cells that are connected to the selected individual word lines. This erasure is called “block erasure”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) Write Mode</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In write mode, a voltage of the ground level is applied to a selected bit lines BLm and a voltage (in this case +2 V) equal or greater than voltage applied to the other, non-selected bit lines BLa-BLl and BLn-BLz. A voltage of +2 V is applied to a word line WLm connected to a control gate <b>9</b> of a selected memory cell and a voltage of the ground level is applied to the other, non-selected word lines WLa-WLl and WLn-WLz. A voltage of +12 V is applied to the common source line SL. Consequently, the electric potential of the floating gate <b>70</b> is pulled up by the capacitive coupling between the source <b>3</b> and the floating gate <b>70</b>, thus producing a high electric field between the channel <b>5</b> and the floating gate <b>70</b>. Thus, the electrons in the channel <b>5</b> are accelerated to become hot electrons which are supplied to the floating gate <b>70</b>. As a result, charges are stored in the floating gate <b>70</b> of the selected memory cell and 1-bit of data is written.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is noted that each memory cell has a threshold voltage Vth of +0.5 V and includes a transistor, which includes the control gate <b>9</b>, the source <b>3</b> and the drain <b>4</b>. Therefore, electrons in the drain <b>4</b> are moved in the channel <b>5</b> in the inverted state from P to N, so that the cell current Id flows to the drain <b>4</b> from the source <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(c) Read Mode</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In read mode, a voltage of +4 V is applied to a selected word line WLm and the voltage of the ground level is applied to the other, non-selected word lines WLa-WLl and WLn-WLz. A voltage of +2 V is applied to a selected bit line BLm and the voltage of the ground level is applied to the other, non-selected bit lines BLa-BLl and BLn-BLz. As a result, the cell current which flows to the source <b>3</b> of the memory cell in the erased state from the drain <b>4</b> becomes greater than the cell current flowing in the memory cell in the written state. This is because the channel <b>5</b> directly below the floating gate <b>70</b> of the data-erased memory cell is enabled, while the channel <b>5</b> directly below the floating gate <b>70</b> of the data-written memory cell is disabled in the memory cell in the written state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">More specifically, because electrons are drained from the floating gate <b>70</b> of a data-erased memory cell, the floating gate <b>70</b> is positively charged. Therefore, the channel <b>5</b> is enabled. As electrons are supplied into the floating gate <b>70</b> of a data-written memory cell, the floating gate <b>70</b> is negatively charged. The channel <b>5</b> is thus disabled. Each sense amplifier in the sense amplifier group <b>160</b> discriminates the level of the cell current flowing in the associated memory cell as erase data “1” or write data “0”. In this manner, binary data having a data value “1” indicating the erased state and a data value “0” indicating the written state may be stored in each memory cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(d) Stand-by Mode</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the stand-by mode, a ground level voltage is applied to the common source line SL, all the word lines WLa-WLz and all the bit lines BLa-BLz. Accordingly, in the stand-by mode, erasure operation, writing operation or read operation is not performed on any memory cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since the split gate type memory cell described above has the selector transistor <b>11</b>, it can make an ON/Off selection by itself. Accordingly, in the data erasure mode, even when excess charge is extracted from the floating gate electrode <b>70</b>, the memory cell can select deenergization by turning off the selector transistor <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The first embodiment may be applied to a split gate type memory cell <b>41</b> in which the source area <b>3</b> and the drain area <b>4</b> are replaced with each other. FIG. 19A is a schematic cross-sectional view showing a part of the memory cell array <b>152</b> having a plurality of such split gate type memory cells; while FIG. 19B is a schematic plan view showing a part of that memory cell array <b>152</b>. FIG. 19A is a cross section taken along the line <b>19</b>A—<b>19</b>A in FIG. <b>19</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The second embodiment may be applied to the split gate type memory cell <b>61</b> in which the source area <b>3</b> and the drain area <b>4</b> are replaced with each other. FIG. 20A is a schematic cross-sectional view showing a part of memory cell array <b>152</b> having a plurality of such split gate type memory cells; while FIG. 20B is a schematic plan view showing a part of that memory cell array <b>152</b>. FIG. 20A is a cross section taken along the line <b>20</b>A—<b>20</b>A in FIG. <b>20</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 21 is a block circuit diagram showing a flash EEPROM <b>171</b> employing the memory cell array <b>152</b> shown in FIG. 19 or FIG. <b>20</b>. FIG. 22 is a drawing for explaining voltage control in the respective modes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 21, the flash EEPROM <b>171</b> is different from the flash EEPROM <b>151</b> in that the common source line SL is grounded in the former. In any operational mode, a ground level voltage is applied via the common source line SL to the respective source lines RSLa-RSLm. Further, in the write mode, a voltage of +12V is applied to the selected bit line BLm, and a ground level voltage is applied to unselected bit lines BLa-BLl and BLn-Blz.</div>
