<div class="abstract">A modular power roller conveyor is described having a conveyor section for transporting a product unit. The conveyor section comprises a number of active zones, each active zone containing means for sensing the entry of a product unit into the active zone. A programmable controller generates activation signals to a drive roller in response to the means for sensing. A plurality of carrier rollers are slaved to the drive roller within the active zone such that activation of the drive roller actuates all of the carrier rollers to drive the product unit through the active zone and into the next active zone. The programmable controller also generates a deactuation signal to deactivate the active zone as a product unit exits the zone.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">This application is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 08/331,063, filed on Oct. 28, 1994, U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,286, entitled MODULAR POWER ROLLER CONVEYOR.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a conveyor systems and more particularly to a modular conveyor system and a method for conveyor operation.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The movement of large numbers of product units, such as a tray or pallet, around a manufacturing or processing facility has long proved to be an expensive and time consuming task. Presently, most systems for carrying out the movement of product units around a manufacturing facility utilize static systems that are set up to maintain and transport product units using a particular configuration that is not easily changed. The problem with these type of systems is that manufacturing or processing requirements may change and reconfiguration of the static system is not easily achieved. Thus, weeks or even months may be required to reconfigure a conveyor system to meet the changing needs of the facility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Prior art conveyor systems have many problems relating to the maintenance and complexity of the systems. One problem with existing conveyor systems is that the systems normally have complex mechanical gearing consisting of a large number of components. This type of mechanically geared conveyor system requires a great deal of maintenance in order to keep the system in peak operating condition. Air pressure operated systems require a complex pneumatic system in order to operate the conveyor. Pneumatic systems require labor intensive maintenance procedures in order to achieve peak operating conditions of the system. Existin, systems also create a great deal of noise when operating. Mechanically geared systems normally comprise a large number of chain and roller drive assemblies creating mechanical noise during operation. Pneumatic systems necessarily require the use of noisy compressors and air injection procedures which add to the noise pollution of the work environment. Finally, each of the above described systems require a great deal of power to operate since the entire system must function at the same time, no matter how many or few product units are present upon the conveyor system at any particular time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Therefore, a conveyor system is needed which will allow a manufacturing or processing facility to quickly and easily reconfigure the system to changing facility needs, provide easy maintenance requirements, decrease the amount of noise pollution to the work environment, and provide lower energy consumption than is possible with presently existing systems.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention overcomes the foregoing and other problems with a modular power roller conveyor system and onboard PLC/power card. The system consists of modular units having a frame for holding a plurality of carrier and drive rollers. These modular units are easily connected to form an adaptable conveyor system. The conveyor section of each module is divided into a number of active zones. Each active zone contains a photosensor and reflector pair for detecting the entry of a product unit into the active zone, a drive roller for driving rollers within the active zone, and a plurality of carrier rollers actuated in response to movement of the drive roller. Each zone is connected to a PLC/power card. Upon detection of a product unit by a photosensor, a control unit generates an activation signal to the drive roller of the active zone the product unit is entering. The drive roller drives the carrier rollers within the active zone allowing the product unit to be transported through the active zone and into the next active zone. At the same time, the controller generates a deactivation signal to the drive roller of the active zone the product unit is exiting to conserve system power.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to the Drawings, and more particularly to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a perspective view of one embodiment of a module <b>8</b> for the modular power roller conveyor of the present invention. The module <b>8</b> is a straight conveyor section <b>10</b> for transporting received product units. The straight conveyor section <b>10</b> is supported by legs <b>11</b> and consists of a left side rail <b>12</b>, a right side rail <b>13</b>, a plurality of carrier rollers <b>14</b> and drive rollers <b>16</b> mounted between the left side rail <b>12</b> and the right side rail <b>13</b>. The drive rollers and the carrier rollers may be of the type manufactured by Interroll Corporation and identified as model Driverroll. The carrier rollers <b>14</b> and drive rollers <b>16</b> are interconnected by a plurality of O-ring bands <b>17</b> such that actuation of a drive roller will cause actuation of any carrier rollers connected thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The side rails <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> have a cross-sectional shape that defines an interior chamber for placement of a controller (FIG. 16) and control wiring (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Openings <b>18</b> within side rails <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> facilitate operation of a plurality of photosensors <b>34</b> and reflectors <b>36</b> (FIG. 4) for sensing the presence of product units or the straight conveyor section <b>10</b>. Mounted to the side rails <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> at each end of the straight conveyor section <b>10</b> are internal connecting brackets <b>22</b> with holes <b>45</b> for bolts and nuts to enable the straight conveyor section <b>10</b> to be interconnected with another module <b>8</b> and form a conveyor system. An electrical connector mounted in an opening <b>23</b> enables a module <b>8</b> to be electrically connected to other modules or to a power supply.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown a cut-away representation of the side rail <b>13</b> and several rollers <b>14</b> and the internal connecting bracket <b>22</b>. Holes <b>45</b> in the connecting bracket <b>22</b> allow structural connection with an adjoining module <b>8</b>, while an opening <b>23</b> in the internal connecting bracket <b>22</b> allows wire connection between electronic components of adjacent modules <b>8</b>. A cover <b>41</b> protects the wireway, and is connected to side rail <b>13</b> with single-turn screws <b>35</b> and rifled holes <b>43</b>. The shafts on which the rollers <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> turn are spring loaded at one end <b>28</b>, and the spring loaded end passes through holes in the side rail <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. <b>3</b> and FIG. 4, there is shown a side view of one of a carrier roller <b>14</b>. The carrier roller surface <b>20</b> is preferably fabricated from a galvanized steel tube. The shafts <b>28</b> of the carrier roller <b>14</b> are spring loaded at each end allowing for easy removal and mounting of the carrier roller within the side rails <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>. Each carrier roller <b>14</b> also includes a pair of grooved channels <b>30</b> for placement of the O-ring bands <b>17</b> (FIG. 1) between adjacent carrier rollers. Each drive roller <b>16</b> has an outward appearance similar to that of the carrier rollers <b>14</b>. The drive roller <b>16</b> has a roller surface <b>26</b>, spring loaded shaft <b>28</b> on one side and a lock nut and a full nut on the opposite side, and groove channels <b>30</b>. However, the drive rollers <b>16</b> further include internal gearing and an electric motor. The drive rollers <b>16</b> are preferably twenty-four volt electric conveyor rollers manufactured by the Interroll Corporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown a lateral cross-section view of the conveyor section <b>10</b> more fully illustrating the placement and operation of the photosensors <b>34</b> and reflectors <b>36</b> mounted along the conveyor section <b>10</b>. The photosensor <b>34</b> is mounted to a lower sensor bracket <b>38</b>. Lower sensor bracket <b>38</b> connects to an upper sensor bracket <b>40</b> which connects to the upper surface of left side rail <b>12</b>. The assembly is positioned in such a manner that a beam <b>42</b> from photosensor <b>34</b> is passes through opening <b>18</b> within left side rail <b>12</b>. The beam <b>42</b> passes laterally across the conveyor section <b>10</b> and passes through opening <b>18</b> in the right side rail <b>13</b> to strike reflector <b>36</b> and is reflected back to sensor <b>34</b> where the reflected beam is detected. The reflector <b>36</b> is mounted to the interior of the right side rail <b>13</b> by a reflector bracket <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 5, there is shown a lateral view of the interface between adjacent modules with the bolts <b>28</b> attaching the shafts of rollers <b>14</b> to the side rail <b>13</b>. A connecting bracket <b>22</b> is shown connecting adjacent modules <b>8</b> by means of bolts <b>37</b> and nuts <b>39</b>. Electrical connection is made by means of connectors (not shown) mounted to openings <b>23</b>. The cover <b>41</b> attached at several points <b>35</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 6, there is illustrated a top view of a straight conveyor section including four active zone areas <b>50</b> <i>a</i>-<b>50</b> <i>d</i>. Each active zone includes a drive roller <b>16</b> and plurality of carrier rollers <b>14</b> slaved to the drive roller by O-ring bands <b>17</b>. Also included within each active zone <b>50</b> is a photosensor <b>34</b> and a reflector <b>36</b> located prior to the entry end <b>52</b> of the active zone. A programmable controller <b>54</b> (FIG. 16) is mounted in the left side rail <b>12</b> and is in communication with each drive roller <b>16</b>, the plurality of photosensors <b>34</b> and programmable controllers (FIG. 16) in adjacent conveyor sections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a product unit leaves one active zone <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, the product unit breaks the light beam <b>42</b> (FIG. 4) between photosensor <b>34</b> and reflector <b>36</b>. This causes a detection signal to be transmitted to the controller <b>54</b> (FIG. 16) by the photosensor <b>34</b>. For example, upon receipt of a detection signal from the active zone <b>50</b> <i>b</i>, the controller <b>54</b> (FIG. 16) generates an activation signal to the drive roller <b>16</b> of the active zone <b>50</b> <i>b </i>as the product unit is entering the zone. Activation of the drive roller <b>16</b> initiates movement of the drive roller and all slaved carrier rollers <b>14</b>. At the same time, a deactivation signal is transmitted to the drive roller <b>16</b> of the active zone <b>50</b> <i>a </i>as the product unit is exiting this zone. This process continues as the product unit passes from one active zone <b>50</b> to another. It is important to note that the drive roller <b>16</b> of an active zone <b>50</b> is only activated while a product unit moves through the active zone. When a product unit leaves an active zone <b>50</b> and no other product units enter the active zone, the drive roller <b>16</b> and slaved carrier rollers <b>14</b> are not actuated. This results in a conveyor system that uses less power and produces less noise than presently existing systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown curved section of the modular power roller conveyor of the present invention. The module of FIG. 7 comprises a curved conveyor section <b>60</b> that change the direction of travel of a product unit by 90°. It is important to note that while this particular module illustrates a 90° turn, a turn from anywhere between 0° and 180° may be constructed. The curved conveyor section <b>60</b> is supported by legs <b>62</b>. As before, the curved conveyor section <b>60</b> comprises a left side rail <b>64</b>, a right side rail <b>66</b>, drive rollers <b>72</b> and carrier rollers (<b>14</b>, <b>74</b>) mounted between the left side rail <b>64</b> and the right side rail <b>66</b>. The carrier rollers <b>74</b> are connected to the drive roller <b>72</b> by a plurality of O-ring bands <b>80</b> such that actuation of a drive roller will actuate any carrier rollers connected thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Openings <b>68</b> within side rails <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> facilitate operation of photosensors <b>34</b> (FIG. 4) and reflectors <b>36</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>). The photosensor and reflector assemblies are mounted in a manner similar to that discussed with respect to FIG. <b>3</b>. At each end of the curved conveyor section <b>60</b> connecting brackets <b>65</b> are mounted to the left and right side rails <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> to interconnect the curved conveyor section <b>60</b> to other conveyor sections. Each end of the curved conveyor section <b>60</b> also includes a electrical connector mounted in an opening <b>69</b> for electrical connection between adjacent modules or a power supply.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 8, there is illustrated the tapered carrier roller <b>72</b> of the curved conveyor section <b>60</b>. The carrier rollers <b>14</b> on the straight portions of the curved conveyor section <b>60</b> are the same as those discussed with respect to FIG. <b>3</b>. On the tapered carrier roller <b>72</b>, the carrier roller surface is preferably fabricated from galvanized steel tubing overlain with high impact molded copolymer segments. The surface forms a continuous taper from a large diameter end <b>75</b> to a small diameter end <b>77</b> to allow efficient movement of a product unit around the curved section. Spring loaded shafts <b>76</b> allow for mounting and removal of the tapered carrier roller <b>72</b> within the left and right side frames <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>. The tapered carrier rollers <b>72</b> are mounted such that the small diameter end <b>77</b> is placed upon the interior radius of the curved conveyor section <b>60</b>. Grooved channels <b>79</b> allow for placement of O-ring bands <b>80</b> (FIG. 7) between adjacent rollers. Drive rollers <b>72</b> have a similar appearance to the carrier rollers and are preferably twenty-four volt electric conveyor rollers as manufactured by the Interroll Corporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 9, there is illustrated a top view of the curved conveyor section <b>60</b> of the curved section module. The conveyor section <b>60</b> comprises a number of active zones <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>d</i>. As a product unit passes between a photosensor <b>34</b> and reflector <b>36</b> and into an active zone <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, the photosensor <b>34</b> transmits a detection signal to a controller <b>86</b> (FIG. <b>16</b>). In response to the detection signal, the programmable controller <b>86</b> (FIG. 16) generates an activation signal to the drive roller <b>72</b> of the active zone <b>61</b> <i>b</i>. The drive roller <b>72</b> drives each of the slaved carrier rollers <b>74</b> within the active zone <b>61</b> <i>b </i>until the product unit passes to the active zone <b>61</b> <i>c</i>. The detection signal also causes the controller <b>86</b> (FIG. 16) to generate a deactivation signal to the drive roller <b>72</b> of the active zone <b>61</b>a as the product unit is exiting this zone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. <b>10</b> and FIG. 11, there is illustrated a top-view and a side view of a left-hand divert section <b>81</b> of a power roller conveyor. A flexible divert arm <b>92</b> is mounted to a side rail <b>85</b>. A programmable controller <b>94</b> (FIG. 16) actuates an air cylinder <b>83</b> mounted to the side rail <b>85</b> and the extension of the plunger arm within the cylinder <b>83</b> extends the flexible divert arm <b>92</b> from the side rail <b>85</b> across the divert section <b>81</b>. A track <b>90</b> in the plane defined by the surface of the rollers, comprises a narrow groove that serves as a guide for the flexible divert arm <b>92</b>. The track extends obliquely from the side rail <b>85</b>, to the limit of extension of the flexible divert arm <b>92</b>. When the cylinder <b>83</b> is actuated, the divert arm <b>92</b> slides along the side rail <b>85</b> and along the track <b>90</b>, into the path of product units <b>88</b> moving along the conveyor. The bottom edge of the divert arm <b>92</b> lies within the groove of the track <b>90</b> and as product units pass along the conveyor <b>81</b> the divert arm <b>92</b> is encountered and slides along the divert arm. Positioned at an angle with reference to the divert section <b>81</b> is a straight section <b>98</b>, and product units that encounter the divert arm <b>92</b> slide along the divert arm into the straight section <b>98</b> of power roller conveyor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a left-hand divert as shown in FIG. 10 the divert arm extends from the side rail <b>85</b>, but right-hand divert sections are also available, in which the divert arm <b>92</b> extends from the opposite side rail. Also available are dual divert sections in which a divert arm <b>92</b> extends from each side rail, and a track <b>90</b> extends from each side rail, so that product unit may be diverted to the left, to the right, or move straight ahead according to instructions from the programmable controller <b>94</b> (FIG. <b>16</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An alternative embodiment of the invention includes a right angle transfer arm that moves up from below the surface defined by the rollers. The right angle transfer arm is raised by instruction from the programmable controller <b>94</b> (FIG. <b>16</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 12 (a top view), and FIG. 13 (a lateral view), of the divert section <b>81</b> in which the divert arm <b>92</b> is unactuated and remains positioned along the side rail <b>85</b>. A product unit <b>88</b> passing along the conveyor continues in a straight line, as though the section were a straight modular section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 14 (a top view), and FIG. 15 (a lateral view), of the divert section <b>81</b> the divert arm <b>92</b> is actuated and extends from the side rail <b>85</b> into the path of the product unit <b>88</b> moving along the conveyor. The product unit is diverted into the side path <b>98</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 16, there is shown a schematic of a preferred implementation of the controller. One such controller appears on each conveyor module. A FLASH-RAM <b>139</b> (manufacture designation AT29C256) stores ladder logic code as the computer program for the module. A logic network <b>137</b>, for example a PSD311 44-pin chip, includes internal logic to interface with a microprocessor <b>134</b>. The logic network <b>137</b> contains a SRAM interconnected to the microprocessor <b>134</b>; an EPROM; and other logic and switching circuits. The microprocessor <b>134</b> controls circuitry associated with the module. A logic network <b>138</b>, for example a DS1232, restarts the microprocessor <b>134</b> in the event of microprocessor interruption. Two logic networks <b>141</b>, for example HCPL-2400 chips, serve as optical isolators for a serial port, protecting the microprocessor <b>134</b> from voltage surges. A networking interface connects a transorb <b>136</b> to the microprocessor <b>134</b>. The transorb <b>136</b> clips any voltage above 12 volts, sending it to ground. A high-speed one-meg serial port <b>130</b> allows the microprocessor <b>134</b> to communicate with the logic networks <b>141</b> of an interconnected module. A port <b>140</b> allows modification and installation of logic code into the FLASH-RAM <b>139</b> by a system installer when the site is initially configured. The inputs of four circuits of the type generally shown in FIG. 17 are collectively made available through terminals <b>132</b> to the microprocessor <b>134</b>. One controller of the type generally shown in FIG. 16 is mounted on each module, as described above, and measures 8″×6″×2″. Eight digital inputs at terminals <b>132</b> connect to the input pins of the microprocessor <b>134</b> through light emitting diodes (LED's) <b>133</b> connected to the input terminals <b>132</b>, these terminals also allow controller diagnostics. Sensor signals at terminals <b>135</b> from each of several photosensors also serve as inputs to the microprocessor <b>134</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the controller operates from a 24 volt AC source, and the interconnected controllers of various modules operate in DEVICE NET and SDS. The controllers communicate on DEVICE NET or on SDS application layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 17, there is illustrated a schematic of a logic circuit allowing the controller to alter direction of motion of items on the module, and to enable dynamic braking. Four circuits functionally equivalent to the circuit shown in FIG. 17 reside on each module. One input <b>101</b> controls dynamic braking; when the value of the input <b>101</b> is zero, dynamic braking is engaged, and the motor driving all rollers associated with the module are stopped. The input <b>101</b> is applied to the input to each of two NOR gates <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, forcing the outputs of the NOR gates <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> to zero whenever input <b>101</b> has a value of one. The output of the NOR gates <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> passes through a resistor-capacitor debouncer <b>105</b> or <b>106</b> and through an AND gate isolator <b>107</b> or <b>108</b>, and finally through a resistor, to a JFET <b>111</b> or <b>112</b>. Thus, when input <b>101</b> has a value of one, the output of the NOR gates <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> is zero and the JFETs <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> close, driving the outputs <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> to ground. This prevents power from reaching the outputs <b>123</b> or <b>124</b>. On the other hand, when input <b>101</b> is zero, the outputs are enabled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The inverter associated with input <b>102</b> ensures that one and only one of the two initial NOR gates <b>103</b> or <b>104</b> will carry a double-zero input, allowing an output <b>103</b> or <b>104</b> of the NOR gates to be zero. Thus, input <b>102</b> selects which portion of the circuit to energize. This zero value will be passed through the debouncer <b>105</b> or <b>106</b> and the AND gate <b>107</b> or <b>108</b>, keeping the JFET <b>111</b> or <b>112</b> open; the output <b>123</b> or <b>124</b> will not be grounded. The “zero” output from the initial NOR gate <b>103</b> or <b>104</b> is inverted to a “one” as it passes through the final NOR gate <b>109</b> or <b>110</b>, providing a non-zero signal that is amplified by the cascaded transistors <b>109</b>, <b>119</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> to a rail voltage <b>117</b> of 30 volts. The high voltage closes the output JFET <b>121</b> or <b>122</b> and connects the output <b>123</b> or <b>124</b> to the 30-volt rail voltage <b>117</b>, powering a motor. Input <b>102</b> controls the direction of the rollers; the top half of FIG. 17, if energized, drive the motor in one direction, and the bottom half drives the motor in the other direction, as controlled by an inverter; only one portion of the circuit will operate at any given time. The circuit as shown in FIG. 17 shows only two inputs, but because four such circuits appear on any given module, eight inputs are supplied to the microprocessor (shown in FIG. <b>16</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although preferred and alternative embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in the accompanying Drawings and described in the foregoing Detailed Description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications and substitutions of parts and elements without departing from the spirit of the invention.</div>
