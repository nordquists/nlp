<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates to a resistor for audio equipment adapted for use in a high-fidelity amplifier in audio equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Prior Art Description</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In audio equipment, a high-fidelity amplifier is used to amplify the low level signals and reproduce sounds with good quality. Even slight variations in the electrical characteristics of the resistors used in high-fidelity amplifiers result in a major degradation of the sound quality. This has given rise to proposals to suppress variations in the characteristics of resistors caused by extraneous signal noise, to prevent the amplifier circuitry from being adversely affected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">JP-A 61-34901, for example, discloses an induction array of resistors for audio equipment applications in which, in order to improve the quality of reproduced sound, the induction field generated when electricity passes through the resistance film is utilized to minimize distortion with respect to the signal current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In another example, JP-A 3-288401 relates to a shielded resistor comprising alternating layers of a magnetic film and a conductive film, in which extraneous noise is converted into heat energy, which is radiated away to prevent noise affecting the resistor in the shielding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In another disclosure, JU-A 1-130501, the inside surface of the resistor carrier is formed in strips and the outside of the carrier is covered with shielding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In all of the prior art resistors, the surface of the resistance film is sheathed to insulate the resistance film from the outside air. In one method, for example, the sheathing is coated on. The sheathing is usually a dielectric, so it is readily charged by external electrostatic induction. When this happens, there is a high possibility of the charge carriers causing variation in the electrical characteristics of the resistance film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Moreover, when a magnetic sheathing is used, there is a high risk of the magnetism giving rise to phase distortion of signals applied to the resistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the resistor carrier is cylindrical and comprises strips of resistance film on the inside surface and shielding on the outside surface, the shielding prevents the resistance film from being affected by the magnetism. However, with the shielding and resistance film being formed integrally with the resistor carrier, the signal flowing through the resistance film charges the resistor carrier, which can adversely affect signals applied to the resistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, a CLT-1 tester (made by Radiometer AS Copenhagen) or the like can be used to test the linearity of such resistors. At more than 120 db, the third high-frequency component included in a 10 KHz signal is known to be low. However, an examination into the factors causing variations in the characteristics of such resistors revealed the following. The present inventor used a Hewlett-Packard 4284A LCR Meter to measure the inductance produced when resistance films are subject to spiral cutting, and the capacitance resulting from using sheathing to directly protect the resistance films. At high audio frequencies, no inductance component was detected, just a change in the capacitance component of 40 db or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These results reveal that the sound sensitivity is affected not by the inductance component of the resistor, but only by the capacitance component, which depends on the dielectric sheathing. That is, the sheathing is in direct contact with the resistance film and therefore is charged by electrostatic induction, thereby affecting signals applied to the resistance film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Based on these findings, the object of the present invention is to provide a resistor for audio equipment that is able to prevent audio replay containing unusual sound quality caused by the effect on the characteristics of a resistance film caused by the resistor sheath becoming charged by electrostatic induction.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">To attain the above object, the present invention provides a resistor for audio equipment, comprising: a resistor body; a first electrode attached to a first end of the resistor body; a second electrode attached to a second end of the resistor body; the resistor including a substrate, a resistance film formed to cover the substrate surface, and a groove of constant width formed in the resistance film, exposing the substrate surface; a sheath formed to encompass the resistance film formed with a space around the outer surface of the resistor body; and a conductive film formed on an internal surface of the sheath; the conductive film having an annular insulating slit formed at a predetermined position along an axial line of the resistor body that exposes the sheath surface, whereby the resistor body is axially separated into a first conductive film portion and a second conductive film portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The conductive film does not have to be formed only on the inside surface of the sheath, but may be formed so as to also cover the outside surface of the sheath.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, it is preferable for the insulating slit to be formed at a central point along the axis of the resistor body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With this configuration, the fact that the resistance film is formed on the resistor surface facing the conductive film on the sheath side, with a space therebetween, makes it more difficult for the resistance film to be subjected to the effects of extraneous electrostatic induction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The part of the resistance film facing the insulation slit formed at a point in the conductive film midway along the resistor body will probably become charged slightly. However, the charge produced in the insulation slit by the electrostatic induction and the charge produced by signals applied to the conductive film will cancel each other out. Therefore, the electrostatically induced charge on the sheath prevents signals applied to the resistance film from having an effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incorporating the resistor of the invention in an amplifier will prevent the signals from being affected by extraneous noise, thereby ensuring the fidelity of the reproduced sound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The resistor of this invention can also include first and second cap electrodes set into the ends of the sheath. In this case, a configuration can be used in which the first electrode is inserted between the first cap electrode and the first end of the resistor, and the second electrode is inserted between the second cap electrode and the second end of the resistor. Also, it is preferable in this case for the space between the resistance film and the conductive film on the sheath to be sealed by the cap electrodes. The space can be filled with air or inert gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, the sealed state can be used to maintain a state of reduced pressure in the space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Filling the space between the resistance film on the resistor body and the conductive film formed on the sheath with air or inert gas is an effective way of suppressing the adverse effect on the resistance film of the electrostatic induction of the sheath. This can also be done by using a reduced-pressure gap.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is preferable to use a sealant to ensure the cap electrodes inserted into the ends of the sheath form a hermetic seal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The resistor of the invention can also include a first lead wire that passes through the first cap electrode to the first electrode, and a second lead wire that passes through the second cap electrode to the second electrode. In this case, it is preferable for sealant to be used where the lead wires pass through the cap electrodes to provide a hermetic seal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will become more apparent from the accompanying drawings and following detailed description of the invention.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Embodiments of the resistor of the invention applied to audio equipment will now be described with reference to the drawings. The embodiments are for explaining the invention and are not intended to be limitative.</div>
<heading>FIRST EXAMPLE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 1 to <b>4</b> show the resistor according to a first embodiment of the invention. As shown by the drawings, a resistor <b>1</b> for audio equipment comprises a cylindrical resistor body <b>2</b>, a tubular sheath <b>3</b> that covers the resistor body <b>2</b>, a first lead wire <b>4</b> extending from a resistor first end <b>1</b>R along axis <b>1</b> <i>a</i>, and a second lead wire <b>5</b> extending from a resistor second end <b>1</b>L along axis <b>1</b> <i>a</i>. A space <b>6</b> having an annular section is formed between the resistor body <b>2</b> and the sheath <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The resistor body <b>2</b> includes a cylindrical ceramic substrate <b>21</b>. A resistance film <b>22</b> of a prescribed thickness is formed over the whole of the surface of the substrate <b>21</b>. The resistance film <b>22</b> is comprised of carbon, nickel-chrome, tin oxide or the like, and can be formed by a coating method such as pyrolysis, sputtering, plating and the like. A spiral groove <b>23</b> having a constant width is formed in the resistance film, exposing the substrate surface. The groove <b>23</b> is used to adjust the resistance of the resistor <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A cap electrode of a conductive material such as metal is fitted into each end of the resistor body <b>2</b>. More specifically, a first cap electrode <b>24</b> is fixed into place in the first end <b>2</b>R of the resistor body <b>2</b>, and a second cap electrode <b>25</b> is fixed into place in the second end <b>2</b>L of the resistor body <b>2</b>. First and second lead wires <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are welded coaxially to the outside end surface of the first and second lead wires <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The outer sheath <b>3</b> protecting the resistor body <b>2</b> is formed of an insulating material such as ceramic or glass. A conductive film <b>31</b> is formed on at least the inside surface <b>3</b>a of the sheath <b>3</b>. This can be done by coating or plating the conductive film <b>31</b> onto the inside surface <b>3</b> <i>a</i>. In this example, the conductive film <b>31</b> comprises a conductive film portion <b>31</b> <i>a </i>formed on the inside surface <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, and conductive film portions <b>31</b> <i>c </i>and <b>31</b> <i>d </i>that continue on from the conductive film portion <b>31</b> <i>a </i>and extend to the edge portion on the outside surface <b>3</b> <i>b </i>at each end of the sheath <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An insulating slit <b>32</b> formed at a central point along the resistor axis <b>1</b> <i>a </i>separates the conductive film <b>31</b> into left and right parts that are electrically isolated from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By means of the insulating slit <b>32</b>, the conductive film portion <b>31</b> <i>a </i>is divided into a first portion comprising a right-side portion <b>31</b> <i>e </i>and conductive film portion <b>31</b> <i>c</i>, and a second portion comprising a left-side portion <b>31</b> <i>f </i>and conductive film portion <b>31</b> <i>d. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The resistor body <b>2</b> inserted into the sheath <b>3</b> is affixed coaxially within the sheath by dish-shaped cap electrode plates <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> fitted at the ends. The cap electrode plates <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> have centrally located through-holes <b>71</b> and <b>81</b> for the lead wires <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. The cap electrode plates <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are each given an outside diameter that allows them to be fixed in place in the end openings <b>3</b>R, <b>3</b>L of the sheath <b>3</b>. Thus, when the resistor body <b>2</b> is inserted into the sheath <b>3</b> and the cap electrode plates <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are plugged into the openings <b>3</b>R and <b>3</b>L, the resistor body <b>2</b> can be maintained in a prescribed position within the sheath <b>3</b> by inserting the cap electrode plates <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> until they abut the cap electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this example, the surfaces of the cap electrode plates <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> inserted into the openings <b>3</b>R and <b>3</b>L are coated with an epoxy sealant <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>. Thus, the insertion portions <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>8</b> <i>a </i>of the cap electrode plates <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> and the take-off portions for the lead wires <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are completely sealed off from the outside. The sealant <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> also serves to keep the space <b>6</b> in an airtight state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The smaller the volume of the airtight space <b>6</b> is the better. It is also preferable to fill the space <b>6</b> beforehand with air or inert gas. Alternatively, the space <b>6</b> can be maintained in a state of reduced pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the resistor <b>1</b> for audio equipment thus configured, the sheath <b>3</b> faces the resistor body <b>2</b> from which it is separated by the space <b>6</b>, so the resistance film <b>22</b> facing the conductive film portion <b>31</b> <i>a </i>does not become charged by extraneous electrostatic induction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With respect to the insulating slit <b>32</b> formed in the conductive film <b>31</b>, extraneous charges arising from electrostatic induction and charges arising from signals applied via the conductive film <b>31</b> cancel each other out, leaving the resistance film <b>22</b> unaffected by the electrostatic induction. Therefore, the signals flowing in the resistor <b>1</b> do not become distorted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Moreover, because the resistance film <b>22</b> and the conductive film <b>31</b> of the sheath <b>3</b> are separated by the space <b>6</b>, there is no need to specify the thickness of the sheath <b>3</b>. This means there is more freedom of choice with respect to the shape of the sheath <b>3</b>, facilitating manufacture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this example the insulating slit <b>32</b> is formed at a central point along the axis of the resistor body <b>2</b>. Thus, as shown in FIG. 1, if the length of the resistor body <b>2</b> is L, the insulating slit <b>32</b> is formed at a point L/<b>2</b>. Although it is preferable for the slit position to be in the middle of the resistor body <b>2</b>, the prescribed effect can be obtained if the slit is located within one-third of the resistor body length L, with said one-third centering on the middle of the resistor body <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is preferable for the insulating slit <b>32</b> to be narrow. The sheath can be formed in various shapes depending on the shape of the substrate. When the resistor substrate is cylindrical or square, it is preferable to reduce the surface area of the substrate and reduce the volume of the space between the resistance film and the conductive film formed on the surface of the sheath.</div>
<heading>SECOND EXAMPLE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 5 is a diagram showing a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a leadless resistor according to a second embodiment of the invention. Except for the fact that the resistor <b>100</b> of this example is leadless, the basic configuration is the same as that of the first embodiment. Therefore, with reference to FIG. 5, identical parts have been given the same reference numbers or symbols, and only different parts will be described here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With respect to the resistor <b>100</b>, internal electrodes <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, made of conductive material, are attached to end portions <b>2</b>R, <b>2</b>L of the resistor body <b>2</b>, and over these are fitted conductive cap electrodes <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>. Cap electrode plates <b>7</b>A and <b>8</b>A do not have through-holes for leads. Annular external electrodes <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, formed of conductive material, are affixed at the ends of the sheath <b>3</b>, over the annular end faces and outer peripheral portions. The external electrodes <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> have electrical continuity with the conductive film <b>31</b> covering the surface of the sheath <b>3</b>. The leadless resistor <b>100</b> thus configured provides the same function and effect as the resistor <b>1</b> of the first embodiment.</div>
