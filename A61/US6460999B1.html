<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a projector for projecting an image on a screen or the like and a protector for protecting the eyes of a person from projecting light emitted by the projector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Generally, a projector such as a liquid crystal projector for projecting an image on a screen located at a remote position is configured so as to emit projecting light by the use of a light source having a relatively high output (e.g., a halogen lamp or the like). Thus, Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Application Publication No. Hei 5-8556 proposes a projector comprising a sensor for detecting the presence or absence of an object (a person) in a space area (hereinafter referred to as a projection space area) which projecting light passes through for the purpose of preventing damage to the eyes of a person who carelessly looks into a projection lens or the like of the projector, wherein projection is stopped when the sensor detects an object in the projection space area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In general, a person who gives an explanation of the image or the like is near the screen. The position at which the explaining person stands is the position having relatively low intensity even in the projection space area of the projector. Thus, the explaining person does not suffer damage to his/her eyes by the projecting light at the position. However, the above-mentioned projector described in Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Application Publication No. Hei 5-8556 may detect even the explaining person at the position and thus stop projecting. Therefore, the projector is disadvantageous for practical use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above-mentioned projector described in Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Application Publication No. Hei 5-8556 is designed so as to stop projecting only after detecting the entry of a person into the projection space area of the projector. However, the projector has a possibility that a person may look into the projection lens or the like before projection is stopped.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention is designed to overcome the foregoing problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a projector and the protector thereof having superior practicality and safety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A projector according to the present invention comprises projecting means for projecting an image on a screen; detecting means for detecting the presence or absence of an object in an area to be subjected to detection, which is a local space near an outer edge of a projection space area which projecting light emitted from the projecting means passes through; and controlling means for performing control so as to reduce the intensity of the projecting light from the projecting means when the detecting means detects an object in the area to be subjected to detection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">More specifically, it is desirable that the area to be subjected to detection is located near the outer edge of the projection space area and extends along the outer edge of the projection space area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A protector of a projector according to the present invention comprises detecting means for detecting the presence or absence of an object in an area to be subjected to detection, which is a local space near an outer edge of a projection space area which projecting light emitted from the projector passes through; and controlling means for performing control so as to reduce the intensity of the projecting light from the projector when the detecting means detects an object in the area to be subjected to detection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the projector or the protector thereof according to the present invention, the detecting means detects the passage of a person through the area to be subjected to detection before the person enters the projection space area, and the controlling means reduces the intensity of the projecting light from the projecting means. Therefore, the intensity of the projecting light is already reduced at the time when the person enters the projection space area. Moreover, the area to be subjected to detection is limited to the local space. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the detecting means from detecting an explaining person who stands near the screen, for example.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">[First embodiment]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1 shows a situation in which a projector <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention is in use. The projector <b>1</b> is configured so as to be placed on, for example, a desk <b>4</b> and to project an image on a screen <b>2</b> located at a remote position. A distance D between the projector <b>1</b> and the screen <b>2</b> is about 3 m, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2 shows a general configuration of the projector <b>1</b> shown in FIG. <b>1</b> and shows the projector <b>1</b> viewed from above. The projector <b>1</b> is a so-called three-panel type color projector using three liquid crystal light bulbs (liquid crystal panels) and comprises a lamp unit <b>10</b> for emitting substantially parallel rays of white light. A discharge tube having a substantially spherical shape, such as a metal halide lamp, is used as a light emitting source <b>10</b>A of the lamp unit <b>10</b>. The metal halide lamp is an improvement of a high pressure mercury lamp. The metal halide lamp comprises a housing made of silica glass or the like, and mercury vapor and other metal halide vapor sealed in the housing. The lamp unit <b>10</b> is driven by a lamp power source <b>10</b>C. The lamp power source <b>10</b>C is operated under output control of a general controller <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A parabolic mirror <b>10</b>B is located around the light emitting source <b>10</b>A of the lamp unit <b>10</b>. The parabolic mirror <b>10</b>B is an aspherical mirror formed by rotating a parabola around an axis of rotation. A dielectric multilayer for letting light in an ultraviolet region and an infrared region escape backward and for reflecting only visible light is formed on an inner surface of the parabolic mirror <b>10</b>B. Thus, the dielectric multilayer prevents heat from being transferred to a frontward optical system. A direction of a pencil of substantially parallel rays emitted from the lamp unit <b>10</b> is referred to as an X direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A UV-IR cut filter <b>11</b>, an R dichroic mirror <b>12</b>, a G dichroic mirror <b>13</b> and a total reflection mirror <b>14</b> are arranged in order along the direction (X direction) of the light emitted from the lamp unit <b>10</b>. The Uv-IR cut filter <b>11</b> cuts ultraviolet rays and infrared rays of the white light from the lamp unit <b>10</b> and transmits only the visible light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">All of the R dichroic mirror <b>12</b>, the G dichroic mirror <b>13</b> and the total reflection mirror <b>14</b> are inclined at 45° relative to the direction (X direction) of the light emitted from the lamp unit <b>10</b>. The R dichroic mirror <b>12</b> reflects only R light (red light) of the light that has passed through the UV-IR cut filter <b>11</b>, and transmits G light (green light) and B light (blue light). The G dichroic mirror <b>13</b> reflects only the G light of the light (the G light and the B light) that has passed through the R dichroic mirror <b>12</b>, and transmits the B light. The total reflection mirror <b>14</b> reflects all of the B light that has passed through the G dichroic mirror <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A total reflection mirror <b>16</b> for reflecting the reflected R light in the direction parallel to the direction (X direction) of the light emitted from the lamp unit <b>10</b> is located in an optical path of the R light reflected by the R dichroic mirror <b>12</b>. A total reflection mirror <b>15</b> for reflecting the reflected B light in the direction opposite to the direction (X direction) of the light emitted from the lamp unit <b>10</b> is located in an optical path of the B light reflected by the total reflection mirror <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A dichroic prism <b>20</b> for combining light of three colors and letting the combined light exit therethrough is located at the position at which the R light, the G light and the B light reflected by the total reflection mirror <b>16</b>, the G dichroic mirror <b>13</b> and the total reflection mirror <b>15</b>, respectively, join one another. The dichroic prism <b>20</b> comprises four rectangular prisms bonded to one another, and dielectric multilayers are formed on bonded surfaces. The dichroic prism <b>20</b> has three planes of incidence <b>20</b>R, <b>20</b>G and <b>20</b>B which the R light, the G light and the B light reflected by the total reflection mirror <b>16</b>, the G dichroic mirror <b>13</b> and the total reflection mirror <b>15</b>, respectively, enter through, and a plane of exit <b>20</b>E for combining the light of three colors and letting the combined light exit therethrough.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An R liquid crystal light bulb <b>17</b>, a G liquid crystal light bulb <b>18</b> and a B liquid crystal light bulb <b>19</b> for applying space modulation to incident light in response to an image signal for each color are located adjacent to the planes of incidence <b>20</b>R, <b>20</b>G and <b>20</b>B of the dichroic prism <b>20</b>, respectively. The R liquid crystal light bulb <b>17</b> applies space modulation to the R light reflected by the total reflection mirror <b>16</b> in response to an R image signal. The G liquid crystal light bulb <b>18</b> applies space modulation to the G light reflected by the G dichroic mirror <b>13</b> in response to a G image signal. The B liquid crystal light bulb <b>19</b> applies space modulation to the B light reflected by the total reflection mirror <b>15</b> in response to a B image signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A projection lens <b>22</b> for projecting the light combined by the dichroic prism <b>20</b> onto the screen <b>2</b> is located adjacent to the exit plane <b>20</b>E of the dichroic prism <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the projector <b>1</b>, the white light emitted from the lamp unit <b>10</b> is separated into the light of three colors, i.e., R, G and B by the R dichroic mirror <b>12</b> and the G dichroic mirror <b>13</b>. When the R light, the G light and the B light pass through the R liquid crystal light bulb <b>17</b>, the G liquid crystal light bulb <b>18</b> and the B liquid crystal light bulb <b>19</b>, respectively, the R light, the G light and the B light are subjected to space intensity modulation in response to the image signals for R, G and B, respectively. Modulated color images are combined into one image by the dichroic prism <b>20</b>. The combined image is projected as a color image on the screen <b>2</b> by the projection lens <b>22</b>. A section of the projector <b>1</b> between the lamp unit <b>10</b> and the projection lens <b>22</b> corresponds to a specific example of “projecting means” of the present invention. A space area (hereinafter referred to as a projection space area) P, which the light to be projected on the screen <b>2</b> by the projection lens <b>22</b> passes through, corresponds to a specific example of “a projection space area” of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> for performing detection in local spaces adjacent to the projection space area P as areas to be subjected to detection are located on both left and right sides of the projection lens <b>22</b>. The sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> correspond to a specific example of “detecting means” of the present invention. In the following description, the side of the screen <b>2</b> viewed from the side of the projector <b>1</b> is defined as “the frontward side”, and “the left side” and “the right side” are defined relative to “the frontward side”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3 illustrates the principle of detection of a subject by the left sensor <b>5</b>. The sensor <b>5</b> comprises a light emitting device <b>51</b> for emitting an infrared beam, and a photodetector <b>52</b> for detecting the infrared beam reflected from a subject S of detection. The light emitting device <b>51</b> comprises an infrared light emitting diode (IRED), for example. The photodetector <b>52</b> comprises a phototransistor. In the embodiment, the light emitting device <b>51</b> and the photodetector <b>52</b> are vertically arranged. However, the light emitting device <b>51</b> and the photodetector <b>52</b> can be horizontally arranged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 3, a projection lens <b>53</b> for changing diverging rays emitted from the light emitting device <b>51</b> into substantially parallel rays of light is located on the light emitting side of the light emitting device. A condenser lens <b>54</b> for focusing the returned light (substantially parallel rays of light) reflected by the subject S of detection on a photo-detection plane <b>52</b>A of the photodetector <b>52</b> is located on the light incidence side of the photodetector <b>52</b> which the light enters through. The projection lens <b>53</b> and the condenser lens <b>54</b> are each composed of an aspherical lens, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The photo-detection plane <b>52</b>A of the photodetector <b>52</b> has an area (a vertical length in FIG. 3) large enough to detect reflected light R<b>1</b> from a subject S<b>1</b> of detection located immediately close to the sensor <b>5</b>, reflected light R<b>2</b> from a subject S<b>2</b> of detection located at a distance L<b>1</b> from the sensor <b>5</b> and reflected light R from the subject S of detection located between the subject S<b>1</b> of detection and the subject S<b>2</b> of detection. When the distance between the sensor <b>5</b> and the subject S of detection exceeds the predetermined value L<b>1</b>, the reflected light from the subject S of detection goes off the photo-detection plane <b>52</b>A of the photodetector <b>52</b>. That is, the area to be subjected to detection by the sensor <b>5</b> is a limited space ranging between the sensor <b>5</b> and a location the predetermined distance L<b>1</b> from the sensor <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 4 illustrates the principle of operation of the photodetector <b>52</b>. The photodetector <b>52</b> comprises a phototransistor in which voltage Vc is applied to between a collector and an emitter through a resistor R, for example. When a base is irradiated with light, a collector current Ic passes through the base due to a photovoltaic effect and an amplification effect. Output voltage Vout is equal to Vc under no irradiation with light. However, the output voltage Vout is changed to Vc−Ic·R under irradiation with light. In other words, output of the photodetector <b>52</b> is changed from H (High) level to L (Low) level under irradiation with light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The right sensor <b>6</b> operates on the same principle as the principle of the abovedescribed left sensor <b>5</b>. As shown in FIG. 2, the left and right sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> are inclined at a predetermined angle relative to an optical axis Ax of the projection lens <b>22</b>. Thus, the direction of the light emitted from the respective light emitting devices <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> (shown in FIG. 5) of the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> extends along the direction in which an outer edge of the projection space area P extends. A distance D<b>1</b> between the projector <b>1</b> and the farthest end of an area A to be subjected to detection is expressed as a distance along the optical axis Ax of the projection lens <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 2, the intensity of projecting light from the projector <b>1</b> is expressed as luminous flux that is one of photometric values. For example, when the intensity of the projecting light is equal to 2000 lm (lumen), the distance D<b>1</b> between the projector <b>1</b> and the farthest end of the area A to be subjected to detection along the direction of the optical axis Ax of the projection lens <b>22</b> (hereinafter referred to as the direction to the screen) is set at 2 m, for instance. Experiments and so on show that, when the luminous flux of the light emitted from the projector <b>1</b> is equal to 2000 lm, a person suffers little damage to his/her eyes even if he/she looks into the projection lens <b>22</b> of the projector <b>1</b> at a distance of 2 m or more from the projector <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a control system of the projector <b>1</b> according to the embodiment. The lamp power source <b>10</b>C, a pair of left and right sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, a power switch <b>7</b> and a reset switch <b>8</b> are connected to the general controller <b>30</b> of the projector <b>1</b>. A light bulb controller <b>9</b> for controlling driving of the liquid crystal light bulbs <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> is also connected to the general controller <b>30</b>, but the detailed description of the light bulb controller <b>9</b> is omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The general controller <b>30</b> has an output controller <b>31</b> comprising a CPU (central processing unit), for example. Upon receipt of an ON signal <b>70</b> from the power switch <b>7</b>, the output controller <b>31</b> outputs a lamp control signal <b>71</b> to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C and outputs a light emission start signal <b>73</b> to the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> simultaneously with output of the lamp control signal <b>71</b>. The lamp control signal <b>71</b> is a signal for allowing the lamp unit <b>10</b> (see FIG. 2) to emit light at 2 kW, for example. The light emission start signal <b>73</b> is a signal for driving the light emitting devices <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> of the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> and thereby allowing the light emitting devices <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> to emit an infrared beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The general controller <b>30</b> has an AND gate <b>33</b> for ANDing photo-detection signals <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> from the photodetectors <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> of the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. An output terminal of the AND gate <b>33</b> is connected to the output controller <b>31</b> so that the AND of the photo-detection signals from the photodetectors <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> of the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> may be captured in the output controller <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The reset switch <b>8</b> connected to the general controller <b>30</b> is operated in order to again turn on the lamp power source <b>10</b>C once turned off. Upon receipt of a reset signal <b>77</b> from the reset switch <b>8</b>, the output controller <b>31</b> restarts outputting the lamp control signal to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C. The general controller <b>30</b> configured as described above corresponds to a specific example of “controlling means” of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The left sensor <b>5</b> comprises a switch <b>56</b> for turning on or off the light emitting device <b>51</b>, and a light emission power supply <b>55</b> for supplying power to the light emitting device <b>51</b>. Similarly, the right sensor <b>6</b> comprises a switch <b>66</b> for turning on or off the light emitting device <b>61</b>, and a light emission power supply <b>65</b> for supplying power to the light emitting device <b>61</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, operation of the projector <b>1</b> configured as described above will be described. When a user turns on the power switch <b>7</b> of the projector <b>1</b>, the output controller <b>31</b> of the general controller <b>30</b> outputs the lamp control signal <b>71</b> to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C and thus the lamp unit <b>10</b> (see FIG. 2) starts emitting white light. Moreover, the output controller <b>31</b> transmits a control start signal <b>72</b> to the light bulb controller <b>9</b>. Thus, the light bulb controller <b>9</b> starts capturing image data from external equipment (a computer or the like), controlling driving of the liquid crystal light bulbs <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When driving control of the lamp unit <b>10</b> and the light bulb controller <b>9</b> is started, the white light emitted from the lamp unit <b>10</b> shown in FIG. 2 is separated into the light of three colors, i.e., R, G and B by the R dichroic mirror <b>12</b> and the G dichroic mirror <b>13</b>. When the R light, the G light and the B light pass through the R liquid crystal light bulb <b>17</b>, the G liquid crystal light bulb <b>18</b> and the B liquid crystal light bulb <b>19</b>, respectively, the R light, the G light and the B light are subjected to space intensity modulation in response to the image signals for R, G and B, respectively. Modulated color images are combined into one image by the dichroic prism <b>20</b>. The combined image is projected as a color image on the screen <b>2</b> by the projection lens <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, the output controller <b>31</b> outputs the light emission start signal <b>73</b> to the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> substantially simultaneously with transmission of the lamp control signal <b>71</b> to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C. In the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, the switches <b>56</b> and <b>66</b> are turned on in accordance with the light emission start signal <b>73</b> from the output controller <b>31</b>, and thus the light emission power supplies <b>55</b> and <b>65</b> supply power to the light emitting devices <b>51</b> and <b>61</b>, respectively. Thus, the light emitting devices <b>51</b> and <b>61</b> of the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> start emitting an infrared beam. When not detecting the reflected light from the subject of detection, the photodetectors <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> of the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> output a H-level voltage signal as the photo-detection signals <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> to the AND gate <b>33</b> of the general controller <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When a person enters the area A (see FIG. 2) to be subjected to detection by the sensor <b>5</b>, the infrared beam emitted from the light emitting device <b>51</b> strikes the person and thus the reflected infrared beam enters into the photodetector <b>52</b>. When the photodetector <b>52</b> detects the infrared beam, the photodetector <b>52</b> outputs a L-level voltage signal as the photo-detection signal <b>74</b> to the AND gate <b>33</b> of the general controller <b>30</b>. When a person enters the area A (see FIG. 2) to be subjected to detection by the sensor <b>6</b>, the infrared beam emitted from the light emitting device <b>61</b> strikes the person and thus the reflected infrared beam enters into the photodetector <b>62</b>. When the photodetector <b>62</b> detects the infrared beam, the photodetector <b>62</b> outputs a L-level voltage signal as the photo-detection signal <b>75</b> to the AND gate <b>33</b> of the general controller <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When an input signal from at least one of the photodetectors <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> (i.e., either the photo-detection signal <b>74</b> or <b>75</b>) enters L level, the AND gate <b>33</b> outputs a L-level signal to the output controller <b>31</b>. Upon receipt of the L-level signal from the AND gate <b>33</b>, the output controller <b>31</b> determines that “a person enters the area A to be subjected to detection” and outputs a stop signal to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C. The stop signal causes the lamp power source <b>10</b>C to be turned off, and thus the lamp unit <b>10</b> (see FIG. 2) stops emitting the white light. That is, the projector <b>1</b> stops projecting, and thus the projecting light goes out. Instead of the stop of light emission of the lamp unit <b>10</b>, the intensity of the projecting light may be reduced to, for example, about ⅓ by reducing the quantity of light to be emitted from the lamp unit <b>10</b> to, for example, about ⅓.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The reset switch <b>8</b> is turned on in order that the projector <b>1</b> restarts projecting. When the reset switch <b>8</b> is turned on, the output controller <b>31</b> receives the reset signal <b>77</b>, again outputs the lamp control signal <b>71</b> to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C and outputs the light emission start signal <b>73</b> to the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. In this manner, the projector <b>1</b> restarts projecting an image on the screen <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, the projector <b>1</b> according to the embodiment stops projecting as soon as a person enters the area A to be subjected to detection adjacent to the outside of the projection space area P. Therefore, the projector <b>1</b> further improves safety as compared to a projector which stops projecting only after a person enters the projection space area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Moreover, the area A to be subjected to detection is limited to a local range (which is shorter than the distance between the projector <b>1</b> and the screen <b>2</b>). Thus, the projector <b>1</b> does not detect an explaining person <b>3</b> who is near the screen <b>2</b> as shown in FIG. 1, and does not stop projecting. Accordingly, the projector <b>1</b> is prevented from unnecessarily stopping projecting, and therefore practicality improves thereby.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the embodiment, the output of the lamp unit <b>10</b> is about 2 kW, and the luminous flux of the projecting light is about 2000 lm. However, the output of the lamp unit <b>10</b> may be about 500 W, and the luminous flux of the projecting light may be about 500 lm. In this case, it is preferable that the maximum detection distance DI between the projector <b>1</b> and the farthest end of the area A to be subjected to detection is reduced (to about 0.8 m, for example) in accordance with a reduction in the intensity of the projecting light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 6 shows a modification of the embodiment. FIG. 6 shows a situation viewed from the side. In the modification, areas B and B′ to be subjected to detection are located over and under the projection space area P, respectively. Such a configuration allows the projector <b>1</b> to stop projecting when a person enters the projection space area P from over or under the projection space area P. When a person is hardly likely to enter the projection space area P from under the projection space area P, the length of the lower area BB to be subjected to detection may be shorter than that of the upper area B to be subjected to detection. In addition to the provision of the above-mentioned area A to be subjected to detection (see FIG. 2) on the left and right sides of the projection space area P, the areas B and BB to be subjected to detection may be provided over and under the projection space area P, respectively. Such a configuration allows the projector <b>1</b> to stop projecting even when a person enters the projection space area P from any direction, i.e., over or under the projection space area P or the left or right side of the projection space area P. The length of the maximum detection distance D<b>1</b> of the left area A to be subjected to detection may differ from the length of the maximum detection distance D<b>1</b> of the right area A to be subjected to detection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">[Second embodiment]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a projector according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the second embodiment, the intensity of the projecting light from the projector (the output of the lamp unit) is variable, and areas to be subjected to detection by sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> are changed in accordance with the intensity of the projecting light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the projector according to the second embodiment, the output of the lamp unit <b>10</b> (see FIG. 2) can be set in three levels, e.g., at 2 kW, 1 kW and 500 W. In accordance with each output of the lamp unit <b>10</b> (see FIG. <b>2</b>), the intensity (luminous flux) of the projecting light from the projector is 2000 lm, 1000 lm and 500 lm at, for example, 2 kW, 1 kW and 500 W, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 7 shows the areas to be subjected to detection by the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> of the projector according to the second embodiment. Each of the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> has three areas A, B and C to be subjected to detection, which differ from one another in the distance between the projector and the farthest end of the area to be subjected to detection. The distance D<b>1</b> between the projector <b>1</b> and the farthest end of the area A to be subjected to detection is set at 2 m, for example. A distance D<b>2</b> between the projector <b>1</b> and the farthest end of the area B to be subjected to detection is set at 1.4 m, for example. A distance D<b>3</b> between the projector <b>1</b> and the farthest end of the area C to be subjected to detection is set at 0.8 m, for example. All of the areas A, B and C to be subjected to detection are located on the outside of the projection space area P and extend along the projection space area P.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above-mentioned distances D<b>1</b> (2 m), D<b>2</b> (1.4 m) and D<b>3</b> (0.8 m) between the projector <b>1</b> and the farthest ends of the areas A, B and C to be subjected to detection are set in accordance with the luminous flux of the projecting light from the projector, i.e., 2000 lm, 1000 lm and 500 lm, respectively. Experiments and so on show that, when the luminous flux of the projecting light is 2000 lm, 1000 lm and 500 lm, a person suffers little damage to his/her eyes even if he/she looks into the projection lens <b>22</b> of the projector at a distance of 2 m or more, 1.4 m or more and 0.8 m or more from the projector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 8A to <b>8</b>C are illustrations of the configuration of the sensor <b>50</b> and the principle of operation thereof. The sensor <b>50</b> is configured in the same manner as the sensor <b>5</b> (see FIG. 3) according to the first embodiment except that the sensor <b>50</b> comprises a light emitting device array <b>510</b>. The light emitting device array <b>510</b> of the sensor <b>50</b> comprises, for example, a vertical array of three light emitting devices <b>51</b>A, <b>51</b>B and <b>51</b>C, each of which is made of an infrared light emitting diode (IRED), for instance. The light emitting device <b>51</b>A is located on an optical axis <b>53</b> <i>x </i>of the projection lens <b>53</b>. The light emitting device <b>51</b>B adjacent to the light emitting device <b>51</b>A is located slightly away from the optical axis <b>53</b> <i>x. </i>The light emitting device <b>51</b>C is located farthest from the optical axis <b>53</b> <i>x. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 8A, when the light emitting device <b>51</b>A emits an infrared beam, the maximum distance L<b>1</b> between the sensor <b>50</b> and the subject S of detection, at which reflected light can be detected by the photo-detection plane <b>52</b>A of the photodetector <b>52</b>, is equal to the distance L<b>1</b> of the first embodiment shown in FIG. <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 8B, when the light emitting device <b>51</b>B emits an infrared beam, the infrared beam travels while being inclined at an angle corresponding to the deviation of the light emitting device <b>51</b>B from the optical axis <b>53</b> <i>x </i>of the projection lens <b>53</b>. Therefore, a maximum distance L<b>2</b> between the sensor <b>50</b> and the subject S of detection, at which reflected light can be detected by the photo-detection plane <b>52</b>A of the photodetector <b>52</b>, is shorter than the distance L<b>1</b> shown in FIG. <b>8</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 8C, when the light emitting device <b>51</b>C emits an infrared beam, the infrared beam travels while being further inclined, because the light emitting device <b>51</b>C is located farthest from the optical axis <b>53</b> <i>x </i>of the projection lens <b>53</b>. Therefore, a maximum distance L<b>3</b> between the sensor <b>50</b> and the subject S of detection, at which reflected light can be detected by the photo-detection plane <b>52</b>A of the photodetector <b>52</b>, is still shorter than the distance L<b>2</b> shown in FIG. <b>8</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In other words, the sensor <b>50</b> of the second embodiment can have three types of areas to be subjected to detection by selectively using the three light emitting devices <b>51</b>A, <b>51</b>B and <b>51</b>C which differ from one another in the distance between the light emitting device and the optical axis <b>53</b> <i>x </i>of the projection lens <b>53</b>. Incidentally, the configuration of the right sensor <b>60</b> is identical to that of the above-mentioned left sensor <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 9 is a block diagram of a control system of the projector of the second embodiment. The same components as the components of the first embodiment are indicated by the same reference numerals, and the description thereof is omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An output setting knob <b>25</b> for setting the output of the lamp unit <b>10</b> in three levels, e.g., at 2 kW, 1 kW and 500 W is connected to the general controller <b>30</b>. A lamp output setting signal <b>80</b> is inputted to the output controller <b>31</b> of the general controller <b>30</b> through an A/D converter <b>34</b> by operating the output setting knob <b>25</b>. The output controller <b>31</b> is configured so as to output the lamp control signal <b>71</b> to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C of the lamp unit <b>10</b> in accordance with the lamp output setting signal <b>80</b>. The general controller <b>30</b> has an output level decision section <b>32</b> for deciding the level of the output of the lamp unit <b>10</b>. The output level decision section <b>32</b> is configured so as to monitor the lamp control signal <b>71</b> transmitted from the output controller <b>31</b> to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C, to decide the lamp output in three levels in accordance with the lamp control signal <b>71</b> and to output a select signal <b>82</b> to the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> in accordance with the result of decision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The left sensor <b>50</b> comprises a select switch <b>58</b> for selecting one of the three light emitting devices <b>61</b>A, <b>51</b>B and <b>51</b>C of the light emitting device array <b>510</b> in accordance with the select signal <b>82</b>, and the light emission power supply <b>55</b> for supplying power to the light emitting device selected by the select switch <b>58</b>. Similarly, the right sensor <b>60</b> comprises a select switch <b>68</b> for selecting one of three light emitting devices <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B and <b>61</b>C of a light emitting device array <b>610</b> in accordance with the select signal <b>82</b>, and the light emission power supply <b>65</b> for supplying power to the light emitting device selected by the select switch <b>68</b>. The sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> select one of the light emitting devices <b>51</b>A, <b>51</b>B and <b>51</b>C and one of the light emitting devices <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B and <b>61</b>C, respectively, in accordance with the select signal from the output controller <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The general controller <b>30</b> also has the AND gate <b>33</b> for ANDing the photo-detection signals <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> from the photodetectors <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> of the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>. The output terminal of the AND gate <b>33</b> is connected to the output controller <b>31</b> so that the AND of the photo-detection signals <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> from the photodetectors <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> of the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> may be captured in the output controller <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the light emitting devices <b>51</b>A, <b>51</b>B and <b>51</b>C of the light emitting device array <b>510</b> are, in fact, vertically arranged as shown in FIGS. 8A to <b>8</b>C, the light emitting devices <b>51</b>A, <b>51</b>B and <b>51</b>C are shown as horizontally arranged in FIG. <b>9</b>. Similarly, the light emitting devices <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B and <b>61</b>C of the light emitting device array <b>610</b> are, in fact, vertically arranged, but the light emitting devices <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B and <b>61</b>C are shown as horizontally arranged in FIG. <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, operation of the projector according to the second embodiment will be described. When a user turns on the power switch <b>7</b> of the projector, the general controller <b>30</b> of the projector <b>1</b> outputs the lamp control signal <b>71</b> to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C in accordance with the lamp output setting signal <b>80</b> generated by operating the output setting knob <b>25</b>. The output level decision section <b>32</b> monitors the lamp control signal <b>71</b>, decides the output of the lamp unit <b>10</b> in three levels and outputs the select signal <b>82</b> to the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, the output controller <b>31</b> transmits the control start signal <b>72</b> to the light bulb controller <b>9</b>. Thus, the light bulb controller <b>9</b> starts capturing image data from external equipment (a computer or the like), controlling driving of the R, G and B liquid crystal light bulbs <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, and so on. When driving control of the lamp unit <b>10</b> and the light bulb controller <b>9</b> is started, a color image is projected on the screen <b>2</b> by the projection lens <b>22</b> in the same manner as the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>, the select switches <b>58</b> and <b>68</b> operate in accordance with the select signal <b>82</b> from the output controller <b>31</b> and select one light emitting device of the light emitting device array <b>510</b> and one light emitting device of the light emitting device array <b>610</b>, respectively. Thus, the light emission power supplies <b>55</b> and <b>65</b> supply power to the selected light emitting devices. Thus, one of the light emitting devices <b>51</b>A, <b>51</b>B and <b>51</b>C of the light emitting device array <b>510</b> starts emitting an infrared beam, and one of the light emitting devices <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B and <b>61</b>C of the light emitting device array <b>610</b> starts emitting an infrared beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is now assumed that the light emitting devices <b>51</b>B and <b>61</b>B of the light emitting device arrays <b>510</b> and <b>610</b> are selected. In this case, the area to be subjected to detection is the area B to be subjected to detection (see FIG. <b>7</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When a person enters the area B (see FIG. 7) to be subjected to detection by the sensor <b>50</b>, the infrared beam emitted from the light emitting device <b>51</b>B strikes the person and thus the reflected infrared beam enters into the photodetector <b>52</b>. When the photodetector <b>52</b> detects the infrared beam, the photodetector <b>52</b> outputs a L-level voltage signal as the photo-detection signal <b>74</b> to the AND gate <b>33</b> of the general controller <b>30</b>. When a person enters the area B (see FIG. 7) to be subjected to detection by the sensor <b>60</b>, the infrared beam emitted from the light emitting device <b>61</b>B strikes the person and thus the reflected infrared beam enters into the photodetector <b>62</b>. When the photodetector <b>62</b> detects the infrared beam, the photodetector <b>62</b> outputs an L-level voltage signal as the photo-detection signal <b>75</b> to the AND gate <b>33</b> of the general controller <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When an input signal (the photo-detection signal) from at least one of the photodetectors <b>52</b> and <b>62</b> enters L level, the AND gate <b>33</b> outputs an L-level signal to the output controller <b>31</b>. Upon receipt of the L-level signal from the AND gate <b>33</b>, the output controller <b>31</b> determines that “a person enters the area B to be subjected to detection” and outputs a stop signal to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C. The stop signal causes the lamp power source <b>10</b>C to be turned off, and thus the lamp unit <b>10</b> (see FIG. 2) stops emitting the white light. That is, the projector stops projecting, and thus the projecting light goes out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the light emitting devices <b>51</b>A and <b>61</b>A emit an infrared beam (i.e., when the area A to be subjected to detection is selected), and when the light emitting devices <b>51</b>C and <b>61</b>C emit an infrared beam (i.e., when the area C to be subjected to detection is selected), the same processing of stopping projection takes place. Instead of the stop of emission of white light of the lamp unit <b>10</b>, the luminous flux of the projecting light from the projector may be reduced to, for example, about ⅓ by reducing the quantity of light to be emitted from the lamp unit <b>10</b> to, for example, about ⅓.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The reset switch <b>8</b> is turned on in order that the projector restarts projecting. When the reset switch <b>8</b> is turned on, the output controller <b>31</b> receives the reset signal <b>77</b>, again outputs the lamp control signal <b>71</b> to the lamp power source <b>10</b>C and outputs the select signal <b>82</b> to the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>. In this manner, the projector restarts projecting an image on the screen <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, the projector according to the embodiment selects the length (maximum detection distance) of the area to be subjected to detection in accordance with the intensity of the projecting light. Therefore, the projector can further improve practicality while keeping greater safety. Assume that the maximum detection distance of the area to be subjected to detection by the sensor is fixed. In this case, when the intensity of the projecting light is increased in order to improve luminance of an image, even a person who is out of the area to be subjected to detection may suffer damage to his/her eyes. When the intensity of the projecting light is reduced in order to improve luminance of an image, the maximum detection distance of the area to be subjected to detection becomes longer than necessary. Thus, the sensor detects even a person who is at a position that does not inherently require detecting. As a result, a protector operates unnecessarily. On the other hand, according to the embodiment, the maximum detection distance of the area to be subjected to detection by the sensor is changed in accordance with the intensity of the projecting light. Thus, a problem, which arises in the case of a fixed maximum detection distance, does not arise. Therefore, the projector according to the embodiment can more reliably ensure safety and can ensure more practical operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the embodiment, the maximum detection distance is changed in three levels in accordance with the intensity of the projecting light. However, the maximum detection distance may be changed in two levels, or in four levels or more. Furthermore, the maximum detection distance may be changed smoothly rather than in levels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the present invention has been described above by referring to some embodiments, the invention is not limited to these embodiments and various modifications of the invention are possible. For example, a movable shutter, which shields the projecting light from the projection lens <b>22</b> when the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> (or the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>) detect a person, may be provided on a front face of the projection lens <b>22</b> of the projector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Instead of stopping of projection of the projector, a voice message, e.g., “watch out” may be outputted when the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> (or the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>) detect a person. A detection off switch for preventing the sensors <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> (or the sensors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>) from operating may be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the projector and the protector thereof described above, detecting means detects the presence or absence of an object in a local space near an outer edge of a projection- space area which projecting light emitted from the projector passes through. Thus, a sensor does not detect a person who does not require detecting (e.g., an explaining person who is near the screen), and therefore the projector does not unnecessarily stop projecting. As a result, an effect of improving practicality is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments chosen for purpose of illustration, it should be apparent that numerous modifications could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the basic concept and scope of the invention.</div>
