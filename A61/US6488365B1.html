<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a liquid discharging head for discharging desired liquid by generating a bubble formed by applying thermal energy to the liquid, and more particularly, it relates to a liquid discharging head having a movable member displaced by generating a bubble, a head cartridge having such a liquid discharging head, and a liquid discharging apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention is applicable to recording apparatuses such as printers for effecting the recording on a recording medium such as a paper sheet, a thread sheet, a fiber sheet, a cloth, a leather sheet, a metal sheet, a plastic sheet, glass, wood, ceramic sheet and the like, copying machines, facsimiles having a communication system, and word processors having a printer portion, and to industrial recording apparatuses combined with various processing devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, in this specification and claims, a term “recording” means not only application of a significant image such as a character or a figure onto a recording medium but also application of a meaningless image such as a pattern onto a recording medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Related Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is already known to provide an ink jet recording method, i.e., so-called bubble jet recording method in which change in state of ink including abrupt change in volume (generation of a bubble) is caused by applying energy such as heat to the ink and the ink is discharged from a discharge port by an acting force based on the change in state to adhere the ink onto a recording medium, thereby forming an image on the recording medium. As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,723,129, a recording apparatus using such a bubble jet recording method generally includes discharge ports for discharging ink, ink passages communicated with the discharge ports, and electrothermal converters as energy generating means disposed in the liquid passages and adapted to generate energy for discharging the ink.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to such a recording method, a high quality image can be recorded at a high speed with less noise, and, in a head carrying out this method, since the discharge ports for discharging the ink can be arranged with high density, a recorded image having high resolving power and a color image can easily be obtained by a compact recording apparatus. Thus, recently, the bubble jet recording method has been applied to many office equipments such as printers, copying machines, facsimiles and the like, and is also applied to industrial systems such as print apparatuses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the application of the bubble jet technique to various field is increased, the following various requirements have recently been desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, regarding the requirement of improvement in energy efficiency, a heat generating element has been optimized by adjusting a thickness of a protection film. This method is effective in the point that transfer efficiency of generated heat to liquid is enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in order to obtain a high quality image, there has been proposed a driving condition for providing a liquid discharging method capable of discharging the ink effectively at high speed due to stable bubble formation, and, in view of high speed recording, there has also been proposed the improvement in a liquid passage design to obtain a liquid discharging head in which liquid corresponding to discharged liquid can be refilled to the liquid passages quickly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among various liquid passage designs, a liquid passage structure as shown in FIGS. 44A and 44B is disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 63-199972. The liquid passage structure and a head manufacturing method disclosed in the above Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 63-199972 are inventions based on a back-wave (pressure directing toward a direction opposite to a direction to the discharge port, i.e., pressure directing toward a liquid chamber <b>12</b>) generated due to bubble generation. The back-wave is known as loss energy, since it is not directed toward the discharge port.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention shown in FIGS. 44A and 44B includes valves <b>10</b> spaced apart from bubble generating areas of heat generating elements <b>2</b> and disposed opposite to discharge ports <b>11</b> with respect to the heat generating elements <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 44B, the valve <b>10</b> has an initial position where a leaf of the valve is contacted with a ceiling of a liquid passage <b>3</b>, and, when the bubble is generated, the leaf of the valve is suspended into the liquid passage <b>3</b>. In this technique, the energy loss is suppressed by controlling a part of the back-wave by means of the valves <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, with the above-mentioned arrangement, as can be understood from the observation of the case where the bubble is generated in the liquid passage <b>3</b> containing the liquid to be discharged, suppression of the part of the back-wave is not practical to the discharging of the liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned above, the back-wave itself does not relate to the liquid discharging directly. At the time when the back-wave is generated in the liquid passage <b>3</b>, as shown in FIG. 44A, a part of pressure of the bubble which directly relates to the liquid discharging already establishes a condition that the liquid can be discharged from the liquid passage <b>3</b>. Accordingly, it is apparent that, even when the part of the back-wave is suppressed, the suppression does not influence upon the liquid discharging greatly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, in the bubble jet recording method, since the heating of the heat generating element contacted with ink is repeated, ink deposit is accumulated on a surface of the heat generating element due to overheat of ink. Depending upon the kind of ink, a large amount of deposit is accumulated on the heat generating element, with the result that the generation of the bubble becomes unstable, thereby causing the poor ink discharging. Further, when the liquid to be discharged is easily deteriorated by heat or when liquid in which an adequate bubble is hard to be formed is used, it has been desired that the liquid to be discharged is not deteriorated and good liquid discharging is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In view of the above problems, there has been proposed a liquid discharging method wherein liquid (bubble liquid) in which a bubble is formed by heat is different from liquid (discharge liquid) which is to be discharged and the liquid is discharged by transmitting pressure generated by bubble formation to the discharge liquid, as disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 61-69467 and 55-81172, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,480,259. In such a method, the discharge liquid (ink) is completely isolated from the bubble liquid by a flexible diaphragm made of silicone rubber and the like to prevent the discharge liquid from directly contacting with the heat generating elements and the pressure generated by the bubble formed in the bubble liquid is transmitted to the discharge liquid by deformation of the flexible diaphragm. With this arrangement, the deposit can be prevented from being accumulated on the heat generating elements and degree of freedom of selection of the discharge liquid can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, in the arrangement in which the discharge liquid is completely isolated from the bubble liquid, since the pressure due to the formation of the bubble is transmitted to the discharge liquid by expansion/contraction deformation of the flexible diaphragm, the pressure of the bubble is greatly absorbed by flexible diaphragm. Further, since a deformation amount of the flexible diaphragm is not so great, although the advantage of separation between the discharge liquid and the bubble liquid can be obtained, energy efficiency and/or discharging ability may be worsened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention premises that fundamental discharging feature of a conventional method for discharging liquid by forming a bubble (particularly, bubble formed by film-boiling) in a liquid passage is improved to the extent that could not be considered by conventional techniques from the point of view which could not be supposed conventionally.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The premise is obtained by first technical analysis based on operation of a movable member in the liquid passage for analyzing the principle of a moving mechanism of the in the liquid passage to provide a new liquid discharging method utilizing a bubble (which could not be obtained in the conventional techniques) and a head used in such a method on the basis of the principle of the liquid discharging, second technical analysis based on the principle of the liquid discharging due to the formation of the bubble, and third analysis based on a bubble forming area of a bubble forming heat generating element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the basis of these analyses, by providing a positional relation between a fulcrum of the movable member and a free end of the movable member in such a manner that the free end is positioned near the discharge port, i.e., at a downstream side of the fulcrum, and by arranging the movable member in a confronting relation to the heat generating element or the bubble forming area, a new technique for positively controlling the bubble is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this new technique, it is most important that a downstream side growth portion of the bubble is considered in view of energy (which can be applied from the bubble itself to the liquid discharge) in order to improve the discharging feature or ability remarkably. That is to say, the discharging efficiency and discharging speed can greatly be improved by directing the downstream side growth portion of the bubble toward the discharging direction efficiently. The inventors proposed a high technical level (greatly higher than the conventional technical levels) in which the downstream side growth portion of the bubble is positively shifted toward the free end of the movable member. In the high technical level, it was found that it is preferable to consider structural factors of the movable member and the liquid passage associated with the growth of the bubble at a downstream side of the heat generating area for forming the bubble (for example, at a downstream side of a center line passing through a center of area of the electrothermal converter in the liquid flowing direction) or at a downstream side of a center of area of a surface for controlling the bubble formation, and that a refilling speed can greatly be increased by considering the arrangement of the movable member and the structure of the liquid supply passage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Particularly, the present invention aims to utilize the above-mentioned discharging principle more effectively and provides more stable discharging feature by improving the construction or arrangement of the movable member.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, the present invention may provide a liquid discharging head comprising a discharge port for discharging liquid, a first liquid passage communicated with the discharge port, a second liquid passage including a bubble generating area for generating a bubble in the liquid by applying heat, and a movable member disposed between the first liquid passage and the bubble generating area and adapted to be shifted toward the first liquid passage by pressure caused by generating the bubble at the bubble generating area to direct the pressure toward the discharge port and to be returned to its initial position by negative pressure due to contraction of the bubble, and wherein resistance of the movable member against the liquid in the first liquid passage when it is shifted is smaller than that when it is returned.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, the present invention may provide a head cartridge comprising the above-mentioned liquid discharging head, and a liquid container for containing the liquid to be supplied to the liquid discharging head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, the present invention may provide a liquid discharging apparatus comprising the above-mentioned liquid discharging head, and a drive signal supplying means for supplying a drive signal for discharging the liquid from the liquid discharging head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, the present invention may provide a liquid discharging apparatus comprising them above-mentioned liquid discharging head, and a recording medium conveying means for conveying a recording medium onto which the liquid discharged from the liquid discharging head is to be adhered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned above, according to the liquid discharging head of the present invention based on the new discharging principle, since the sides of the generated bubble are covered by the side members, the pressure directing to the directions transverse to the liquid flowing direction is also directed toward the liquid flowing direction. And, the bubble growing direction itself is also oriented toward the downstream side, with the result that the growth of the downstream bubble portion becomes greater than the growth of the upstream bubble portion. Consequently, since the liquid near the discharge port can efficiently be discharged toward the discharge port, the discharging efficiency can be improved in comparison with the conventional techniques. For example, in a most preferable embodiment of the present invention, the discharging efficiency could be improved by twice or more in comparison with the conventional techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Particularly, when the movable member has a flexible diaphragm including expansion/contraction portions constituting both sides of the movable member and the expansion/contraction portions are utilized as the side members, the displaced amount of the movable member is regulated by the expansion/contraction portions. As a result, since the degree of opening of the liquid passage near the discharge port caused by the displacement of the movable member becomes constant and bubble pressure acting toward the discharge port also becomes constant, the stable discharging can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the characteristic arrangement of the present invention, even if the head is placed under a low temperature condition and/or a low humidity condition for a long time. The poor discharging can be prevented. If the poor discharging occurs, merely by effecting a recovery treatment such as preliminary discharge and/or suction recovery, the normal condition can easily be restored.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specifically, even under a long term placement condition wherein many conventional bubble jet heads having 64 discharge ports occur the poor discharging, in the head of the present invention, only about a half or less of the discharge ports cause the poor discharging. Further, when such head is restored by the preliminary discharge, it was found that, in the conventional head, about 1000 preliminary discharges must be effected for each discharge port; whereas, in the head of the present invention, the head can be restored merely by about 100 preliminary discharges. This means that the recovery time and the liquid loss during the recovery operation can be reduced and the running cost can be reduced greatly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, according to the arrangement of the present invention in which the refilling feature is improved, the response in the continuous liquid discharging, stable growth of the bubble and stability of liquid droplets can be improved, thereby permitting high speed recording due to high speed liquid discharging and high quality image recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The other advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the detailed explanation of respective embodiments of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, in the specification and claims, the terms “upstream” and “downstream” are referred to regarding the liquid flowing direction from the liquid supply source through the bubble generating area (or movable member) to the discharge port, or the constructional direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the term “downstream side” regarding the bubble itself mainly means a discharge port side portion of the bubble directly relating the liquid discharging. More particularly, it means a bubble portion generated at a downstream of a center of the bubble in the liquid flowing direction or the constructural direction or at downstream of a center of the area of the heat generating element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in the specification and claims, the term “substantially closed” or “substantially sealed” means a condition that, when the bubble is growing, before the movable member is shifted, the bubble cannot escape through a gap (slit) at a downstream side of the movable member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the term “separation wall” means a wall (which may include the movable member) disposed to separate the bubble generating area from an area directly communicated with the discharge port in a broader sense, and means a wall for distinguishing the liquid passage including the bubble generating area from the liquid passage directly communicated with the discharge port and for preventing the mixing of the liquid in both liquid passages in a narrower sense.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">(First Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, a first embodiment of the present invention will be fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">First of all, in this embodiment, an example that a discharging force and discharging efficiency are improved by controlling a transmission direction of pressure caused by formation of a bubble and a growing direction of the bubble in order to discharge liquid will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 1A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D are sectional views of a liquid passage of a liquid discharging head according to the first embodiment, and FIG. 2 is a partial fragmental perspective view of the liquid discharging head. FIGS. 3A and 3B are schematic sectional views of the liquid discharging head according to the first embodiment, looked at from a discharge port side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid discharging head according to the illustrated embodiment includes an element substrate <b>1</b> on which a heat generating element <b>2</b> (heat generating resistance member having a dimension of 40 μm×105 μm, in the illustrated embodiment) for acting thermal energy on liquid (as discharge energy generating element for generating energy for discharging the liquid) is arranged, and a liquid passage <b>10</b> is formed above the element substrate <b>1</b> in correspondence to the heat generating element <b>2</b>. The liquid passage <b>10</b> communicates with a discharge port <b>18</b> and also communicated with a common liquid chamber <b>13</b> for supplying the liquid to a plurality of liquid passages <b>10</b>, and receives the liquid corresponding to the discharged liquid from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Within the liquid passage <b>10</b>, above the element substrate <b>1</b>, there is provided a movable member <b>31</b> formed from a flexible thin diaphragm made of resin and the like. The movable member is provided at its both sides with the expansion/contraction portion <b>60</b> and has a flat upper surface. One end of the movable member <b>31</b> and the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> are secured to a base (support member) <b>34</b> formed by patterning photosensitive resin on a wall of the liquid passage <b>10</b> and on the element substrate <b>1</b>. As a result, the movable member <b>31</b> is held in such a manner that the upper surface of the member can be displaced around a fulcrum (support portion) <b>33</b> at its one end as the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> are expanded and contracted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The movable member <b>31</b> has the fulcrum <b>33</b> positioned at an upstream side of large flow of liquid flowing from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> through the movable member <b>31</b> to the discharge port <b>18</b> and is opened at a downstream side of the fulcrum <b>33</b> to form the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> on its both sides and a free end (free end portion) <b>32</b> at its distal end and is disposed in a confronting relation to the heat generating element <b>2</b> to cover the heat generating element <b>2</b> and is spaced apart from the heat generating element <b>5</b> by about 15 μm. A bubble generating area <b>11</b> is defined between the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An example of a method for manufacturing the thin diaphragm having the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> will be explained with reference to FIGS. 4A, <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C. Here, an electroforming method will be described. First of all, a master mold <b>62</b> having projections <b>62</b> <i>a </i>corresponding to the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> as shown in FIG. 4A is prepared. Heights, configurations and number of the projections <b>62</b> <i>a </i>are determined to achieve a desired displacement amount in accordance with material and thickness of resin from which the thin diaphragm is formed. Then, as shown in FIG. 4B, resin such as polyimide as this diaphragm material <b>63</b> is coated on a surface of the master mold <b>62</b> on which the projections <b>62</b> <i>a </i>are formed. Then, the thin diaphragm material <b>63</b> is peeled from the master mold <b>62</b>, thereby obtaining the thin diaphragm having the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Kinds, configurations and dispositions of the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the movable member <b>31</b> are not limited to the above-mentioned ones, but, the heat generating element and the movable member may be configured and disposed to control the growth of the bubble and transmission of the pressure, which will be described later. Incidentally, for the explanation of a liquid flow which will be described later, the liquid passage <b>10</b> is explained to have a first liquid passage <b>14</b> (at one side of the movable member <b>31</b>) directly communicated with the discharge port <b>18</b> and a second liquid passage <b>16</b> (at the other side of the movable member) including the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and a liquid supply passage <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Heat is applied to the liquid in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> between the movable member <b>31</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> by heating the heat generating element <b>2</b>, and a bubble is formed in the liquid by a film-boiling phenomenon as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,723,129. Pressure caused by the formation of the bubble, and the bubble act on the movable member <b>31</b> preferentially to expand the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b>, with the result that the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced around the fulcrum <b>33</b> to be greatly opened toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, as shown in FIGS. 1B and 1C or FIG. <b>2</b>. By the displacement or a displaced condition of the movable member <b>31</b>, a transmitting direction of the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble and a growing direction of the bubble itself are oriented toward the discharge port <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, one of fundamental discharging principles of the present invention will be explained. The most important principle of the present invention is to displace or shift the movable member <b>31</b> (disposed in a confronting relation to the bubble) from a first positon (normal condition) to a second position (displaced condition) by the pressure of the bubble or the bubble itself, so that the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble and the bubble itself are oriented to a downstream side in which the discharge port <b>18</b> is disposed, by the displaced movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This principle will be fully explained while comparing FIG. 5 (schematically showing a structure of a conventional liquid passage not having the movable member <b>31</b>) and FIG. 6 (showing the present invention). Incidentally, here, the pressure transmitting direction toward the discharge port is shown by the arrows VA and a pressure transmitting direction toward the upstream side is shown by the arrows VB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the conventional head as shown in FIG. 5, there is no means for regulating a transmitting direction of the pressure caused by formation of a bubble <b>40</b>. Thus, the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> is transmitted toward various directions as shown by the arrows V<b>1</b>-V<b>8</b> perpendicular to a surface of the bubble. Among them, the pressure transmitting directions V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b> have components directing toward the direction VA which is most effective to the liquid discharging, and the pressure transmitting directions V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b> are positioned on a left half of the bubble near the discharge port and contribute to the liquid discharging efficiency, liquid discharging force and liquid discharging speed. Further, since the pressure transmitting direction V<b>1</b> is directed to the discharging direction VA, it is most effective; whereas, the pressure transmitting direction V<b>4</b> has smallest component directing toward the discharging direction VA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To the contrary, in the present invention shown in FIG. 6, the pressure transmitting directions V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b> which are directed to various directions in FIG. 5 are oriented toward the downstream side (i.e., toward the discharge port) by the movable member <b>31</b> (i.e., various pressure transmitting directions is converted to the downstream direction), with the result that the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> contributes to the liquid discharging directly and effectively. Further, as shown in FIG. 3B, since both sides of the bubble <b>40</b> is covered or regulated by the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b>, the pressure directing laterally of the liquid passage <b>10</b> can also be oriented toward the discharge port <b>18</b> by the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> of the movable member <b>31</b>. Similar to the pressure transmitting directions V<b>1</b>-V<b>4</b>, the growing direction of the bubble is directed toward the downstream side, with the result that the bubble is grown more greatly at the downstream side than at the upstream side. By controlling the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> itself and the pressure transmitting direction of the bubble <b>40</b> by means of the movable member <b>31</b>, the discharging efficiency, discharging force and discharging speed can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a discharging operation of the liquid discharging head according to the illustrated embodiment will be fully described with reference to FIGS. 1A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1A shows a condition before energy such as electrical energy is applied to the heat generating element <b>2</b>, i.e., before heat is generated from the heat generating element <b>2</b>. It is important that the movable member <b>31</b> is disposed in a confronting relation to at least a downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b> which will be formed by the heat from the heat generating element <b>2</b>. That is to say, the movable member <b>31</b> extends up to at least a position downstream of center <b>3</b> of an area of the heat generating element in the liquid passage (i.e., downstream of a line passing through the center <b>3</b> of the area of the heat generating element and extending perpendicular to the length of the liquid passage) so that the movable member <b>31</b> acts on the downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1B shows a condition that the heat generating element <b>2</b> is heated by applying the electrical energy to the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the bubble <b>40</b> is formed by the film-boiling caused by heating a portion of the liquid contained in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> by utilizing the heat from the heat generating element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced or shifted by the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble <b>40</b> from the first position to the second position to direct the pressure transmitting direction of the bubble <b>40</b> toward the discharge port. Further, at the same time, the expansion/contraction portion <b>60</b> are expanded so that the movable member <b>31</b> forms a liquid path directing from the upstream side (side of the common liquid chamber <b>13</b>) to the downstream side (side of the discharge port <b>18</b>). Here, it is important that, as mentioned above, the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> is disposed at the downstream side and the sides of the movable member are constituted by the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> so that the movable member is opened only toward the discharge port, and the fulcrum <b>33</b> is disposed at the upstream side and at least a portion of the movable member <b>31</b> is faced to the downstream portion of the heat generating element <b>2</b> (i.e., downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1C shows a condition that the bubble <b>40</b> is further growing and the movable member <b>31</b> is further displaced by the pressure caused by the growth of the bubble <b>40</b>. The generated bubble <b>40</b> is grown more greatly at the downstream side than at the upstream side, and the bubble is greatly grown to exceed the first position (shown by the dot and chain line) of the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 2, <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B, the movable member <b>31</b> is formed from the thin diaphragm having the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b>, and, since the fulcrum <b>33</b> and the both sides of the movable member are integrally secured to the element substrate <b>1</b> and the movable member is opened only toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, when the movable member <b>31</b> is gradually displaced as the bubble <b>40</b> is growing, the pressure transmitting direction of the bubble <b>40</b> is regulated to a direction toward which the pressure transmitting direction is apt to be oriented (i.e., to the free end opened toward the discharge port), with the result that the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> is uniformly oriented toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, thereby improving the discharging efficiency. When the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> and the pressure transmitting direction are oriented toward the discharge port, the movable member does not resist against such orientation, with the result that the pressure transmitting direction and the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> can be controlled efficiently in accordance with the magnitude of the pressure to be transmitted. Further, since the displacement amount of the movable member <b>31</b> is regulated by the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> so that the degree of opening of the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> during the displacement of the movable member becomes always constant, the bubble pressure acting on the first liquid passage <b>14</b> also becomes constant, thereby achieving the stable liquid discharging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1D shows a condition that the bubble <b>40</b> is contracted to be disappeared by reduction of pressure in the bubble (after the film-boiling).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The movable member <b>31</b> which was displaced to the second position is returned to an initial position shown in FIG. 1A (first position) by negative pressure due to contraction of the bubble <b>40</b>, elasticity of the movable member <b>31</b> itself and restoring ability of the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b>. Further, when the bubble is disappeared, in order to compensate the contracted volume of the bubble <b>40</b> at the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and to compensate the volume of the discharged liquid, the liquid flows into the bubble generating area from the upstream side (B), i.e., from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> as shown by the arrows V<sub>D1</sub>, V<sub>D2 </sub>and from the discharge port <b>18</b> as shown by the arrow V<sub>C</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the operation of the movable member <b>31</b> in response to the formation of the bubble <b>40</b> and the liquid discharging were explained, now, refilling of the liquid in the liquid discharging head of the present invention will be fully explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid supplying mechanism in the present invention will be fully described with reference to FIGS. 1A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the condition shown in FIG. 1C, when the bubble <b>40</b> is being contracted from the maximum volume condition, the liquid compensating the reduced bubble volume flows into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> from the discharge port <b>18</b> of the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> associated with the second liquid passage <b>16</b>. In the conventional liquid passage design not having the movable member <b>31</b>, an amount of liquid flowing toward the discharge port into the reduced bubble position and an amount of liquid flowing toward the common liquid chamber into the reduced bubble position depend upon flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the discharge port, and flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the common liquid chamber (i.e., depend upon resistance of the liquid passages and inertia of the liquid).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, when the flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the discharge port is smaller than the flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the common liquid chamber, the greater amount of liquid flow into the reduced bubble position, thereby increasing a retard amount of meniscus M. In particular, the smaller the flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the discharge port (to enhance the discharging efficiency), the greater the retard amount of the meniscus M, thereby increasing the refilling time to affect a bad influence upon the high speed recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To the contrary, in the illustrated embodiment, since the movable member <b>31</b> is provided, when it is assumed that a volume portion (above the first position) of the volume W of the bubble is W<b>1</b> and a volume portion (below the first position, i.e., toward the bubble generating area <b>11</b>) of the volume W of the bubble is W<b>2</b>, the retard of the meniscus M is stopped at the time when the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to its initial position during the reduction of the bubble. And, the liquid corresponding to the remaining volume W<b>2</b> is mainly supplied from the liquid flow V<sub>D2 </sub>in the second liquid passage <b>16</b>. In this way, the retard amount of the meniscus M can be suppressed to about a half of the volume portion W<b>1</b>; incidentally, in the conventional techniques, the retard amount of the meniscus M was about a half of the entire volume W of the bubble.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, since the liquid corresponding to the volume portion W<b>2</b> can forcibly be supplied mainly from the upstream side (V<sub>D2</sub>) along the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> by utilizing the negative pressure during the disappearance of the bubble, the refilling time can be shortened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the refill is effected by utilizing the negative pressure during the disappearance of the bubble in the conventional head, the fluctuation of the meniscus becomes great to cause the deterioration of the image quality. To the contrary, in the high speed refill according to the illustrated embodiment, since the flowing of the liquid in the first liquid passage near the discharge port into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> near the discharge port <b>18</b> is suppressed by the movable member <b>31</b>, the fluctuation of the meniscus M can be minimized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this way, according to the present invention, since the high speed refill is achieved by the forcible refill of the liquid into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> from the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> of the second liquid passage <b>16</b> and suppression of the retard or fluctuation of the meniscus, the stable liquid discharging and high speed repeat discharging can be realized, and, when applied to the recording field, the high quality image and high speed recording can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the arrangement according to the present invention, there is also provided the following effective function. That is to say, the transmission of the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble to the upstream side (back-wave) can be suppressed. The pressure of the bubble portion (near the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> (upstream side)) of the bubble <b>40</b> generated on the heat generating element <b>2</b> tends to push the liquid back to the upstream side (to cause the back-wave). The back-wave creates upstream pressure, upstream movement of the liquid and an inertia force due to the liquid movement, which resist the refill of the liquid into the liquid passage, thereby affecting a bad influence upon the high speed recording. In the present invention, since such upstream pressure, upstream liquid movement and inertia force can be suppressed by the movable member <b>31</b>, the refill ability can be further improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a further characteristic construction and advantage therefor in the illustrated embodiment will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The second liquid passage <b>16</b> according to the illustrated embodiment has the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> having an inner wall flatly contiguous to (i.e., flush with) the heat generating element <b>2</b> at the upstream side of the heat generating element <b>2</b>. In such a case, the supply of the liquid to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and the surface of the heat generating element <b>2</b> is effected along the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> (as flow V<sub>D2</sub>). Thus, stagnation of liquid on the heat generating element <b>2</b> is prevented, with the result that gas included in the liquid and the residual bubble can easily be removed and excessive accumulation of heat in the liquid can be avoided. Accordingly, more stable formation of bubble can be repeated at a high speed. Incidentally, in the illustrated embodiment, while an example that the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> has a substantially flat inner wall was explained, the inner wall of the liquid supply passage is not limited to such an example, but may have a gentle slope or other shape smoothly contiguous to the surface of the heat generating element to prevent the stagnation of liquid on the heat generating element and disturbance of the supplied liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By the way, regarding the positions of the free end <b>32</b> and the fulcrum <b>33</b> of the movable member <b>31</b>, for example, as shown in FIG. 7, the free end <b>32</b> is disposed at a downstream side of the fulcrum <b>33</b>. With this arrangement, when the bubble is being formed, the pressure transmitting direction and the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> can be oriented or directed toward the discharge port <b>18</b> effectively. Further, this positional relation not only contributes the improvement of the discharging efficiency or ability but also reduces flow resistance of the liquid flowing through the liquid passage <b>10</b> during the supply of liquid, thereby achieving the high speed refill. The reason is that, as shown in FIG. 7, when the meniscus M retarded due to the liquid discharging is restored toward the discharge port <b>18</b> by a capillary phenomenon and/or when the liquid is supplied to compensate the disappeared bubble, the free end <b>32</b> and the fulcrum <b>33</b> are arranged not to resist against the liquid flows S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> flowing in the liquid passage <b>10</b> (including the first and second liquid passages <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in FIGS. 1A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D, as mentioned above, regarding the heat generating element <b>2</b>, the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> extends up to the position downstream of the center <b>3</b> of the area of the heat generating element <b>2</b> (i.e., downstream of the line passing through the center of the area of the heat generating element and extending perpendicular to the length of the liquid passage <b>10</b>). Thus, the pressure and the downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b> which are generated at the downstream side of the center <b>3</b> of the area of the heat generating element and greatly contribute to the liquid discharging are supported by the movable member <b>31</b>, with the result that the pressure and the bubble portion <b>40</b> are directed toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, thereby improving the discharging efficiency and discharging force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, by utilizing the upstream portion of the bubble, various advantages can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in the illustrated embodiment, the momentary mechanical displacement of the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> also contributes to the improvement of the liquid discharging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Second Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 8 is a partial fragmental perspective view of a liquid discharging head according to a second embodiment of the present invention. FIGS. 9A and 9B are schematic sectional views of the liquid discharging head of FIG. 8, looked at from a discharge port side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this second embodiment, as is in the first embodiment, a movable member <b>31</b> is constituted by a thin diaphragm having expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> at its both sides and opened toward a discharge port <b>18</b>, and a cantilever portion <b>65</b> secured to an upper surface of the thin diaphragm (a zone of the diaphragm between the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b>) and having an upstream fulcrum <b>33</b> and a downstream free end <b>32</b>. The cantilever portion <b>65</b> is formed from a plate member made of material (for example, metal) having elasticity. The movable member <b>31</b> constituted by the thin diaphragm and the cantilever portion <b>65</b> is disposed in a confronting relation to a heat generating element <b>2</b> to cover the heat generating element <b>2</b> and is spaced apart from the heat generating element <b>2</b> by about 15 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With the arrangement as mentioned above, the free end <b>32</b> of the cantilever portion <b>65</b> is gradually displaced as a bubble <b>40</b> is growing, with the result that the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> of the thin diaphragm is gradually expanded. In this case, as shown in FIG. 9B, since the both sides of the cantilever portion <b>65</b> are covered by the diaphragm having the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b>, the pressure transmitting direction and the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> is directed toward the free end <b>32</b> of the cantilever portion <b>65</b> and the opening of the diaphragm having the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b>. Further, by using the cantilever portion <b>65</b>, the direction control and the shape restoring can be effected more effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Third Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 10 shows a third embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 10, “A” shows a condition that a movable member <b>31</b> is displaced (a bubble is not shown), and “B” shows a condition that the movable member <b>31</b> is positioned in an initial position (first position). In the condition B, a bubble generating area <b>11</b> is substantially closed or sealed with respect to a discharge port <b>18</b>. (Although not shown, there is a liquid passage wall between A and B to separate liquid passages from each other.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 10 has two bases <b>34</b> and a liquid supply passage <b>12</b> between the bases. With the arrangement, the liquid can be supplied along a surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to a heat generating element <b>2</b> from a liquid supply passage <b>12</b> having an inner surface flush with or smoothly contiguous to a surface of the heat generating element <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the initial position (first position) of the movable member <b>31</b>, the movable member <b>31</b> is adjacent to or closely contacted with a downstream wall <b>36</b> of the heat generating element disposed at a downstream end of the heat generating element <b>2</b>, and an end (toward the discharge port <b>18</b>) of a bubble generating area <b>11</b> is substantially sealed by the downstream wall <b>36</b> of the heat generating element and expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> of the movable member <b>31</b>. Thus, pressure of a bubble (particularly, downstream pressure of the bubble) can be concentrated and oriented toward a free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> without loss of the downstream portion of the bubble.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, when the bubble is disappeared, the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to the first position, and, when the liquid is supplied to compensate the disappeared bubble, since the side (near the discharge port <b>18</b>) of the bubble generating area <b>11</b> is substantially sealed, the suppression of the retard of the meniscus and the like can be achieved, as is in the former embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in the illustrated embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 10, the bases <b>34</b> for supporting and securing the movable member <b>31</b> are spaced apart from the heat generating element <b>2</b> and disposed at the upstream side of the heat generating element, and widths of the bases <b>34</b> are smaller than a width of the liquid passage <b>10</b> to permit the supply of liquid to a liquid supply passage <b>12</b>. Further, the configuration of each base <b>34</b> is not limited to the illustrated one, but may be selected to perform the refill smoothly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, in the illustrated embodiment, while the distance between the movable member <b>31</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> was selected to about 15 μm, such a distance may be selected within a range in which the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble can be sufficiently transmitted to the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Fourth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 11 shows one of fundamental conceptions of the present invention associated with a fourth embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 11 shows a positional relation between a bubble generating area in a liquid passage, a bubble generated in the area and a movable member, and shows an embodiment in which the liquid discharging method and the refilling method in the liquid discharging head of the present invention can easily be understood.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the former embodiments, the prompt displacement of the movable member and the movement of the bubble are concentrated to the discharge port by concentrating the pressure of the generated bubble to the free end of the movable member. To the contrary, in this fourth embodiment, the downstream portion of the bubble near the discharge port (directly associated with the liquid discharging) is regulated by the free end of the movable member, while permitting free growth of the bubble.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 11, comparing with FIG. 2 (first embodiment), in this fourth embodiment, there is no protruded portion or barrier (shown by the hatched area in FIGS. 1A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D) disposed at a downstream side of the bubble generating area on the element substrate <b>1</b> shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. That is to say, the free end of the movable member <b>31</b> is opened not to substantially cloth or seal the bubble generating area with respect to the discharge port.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, since the growth of a downstream tip end portion of the downstream bubble portion which is directly associated with the liquid discharging is permitted, the pressure component of the tip end bubble portion can be used for the liquid discharging effectively. In addition, since the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> causes the pressure directing upwardly of the downstream bubble portion (components of forces V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b>, V<b>4</b> in FIG. 5) to help the growth of the downstream bubble portion, the discharging efficiency can be improved, as is in the former embodiments. In this embodiment, the response to the energization of the heat generating element is superior to those in the former embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in this embodiment, since the construction is simple, the manufacture of the head can be facilitated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The fulcrum <b>33</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> in this embodiment is secured to a single base <b>34</b> having a width smaller than that of the movable member <b>31</b>. Accordingly, during the disappearance of the bubble, the liquid is supplied through both sides of the base <b>34</b> (as shown by the arrows). The base <b>34</b> may have any configuration so long as the liquid can be supplied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the illustrated embodiment, since the liquid flow from the above into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> during the disappearance of the bubble is controlled by the presence of the movable member <b>31</b>, the refill of the liquid is superior to the refill in the conventional bubble generating structure only having a heat generating element. Of course, with the arrangement as mentioned above, the retard amount of the meniscus can be reduced. Further, since both sides of the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> is substantially sealed by the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b> with respect to the bubble generating area <b>11</b>, as mentioned above, the pressure direction laterally of the movable member <b>31</b> can be oriented to help the growth of the bubble, thereby further improving the discharging efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Fifth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A fifth embodiment of the present invention shows an example that the liquid discharging force obtained by the mechanical displacement is further improved. FIG. 12 is a sectional view of a liquid discharging head according to the fifth embodiment. In FIG. 12, the movable member <b>31</b> extends so that the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> is positioned at a downstream side of the heat generating element <b>2</b>. With this arrangement, a displacement speed of the movable member <b>31</b> at the free end <b>32</b> can be increased, and the formation of the discharging force can be further improved by the displacement of the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, since the free end <b>32</b> is positioned nearer to the discharge port <b>18</b> than the former embodiments, the growth of the bubble <b>40</b> can be concentrated to a more stable direction, thereby obtaining the good discharging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in response to a bubble growing speed of a center of the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b>, the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced at a displacement speed of R<b>1</b>, and, the free end <b>32</b> remote from this position with respect to the fulcrum <b>33</b> is displaced at a displacement speed of R<b>2</b> faster than the speed R<b>1</b>. Thus, the high speed liquid flow acts on the free end to cause the movement of liquid, thereby improving the discharging efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, since the free end <b>32</b> has a configuration perpendicular to the liquid flow as is in FIG. 11, the pressure of the bubble and the mechanical action of the movable member <b>31</b> contribute to the liquid discharging efficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Sixth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 13A, <b>13</b>B and <b>13</b>C show a sixth embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Unlike to the former embodiments, in the sixth embodiment, the area directly communicated with the discharge port <b>18</b> is not communicated with the common liquid chamber <b>13</b>, thereby facilitating a structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid is supplied only through the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> along the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the bubble generating area <b>11</b>. The positional relation between the free end <b>32</b> and the fulcrum <b>33</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> and the discharge port <b>18</b>, and the structure of the movable member facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> are the same as the previous embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, although the above-mentioned advantages such as improvement of discharging efficiency and liquid supplying ability can be obtained, particularly, the retard of the meniscus is suppressed, and the forcible refill is performed by the liquid from the common liquid chamber by utilizing negative pressure during the disappearance of the bubble.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 13A shows a condition that the bubble is formed in the liquid by the heat generating element <b>2</b>, and FIG. 13B shows a condition that the bubble is being disappeared. In this condition, the movable member <b>31</b> is being returned to its initial position and the forcible refill as shown by the arrow S<b>3</b> is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 13C shows a condition that minute retard of the meniscus caused when the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to its initial position is compensated by the liquid near the discharge port <b>18</b> by a capillary phenomenon after the bubble is disappeared.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Seventh Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a seventh embodiment of the present invention, the liquid passage has a multi-passage structure so that the liquid in which the bubble is formed by applying the heat (bubble liquid) can be isolated from the liquid to be discharged (discharge liquid).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 14 is a schematic sectional view of a liquid passage of a liquid discharging head according to the seventh embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid discharging head according to this embodiment includes an element substrate <b>1</b> on which a heat generating element <b>2</b> for applying thermal energy for forming a bubble in the liquid is arranged, a second liquid passage <b>16</b> for the bubble liquid disposed on the element substrate <b>1</b>, and a first liquid passage <b>14</b> for the discharge liquid directly communicated with the discharge port <b>18</b> and disposed above the second liquid passage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An upstream side portion of the first liquid passage <b>14</b> is communicated with a first common liquid chamber <b>15</b> for supplying the discharge liquid to a plurality of first liquid passages <b>14</b>, and an upstream side portion of the second liquid passage <b>16</b> is communicated with a second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> for supplying the bubble liquid to a plurality of second liquid passages <b>16</b>. However, when the same liquid is used both as the bubble liquid and as the discharge liquid, a single common liquid chamber may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A separation wall <b>31</b> is disposed between the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and the second liquid passage <b>16</b> to isolate the first liquid passage <b>14</b> from the second liquid passage <b>16</b>. Incidentally, when the mixing between the bubble liquid and the discharge liquid is desired to prevent as much as possible, the liquid in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> is isolated from the liquid in the second liquid passage <b>16</b> by the separation wall <b>30</b> as much as possible; whereas, when the bubble liquid and the discharge liquid may be mixed to some extent, the separation wall <b>30</b> may not have the perfect separation function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A portion of the separation wall <b>30</b> positioned in an upper projection space regarding the heat generating element <b>2</b> (referred to as “discharge pressure generating area” hereinafter; an area A and area B of the bubble generating area <b>11</b> in FIG. 14) constitutes a movable member <b>31</b> having a free end <b>32</b> opened toward the discharge port <b>18</b> (i.e., toward a downstream side in the liquid flowing direction) through a slit <b>35</b>, side expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b>, and a fulcrum <b>33</b> disposed at the common liquid chamber (<b>15</b>, <b>17</b>) side. Since the movable member <b>31</b> is disposed in a confronting relation to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> (B), the movable member is moved (as shown by the arrow) by the bubble in the bubble liquid to be opened toward the discharge port <b>18</b> in the first liquid passage <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The positional relation between the fulcrum <b>33</b> and the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> are the same as the former embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, while the structural relation between the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> was explained in the previous embodiments, also in this embodiment, a structural relation between the second liquid passage and the heat generating element <b>2</b> is the same as the above-mentioned structural relation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, an operation of the liquid discharging head according to this embodiment will be explained with reference to FIGS. 15A and 15B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Regarding the operation of the head, as the discharge liquid supplied to the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and the bubble liquid supplied to the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, the same water-base ink is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the bubble liquid in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> in the second liquid passage <b>16</b> is subjected to the heat from the heat generating element <b>2</b>, as is in the former embodiments, a bubble <b>40</b> is formed in the bubble liquid by film-boiling phenomenon as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,723,129.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, since the bubble pressure cannot escape except through the upstream side of the bubble generating area <b>11</b>, the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble is concentrated and transmitted toward the movable member <b>31</b>, so that, as the bubble <b>40</b> is growing, the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced from a condition shown in FIG. 15A to a condition shown in FIG. 15B toward the first liquid passage <b>14</b>. This movement of the movable member <b>31</b> causes the second liquid passage <b>16</b> to greatly communicate with the first liquid passage <b>14</b>, with the result that the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> is transmitted to a direction toward the discharge port in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> (i.e., direction A). The liquid is discharged from the discharge port <b>18</b> by such transmission of the pressure and the mechanical displacement of the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, as the bubble <b>40</b> is being disappeared, the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to condition shown in FIG. 15A, and, in the first liquid passage <b>14</b>, the discharge liquid corresponding to an amount of the discharged liquid is supplied from the common liquid chamber <b>15</b>. Also in this embodiment, since the supply of the discharge liquid is effected toward a direction for closing the movable member <b>31</b> as is in the former embodiments, the refill of the discharge liquid is not prevented by the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While function and advantage regarding the transmission of the bubble pressure due to the displacement of the movable member <b>31</b>, the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> and the prevention of the back-wave in this embodiment are the same as the first embodiment, the two-liquid passage structure of this embodiment further provides the following advantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is to say, according to the arrangement of this embodiment, since the discharge liquid and the bubble liquid are isolated from each other, the discharge liquid can be discharged by the pressure of the bubble formed in the bubble liquid. Thus, even when high-viscous liquid in which a bubble is not adequately formed and provides only poor discharging force is used, by supplying such high-viscous liquid in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and by supplying liquid in which a bubble can easily be formed in the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, the good discharging can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, by selecting liquid in which deposit due to heat is not accumulated on the surface of the heat generating element <b>2</b> as the bubble liquid, the formation of the bubble can be stabilized and good discharging can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, since the head according to this embodiment provides the advantages same as the former embodiments, the liquid such as high-viscous liquid can be discharged with high discharging efficiency and high discharging force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, even when liquid having poor resistance to heat is used, by supplying such liquid in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and by supplying liquid having good resistance to heat and facilitating the formation of the bubble in the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, the liquid can be discharged with high discharging efficiency and high discharging force and without thermal damage of the liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Eighth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the former embodiments, while an example that both sides of the movable member is constituted by the expansion/contraction portions formed from the flexible thin diaphragm was explained, the expansion/contraction portions are not limited to the bellows-type thin diaphragm, but may be formed from plate-shaped walls. Now, an example that a movable member having plate-shaped side members is used will be explained with reference to FIGS. 16, <b>17</b>A, <b>17</b>B, <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 16 is a partial fragmental perspective view of a liquid discharging head according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention. Further, FIGS. 17A and 17B are schematic sectional views of a liquid passage structure of the liquid discharging head of FIG. 16, and FIGS. 18A and 18B are schematic sectional views of the liquid discharging head of FIG. 16, looked at from a discharge port side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A movable member <b>31</b> formed from material having elasticity such as metal is provided on an element substrate <b>1</b> of a liquid passage <b>10</b> in a cantilever fashion and in a confronting relation to a heat generating element <b>2</b>. The movable member <b>31</b> has a flat upper surface, and plate-shaped side walls <b>66</b> are protruded from both sides of the upper surface toward the element substrate <b>1</b>. One end of the movable member <b>31</b> is secured to bases <b>34</b> formed by patterning photosensitive resin on the wall of the liquid passage and the element substrate <b>1</b>. With this arrangement, the movable member <b>31</b> is held and has a fulcrum <b>33</b>. The movable member <b>31</b> is disposed above the heat generating element <b>2</b> by a predetermined distance and in a confronting relation to the heat generating element <b>2</b> to cover the heat generating element <b>2</b> so that the fulcrum <b>33</b> of the movable member is disposed at an upstream side in great liquid flow (caused by the liquid discharging) flowing from a common liquid chamber <b>13</b> through the movable member <b>31</b> to a discharge port <b>18</b> and the free end is disposed at a downstream side of the fulcrum <b>33</b>. Further, a height of each side wall <b>66</b> is smaller than a height of the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, and, in a condition that the movable member <b>31</b> is not displaced, a bottom wall of the first liquid passage <b>14</b> including the upper surface of the movable member <b>31</b> is smooth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, an example of a method for manufacturing the movable member <b>31</b> having the side walls <b>66</b> will be described with reference to FIGS. 23A, <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C, <b>23</b>D and <b>23</b>E. Here, an electroforming method will be explained. First of all, as shown in FIG. 23A, a master mold <b>67</b> having projections <b>67</b> <i>a </i>each having a height equal to a thickness of the movable member <b>31</b> and spaced apart from each other by a distance corresponding to a width of the upper surface of the movable member <b>31</b> is prepared. Then, as shown in FIG. 23B, the master mold <b>67</b> is subjected to electro-plating to form nickel layers <b>68</b> on the master mold <b>67</b>. A thickness of each nickel layer <b>68</b> is equal to the height of each projection <b>67</b> <i>a </i>of the master mold <b>67</b>. Then, as shown in FIG. 23C, regist <b>69</b> is patterned on the master mold <b>67</b> on which the nickel layers <b>68</b> were formed, except portions corresponding to the side walls <b>66</b>. A thickness of the regist <b>69</b> is equal to a height of each side wall <b>66</b> of the movable member <b>31</b>. Then, the electro-plating is effected again to grow the nickel layer <b>68</b> as shown in FIG. <b>23</b>D. Thereafter, the regist <b>69</b> is removed and the nickel layers <b>68</b> are peeled from the master mold <b>67</b>, thereby obtaining the movable member <b>31</b> having the side walls <b>66</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With the arrangement according to this embodiment, as the bubble <b>40</b> is growing, the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> is gradually displaced. In this case, as shown in FIGS. 17B and 18B, since both sides of the bubble <b>40</b> is covered by the side walls <b>66</b>, the pressure transmitting direction of the bubble <b>40</b> and the growing direction of the bubble are regulated to a direction toward the free end <b>32</b>, i.e., toward the discharge port <b>18</b>. Particularly, by providing side walls <b>66</b> having rigidity against the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b>, the release of pressure other than the direction toward the discharge port is suppressed during the displacement of the movable member <b>31</b>, with the result that, since the bubble pressure can be oriented toward the discharge port more effectively, the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> contributes to the liquid discharging more efficiently. Further, since the transmission of pressure in the lateral direction is suppressed by the side walls <b>66</b>, the side walls <b>66</b> can serve as separation walls for isolating adjacent first liquid passages <b>14</b>, thereby eliminating the additional separation walls. Thus, the liquid discharging head can be simplified and can be made cheaper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Ninth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 19 is a partial fragmental perspective views of a liquid discharging head according to a ninth embodiment of the present invention. FIGS. 20A and 20B are schematic sectional view of a liquid passage structure of the liquid discharging head of FIG. <b>19</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As is in the eighth embodiment, also in this embodiment, although side members are constituted by plate-shaped side walls <b>66</b>, the side walls <b>66</b> are disposed on both sides of the movable member <b>31</b> near the fulcrum <b>33</b>, except for side portions near the free end <b>32</b>. Since the other construction is the same as that of the eighth embodiment, explanation thereof will be omitted. With the above-mentioned arrangement, since a center of gravity of the movable member <b>31</b> more approaches to the fulcrum <b>33</b>, the displacement of the movable member <b>31</b> can be more facilitated. Further, the bubble pressure loss at a downstream side of the heat generating element <b>2</b> can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Tenth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 21 is a partial fragmental perspective views of a liquid discharging head according to a tenth embodiment of the present invention.

<div class="description-paragraph">As is in the eighth embodiment, also in this embodiment, although side members are constituted by plate-shaped side walls <b>66</b>, the side walls <b>66</b> are disposed on both sides of the movable member <b>31</b> near the free end <b>32</b>, except for side portions near the fulcrum <b>33</b>. Since the other construction is the same as that of the eighth embodiment, explanation thereof will be omitted. With the above-mentioned arrangement, the refill of the liquid from the both sides of the movable member <b>31</b> can be improved, while directing the pressure transmitting direction of the bubble and the growing direction of the bubble toward the discharge port <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Eleventh Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, an eleventh embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. This embodiment shows an example that a nozzle structure is used to improve the refill ability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 45 schematically shows a liquid discharging head according to the eleventh embodiment. In FIG. 45, a movable wall support member <b>210</b> and movable walls <b>211</b> supported by the movable wall support member are joined to an element substrate <b>220</b> on which discharge energy generating elements <b>221</b> (heat generating resistance bodies having a dimension of 40 μm×105 μm, for example, in the illustrated embodiment) for generating discharge energy for discharging the liquid is disposed, thereby forming liquid passages corresponding to the discharge energy generating elements <b>221</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each movable wall <b>211</b> is disposed in a confronting relation to the corresponding discharge energy generating element <b>221</b> and has a supported one end and the other end constituting a free end.

Here, the sentence “directly communicated with the common liquid chamber” refers to a condition that the displacement areas of the movable walls are not completely isolated by walls for separating the liquid passages from each other, i.e., a condition that areas corresponding to the liquid passages are directly communicated with each other laterally to form a common liquid chamber. Incidentally, with this arrangement, the refill of liquid can be effected very quickly.</div>

The movable wall side walls <b>252</b> are integrally formed with the movable wall support member <b>250</b> and cooperate with the movable walls <b>251</b> to define liquid passages corresponding to the discharge energy generating elements <b>221</b>. Each movable wall <b>251</b> constitutes a ceiling of the corresponding liquid passage and the movable wall side walls <b>252</b> constitute side walls of the liquid passage. The liquid passage constituted by the movable wall <b>251</b> and the movable wall side walls <b>252</b> is communicated with a liquid chamber (<b>231</b>′ in FIG. 46A) defined by the movable wall side walls <b>252</b>. Further, the movable wall <b>251</b> and the movable wall side walls <b>252</b> are disposed adjacent to each other to cover the corresponding discharge energy generating element <b>221</b> and to constitute a bubble liquid passage.

<div class="description-paragraph">In the above-mentioned eleventh to thirteenth embodiments, while an example that the liquid passage for supplying the liquid to the bubble generating area is separated from the liquid chamber <b>231</b> for supplying the liquid to the discharge port, that is to say, two kinds of liquids, i.e., the liquid to be discharged (discharge liquid) and the liquid in which the bubble is generated (bubble liquid) are used (however, these liquids may be the same) was explained, only the discharge liquid may be used (one liquid type). Now, an example of a head of one liquid type will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 51 schematically shows a liquid discharging head of one liquid type according to a fourteenth embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 51, “A” shows a condition that a movable member is displaced (a bubble is not shown) and “B” shows a condition that the movable member is in an initial position (first position). In the condition B, a bubble generating area <b>299</b> is substantially closed or sealed with respect to a discharge port <b>233</b>. Incidentally, in FIG. 51, the same elements as those shown in FIG. 45 are designated by the same reference numerals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 51, the liquid discharging head according to this embodiment has a movable wall support member <b>270</b> provided at its both sides with bases <b>272</b>. The bases <b>272</b> of the movable wall support member are joined to an element substrate <b>220</b> to define a liquid supply passage <b>218</b>. Further, a movable wall <b>271</b> is disposed in a confronting relation to the corresponding discharge energy generating element <b>221</b> and has one end supported by the movable wall support member <b>270</b> and the other end constituting a free end. The free end is displaced by pressure caused by a bubble generated by the discharge energy generating element <b>221</b>. The movable wall has an inverted U-shaped cross-section. In the condition B, the movable wall <b>271</b> is closely contacted with a fixed wall <b>273</b> disposed along a discharge port side edge of the discharge energy generating element <b>221</b> on the element substrate <b>220</b> (i.e., a downstream edge of the discharge energy generating element in a liquid passage defined by the movable wall support member <b>270</b>), thereby substantially sealing the bubble generating area with respect to the discharge port <b>233</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With the arrangement according to this embodiment, the liquid can be supplied to the bubble generating area from a liquid supply passage <b>218</b> having a surface flush with or smoothly connected to the surface of the discharge energy generating element <b>221</b> along an inner surface of the movable wall <b>271</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the initial position (first position) of the movable wall <b>271</b>, the movable wall <b>271</b> is closely contacted with the fixed wall <b>273</b> disposed at the downstream side of the discharge energy generating element <b>221</b>, with the result that, since the discharge port side portion of the bubble generating area is substantially closed, the bubble pressure (particularly, the pressure of the downstream side portion of the bubble) is concentrated to the free end of the movable wall without escaping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, as the bubble is disappearing, the movable wall <b>271</b> is returned to its first position, and, during the disappearance of the bubble, regarding the supply of the liquid to the discharge energy generating element, the discharge port <b>233</b> side of the bubble generating area is substantially sealed, thereby providing the above-mentioned various advantages such as prevention of retard of meniscus.

<div class="description-paragraph">(Fifteenth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, a fifteenth embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, an example that a movable member for facilitating the improvement of the discharging efficiency is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 52A, <b>52</b>B, <b>52</b>C and <b>52</b>D are schematic sectional views of a liquid passage structure of a liquid discharging head according to this embodiment, and FIG. 53 is a partial fragmental perspective view of the liquid discharging head. FIG. 53 is a schematic sectional view of the liquid discharging head, looked at from a discharge port side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid discharging head according to this embodiment includes an element substrate <b>1</b> on which a heat generating element <b>2</b> (heat generating resistance member having a dimension of 40 μm×105 μm, in the illustrated embodiment) for acting thermal energy on liquid (as discharge energy generating element for generating energy for discharging the liquid) is arranged, and a liquid passage <b>10</b> is formed above the element substrate <b>1</b> in correspondence to the heat generating element <b>2</b>. The liquid passage <b>10</b> communicates with a discharge port <b>18</b> and also communicates with a common liquid chamber <b>13</b> for supplying the liquid to a plurality of liquid passages <b>10</b>, and receives the liquid corresponding to the discharged liquid from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Within the liquid passage <b>10</b>, above the element substrate <b>1</b>, there is provided a plate-shaped movable member <b>31</b> made of material having elasticity such as metal and disposed in a cantilever fashion to face to the heat generating element <b>2</b>. One end of the movable member <b>31</b> is secured to bases (support members) <b>34</b> formed by patterning photosensitive resin on a wall of the liquid passage <b>10</b> and on the element substrate. As a result, the movable member <b>31</b> is held and includes a fulcrum (fulcrum portion) <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The movable member <b>31</b> has the fulcrum <b>33</b> positioned at an upstream side of large flow of liquid flowing from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> through the movable member <b>31</b> to the discharge port <b>18</b> and a free end (free end portion) <b>32</b> at a downstream side of the fulcrum <b>33</b> and is disposed in a confronting relation to the heat generating element <b>2</b> to cover the heat generating element <b>2</b> and is spaced apart from the heat generating element <b>5</b> by about 15 μm. A bubble generating area <b>11</b> is defined between the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> has a recessed portion <b>60</b> extending from the free end <b>32</b> to the fulcrum <b>33</b> and having an arcuate cross-section. As shown in FIG. 54, a width W of the recessed portion <b>60</b> at the free end <b>32</b> is smaller than a diameter d of the discharge port <b>18</b>. Further, the width W and a depth of the recessed portion <b>60</b> are gradually decreased from the free end <b>32</b> to the fulcrum <b>33</b>. Incidentally, since the movable member <b>31</b> is a plate-shaped member, when the recessed portion <b>60</b> is formed in the surface facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b>, an opposite surface of the movable member becomes convex.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Kinds, configurations and dispositions of the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the movable member <b>31</b> are not limited to the above-mentioned ones, but, the heat generating element and the movable member may be configured and disposed to control the growth of the bubble and transmission of the pressure, which will be described later. Incidentally, for the explanation of a liquid flow which will be described later, the liquid passage <b>10</b> is explained to have a first liquid passage <b>14</b> (at one side of the movable member <b>31</b>) directly communicated with the discharge port <b>18</b> and a second liquid passage <b>16</b> (at the other side of the movable member) including the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and a liquid supply passage <b>12</b>. Hereinbelow, explanation is made by referring to the first and second liquid passages <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Heat is applied to the liquid in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> between the movable member <b>31</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> by heating the heat generating element <b>2</b>, and a bubble is formed in the liquid by a film-boiling phenomenon as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,723,129. Pressure caused by the formation of the bubble, and the bubble act on the movable member <b>31</b> preferentially, with the result that the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced around the fulcrum <b>33</b> to be greatly opened toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, as shown in FIGS. 52B and 52C or FIG. <b>53</b>. By the displacement or a displaced condition of the movable member <b>31</b>, a transmitting direction of the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble and a growing direction of the bubble itself are oriented toward the discharge port <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a discharging operation of the liquid discharging head according to the illustrated embodiment will be fully described with reference to FIGS. 52A, <b>52</b>B, <b>52</b>C and <b>52</b>D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 52A shows a condition before energy such a electrical energy is applied to the heat generating element <b>2</b>, i.e., before heat is generated from the heat generating element <b>2</b>. It is important that the movable member <b>31</b> is disposed in a confronting relation to at least a downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b> which will be formed by the heat from the heat generating element <b>2</b>. That is to say, the movable member <b>31</b> extends up to at least a position downstream of center <b>3</b> (FIG. 52B) of an area of the heat generating element in the liquid passage (i.e., downstream of a line passing through the center <b>3</b> of the area of the heat generating element and extending perpendicular to the length of the liquid passage) so that the movable member <b>31</b> acts on the downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 52B shows a condition that the heat generating element <b>2</b> is heated by applying the electrical energy to the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the bubble <b>40</b> is formed by the film-boiling caused by heating a portion of the liquid contained in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> by utilizing the heat from the heat generating element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced or shifted by the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble <b>40</b> from the first position to the second position to direct the pressure transmitting direction of the bubble <b>40</b> toward the discharge port. Further, in this case, a major portion of the pressure component (among the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b>) acting on the movable member <b>31</b> is received by the recessed portion <b>60</b> (FIG. 53) of the movable member <b>31</b>, thereby facilitating the orientation of the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> toward the discharge port <b>18</b>. Here, it is important that, as mentioned above, the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> is disposed at the downstream side (discharge port side) and the fulcrum <b>33</b> is disposed at the upstream side (common liquid chamber <b>13</b> side) so that at least a portion of the movable member <b>31</b> is faced to the downstream portion of the heat generating element <b>2</b> (i.e., downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b>). Further, it is preferable that a terminal end (near the fulcrum <b>33</b>) of the recessed portion <b>60</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> is disposed at the upstream side of the heat generating element <b>2</b> so that the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> can easily be received by the recessed portion <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 52C shows a condition that the bubble <b>40</b> is further growing and the movable member <b>31</b> is further displaced by the pressure caused by the growth of the bubble <b>40</b>. The generated bubble <b>40</b> is grown more greatly at the downstream side than at the upstream side, and the bubble is greatly grown to exceed the first position (shown by the dot and chain line) of the movable member <b>31</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, since the recessed portion <b>60</b> having the width smaller than the maximum diameter of the discharge port <b>18</b> and extending from the free end <b>32</b> to the fulcrum <b>33</b> is formed in the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the major portion of the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> acting on the movable member <b>31</b> is received by the recessed portion <b>60</b>, when the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced as the bubble <b>40</b> is growing, the pressure transmitting direction of the bubble <b>40</b> and the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> are uniformly directed toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, thereby improving the discharging efficiency. When the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> and the pressure transmitting direction are oriented toward the discharge port, the movable member <b>31</b> does not resist against such orientation, with the result that the pressure transmitting direction and the growing direction of the bubble can be controlled efficiently in accordance with the magnitude of the pressure to be transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, since the width of the recessed portion <b>60</b> at the free end <b>32</b> is smaller than the diameter of the discharge port <b>18</b>, the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> is directed toward the discharge port <b>18</b> more correctly, and, further, since the width and the depth of the recessed portion <b>60</b> are gradually decreased toward the fulcrum <b>33</b>, the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> is directed toward the discharge port <b>18</b> efficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 52D shows a condition that the bubble <b>40</b> is contracted to be disappeared by reduction of pressure in the bubble (after the film-boiling).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The movable member <b>31</b> which was displaced to the second position is returned to an initial position shown in FIG. 52A (first position) by negative pressure due to contraction of the bubble <b>40</b> and the restoring force due to the elasticity of the movable member <b>31</b> itself. Further, when the bubble is disappeared, in order to compensate the contracted volume of the bubble <b>40</b> at the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and to compensate the volume of the discharged liquid, the liquid flows into the bubble generating area from the upstream side (B), i.e., from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> as shown by the arrows V<sub>D1</sub>, V<sub>D2 </sub>and from the discharge port <b>18</b> as shown by the arrow V<sub>C</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the operation of the movable member <b>31</b> in response to the formation of the bubble <b>40</b> and the liquid discharging operation were explained, now, refilling of the liquid in the liquid discharging head of the present invention will be fully explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid supplying mechanism in the present invention will be fully described with reference to FIGS. 52A, <b>52</b>B, <b>52</b>C and <b>52</b>D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the condition shown in FIG. 52C, when the bubble <b>40</b> is being contracted from the maximum volume condition, the liquid compensating the reduced bubble volume flows into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> from the discharge port <b>18</b> of the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> associated with the second liquid passage <b>16</b>. In the conventional liquid passage design not having the movable member <b>31</b>, an amount of liquid flowing toward the discharge port <b>18</b> into the reduced bubble position and an amount of liquid flowing toward the common liquid chamber into the reduced bubble position depend upon flow resistance between a portion (near the discharge port <b>18</b>) of the bubble generating area and a portion (near the common liquid chamber <b>13</b>) of the bubble generating area (i.e., depend upon resistances of the liquid passages and inertia of the liquid).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, when the flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the discharge port is smaller than the flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the common liquid chamber, the greater amount of liquid flows into the reduced bubble position from the discharge port side, thereby increasing a retard amount of meniscus M. In particular, the smaller the flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the discharge port (to enhance the discharging efficiency), the greater the retard amount of the meniscus M, thereby increasing the refilling time to affect a bad influence upon the high speed recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To the contrary, in the illustrated embodiment, since the movable member <b>31</b> is provided, when it is assumed that a volume portion (above the first position) of the volume W of the bubble is W<b>1</b> and a volume portion (below the first position, i.e., toward the bubble generating area <b>11</b>) of the volume W of the bubble is W<b>2</b>, the retard of the meniscus M is stopped at the time when the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to its initial position during the reduction of the bubble. And, the liquid corresponding to the remaining volume W<b>2</b> is mainly supplied from the liquid flow V<sub>D2 </sub>in the second liquid passage <b>16</b>. In this way, the retard amount of the meniscus M can be suppressed to about a half of the volume portion W<b>1</b>; incidentally, in the conventional techniques, the retard amount of the meniscus M was about a half of the entire volume W of the bubble.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, since the liquid corresponding to the volume portion W<b>2</b> can forcibly be supplied mainly from the upstream side (V<sub>D2</sub>) along the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> by utilizing the negative pressure during the disappearance of the bubble, the refilling time can be shortened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the refill is effected by utilizing the negative pressure during the disappearance of the bubble in the conventional head, the fluctuation of the meniscus becomes great to cause the deterioration of the image quality. To the contrary, in the high speed refill according to the illustrated embodiment, since the flowing of the liquid in the first liquid passage near the discharge port into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> near the discharge port <b>18</b> is suppressed by the movable member <b>31</b>, the fluctuation of the meniscus M can be minimized. In this way, according to the present invention, since the high speed refill is achieved by the forcible refill of the liquid into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> from the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> of the second liquid passage <b>16</b> and suppression of the retard or fluctuation of the meniscus, the stable liquid discharging and high speed repeat discharging can be realized, and, when applied to the recording field, the high quality image and high speed recording can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the arrangement according to the present invention, there is also provided the following effective function. That is to say, the transmission of the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble to the upstream side (back-wave) can be suppressed. The pressure of the bubble portion (near the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> (upstream side)) of the bubble <b>40</b> generated on the heat generating element <b>2</b> tends to push the liquid back to the upstream side (to cause the back-wave). The back-wave creates upstream pressure, upstream movement of the liquid and an inertia force due to the liquid movement, which resist the refill of the liquid into the liquid passage <b>10</b>, thereby affecting a bad influence upon the high speed recording. In the present invention, since such upstream pressure, upstream liquid movement and inertia force can be suppressed by the movable member <b>31</b>, the refill ability can be further improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a further characteristic construction and advantage therefor in the illustrated embodiment will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The second liquid passage <b>16</b> according to the illustrated embodiment has the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> having an inner wall flatly contiguous to (i.e., flush with) the heat generating element <b>2</b> at the upstream side of the heat generating element <b>2</b>. In such a case, the supply of the liquid to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and the surface of the heat generating element <b>2</b> is effected along the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> (as flow V<sub>D2</sub>). Thus, stagnation of liquid on the heat generating element <b>2</b> is prevented, with the result that gas included in the liquid and the residual bubble can easily be removed and excessive accumulation of heat in the liquid can be avoided. Accordingly, more stable formation of bubble can be repeated at a high speed. Incidentally, in the illustrated embodiment, while an example that the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> has a substantially flat inner wall was explained, the inner wall of the liquid supply passage is not limited to such an example, but may have a gentle slope or other shape smoothly contiguous to the surface of the heat generating element to prevent the stagnation of liquid on the heat generating element and disturbance of the supplied liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the liquid is supplied into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> from the direction V<sub>D1 </sub>through the side (slit <b>35</b>) of the movable member <b>31</b>. However, a large movable member <b>31</b> for covering the entire bubble generating area <b>11</b> (covering the surface of the heat generating element) as shown in FIGS. 52A, <b>52</b>B, <b>52</b>C and <b>52</b>D is used to direct the pressure of the bubble to the discharge port <b>18</b> more effectively. In this case, after the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to the first position, if the flow resistance between the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and an area (near the discharge port <b>18</b>) of the first liquid passage <b>14</b> becomes great, the flow of the liquid from the direction V<sub>D1 </sub>to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> is blocked. However, in the head arrangement according to the illustrated embodiment, since the liquid is supplied to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> from the direction V<sub>D2</sub>, the liquid supply ability is extremely improved. Thus, even when the arrangement wherein the bubble generating area <b>11</b> is covered by the movable member <b>31</b> to improve the discharging efficiency is used, the liquid supplying ability is not worsened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By the way, regarding the positions of the free end <b>32</b> and the fulcrum <b>33</b> of the movable member <b>31</b>, for example, as shown in FIGS. 52A, <b>52</b>B, <b>52</b>C and <b>52</b>D, the free end <b>32</b> is disposed at a down stream side of the fulcrum <b>33</b>. With this arrangement, when the bubble is being formed, the pressure transmitting direction and the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> can be oriented or directed toward the discharge port <b>18</b> effectively. Further, this positional relation not only contributes the improvement of the discharging efficiency or ability but also reduces flow resistance of the liquid flowing through the liquid passage <b>10</b> during the supply of liquid, thereby achieving the high speed refill. The reason is that, as shown in FIGS. 52A, <b>52</b>B, <b>52</b>C and <b>52</b>D, when the meniscus M retarded due to the liquid discharging is restored toward the discharge port <b>18</b> by a capillary phenomenon and/or when the liquid is supplied to compensate the disappeared bubble, the free end <b>32</b> and the fulcrum <b>33</b> are arranged not to resist against the liquid flows S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> flowing in the liquid passage <b>10</b> (including the first and second liquid passages <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in FIGS. 52A, <b>52</b>B, <b>52</b>C and <b>52</b>D, as mentioned above, regarding the heat generating element <b>2</b>, the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> extends up to the position downstream of the center <b>3</b> of the area of the heat generating element <b>2</b> (i.e., downstream of the line passing through the center of the area of the heat generating element and extending perpendicular to the length of the liquid passage <b>10</b>). Thus, the pressure and the downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b> which are generated at the downstream side of the center <b>3</b> of the area of the heat generating element and greatly contribute to the liquid discharging are supported by the movable member <b>31</b>, with the result that the pressure and the bubble are directed toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, thereby improving the discharging efficiency and discharging force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, by utilizing the upstream portion of the bubble, various advantages can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in the illustrated embodiment, the momentary mechanical displacement of the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> also contributes to the improvement of the liquid discharging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Sixteenth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 55 shows a sixteenth embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 55, “A” shows a condition that a movable member <b>31</b> is displaced (a bubble is not shown), and “B” shows a condition that the movable member <b>31</b> is positioned in an initial position (first position). In the condition B, a bubble generating area <b>11</b> is substantially closed or sealed with respect to a discharge port <b>18</b>. (Although not shown, there is a liquid passage wall between A and B to separate liquid passages from each other.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 55 has a recessed portion <b>60</b> similar to that in the fifteenth embodiment. Further, there are two side bases <b>34</b> and a liquid supply passage <b>12</b> between the bases. With this arrangement, the liquid can be supplied along a surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to a heat generating element <b>2</b> from a liquid supply passage <b>12</b> having an inner surface flush with or smoothly contiguous to a surface of the heat generating element <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the initial position (first position) of the movable member <b>31</b>, the movable member <b>31</b> is adjacent to or closely contacted with a downstream wall <b>36</b> of the heat generating element disposed at a downstream end of the heat generating element <b>2</b>, and an end (toward the discharge port <b>18</b>) of a bubble generating area <b>11</b> is substantially sealed. Thus, pressure of a bubble (particularly, downstream pressure of the bubble) can be concentrated and oriented toward a free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> without escaping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, when the bubble is disappeared, the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to the first position, and, when the liquid is supplied to compensate the disappeared bubble, since the side (near the discharge port <b>18</b>) of the bubble generating area <b>11</b> is substantially sealed, the suppression of the retard of the meniscus and the like can be achieved, as is in the former embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in the illustrated embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 53 and 55, the bases <b>34</b> for supporting and securing the movable member <b>31</b> are spaced apart from the heat generating element <b>2</b> and disposed at the upstream side of the heat generating element, and widths of the bases <b>34</b> are smaller than a width of the liquid passage <b>10</b> to permit the supply of liquid to a liquid supply passage <b>12</b>. Further, the configuration of each base <b>34</b> is not limited to the illustrated one, but may be selected to perform the refill smoothly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, in the illustrated embodiment, while the distance between the movable member <b>31</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> was selected to about 15 μm, such a distance may be selected within a range in which the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble can be sufficiently transmitted to the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Seventeenth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 56 shows one of fundamental conceptions of the present invention associated with a seventeenth embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 56 shows a positional relation between a bubble generating area <b>11</b> in a liquid passage <b>10</b>, a bubble generated in the area and a movable member <b>31</b>, and shows an embodiment in which the liquid discharging method and the refilling method in the liquid discharging head of the present invention can easily be understood.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the former embodiments, the prompt displacement of the movable member and the movement of the bubble are concentrated to the discharge port by concentrating the pressure of the generated bubble to the free end of the movable member. To the contrary, in this embodiment, the downstream portion of the bubble near the discharge port <b>18</b> (directly associated with the liquid discharging) is regulated by the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b>, while permitting free growth of the bubble.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 56, comparing with FIG. 53 (fifteenth embodiment), in this embodiment, there is no protruded portion or barrier (shown by the hatched area in FIGS. 52A, <b>52</b>B, <b>52</b>C and <b>52</b>D) disposed at a downstream side of the bubble generating area on the element substrate <b>1</b> shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. That is to say, the free end and both side areas of the movable member <b>31</b> is opened not to substantially close or seal the bubble generating area <b>11</b> with respect to the discharge port.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, since the growth of a downstream tip end portion of the downstream bubble portion which is directly associated with the liquid discharging is permitted, the pressure component of the tip end bubble portion can be used for the liquid discharging effectively. In addition, since the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> causes at least the pressure directing upwardly of the downstream bubble portion to help the growth of the downstream bubble portion, the discharging efficiency can be improved, as is in the former embodiments. In this embodiment, the response to the energization of the heat generating element <b>2</b> is superior to those in the former embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in this embodiment, since the construction is simple, the manufacture of the head can be facilitated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The fulcrum of the movable member <b>31</b> in this embodiment is secured to a single base <b>34</b> having a width smaller than that of the movable member <b>31</b>. Accordingly, during the disappearance of the bubble, the liquid is supplied through both sides of the base <b>34</b> (as shown by the arrows). The base <b>34</b> may have any configuration so long as the liquid can be supplied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the illustrated embodiment, since the liquid flow from the above into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> during the disappearance of the bubble is controlled by the presence of the movable member <b>31</b>, the refill of the liquid is superior to the refill in the conventional bubble generating structure only having a heat generating element. Of course, with the arrangement as mentioned above, the retard amount of the meniscus can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As an alteration of this embodiment, it is preferable that both side ends (or one of them) of the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> alone are substantially sealed to the bubble generating area <b>11</b>. With this arrangement, since the pressure directing laterally of the movable member <b>31</b> is utilized to growth of the downstream portion (near the discharge port) of the bubble, the discharging efficiency can be further improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Eighteenth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, an eighteenth embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. 57, <b>58</b>, <b>59</b>A and <b>59</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also in this embodiment, although the main liquid discharging principle is the same as the previous embodiments, in this embodiment, the liquid passage has a multi-passage structure so that the liquid in which the bubble is formed by applying the heat (bubble liquid) can be isolated from the liquid to be discharged (discharge liquid).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 57 is a schematic sectional view of a liquid passage structure of a liquid discharging head according to this embodiment, and FIG. 58 is a partial fragmental perspective view of the liquid discharging head of FIG. <b>57</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid discharging head according to this embodiment includes an element substrate <b>1</b> on which a heat generating element <b>2</b> for applying thermal energy for forming a bubble in the liquid is arranged, a second liquid passage <b>16</b> for the bubble liquid disposed on the element substrate <b>1</b>, and a first liquid passage <b>14</b> for the discharge liquid directly communicated with the discharge port <b>18</b> and disposed above the second liquid passage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An upstream side portion of the first liquid passage <b>14</b> is communicated with a first common liquid chamber <b>15</b> for supplying the discharge liquid to a plurality of first liquid passages <b>14</b>, and an upstream side portion of the second liquid passage <b>16</b> is communicated with a second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> for supplying the bubble liquid to a plurality of second liquid passages <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, when the same liquid is used both as the bubble liquid and as the discharge liquid, a single common liquid chamber may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A separation wall <b>30</b> made of material having elasticity such as metal is disposed between the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and the second liquid passage <b>16</b> to isolate the first liquid passage <b>14</b> from the second liquid passage <b>16</b>. Incidentally, when the mixing between the bubble liquid and the discharge liquid is desired to prevent as much as possible, the liquid in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> is isolated from the liquid in the second liquid passage <b>16</b> by the separation wall <b>30</b> as much as possible; whereas, when the bubble liquid and the discharge liquid may be mixed to some extent, the separation wall <b>30</b> may not have the perfect separation function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A portion of the separation wall <b>30</b> positioned in an upper projection space regarding the heat generating element <b>2</b> (referred to as “discharge pressure generating area” hereinafter; an area A and area B of the bubble generating area <b>11</b> in FIG. 57) constitutes a movable member <b>31</b> (supported in a cantilever fashion) having a free end <b>32</b> opened toward the discharge port <b>18</b> (i.e., toward a downstream side in the liquid flowing direction) through a slit <b>35</b>, and a fulcrum <b>33</b> disposed at the common liquid chamber (<b>15</b>, <b>17</b>) side. Since the movable member <b>31</b> is disposed in a confronting relation to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> (B), the movable member is moved (as shown by the arrow) by the bubble in the bubble liquid to be opened toward the discharge port <b>18</b> in the first liquid passage <b>14</b>. In FIG. 58, the separation wall <b>30</b> is disposed, with the interposition of a space for defining a second liquid passage, on the element substrate <b>1</b> on which heat generating resistance bodies as the heat generating elements <b>2</b> and electrodes <b>5</b> for applying an electrical signal to the heat generating body are disposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The positional relation between the fulcrum <b>33</b> and the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> are the same as the former embodiments. Further, regarding the movable member <b>31</b>, as is in the former embodiments, a surface of the movable member facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> has a recessed portion <b>60</b> having a width smaller than a maximum diameter of the discharge port <b>18</b> and extending from the free end <b>32</b> to the fulcrum <b>33</b> to facilitate the orientation of the pressure of the bubble toward the discharge port <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, while the structural relation between the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> was explained in the previous embodiments, also in this embodiments, a structural relation between the second liquid passage <b>16</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> is the same as the above-mentioned structural relation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, an operation of the liquid discharging head according to this embodiment will be explained with reference to FIGS. 59A and 59B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Regarding the operation of the head, as the discharge liquid supplied to the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and the bubble liquid supplied to the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, the same water-base ink is used. When the bubble liquid in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> in the second liquid passage <b>16</b> is subjected to the heat from the heat generating element <b>2</b>, as is in the former embodiments, a bubble <b>40</b> is formed in the bubble liquid by film-boiling phenomenon as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,723,129.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, since the bubble pressure cannot escape except through the upstream side of the bubble generating area <b>11</b>, the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble is concentrated and transmitted toward the movable member <b>31</b>, so that, as the bubble <b>40</b> is growing, the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced from a condition shown in FIG. 59A to a condition shown in FIG. 59B toward the first liquid passage <b>14</b>. This movement of the movable member <b>31</b> causes the second liquid passage <b>16</b> to greatly communicate with the first liquid passage <b>14</b>, with the result that the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> is mainly transmitted to a direction toward the discharge port in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> (i.e., direction A). The liquid is discharged from the discharge port by such transmission of the pressure and the mechanical displacement of the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, as the bubble <b>40</b> is being disappeared, the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to condition shown in FIG. 59A, and, in the first liquid passage <b>14</b>, the discharge liquid corresponding to an amount of the discharged liquid is supplied from the upstream side. Also in this embodiment, since the supply of the discharge liquid is effected toward a direction for closing the movable member <b>31</b> as is in the former embodiments, the refill of the discharge liquid is not prevented by the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While function and advantage regarding the transmission of the bubble pressure due to the displacement of the movable member <b>31</b>, the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> and the prevention of the back-wave in this embodiment are the same as the first embodiment, the two-liquid passage structure of this embodiment further provides the following advantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is to say, according to the arrangement of this embodiment, since the discharge liquid and the bubble liquid are isolated from each other, the discharge liquid can be discharged by the pressure of the bubble formed in the bubble liquid. Thus, even when high-viscous liquid such as polyethylene or glycol in which a bubble is not adequately formed and provides only poor discharging force is used, by supplying such high-viscous liquid in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and by supplying liquid (mixture of ethanol:water=4:6; about 1-2 cp) or low boiling point liquid in which a bubble can easily be formed in the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, the good discharging can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, by selecting liquid in which deposit due to heat is not accumulated on the surface of the heat generating element <b>2</b> as the bubble liquid, the formation of the bubble can be stabilized and good discharging can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, since the head according to this embodiment provides the advantages same as the former embodiments, the liquid such as high-viscous liquid can be discharged with high discharging efficiency and high discharging force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, even when liquid having poor resistance to heat is used, by supplying such liquid in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and by supplying liquid having good resistance to heat and facilitating the formation of the bubble in the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, the liquid can be discharged with high discharging efficiency and high discharging force and without thermal damage of the liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Nineteenth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, a nineteenth embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This embodiment shows an example that, when the movable member is displaced, the resistance of the movable member subjected from the liquid becomes smaller to effectively operate the movable member during the growth of the bubble, thereby obtaining the good discharging efficiency and discharging force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 65A, <b>65</b>B, <b>65</b>C and <b>65</b>D are schematic sectional views of a liquid passage structure of a liquid discharging head according to the nineteenth embodiment, and FIG. 66 is a partial fragmental perspective view of the liquid discharging head. FIG. 67 is a schematic sectional view of the liquid discharging head according to the first embodiment, looked at from a discharge port side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid discharging head according to the illustrated embodiment includes an element substrate <b>1</b> on which a heat generating element <b>2</b> (heat generating resistance member having a dimension of 40 μm×105 μm, in the illustrated embodiment) for acting thermal energy on liquid (as discharge energy generating element for generating energy for discharging the liquid) is arranged, and a liquid passage <b>10</b> is formed above the element substrate <b>1</b> in correspondence to the heat generating element <b>2</b>. The liquid passage <b>10</b> communicates with a discharge port <b>18</b> and also communicates with a common liquid chamber <b>13</b> for supplying the liquid to a plurality of liquid passages <b>10</b>, and receives the liquid corresponding to the discharged liquid from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Within the liquid passage <b>10</b>, above the element substrate <b>1</b>, there is provided a plate-shaped movable member <b>31</b> made of material having elasticity such as metal in a cantilever fashion. The movable member <b>31</b> has a flat surface facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> and extending in parallel with a surface of the heat generating element <b>2</b>. Further, a width of the movable member <b>31</b> is gradually decreased from the surface facing the heat generating element <b>2</b> to an opposite surface. One end of the movable member <b>31</b> is secured to bases (support member) <b>34</b> formed by patterning photosensitive resin on a wall of the liquid passage <b>10</b> and on the element substrate <b>1</b>. As a result, the movable member <b>31</b> is held and has a fulcrum (support portion) <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The movable member <b>31</b> has the fulcrum <b>33</b> positioned at an upstream side of large flow of liquid flowing from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> through the movable member <b>31</b> to the discharge port <b>18</b> and a free end (free end portion) <b>32</b> at a downstream side of the fulcrum <b>33</b> and is disposed in a confronting relation to the heat generating element <b>2</b> to cover the heat generating element <b>2</b> and is spaced apart from the heat generating element <b>5</b> by about 15 μm. A bubble generating area <b>11</b> is defined between the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the movable member <b>31</b>. Incidentally, kinds, configurations and dispositions of the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the movable member <b>31</b> are not limited to the above-mentioned ones, but, the heat generating element and the movable member may be configured and disposed to control the growth of the bubble and transmission of the pressure, which will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Heat is applied to the liquid in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> between the movable member <b>31</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> by heating the heat generating element <b>2</b>, and a bubble is formed in the liquid by a film-boiling phenomenon as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,723,129. Pressure caused by the formation of the bubble, and the bubble act on the movable member <b>31</b> preferentially, with the result that the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced around the fulcrum <b>33</b> to be greatly opened toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, as shown in FIGS. 65B and 65C or FIG. <b>66</b>. By the displacement or a displaced condition of the movable member <b>31</b>, a transmitting direction of the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble and a growing direction of the bubble itself are oriented toward the discharge port <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a discharging operation of the liquid discharging head according to the illustrated embodiment will be fully described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 65A shows a condition before energy such as electrical energy is applied to the heat generating element <b>2</b>, i.e., before heat is generated from the heat generating element <b>2</b>. It is important that the movable member <b>31</b> is disposed in a confronting relation to at least a downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b> which will be formed by the heat from the heat generating element <b>2</b>. That is to say, the movable member <b>31</b> extends up to at least a position downstream of center <b>3</b> (FIG. 65B) of an area of the heat generating element in the liquid passage (i.e., downstream of a line passing through the center <b>3</b> of the area of the heat generating element and extending perpendicular to the length of the liquid passage) so that the movable member <b>31</b> acts on the downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 65B shows a condition that the heat generating element <b>2</b> is heated by applying the electrical energy to the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the bubble <b>40</b> is formed by the film-boiling caused by heating a portion of the liquid contained in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> by utilizing the heat from the heat generating element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced or shifted by the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble <b>40</b> from the first position to the second position to direct the pressure transmitting direction of the bubble <b>40</b> toward the discharge port. Here, it is important that, as mentioned above, the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> is disposed at the downstream side (discharge port side) and the fulcrum <b>33</b> is disposed at the upstream side (common liquid chamber <b>13</b> side) and at least a portion of the movable member <b>31</b> is faced to the downstream portion of the heat generating element <b>2</b> (i.e., downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 65C shows a condition that the bubble <b>40</b> is further growing and the movable member <b>31</b> is further displaced by the pressure caused by the growth of the bubble <b>40</b>. The generated bubble <b>40</b> is grown more greatly at the downstream side than at the upstream side, and the bubble is greatly grown to exceed the first position (shown by the dot and chain line) of the movable member <b>31</b>. When the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced as the bubble <b>40</b> is growing, the pressure transmitting direction of the bubble <b>40</b> is regulated to a direction toward which the pressure transmitting direction is apt to be oriented (i.e., to the free end opened toward the discharge port), with the result that the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> is uniformly oriented toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, thereby improving the discharging efficiency. When the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> and the pressure transmitting direction are oriented toward the discharge port, the movable member <b>31</b> does not resist against such orientation, with the result that the pressure transmitting direction and the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> can be controlled efficiently in accordance with the magnitude of the pressure to be transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, as mentioned above, since the width of the movable member <b>31</b> is gradually decreased from the surface facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> to the opposite surface, when the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced by the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b>, the movable member <b>31</b> is hard to be resisted by the liquid in the liquid passage <b>10</b>, with the result that the movable member can be displaced with low pressure. Accordingly, a component of the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> used to displace the movable member <b>31</b> can be minimized, with the result that the remaining pressure contributes to grow the bubble toward the discharge port <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, since the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> is substantially flat and extends in parallel with the surface of the heat generating element <b>2</b>, the movable member can easily be subjected to the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b>, thereby displacing the movable member <b>31</b> efficiently. The structure which can easily be subjected to the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> is not limited to the above one, but, for example, sattin finished surface or serration may be formed on the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b>, or a concave portion for covering both sides of the bubble <b>40</b> may be formed in a portion of the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 65D shows a condition that the bubble <b>40</b> is contracted to be disappeared by reduction of pressure in the bubble (after the film-boiling).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The movable member <b>31</b> which was displaced to the second position is quickly returned to an initial position shown in FIG. 65A (first position) by negative pressure due to contraction of the bubble <b>40</b> and a restoring force due to the elasticity of the movable member <b>31</b> itself. Further, when the bubble is disappeared, in order to compensate the contracted volume of the bubble <b>40</b> at the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and to compensate the volume of the discharged liquid, the liquid flows into the bubble generating area from the upstream side (B), i.e., from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> as shown by the arrows V<sub>D1</sub>, V<sub>D2 </sub>and from the discharge port <b>18</b> as shown by the arrow V<sub>C</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the operation of the movable member <b>31</b> in response to the formation of the bubble <b>40</b> and the liquid discharging operation were explained, now, refilling of the liquid in the liquid discharging head of the present invention will be fully explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid supplying mechanism in the present invention will be fully described with reference to FIGS. 65A, <b>65</b>B, <b>65</b>C and <b>65</b>D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the condition shown in FIG. 65C, when the bubble <b>40</b> is being contracted from the maximum volume condition, the liquid compensating the reduced bubble volume flows into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> from the discharge port <b>18</b> of the liquid passage <b>10</b> and from the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> associated with the liquid supply passage <b>12</b>. In the conventional liquid passage design not having the movable member <b>31</b>, an amount of liquid flowing toward the discharge port <b>18</b> into the reduced bubble position and an amount of liquid flowing toward the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> into the reduced bubble position depend upon flow resistance between the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and the discharge port <b>18</b>, and, flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> (i.e., depend upon resistances of the liquid passages and inertia of the liquid).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, when the flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the discharge port <b>18</b> is smaller than the flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the common liquid chamber, the greater amount of liquid flows into the reduced bubble position from the discharge port <b>18</b>, thereby increasing a retard amount of meniscus M. In particular, the smaller the flow resistance between the bubble generating area and the discharge port <b>18</b> (to enhance the discharging efficiency), the greater the retard amount of the meniscus M, thereby increasing the refilling time to affect a bad influence upon the high speed recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To the contrary, in the illustrated embodiment, since the movable member <b>31</b> is provided, when it is assumed that a volume portion (above the first position) of the volume W of the bubble is W<b>1</b> and a volume portion (below the first position, i.e., toward the bubble generating area <b>11</b>) of the volume W of the bubble is W<b>2</b>, the retard of the meniscus M is stopped at the time when the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to its initial position during the reduction of the bubble. And, the liquid corresponding to the remaining volume W<b>2</b> is mainly supplied from the liquid flow V<sub>D2 </sub>in the liquid supply passage <b>12</b>. In this way, the retard amount of the meniscus M can be suppressed to about a half of the volume portion W<b>1</b>; incidentally, in the conventional techniques, the retard amount of the meniscus M was about a half of the entire volume W of the bubble.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, since the liquid corresponding to the volume portion W<b>2</b> can forcibly be supplied mainly from the upstream side of the supply passage <b>12</b> (V<sub>D2</sub>) along the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> by utilizing the negative pressure during the disappearance of the bubble, the refilling time can be shortened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the refill is effected by utilizing the negative pressure during the disappearance of the bubble in the conventional head, the fluctuation of the meniscus becomes great to cause the deterioration of the image quality. To the contrary, in the high speed refill according to the illustrated embodiment, since the flowing of the liquid in the liquid passage <b>10</b> near the discharge port <b>18</b> into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> near the discharge port <b>18</b> is suppressed by the movable member <b>31</b>, the fluctuation of the meniscus M can be minimized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this way, according to the present invention, since the high speed refill is achieved by the forcible refill of the liquid into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> from the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> and suppression of the retard or fluctuation of the meniscus, the stable liquid discharging and high speed repeat discharging can be realized, and, when applied to the recording field, the high quality image and high speed recording can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the arrangement according to the present invention, there is also provided the following effective function. That is to say, the transmission of the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble to the upstream side (back-wave) can be suppressed. The pressure of the bubble portion (near the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> (upstream side)) of the bubble <b>40</b> generated on the heat generating element <b>2</b> tends to push the liquid back to the upstream side (to cause the back-wave). The back-wave creates upstream pressure, upstream movement of the liquid and an inertia force due to the liquid movement, which resist the refill of the liquid into the liquid passage <b>10</b>, thereby affecting a bad influence upon the high speed recording. In the present invention, since such upstream pressure, upstream liquid movement and inertia force can be suppressed by the movable member <b>31</b>, the refill ability can be further improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a further characteristic construction and advantage therefor in the illustrated embodiment will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid supply passage <b>12</b> according to the illustrated embodiment has an inner wall flatly contiguous to (i.e., flush with) the heat generating element <b>2</b> at the upstream side of the heat generating element <b>2</b>. In such a case, the supply of the liquid to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and the surface of the heat generating element <b>2</b> is effected along the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> (as flow V<sub>D2</sub>). Thus, stagnation of liquid on the heat generating element <b>2</b> is prevented, with the result that gas included in the liquid and the residual bubble can easily be removed and excessive accumulation of heat in the liquid can be avoided. Accordingly, more stable formation of bubble can be repeated at a high speed. Incidentally, in the illustrated embodiment, while an example that the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> has a substantially flat inner wall was explained, the inner wall of the liquid supply passage is not limited to such an example, but may have a gentle slope or other shape smoothly contiguous to the surface of the heat generating element to prevent the stagnation of liquid on the heat generating element and disturbance of the supplied liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the liquid is supplied into the bubble generating area <b>11</b> from the direction V<sub>D1 </sub>through the side (slit <b>35</b>) of the movable member <b>31</b>. However, a large movable member <b>31</b> for covering the entire bubble generating area <b>11</b> (covering the surface of the heat generating element) as shown in FIGS. 65A, <b>65</b>B, <b>65</b>C and <b>65</b>D is used to direct the pressure of the bubble to the discharge port <b>18</b> more effectively. In this case, after the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to the first position, if the flow resistance between the bubble generating area <b>11</b> and an area (near the discharge port <b>18</b>) of the liquid passage <b>10</b> becomes great, the flow of the liquid from the direction V<sub>D1 </sub>to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> is blocked. However, in the head arrangement according to the illustrated embodiment, since the liquid is supplied to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> from the direction V<sub>D2</sub>, the liquid supply ability is extremely improved. Thus, even when the arrangement wherein the bubble generating area <b>11</b> is covered by the movable member <b>31</b> to improve the discharging efficiency is used, the liquid supplying ability is not worsened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By the way, regarding the positions of the free end <b>32</b> and the fulcrum <b>33</b> of the movable member <b>31</b>, for example, as shown in FIGS. 65A, <b>65</b>B, <b>65</b>C and <b>65</b>D, the free end <b>32</b> is disposed at a downstream side of the fulcrum <b>33</b>. With this arrangement, when the bubble is being formed, the pressure transmitting direction and the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> can be oriented or directed toward the discharge port <b>18</b> effectively. Further, this positional relation not only contributes the improvement of the discharging efficiency or ability but also reduces flow resistance of the liquid flowing through the liquid passage <b>10</b> during the supply of liquid, thereby achieving the high speed refill. The reason is that, when the meniscus M retarded due to the liquid discharging is restored toward the discharge port <b>18</b> by a capillary phenomenon and/or when the liquid is supplied to compensate the disappeared bubble, the free end <b>32</b> and the fulcrum <b>33</b> are arranged not to resist against the liquid flows Sl, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b> flowing in the liquid passage <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in FIGS. 65A, <b>65</b>B, <b>65</b>C and <b>65</b>D, as mentioned above, regarding the heat generating element <b>2</b>, the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> extends up to the position downstream of the center <b>3</b> of the area of the heat generating element <b>2</b> (i.e., downstream of the line passing through the center of the area of the heat generating element and extending perpendicular to the length of the liquid passage <b>10</b>). Thus, the pressure and the downstream portion of the bubble <b>40</b> which are generated at the downstream side of the center <b>3</b> of the area of the heat generating element and greatly contribute to the liquid discharging are supported by the movable member <b>31</b>, with the result that the pressure and the bubble are directed toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, thereby improving the discharging efficiency and discharging force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, by utilizing the upstream portion of the bubble, various advantages can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in the illustrated embodiment, the momentary mechanical displacement of the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> also contributes to the improvement of the liquid discharging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Twentieth Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 68 is a schematic sectional view of a liquid discharging head according to a twentieth embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 69 is a schematic sectional view of the liquid discharging head of FIG. 68, looked at from a discharge port side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this twenty embodiment, upright wall portions <b>31</b> <i>a </i>extending toward the heat generating element <b>2</b> are integrally formed with both lateral edges of a movable member <b>31</b> similar to that of the nineteenth embodiment. The upright wall portions <b>31</b> <i>a </i>are disposed outside of the bubble generating area <b>11</b> in a width-wise direction of the movable member <b>31</b> so that both sides of the bubble generated in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> are covered by the upright wall portions <b>31</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With this arrangement, when the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced, as is in the nineteenth embodiment, the resistance of the liquid in the liquid passage <b>10</b> is reduced and the bubble pressure is prevented from escaping laterally, thereby utilizing the bubble pressure to the displacement of the movable member <b>31</b> more effectively. Further, since the release of pressure toward directions other than the discharge port direction due to the displacement of the movable member <b>31</b> is suppressed to effectively direct the bubble pressure toward the discharge port <b>18</b>, the pressure of the bubble contributes to the liquid discharging more effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Twenty-first Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 70 is a schematic sectional view of a liquid discharging head according to a twenty-first embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also in this embodiment, although a movable member <b>31</b> similar to that of the nineteenth embodiment, a thickness of the movable member is gradually decreased from the fulcrum <b>33</b> to the free end <b>32</b>. With this arrangement, when the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced, since the resistance of the liquid in the liquid passage <b>10</b> becomes further small and the free end <b>32</b> can be greatly displaced, the bubble can positively be grown toward the discharge port <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Twenty-second Embodiment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, a twenty-second embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. 71, <b>72</b>, <b>73</b>A and <b>73</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also in this embodiment, although the main liquid discharging principle is the same as the previous embodiments, in this embodiment, the liquid passage has a multi-passage structure so that the liquid in which the bubble is formed by applying the heat (bubble liquid) can be isolated from the liquid to be discharged (discharge liquid).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 71 is a schematic sectional view of a liquid passage structure of a liquid discharging head according to this embodiment, and FIG. 72 is a partial fragmental perspective view of the liquid discharging head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid discharging head according to this embodiment includes an element substrate <b>1</b> on which heat generating elements <b>2</b> for applying thermal energy for forming a bubble in the liquid are arranged, a second liquid passage <b>16</b> for the bubble liquid disposed on the element substrate <b>1</b>, and a first liquid passage <b>14</b> for the discharge liquid directly communicated with the discharge port <b>18</b> and disposed above the second liquid passage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An upstream side portion of the first liquid passage <b>14</b> is communicated with a first common liquid chamber <b>15</b> for supplying the discharge liquid to a plurality of first liquid passages <b>14</b>, and an upstream side portion of the second liquid passage <b>16</b> is communicated with a second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> for supplying the bubble liquid to a plurality of second liquid passages <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A separation wall <b>30</b> made of material having elasticity such as metal is disposed between the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and the second liquid passage <b>16</b> to isolate the first liquid passage <b>14</b> from the second liquid passage <b>16</b>. Incidentally, when the mixing between the bubble liquid and the discharge liquid is desired to prevent as much as possible, the liquid in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> is isolated from the liquid in the second liquid passage <b>16</b> by the separation wall <b>30</b> as much as possible; whereas, when the bubble liquid and the discharge liquid may be mixed to some extent, the separation wall <b>30</b> may not have the perfect separation function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A portion of the separation wall <b>30</b> positioned in an upper projection space regarding the heat generating element <b>2</b> (referred to as “discharge pressure generating area” hereinafter; an area A and an area B of the bubble generating area <b>11</b> in FIG. 71) constitutes a movable member <b>31</b> (supported in a cantilever fashion) having a free end <b>32</b> opened toward the discharge port <b>18</b> (i.e., toward a downstream side in the liquid flowing direction) through a slit <b>35</b>, and a fulcrum <b>33</b> disposed at the common liquid chamber (<b>15</b>, <b>17</b>) side. Since the movable member <b>31</b> is disposed in a confronting relation to the bubble generating area <b>11</b> (B), the movable member is moved (as shown by the arrow) by the bubble in the bubble liquid to be opened toward the discharge port <b>18</b> in the first liquid passage <b>14</b>. In FIG. 72, the separation wall <b>30</b> is disposed, with the interposition of a space for defining a second liquid passage, on the element substrate <b>1</b> on which heat generating resistance bodies as the heat generating elements <b>2</b> and electrodes <b>5</b> for applying an electrical signal to the heat generating body are disposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The positional relation between the fulcrum <b>33</b> and the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> are the same as the former embodiments. Further, regarding the cross-section of the movable member <b>31</b>, as is in the previous embodiment, a width of the movable member is gradually decreased from the surface facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b> to the opposite surface, so that, when the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced, the resistance to the liquid in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> becomes smaller.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, while the structural relation between the liquid supply passage <b>12</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> was explained in the previous embodiments, also in this embodiments, a structural relation between the second liquid passage <b>16</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b> is the same as the above-mentioned structural relation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, an operation of the liquid discharging head according to this embodiment will be explained with reference to FIGS. 73A and 73B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Regarding the operation of the head, as the discharge liquid supplied to the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and the bubble liquid supplied to the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, the same water-base ink is used. When the bubble liquid in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> in the second liquid passage <b>16</b> is subjected to the heat from the heat generating element <b>2</b>, as is in the former embodiments, a bubble <b>40</b> is formed in the bubble liquid by film-boiling phenomenon as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,723,129.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, since the bubble pressure cannot escape except through the upstream side of the bubble generating area <b>11</b>, the pressure caused by the formation of the bubble is concentrated and transmitted toward the movable member <b>31</b> disposed at the discharge pressure generating portion, so that, as the bubble <b>40</b> is growing, the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced from a condition shown in FIG. 73A to a condition shown in FIG. 73B toward the first liquid passage <b>14</b>. This movement of the movable member <b>31</b> causes the second liquid passage <b>16</b> to greatly communicate with the first liquid passage <b>14</b>, with the result that the pressure of the bubble <b>40</b> is mainly transmitted to a direction toward the discharge port in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> (i.e., direction A). The liquid is discharged from the discharge port by such transmission of the pressure and the mechanical displacement of the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, as the bubble <b>40</b> is being disappeared, the movable member <b>31</b> is returned to the condition shown in FIG. 73A, and, in the first liquid passage <b>14</b>, the discharge liquid corresponding to an amount of the discharged liquid is supplied from the upstream side. Also in this embodiment, since the supply of the discharge liquid is effected toward a direction for closing the movable member <b>31</b> as is in the former embodiments, the refill of the discharge liquid is not prevented by the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the function and advantage regarding the easy displacement of the movable member <b>31</b>, the transmission of the bubble pressure due to the displacement of the movable member <b>31</b>, the growing direction of the bubble <b>40</b> and the prevention of the back-wave in this embodiment are the same as the first embodiment, the two-liquid passage structure of this embodiment further provides the following advantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is to say, according to the arrangement of this embodiment, since the discharge liquid and the bubble liquid are isolated from each other, the discharge liquid can be discharged by the pressure of the bubble formed in the bubble liquid. Thus, even when high-viscous liquid such as polyethylene or glycol in which a bubble is not adequately formed and provides only poor discharging force is used, by supplying such high-viscous liquid in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and by supplying liquid (mixture of ethanol:water=4:6; about 1-2 cp) or low boiling point liquid in which a bubble can easily be formed in the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, the good discharging can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, by selecting liquid in which deposit due to heat is not accumulated on the surface of the heat generating element <b>2</b> as the bubble liquid, the formation of the bubble can be stabilized and good discharging can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, since the head according to this embodiment provides the advantages same as the former embodiments, the liquid such as high-viscous liquid can be discharged with high discharging efficiency and high discharging force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, even when liquid having poor resistance to heat is used, by supplying such liquid in the first liquid passage <b>14</b> and by supplying liquid having good resistance to heat and facilitating the formation of the bubble in the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, the liquid can be discharged with high discharging efficiency and high discharging force and without thermal damage of the liquid.</div>
<heading>Other Embodiments</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the embodiments regarding the liquid discharging head and liquid discharging method of the present invention were explained, now, examples applicable to the above embodiments will be explained. Incidentally, hereinbelow, although explanation is made regarding the embodiment of one-passage type or the embodiment of two-passage type in some cases, the other cases can be applied to both embodiments of one-passage type and of two-passage type.</div>
<heading>Configuration of Ceiling of Liquid Passage</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 24 is a sectional view of a liquid passage structure of the liquid discharging head according to the present invention. A grooved member <b>50</b> having a groove for constituting the first liquid passage <b>14</b> (or liquid passage <b>10</b> in FIGS. 1A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D) is provided on the separation wall <b>30</b>. In this example, a ceiling of the liquid passage at a position near the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> is elevated so that a displacement angle θ of the movable member <b>31</b> can be greater. Although the displacement range of the movable member <b>31</b> may be determined in consideration of the structure of the liquid passage, durability of the movable member <b>31</b> and the force of the bubble, it is desirable that the movable member can be displaced up to an angle including an axial angle of the discharge port <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, as shown, by selecting so that the displacement height of the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> becomes greater than the diameter of the discharge port <b>18</b>, more adequate discharging force can be transmitted. Further, as shown, since the height of the ceiling of the liquid passage at the free end <b>32</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> is higher than the height of the ceiling of the liquid passage at the fulcrum <b>33</b> of the movable member <b>31</b>, the upstream escape of the pressure wave due to the displacement of the movable member <b>31</b> can be prevented more effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the structure of the movable member <b>31</b>, although a design including the thin diaphragm having the expansion/contraction portions and a design including the side walls can be used, when the displacement angle θ of the movable member <b>31</b> can be greater, in case of the structure including the side walls, the heights of the side walls must be increased in accordance with the displacement angle θ of the movable member <b>31</b> in order to positively cover the both sides of the growing bubble <b>40</b>. Accordingly, the height of the second liquid passage <b>16</b> is also increased in accordance with the heights of the side walls, with the result that, since the thickness of the entire liquid discharging head is increased accordingly, it is preferable that the design including the thin diaphragm having the expansion/contraction portions is applied to the structure of the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<heading>Positional Relation Between Second Liquid Passage and Movable Member</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 25A, <b>25</b>B and <b>25</b>C are views for explaining a positional relation between the movable member <b>31</b> and the second liquid passage <b>16</b>. In this case, the movable member <b>31</b> includes the thin diaphragm having the expansion/contraction portions <b>60</b>. FIG. 25A shows the separation wall <b>30</b> and the movable member <b>31</b> looked at from the above, and FIG. 25B shows the second liquid passage <b>16</b> (but, the separation wall <b>30</b> is removed) looked at from the above. FIG. 25C schematically shows a positional relation between the movable member <b>31</b> and the second liquid passage <b>16</b> in an overlapped condition. Incidentally, these figures front faces below which the discharge ports are disposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, FIGS. 64A, <b>64</b>B and <b>64</b>C are views for explaining a positional relation between the movable member <b>31</b> and the second liquid passage <b>16</b> according to the above-mentioned fifteenth to eighteenth embodiments. FIG. 64A shows the separation wall <b>30</b> and the movable member <b>31</b> looked at from the above, and FIG. 64B shows the second liquid passage <b>16</b> (but, the separation wall <b>30</b> is removed) looked at from the above. FIG. 64C schematically shows a positional relation between the movable member <b>31</b> and the second liquid passage <b>16</b> in an overlapped condition. Incidentally, these figures front faces below which the discharge ports are disposed. Further, a triangular portion of the movable member <b>31</b> shows an outline of a convex portion formed on the opposite surface (upper surface) when the recessed portion is formed in the surface of the movable member <b>31</b> facing to the heat generating element <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIGS. 74A, <b>74</b>B, <b>74</b>C and <b>74</b>D are alterations of the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 67, and, in each alteration, a surface of the movable member facing the heat generating element is flat and a opposite surface is changed in configuration. Movable members <b>31</b> shown in FIGS. 74E, <b>74</b>F, <b>74</b>G and <b>74</b>H are alterations of the movable members shown in FIGS. 74A, <b>74</b>B, <b>74</b>C and <b>74</b>D, in which each surface facing to the heat generating element has the same configuration as that of the opposite surface and both lateral ends of each movable member are protruded toward the heat generating element more than a central portion of the movable member. With these arrangements, the same advantage as that of the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 8 can be achieved. In a movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 74I, upright walls are added to both lateral ends of the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. <b>74</b>A. This is an alteration of the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The second liquid passage <b>16</b> has a restriction <b>19</b> at the upstream side of the heat generating element <b>2</b> (at an upstream side in the large flow directing from the second common liquid chamber through the heat generating element, movable member and first liquid passage to the discharge port), thereby providing a chamber (bubble liquid chamber) structure for suppressing the easy escape of the pressure of the bubble toward the upstream side of the second liquid passage <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As is in the conventional heads, in case of a head in which a liquid passage for the bubble liquid and a liquid passage for the discharge liquid are common and a restriction is provided for preventing pressure of a bubble generated in a liquid chamber by a heat generating element from escaping toward a common liquid chamber, it is necessary that area of flow at the restriction is no so large in consideration of the refill of the liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To the contrary, in the illustrated embodiment, since the discharge liquid in the first liquid passage is mainly discharged and the bubble liquid in the second liquid passage including the heat generating element <b>2</b> is almost not consumed, a refilling amount of liquid in the bubble generating area of the second liquid passage may be less. Accordingly, since the gap at the restriction can greatly be reduced to several μm−ten-odd μm, the bubble pressure generated in the second liquid passage <b>16</b> can be prevented from escaping therearound, thereby concentrating the bubble pressure toward the movable member <b>31</b>. Further, since the pressure can be used for the liquid discharging through the movable member <b>31</b>, high discharging efficiency and high discharging force can be achieved. However, the configuration of the second liquid passage <b>16</b> is not limited to the above-mentioned one, but may be selected to transmit the bubble pressure to the movable member <b>31</b> effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Both sides of the movable member <b>31</b> cover portions of walls defining the second liquid passage <b>16</b>. With this arrangement, the movable member <b>31</b> can be prevented from dropping in the second liquid passage <b>16</b>. As a result, the separation between the discharge liquid and the bubble liquid is further improved. Further, since the escaping of liquid through the slit <b>35</b> can be suppressed, the discharging force and discharging efficiency can be improved. In addition, the refilling effect due to the negative pressure during the disappearance of bubble (for supplying the liquid from the upstream side) can be enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, in FIGS. 15B, <b>24</b> and <b>59</b>B, when the movable member <b>31</b> is displaced toward the first liquid passage <b>14</b>, a portion of the bubble <b>40</b> generated in the bubble generating area <b>11</b> of the second liquid passage <b>16</b> extends into the first liquid passage <b>14</b>. By selecting the height of the second liquid passage <b>16</b> so that the bubble <b>40</b> can extend into the first liquid passage, the discharging force can be improved, in comparison with the case where the bubble <b>40</b> cannot extend. In order to permit the bubble <b>40</b> to extend into the first liquid passage <b>14</b>, it is desirable that the height of the second liquid passage <b>16</b> is smaller than a height of a maximum bubble. This height is preferably several μm to 30 μm. In the illustrated embodiment, the height is selected to 15 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the illustrated embodiment, while the movable member <b>31</b> having the extension/contraction portions <b>60</b> was explained, the movable member <b>31</b> having the side walls <b>66</b> as shown in FIGS. 16, <b>17</b>A, <b>17</b>B, <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B may be used. In this case, portions designated by the reference numeral <b>60</b> in FIGS. 25A, <b>25</b>B and <b>25</b>C constitute the slit <b>35</b>, and the movable member <b>31</b> is defined by the slit <b>35</b>. Further, the side walls <b>66</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> are disposed inside of the second liquid passage <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The material for forming the movable member <b>31</b> and the separation wall <b>30</b> is insoluble to the bubble liquid and the discharge liquid and has elasticity permitting good operation of the movable member <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The material for the movable member <b>31</b> may be durable metal such as silver, nickel, gold, iron, titanium, aluminium, platinum, tantalum, stainless steel and bronze phosphite and its alloys, or, resin including nitrile group such as acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene, or, resin including amide group such as polyamide, or, resin including calboxyl group such as polycarbonate, or, resin including aldehyde group such as polyacetal, or, resin including sulfone group such as polysulfone, or, other resins such as crystalliquid polymer and their compounds, or ink-resistance metal such as gold, tungsten, tantalum, nickel, stainless steel and titanium and its alloys. Regarding the ink-resistance, materials on which such metal is coated, or, resin including amide group such as polyamide, or, resin including aldehyde group such as polyacetal, or, resin including ketone group such as polyether-etherketone, or, resin including imide group such polyimide, or, resin including hydro-group such as phenol resin, or, resin including ethyl group such as polyethylene, or, resin including alkyl group such as polypropylene, or, resin including epoxy group such as epoxy resin, or, resin including amino group such as melamine resin, or, resin including methylol group such as xylene resin and their compounds, or, ceramics such as silicon dioxide and its compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The material for the separation wall <b>30</b> may be insoluble resin having good heat-resistance and good molding ability (for example, engineering plastics) such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polyethylene terephthalate, melamine resin, phenol resin, epoxy resin, polybutadiene, polyurethane, polyether-etherketone, polyether-sulfone, polyallylate, polyimide, polysulfone, liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and their compounds, or, metal such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, nickel, gold and stainless steel and its alloys and compounds, or, materials on which titanium or gold is coated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, while a width of the slit <b>35</b> was selected to 2 μm in the illustrated embodiment, when the bubble liquid differs from the bubble liquid and the mixing of these liquids is desired to be prevented, the width of the slit may be selected so that the meniscus is formed between the liquids to suppress the mixing of liquids. For example, when liquid having about 2 cp (centipoise) is used as the bubble liquid and liquid having 100 cp or more is used as the discharge liquid, although the mixing of liquids can be prevented by a slit <b>35</b> of about 35 μm, the slit is preferably 3 μm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, although a thickness of the separation wall <b>30</b> may be determined in consideration of its material and configuration to achieve the adequate strength as the separation wall <b>30</b>, the thickness is preferably about 0.5-10 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the illustrated embodiment, the thickness of the movable member is in the order of μm (t μm), and the thickness of the movable member in the order of cm is not required. Regarding the movable member having the thickness in the order of μm, when the slit having a width (W μm) in the order of μm is formed, it is desirable that manufacturing tolerance is considered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When a thickness of the free end of the movable member in which the slit is formed and/or a thickness of a member facing to the lateral ends is the same as the thickness of the movable member (FIGS. 15A, <b>15</b>B, <b>24</b> and the like), a relation between the thickness and the width of the slit is selected within the following range in consideration of the manufacturing tolerance of unevenness so that the mixing of the liquids can stably be suppressed. Thus, from the view point of design, when high viscous ink (for example, 5 cp, 10 cp) is used in association with the bubble liquid having viscosity of 3 cp or less, by satisfying a relation W/t≦1, the mixing of two liquids can be prevented for a long time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to achieve a “substantially sealed condition” in the present invention, the slit may be in the order of several μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned above, when the bubble liquid is isolated from the discharge liquid, the movable member acts as a partition. When the movable member is shifted during the growth of the bubble, a very small amount of the bubble liquid is mixed with the discharge liquid. In case of ink jet recording, when it is considered that the discharge liquid for forming an image normally has color density of about 3%-5%, if the bubble liquid of 20% or less is mixed with the discharge liquid, the change intensity does not occur. Accordingly, in the present invention, even if the bubble liquid is mixed with the discharge liquid, a mixing amount of the bubble liquid with the discharge liquid is suppressed below 20%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, it was found that, even when the viscosity is changed, the mixing amount of the bubble liquid was 15% at the maximum, and, regarding the liquid having 5 cps or less, the maximum mixing amount was about 10%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Particularly, the smaller the viscosity of the discharge liquid (20 cps or less) the smaller the mixing amount (for example, 5% or less).</div>
<heading>Movable Member and Separation Wall</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 26A, <b>26</b>B and <b>26</b>C show another configurations of the movable member <b>31</b>. FIG. 26A shows a rectangular movable member, FIG. 26B shows a movable member having a narrower fulcrum to facilitate the displacement of he movable member <b>31</b>, and FIG. 26C shows a movable ember having a wider fulcrum to improve the durability f the movable member <b>31</b>. Regarding a configuration providing good displacement and durability, as shown in FIG. 25A, a movable member including a fulcrum having a concave narrower portion is desirable. However, the movable member may have any configuration so long as the movable member does not penetrate into the second liquid passage <b>16</b> and can easily be displaced and has good durability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 60A, <b>60</b>B, <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B, <b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B, <b>63</b>A and <b>63</b>B show various configurations of the movable member. FIGS. 60A, <b>61</b>A, <b>62</b>A and <b>63</b>A are end views of the movable member <b>31</b>, looked at from the free end <b>32</b>, and FIGS. 60B, <b>61</b>B, <b>62</b>B and <b>63</b>B are side views of the movable member <b>31</b> and the heat generating element <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIGS. 60A and 60B, the recessed portion <b>60</b> has a rectangular cross-section, and its width and depth are gradually decreased from the free end <b>32</b> to the fulcrum <b>33</b>. Further, a terminal end of the recessed portion <b>60</b> near the fulcrum <b>33</b> is positioned at an upstream side of the heat generating element <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIGS. 61A and 61B, the recessed portion <b>60</b> has a triangular cross-section, and its width and depth are gradually decreased from the free end <b>32</b> th the fulcrum <b>33</b>. Further, a terminal end of the recessed portion <b>60</b> near the fulcrum <b>33</b> is positioned at a downstream side of the heat generating element <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIGS. 62A and 62B, the recessed portion <b>60</b> has a semi-circular cross-section, and its width and depth are constant. Further, a terminal end of the recessed portion <b>60</b> near the fulcrum <b>33</b> is positioned at an upstream side of the heat generating element <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIGS. 63A and 63B, a configuration of the recessed portion <b>60</b> is the same as that shown in FIGS. 62A and 62B, but, a terminal end of the recessed portion <b>60</b> near the fulcrum <b>33</b> is positioned at an upstream side of both the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the fulcrum <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the movable members <b>31</b> shown in FIGS. 60A, <b>60</b>B, <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B, <b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B, <b>63</b>A and <b>63</b>B, the bubble pressure can be directed to the discharge port efficiently. Particularly, in the movable members <b>31</b> shown in FIGS. 60A, <b>60</b>B, <b>61</b>A and <b>61</b>B in which the width and depth of the recessed portion <b>60</b> are gradually decreased toward the fulcrum, the bubble pressure can be directed to the discharge port more efficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a positional relation between the heat generating element and the movable member in the head will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, configurations, dimensions and number of the movable member and heat generating element are not limited to the following example. The bubble pressure can be used as the discharging force effectively by selecting optimum positional relation between the heat generating element and the movable member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the conventional techniques regarding the ink jet recording system. i.e., so-called bubble jet recording system in which change in state of ink including abrupt change in volume (generation of bubble) is caused by supplying energy such as heat to the ink and the ink is discharged from a discharge port by an action force based on the change in state to adhere the ink onto a recording medium, as shown in FIG. 27, although an area of the heat generating element is proportional to the ink discharge amount, there is a non-effective bubble generating area S which does not contribute to the ink discharging. Further, it can be under stood that such a non-effective bubble generating area S is situated at a peripheral portion of the heat generating element by checking the deposit on the heat generating element. From these results, it has seen recognized that a peripheral zone, having a width of about 4 μm, of the heat generating element does not contribute to the generation of the bubble.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, in order to effectively utilize the bubble pressure, it is effective that a portion of the bubble generating area except for the peripheral zone having the width of about 4 μm is covered by the movable portion of the movable member from the above. In the illustrated embodiment, while an example that the effective bubble generating zone is considered as the portion of the bubble generating area except for the peripheral zone having the width of about 4 μm was explained, depending upon the kind and/or manufacturing method of the heat generating element, the effective zone is not limited to the above example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 28A and 28B are schematic plan views showing conditions that a movable member <b>31</b> <i>a </i>(FIG. 28A) and a movable member <b>31</b> <i>b </i>(FIG. 28B) which have different area of the movable portion are arranged on the heat generating element <b>2</b> having a dimension of 58×150 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The movable member <b>31</b> <i>a </i>has a dimension of 53×145 μm which is slightly smaller than that of the heat generating element <b>2</b> and is arranged to cover the effective bubble generating zone.

Regarding two movable members <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, durability and discharging efficiency were measured. The measuring condition was as follows:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">As a result of tests under such measuring condition, regarding the durability of the movable member, (a) when 1×10<sup>7 </sup>pulses are applied to the movable member <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, the fulcrum <b>33</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> <i>a </i>was damaged; whereas, (b) even after 3×10<sup>8 </sup>pulses were applied to the movable member <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, no damage was found. Further, kinetic energy determined from discharge amount and discharge speed regarding the applied energy was recognized to be improved by about 1.5-2.5 times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">From the above results, regarding both durability and discharging efficiency, it is preferable that the effective bubble generating zone is covered from the above and it is desirable that the area of the movable member is greater than the area of the heat generating element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 29 shows a relation between a distance from an edge of the heat generating element to the fulcrum of the movable member and the displacement amount of the movable member. Further, FIG. 30 is a side sectional view showing a relation between the heat generating element <b>2</b> and the movable member <b>31</b>. The heat generating element <b>2</b> having the dimension of 40×105 μm was used. It can be seen that the greater the distance from the edge of the heat generating element <b>2</b> to the fulcrum of the movable member <b>31</b> the greater the displacement amount. Accordingly, it is desirable that the optimum displacement amount is determined depending upon the required ink discharge amount, the liquid passage structure and the configuration of the heat generating element, and the position of the fulcrum <b>33</b> of the movable member <b>31</b> is determined thereby.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If the fulcrum of the movable member is positioned above the effective bubble generating zone of the heat generating element, since the fulcrum is directly subjected to stress due to the displacement of the movable member and the bubble pressure, the durability of the movable member will be worsened. According to the inventor's tests, it was found that in the case where the fulcrum is positioned above the effective bubble generating zone, when 1×10<sup>6 </sup>pulses are applied to the movable member, the movable wall is damaged, thereby reducing the durability. Therefore, by arranging the fulcrum of the movable member out of the effective bubble generating zone of the heat generating element, even a movable member having configuration and material having relatively small durability can be put to a practical use. However, even when the fulcrum is positioned above the effective bubble generating zone, by selecting the configuration and material of a movable member appropriately, the movable member can be used. With the above-mentioned arrangement, a liquid discharging head having high discharging efficiency and good durability can be obtained.</div>
<heading>Element Substrate</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, a construction of the element substrate on which the heat generating elements for applying the heat will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 31A and 31B are sectional views of the liquid discharging head according to the present invention, where FIG. 31A shows a head having a protection layer (cavitation-resistance layer) which will be described later and FIG. 31B shows a head having no protection layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Above the element substrate <b>1</b>, there are disposed the second liquid passage <b>16</b>, separation wall <b>30</b>, first liquid passage <b>14</b> and grooved member <b>50</b> having a groove defining the first liquid passage <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the element substrate <b>1</b>, silicon oxide film or silicon nitride film <b>106</b> (for the purpose of insulation and heat accumulation) is formed on a silicone substrate, and an electric resistance layer <b>105</b> (having a thickness of 0.01-0.2 μm) (constituting the heat generating elements <b>2</b>) formed from hafnium boride (HfB<sub>2</sub>), tantalum nitride (TaN) or tantalum aluminium (TaAl) and wiring electrodes <b>104</b> (having a thickness of 0.2-1.0 μm) made of aluminium are patterned on the film <b>106</b>. By applying voltage from two wiring electrodes <b>104</b> to the electric resistance layer <b>105</b>, current flows through the electric resistance layer <b>105</b>, thereby generating heat. On the electric resistance layer <b>105</b>, between the wiring electrodes <b>104</b>, there is provided a protection layer <b>103</b> (having a thickness of 0.1-2.0 μm) made of silicon oxide or silicon nitride, and a cavitation-resistance layer <b>102</b> (having a thickness of 0.1-0.6 μm) made of tantalum is formed on the protection layer, thereby protecting the electric resistance layer <b>105</b> from various liquid such as ink.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Particularly, since the pressure and shock wave generated during the formation and disappearance of the bubble are very strong and worsens the durability of fragile oxide films, metal material such as tantalum (Ta) is used for forming the cavitation-resistance layer <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, by combining the liquids, liquid passage structure and resistance material appropriately, the cavitation-resistance layer <b>102</b> can be omitted. Such an example is shown in FIG. <b>31</b>B. The material of the electric resistance layer <b>105</b> capable of omitting the cavitation-resistance layer may be iridium/tantalum/aluminium alloy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this way, as the construction of the heat generating element <b>2</b> in the former embodiments, only the electric resistance layer (heat generating portion) <b>105</b> disposed between the wiring electrodes <b>104</b> may be used, or the protection layer <b>103</b> for protecting electric resistance layer <b>105</b> may be added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the illustrated embodiment, while an example that the heat generating portion formed from the electric resistance layer <b>105</b> capable of generating heat in response to the electrical signal is used as the heat generating element <b>2</b> was explained, the heat generating element is not limited to such an example, but any element for generating the bubble sufficient to discharge the discharge liquid in the bubble liquid may be used. For example, a heat generating element having an optothermal converter capable of generating heat by receiving light such as laser light or a heat generating element having a heat generating body capable of generating heat by receiving a high frequency wave may be used as the heat generating portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, in the element substrate <b>1</b>, as well as the electrothermal converter constituted by the electric resistance layer <b>105</b> forming the heat generating portion and the wiring electrodes <b>104</b> for supplying the electrical signal to the electric resistance layer <b>105</b>, function elements (for selectively driving the electrothermal converter) such as a transistor, diode, latch and shift-resistor are integrally incorporated by a semi-conductor manufacturing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in order to discharge the liquid by driving the heat generating portion of the electrothermal converter provided on the element substrate <b>1</b>, a rectangular pulse shown in FIG. 32 is applied to the electric resistance layer <b>105</b> through the wiring electrodes <b>104</b>, thereby heating the electric resistance layer <b>105</b> between the wiring electrodes <b>104</b> quickly. In the heads of the previous embodiments, the heat generating element <b>2</b> is driven by applying voltage of 24V, pulse width of 7 μsec, current of 150 mA and electrical signal of 6 kHz, thereby discharging the liquid from the discharge port <b>18</b> under the above-mentioned operation. However, the condition of the drive signal is not limited to the above, but any drive signal capable of generating the bubble in the bubble liquid properly may be used.</div>
<heading>Head Structure of Two-liquid Passage Type</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, a structure of a liquid discharging head in which two different liquids can be introduced into the first and second common liquid chambers, respectively, and in which the number of parts can be reduced and “cost-down” can be achieved will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 33 is a schematic sectional view showing a construction of such liquid discharging head. The same elements as those in the previous embodiments are designated by the same reference numerals and detailed explanation thereof will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the illustrated embodiment, the grooved member <b>50</b> includes an orifice plate <b>51</b> having the discharge ports <b>18</b>, a plurality of grooves constituting a plurality of first liquid passages <b>14</b>, and a recessed portion constituting the first common liquid chamber <b>15</b> communicated with the plurality of first liquid passages <b>14</b> and adapted to supply the liquid (discharge) liquid to the plurality of first liquid passage <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By joining the separation wall <b>30</b> to a lower portion of the grooved member <b>50</b>, the plurality of first liquid passages <b>14</b> can be formed. The grooved member <b>50</b> has a first liquid supply passage <b>20</b> extending into the first common liquid chamber <b>15</b> from the above. Further, the grooved member <b>50</b> has a second liquid supply passage <b>21</b> extending into the second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> from the above through the separation wall <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown by the arrow C in FIG. 33, the first liquid (discharge liquid) is supplied to the first liquid passage <b>14</b> through the first liquid supply passage <b>20</b> and the first common liquid chamber <b>15</b>, and, as shown by the arrow D in FIG. 33, the second liquid (bubble liquid) is supplied to the second liquid passage <b>16</b> through the second liquid supply passage <b>21</b> and the second liquid chamber <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the illustrated embodiment, while an example that the second liquid supply passage <b>21</b> extends in parallel with the first liquid supply passage <b>20</b> was shown, the present invention is not limited to such an example, but, any arrangement of the second liquid supply passage <b>21</b> may be adopted so long as it extends into the second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> through the separation wall <b>30</b> disposed outside of the first common liquid chamber <b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, a magnitude (diameter) of the second liquid supply passage <b>21</b> is determined in consideration of the supply amount of the second liquid. The cross-sectional shape of the second liquid supply passage <b>21</b> is not limited to a circular shape, but may be rectangular.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> can be formed by partitioning the grooved member <b>50</b> by the separation wall <b>30</b>. As an example, as shown in FIG. 34 (exploded perspective view), the second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> and the second liquid passage <b>16</b> can be formed by forming a common liquid chamber frame <b>71</b> and a second liquid passage wall <b>72</b> on the element substrate <b>1</b> and then by joining an assembly of the separation wall <b>30</b> and the grooved member <b>50</b> to the element substrate <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the illustrated embodiment, the element substrate <b>1</b> on which the plurality of electrothermal converters (heat generating elements <b>2</b>) for generating the heat for forming the bubble in the bubble liquid by the film-boiling are arranged is disposed on a support <b>70</b> made of metal such as aluminium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the element substrate <b>1</b>, there are provided a plurality of grooves for constituting the second liquid passages <b>16</b> defined by the second liquid passage walls <b>72</b>, a recessed portion constituting the second common liquid chamber (common bubble liquid chamber) <b>17</b> communicated with the plurality of discharge liquid passages and adapted to supply the bubble liquid to the discharge liquid passages, and the separation wall <b>30</b> including the movable members <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The grooved member <b>50</b> includes the grooves for constituting the discharge liquid passages (first liquid passages) <b>14</b> by combining with the separation wall <b>30</b>, the recessed portion for constituting the first common liquid chamber (common discharge liquid chamber) <b>15</b> communicated with the discharge liquid passages and adapted to supply the discharge liquid to the discharge liquid passages, the first liquid supply passage (discharge liquid supply passage) <b>20</b> for supplying the discharge liquid to the first common liquid chamber <b>15</b>, and the second liquid supply passage (bubble liquid supply passage) <b>21</b> for supplying the bubble liquid to the second common liquid chamber <b>17</b>. The second liquid supply passage <b>21</b> is connected to a communication passage extending into the second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> through the separation wall <b>30</b> disposed outside of the first common liquid chamber <b>15</b>, and, by this communication passage, the bubble liquid can be supplied to the second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> without mixing with the discharge liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Regarding the positional relation between the element substrate, the separation wall <b>30</b> and the grooved member <b>50</b>, the movable members <b>31</b> are disposed in correspondence to the heat generating elements <b>2</b> of the element substrate <b>1</b>, and the discharge liquid passages <b>14</b> are arranged in correspondence to the movable members <b>31</b>. Further, in the illustrated embodiment, while an example that the single second liquid supply passage <b>21</b> is formed in the grooved member <b>50</b> was explained, a plurality of second liquid supply passages may be provided in accordance with the liquid supply amount. In addition, flow areas of the first and second liquid supply passages <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> may be determined in proportion to the liquid supply amount. Further, when the movable member <b>31</b> has the side walls <b>66</b> as shown in FIGS. 16, <b>17</b>A, <b>17</b>B, <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B, the grooves constituting the first liquid passages are not necessarily provided in the grooved member <b>50</b>. By optimizing the flow areas in this way, the parts constituting the grooved member <b>50</b> and the like can be made compact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned above, according to the present invention, since the second liquid supply passage <b>21</b> for supplying the second liquid to the second liquid passages <b>16</b> and the first liquid supply passage <b>20</b> for supplying the first liquid to the first liquid passages <b>14</b> are formed in the same grooved member <b>50</b>, the number of parts can be reduced, the number of manufacturing steps can be reduced and the “cost-down” can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, since the supply of the second liquid to the second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> communicated with the second liquid passages <b>16</b> is effected by the second liquid supply passage <b>21</b> extending through the separation wall <b>30</b>, the assembling between the separation wall <b>30</b>, grooved member <b>50</b> and element substrate <b>1</b> can be performed by a single step, thereby facilitating the manufacture, improving the assembling accuracy and achieving the good liquid discharging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, since the second liquid is supplied to the second common liquid chamber <b>17</b> through the separation wall <b>30</b>, the supply of the second liquid to the second liquid passages <b>16</b> is effected positively, and, thus, since the adequate liquid supply amount is ensured, the stable liquid discharging can be achieved.</div>
<heading>Discharge Liquid and Bubble Liquid</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned above, in the present invention, since the head has the above-mentioned movable members, the liquid can be discharged at high speed with higher discharging force and higher discharging efficiency than those in the conventional heads. When the same liquid is used as both bubble liquid and discharge liquid, various kinds of liquids can be used so long as the liquid is not deteriorated by the heat from the heat generating element, deposit from the liquid due to the heat is hard to be accumulated on the heat generating element, the reversible state change between evaporation and condensation can be permitted and the deterioration of liquid passage walls, movable members and separation wall can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among such liquids, as the recording liquid, ink having conventional composition utilized in the conventional bubble jet apparatuses can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, when the head of two-passage type is used and the discharge liquid is different from the bubble liquid, as the bubble liquid, the liquids having the above-mentioned features may be used. More specifically, the following liquids may be used: methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, toluene, xylene, methylene dichloride, trichlene, fleon TF, fleon BF, ethylether, dioxane, cyclohexane, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, acetone, methylethylketone, water and their compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Regarding the discharge liquid, various kinds of liquids can be used without bubbling ability and thermal features. Even liquid having low bubbling ability and liquid easy to be deteriorated by heat can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, if the liquid discharging, formation of the bubble and/or operation of the movable member are prevented by the feature of the discharge liquid and the reaction between the discharge liquid and the bubble liquid, such discharge liquid should not be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Regarding the recording discharge liquid, high viscous ink can be used. Further, medical liquids and scented water having poor resistance to heat can also be used as the discharge liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, as the recording liquid used as both the discharge liquid and the bubble liquid, ink having the following composition was used. As a result, since the discharging speed of ink was increased by enhancement of the discharging force, target accuracy of ink droplet was improved and a high quality image could be obtained.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">By the way, in case of the above-mentioned liquid which has conventionally been considered to be hard to discharge, since the discharging speed is small, unevenness in discharging direction was worsened and the target accuracy of ink dot was also worsened and there arose unevenness in discharge amount due to unstable discharging, which resulted in poor image. However, in the illustrated embodiment, by using the bubble liquid, the bubble can be generated stably and adequately. Thus, the target accuracy of the liquid droplet can be improved and the ink discharge amount can be stabilized, thereby improving the image quality greatly.</div>
<heading>Structure of Movable Member</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, some examples of a method for manufacturing the movable member which is most important characteristic of the present invention will be explained, among the above-mentioned embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">First of all, an example of a method for manufacturing the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 67 will be described with reference to FIGS. 75A to <b>75</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) Regist <b>1101</b> having a thickness of 0.5 μm is patterned on a SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b>. In case of regist having the thickness of 0.5 μm, when a width to be remained as the slit is 3 μm, a width of the regist <b>1101</b> to be patterned is 12 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) The SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> is electro-plated to form a nickel layer <b>1102</b> having a thickness of 5 μm on the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b>. Regarding electro-plating liquid, sulfonic acid nickel, stress reduction agent (“Zeorol”: trade mark; available from World Metal Inc.), boric acid, pit prevention agent (NP-APS available from World Metal Inc.) and nickel chloride are used. Regarding application of electric field upon electrodeposition, an electrode is attached to an anode and the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> on which the regist <b>1101</b> was patterned is attached to a cathode, and a temperature of the plating liquid is selected to 50° C. and current density is selected to 5 A/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Under this condition, when the nickel layer <b>1102</b> is grown, the nickel layer <b>1102</b> is growing (from the thickness of 5 μm) not only in a thickness direction but also in directions for covering the regist <b>1101</b>. And, when the total thickness becomes 5 μm, the nickel layer <b>1102</b> covers both side portions of the regist <b>1101</b> by a thickness of about 4.5 μm. As a result, on the regist <b>1101</b>, a gap having a width of 3 μm is formed along the pattern of the regist <b>1101</b>, and, a radius of curvature nickel layer at the gap in the thickness direction becomes 4.5 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(c) After the electro-plating is finished, the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> is subjected to ultrasonic vibration, so that the nickel layer <b>1102</b> is peeled from the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b>, thereby obtaining the movable member <b>31</b> having a width gradually decreased from the bottom to the top.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, although steps corresponding the removed regist <b>1101</b> are formed in a lower surface of the movable member <b>31</b>, since the heights of the steps are 0.5 μm, the lower surface of the movable member can be regarded as flatness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, an example of a method for manufacturing the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 74C will be described with reference to FIGS. 76A, <b>76</b>B, <b>76</b>C, <b>76</b>D and <b>76</b>E.</div>

Regarding electro-plating liquid, sulfonic acid nickel, stress reduction agent (“Zeorol”: trade mark; available from World Metal Inc.), boric acid, pit prevention agent (NP-APS available from World Metal Inc.) and nickel chloride are used. Regarding application of electric field upon electrodeposition, an electrode is attached to an anode and the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> on which the regist <b>1101</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1101</b> <i>b </i>were patterned is attached to a cathode, and a temperature of the plating liquid is selected to 50° C. and current density is selected to 5 A/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(c) Regist <b>1101</b> <i>b </i>having a thickness of 2.5 μm is patterned on the regist <b>1101</b> <i>a</i>. A width of the regist <b>1101</b> <i>b </i>is greater than the width of the regist <b>1101</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(d) The nickel layer <b>1102</b> <i>a </i>is subjected to the electro-plating again to form a second nickel layer having a thickness of 2.5 μm on the first nickel layer. The plating condition is the same as that of the first nickel layer <b>1102</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(e) After the regists <b>1101</b> <i>a</i>, <b>1101</b> <i>b </i>are removed, the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> is subjected to ultrasonic vibration, so that the first nickel layer <b>1102</b> <i>a </i>is peeled from the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b>, thereby obtaining the movable member <b>31</b> of two-layer type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, an example of a method for manufacturing the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 74D will be described with reference to FIGS. 77A, <b>77</b>B and <b>77</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) Regist <b>1101</b> having a thickness of 15 μm is patterned on a SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b>. In this case, the focus of exposure is deviated so that the regist <b>1101</b> has inclined side surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) The SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> is electro-plated to form a nickel layer <b>1102</b> having a thickness of 5 μm on the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph">(c) After the electroplating is finished, the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> is subjected to ultrasonic vibration, so that the nickel layer <b>1102</b> is peeled from the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b>. When the peeled nickel layer is inverted, a trapezoidal movable member <b>31</b> is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, an example of a method for manufacturing the movable member <b>31</b> shown in FIG. 74H will be described with reference to FIGS. 78A, <b>78</b>B, <b>78</b>C, <b>78</b>D, <b>78</b>E and <b>78</b>F.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) Regist <b>1101</b> <i>a </i>is patterned on a SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) The SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> on which the regist <b>1101</b> <i>a </i>was patterned is dipped into etching liquid (solution of iron (III) chloride or copper (II) chloride), thereby etching portions exposed from the regist <b>1101</b> <i>a</i>.

<heading>Manufacture of Liquid Discharging Head</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a method for manufacturing the liquid discharging head according to the present invention will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In case of the liquid discharging head as shown in FIG. 2, the bases <b>34</b> for attaching the movable member <b>31</b> to the element substrate <b>1</b> are formed by patterning dry film and the like, and the movable member <b>31</b> is bonded or welded to the bases <b>34</b>. Incidentally, although the movable member <b>31</b> is formed from the thin diaphragm, the method for manufacturing the thin diaphragm was already explained in connection with FIGS. 4A, <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C. Thereafter, the grooved member having the plurality of grooves constituting the liquid passages <b>10</b>, and the recessed portion constituting the discharge ports <b>18</b> and the common liquid chamber <b>13</b> is joined to the element substrate <b>1</b> in such a manner that the grooves are opposed to the movable members <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a method for manufacturing the liquid discharging head of two-passage type as shown in FIGS. 14 and 34 will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Briefly explaining, the walls for the second liquid passages <b>16</b> are formed on the element substrate <b>1</b>, and the separation wall <b>30</b> is attached onto the element substrate, and then, the grooved member <b>50</b> having the grooves constituting the first liquid passages <b>14</b> and the like is attached thereto. Alternatively, after the walls for the second liquid passages <b>16</b> were formed, the grooved member <b>50</b> to which the separation wall <b>30</b> was attached is joined to the walls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, a method for manufacturing the second liquid passages <b>16</b> will be fully explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 35A, <b>35</b>B, <b>35</b>C, <b>35</b>D and <b>35</b>E are schematic sectional views for explaining a first embodiment of a method for manufacturing the liquid discharging head of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 35A, after the electrothermal converters having the heat generating elements <b>2</b> made of hafnium boride or tantalum nitride are formed on the element substrate (silicon wafer) <b>1</b> by using the same manufacturing apparatus as that used in the semi-conductor manufacturing process, the surface of the element substrate <b>1</b> is cleaned in order to improve close contact ability between the substrate and photosensitive resin in a next process or step. Further, in order to improve the close contact ability, it is desirable that, after the surface of the element substrate <b>1</b> is illuminated by ultraviolet ray/ozone, for example, liquid obtained by diluting silane coupling agent (A189 available from Nippon Unika Co., Ltd.) with ethylalcohol up to 2 wt % is spin-coated on the treated surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, after the surface cleaning is effected, as shown in FIG. 35B, ultraviolet-sensitive resin film DF (“Dry Film Odel SY-318” (trade mark); available from Tokyo Ohka Co., Ltd.) is laminated on the element substrate <b>1</b> (close contact ability of the surface was improved).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, as shown in FIG. 35C, a photo-mask PM is disposed on the dry film DF, and, ultraviolet ray is illuminated onto a portion of the dry film DF which is to be remained as the second liquid passage walls through the photo-mask PM. This exposure process is effected by using the apparatus (MPA-600 available from Canon, in Japan) with an exposure amount of about 600 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, as shown in FIG. 35D, the dry film DF is developed by a developing liquid (BMRC-3 available from Tokyo Ohka Co., Ltd.) comprised of mixture liquid of xylene and butyl selsolve acetate to dissolve the non-exposed portion, thereby forming the hardened portions as the wall portions of the second liquid passages <b>16</b>. Further, the residual matters remaining on the surface of the element substrate <b>1</b> are removed by driving an oxide plasma ashing apparatus (MAS-800 available from Alcantec Inc.) for about 90 seconds. Then, the ultraviolet ray is further illuminated with the exposure amount of 100 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>at a temperature of 50° C. for two hours, thereby completely hardening the exposed portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A plurality of heater boards (element substrates) obtained by dividing so treated silicon wafer have high accurate second liquid passages <b>16</b>. The silicon wafer were divided into the heater boards by a dicing machine (AWD-4000 available from Tokyo Seimitsu Co., Ltd.) including a diamond blade having a thickness of 0.05 mm. The divided or separated heater board <b>1</b> is secured to an aluminium base plate (support) <b>70</b> (FIG. 38) by an adhesive (SE4400 available from Toray Co., Ltd.). Then, a printed wiring board <b>73</b> (FIG. 39) previously connected to the aluminium base plate <b>70</b> is connected to the heater board <b>1</b> via aluminium wires (not shown) having a diameter of 0.005 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, as shown in FIG. 35E, the assembly of the grooved member <b>50</b> and the separation wall <b>30</b> is positioned and joined. That is to say, the grooved member <b>50</b> including the separation wall <b>50</b> and the heater board <b>1</b> are positioned and secured to each other by a cap spring <b>78</b> (FIG. <b>38</b>), and, then, an ink/bubble liquid supplying member <b>80</b> (FIG. 38) is securely joined to the aluminium base plate <b>70</b> with the interposition of the assembly <b>200</b> of the grooved member <b>50</b> and the separation wall <b>30</b>. Then, gaps between the aluminium wires and between the grooved member <b>50</b>, the heater board <b>1</b> and the ink/bubble liquid supplying member <b>80</b> are filled with and sealed by silicone sealant (TSE399 available from Toshiba Silicone Co., Ltd.), thereby completing the head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By forming the second liquid passages <b>16</b> in this way, high accurate liquid passages having no positional deviation with respect to the heat generating elements <b>2</b> of the heater board <b>1</b> can be obtained. Particularly, by previously assembling the grooved member <b>50</b> and the separation wall <b>30</b> together in the previous step, the positional accuracy of the first liquid passages <b>14</b> and the movable members <b>31</b> can be enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By using such high accurate manufacturing methods, the discharging feature can be stabilized and the image quality can be improved. Further, since the element substrates can be formed on the wafer collectively, mass-production can be permitted, thereby achieving the “cost-down”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, in the illustrated embodiment, while an example that the dry film of type which can be cured by the ultraviolet ray is used to form the second liquid passages <b>16</b> was explained, resin having ultraviolet band (particularly, absorption band near 248 nm) may be used, and, after lamination, resin may be cured and then portions corresponding to the second liquid passages <b>16</b> may be directly removed by excimer laser.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 36A, <b>36</b>B, <b>36</b>C and <b>36</b>D are schematic sectional views showing a second embodiment of a method for manufacturing the liquid discharging head of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 36A, regist <b>1101</b> having a thickness of 15 μm is patterned on a SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> in correspondence to the shape of the second liquid passages <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, as shown in FIG. 36B, the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> is electro-plated to form a nickel layer <b>1102</b> having a thickness of 15 μm on the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b>. Regarding electroplating liquid, sulfonic acid nickel, stress reduction agent (“Zeorol”: trade mark; available from World Metal Inc.), boric acid, pit prevention agent (NP-APS available from World Metal Inc.) and nickel chloride are used. Regarding application of electric field upon electrodeposition, an electrode is attached to an anode and the patterned SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> is attached to a cathode, and a temperature of the plating liquid is selected to 50° C. and current density is selected to 5 A/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, as shown in FIG. 36C, after the electro-plating is finished, the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> is subjected to ultrasonic vibration, so that the nickel layer <b>1102</b> is peeled from the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b>, thereby obtaining desired second liquid passages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, a plurality of heater boards having the electrothermal converters are formed on a silicon wafer by the same apparatus used in the semi-conductor process. Then, as is in the first embodiment, the silicon wafer is divided into the heater boards by the dicing machine. The divided or separated heater board <b>1</b> is secured to an aluminium base plate <b>70</b> to which a printed wiring board <b>73</b> was previously connected, and the printed wiring board <b>73</b> is connected to aluminium wires (not shown), thereby completing electrical connection. As shown in FIG. 36D, the second liquid passages <b>16</b> obtained by the previous step are positioned on and secured to the heater board <b>1</b>. Regarding such securing, as is in the first embodiment, since the second liquid passages <b>16</b> are securely joined by the top plate having the separation wall and the cap spring, the securing may be effected to the extent that positional deviation does not occur during the joining of the top plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, the securing is effected by using adhesive (Amicon UV-300 available from Glace Japan Co., Ltd.) of type which can be cured by the ultraviolet ray and an ultraviolet ray illuminating apparatus and by illuminating with the exposure amount of 100 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>for about 3 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the illustrated method, the high accurate second liquid passages <b>16</b> having no positional deviation with respect to the heat generating elements <b>2</b> can be obtained, and, since the liquid passage walls are formed from nickel, a high reliable head having good resistance to alkaline liquid can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 37A, <b>37</b>B, <b>37</b>C and <b>37</b>D are schematic sectional views showing a third embodiment of a method for manufacturing the liquid discharging head of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 37A, regists <b>1103</b> are coated on both surfaces of a SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> having a thickness of 15 μm and having alignment holes <b>1100</b> <i>a </i>or marks. As the regist <b>1103</b>, PMERP-AR900 available from Tokyo Oyo Kagaku Co., Ltd. is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 37B, the exposure is effected in coincidence with the alignment holes llOOa of the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> by using an exposure apparatus (MPA-600 available from Canon CO., Ltd. in Japan) to remove the regist <b>1103</b> from portions where the second liquid passages <b>16</b> are to be formed. The exposure is effected with the exposure amount of 800 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, as shown in FIG. 37C, the SUS substrate plate <b>1100</b> having the patterned <b>1103</b> at on both surfaces is dipped into etching liquid (solution of iron (III) chloride or copper (II) chloride), thereby etching portions exposed from the regist <b>1103</b>. Thereafter, the regist <b>1103</b> is peeled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, as shown in FIG. 37D, as is in the former embodiment of the method, the etched SUS substrate plate <b>1101</b> is positioned on and secured to the heater board <b>1</b>, thereby assembling the liquid discharging head having the second liquid passages <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the illustrated method, the high accurate second liquid passages <b>16</b> having no positional deviation with respect to the heat generating elements <b>2</b> can be obtained, and, since the liquid passage walls are formed from SUS, a high reliable head having good resistance to alkaline liquid can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned above, according to the illustrated method, by previously arranging the walls for the second liquid passages <b>16</b> on the element substrate, the heat generating elements and the second liquid passages <b>16</b> can be positioned relative to each other with high accuracy. Further, since the second liquid passages can be simultaneously formed on a plurality of element substrates before division, a number of liquid discharging heads can be obtained with low cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in the liquid discharging head obtained by the illustrated method, since the heat generating elements and the second liquid passages <b>16</b> can be positioned relative to each other with high accuracy, the pressure of the bubble generated by the heat from the heat generating element can receive efficiently, thereby improving the discharging efficiency.</div>

By joining the grooved top plate <b>50</b> to the separation wall <b>30</b>, the discharge liquid passages (not shown) are formed, and the discharge liquid flows these liquid passages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The cap spring <b>78</b> serves to apply a biasing force directing toward the element substrate <b>1</b> to the grooved member <b>50</b>. By such biasing force, the element substrate <b>1</b>, separation wall <b>30</b> and grooved member <b>50</b> are effectively integrated with the support <b>70</b> which will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The support <b>70</b> serves to support the element substrate <b>1</b>, and, on the support <b>70</b>, there are disposed a printed wiring board <b>73</b> connected to the element substrate <b>1</b> and adapted to supply an electrical signal, and contact pads <b>74</b> for connection to the liquid discharging apparatus to perform communication between the cartridge and the apparatus.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">In the above-mentioned liquid discharging head cartridge, while the supply system and the liquid container <b>90</b> which can perform the liquid supply even when the bubble liquid is different from the discharge liquid were explained, when the discharge liquid and the bubble liquid are the same, the supply path for the bubble liquid may not be separated from the supply path for the discharge liquid, and the liquid container may contain the single liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, after the liquid(s) from the liquid container <b>90</b> is used up or consumed, new liquid may be replenished. To this end, liquid pouring port(s) may be provided in the liquid container <b>90</b>. Further, the liquid container <b>90</b> may be integrally formed with the liquid discharging head portion <b>200</b> or may removably be mounted on the liquid discharging head portion <b>200</b>.</div>
<heading>Liquid Discharging Apparatus</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 39 schematically shows a liquid discharging apparatus on which the above-mentioned liquid discharging head is mounted. In this example, particularly, an ink discharge recording apparatus IJRA using ink as the discharge liquid will be explained as the liquid discharging apparatus. The cartridge to which the liquid container <b>90</b> for containing the ink and the liquid discharging head portion <b>200</b> are removably attached is mounted on a carriage HC of the apparatus. The carriage can be reciprocally shifted in a width-wise direction (directions a, b) of a recording medium <b>150</b> conveyed by a recording medium convey means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When a drive signal is supplied from a drive signal supplying means (not shown) to the liquid discharging means on the carriage HC, the recording liquid is discharged from the liquid discharging head portion <b>200</b> toward the recording medium <b>150</b> in response to the drive signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in the liquid discharging apparatus according to the illustrated embodiment, there are provided a motor (drive source) <b>111</b> for driving the recording medium convey means and the carriage HC, gears <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> for transmitting a driving force from the drive source to the carriage HC, and a carriage shaft <b>85</b>. By discharging the liquid onto various kinds of recording media by using the recording apparatus and the liquid discharging method (effected in the recording apparatus), a good image can be recorded on the recording medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 40 is a block diagram of the entire of the apparatus for performing the ink discharge recording by using the liquid discharging head of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the recording apparatus, a host computer <b>300</b> receives recording information as a control signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The recording information is temporarily stored in an input/output interface <b>301</b> of the apparatus and, at the same time, is converted into a treatable data in the apparatus. The data is inputted to a CPU <b>302</b> also acting as the head drive signal supplying means. The CPU <b>302</b> treats the input data on the basis of control program stored in a ROM <b>303</b>, by utilizing peripheral units such as a RAM <b>304</b>, to convert the input data into print data (image data).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the CPU <b>302</b> produces drive data for driving a drive motor <b>306</b> for shifting the recording medium and the head <b>200</b> in synchronous with the image data in order to record the image data on a proper position on the recording medium. The image data and the motor drive data are transmitted to the head <b>200</b> and the drive motor <b>306</b> through a head driver <b>307</b> and a motor driver <b>305</b>, respectively, thereby driving the head and motor at a controlled timing to form an image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The recording medium applicable to the above-mentioned recording apparatus and capable of receiving the liquid such as ink may be various kinds of paper sheets, an OHP sheet, a plastic plate used in a compact disc or an ornament plate, cloth, a metal sheet made of aluminum, copper or the like, leather, pigskin, synthetic leather, wood, a wood board, a bamboo sheet, a ceramic sheet such as a tile, or three-dimensional articles such as sponge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the recording apparatus may include a printer for effecting the recording on various kinds of paper sheets or an OHP sheet, a plastic recording apparatus for effecting the recording on plastic material such as a compact disc, a metal recording apparatus for effecting the recording on metal, a leather recording apparatus for effecting the recording on leather, a wood recording apparatus for effecting the recording on wood, a ceramic recording apparatus for effecting the recording on ceramic material, a recording apparatus for effecting the recording on a three-dimensional net article such as sponge, and a print apparatus for effecting the recording on cloth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the discharge liquid used in these liquid discharging apparatuses may be selected in accordance with the kind of a recording medium and a recording condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention is not limited to a head of so-called edge chuter type which a discharge port is disposed at one end of a liquid passage extending along a surface of a heater, but may be applied to, for example, a head of so-called side chuter type in which a discharge port is disposed at a position confronting to a surface of a heater as shown in FIG. <b>41</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid discharging head of side chuter type shown in FIG. 41 is similar to the liquid discharging head of edge chuter type in the point that second liquid passages <b>16</b> for the bubble liquid are formed above an element substrate <b>1</b> on which heat generating elements <b>2</b> (for respective discharge ports) for generating thermal energy for forming a bubble in the liquid are provided, and first liquid passages <b>14</b> (for the discharge liquid) directly communicated with the discharge port provided in a grooved member <b>50</b> are formed above the second liquid passages, and the first liquid passages <b>14</b> and the second liquid passages <b>16</b> are isolated from each other by a separation wall <b>30</b> formed from material having elasticity such as metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid discharging head of side chuter type is characterized in that the discharge ports <b>18</b> are formed in portions (of the grooved member <b>50</b> arranged on the first liquid passages <b>14</b>) disposed directly above the heat generating elements <b>2</b>. Between each heat generating element <b>2</b> and the corresponding discharge port <b>18</b>, the separation wall <b>30</b> has a pair of movable members <b>31</b> which can open together on hinges. Both movable members <b>31</b> are supported at their fulcrums <b>33</b>. Each movable member has a free end <b>32</b> which is provided at its both lateral edges with side members capable of displacing together with the movable member <b>31</b> and adapted to cover both side of a bubble generated. In a non-discharging condition, the free ends <b>32</b> of both movable members <b>31</b> are closely spaced apart from each other with the interposition of a slit <b>35</b> disposed directly above a center of the discharge port <b>18</b>. Upon liquid-discharge, as shown by the arrows in FIG. 41, both movable members <b>31</b> are opened toward the first liquid passage <b>14</b> of the discharge port <b>18</b> by the bubble generated in the bubble liquid in a bubble generating area <b>11</b>. When the bubble is contracted, the movable members are closed. The discharge liquid is refilled in a zone C from a discharge liquid tank (described later) to restore the liquid discharge permitting condition, for preparing for next liquid discharging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The first liquid passages <b>14</b> are communicated with a tank (not shown) containing the discharge liquid through a first common liquid chamber <b>15</b>, and the second liquid passages <b>16</b> are communicated with a tank (not shown) containing the bubble liquid through a second common liquid chamber <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Substantially similar to the liquid discharging head of edge chuter type, in the liquid discharging head of edge chuter type having the above construction, the growing direction of the bubble can be directed toward the discharge port <b>18</b> while improving the refilling ability of the discharge liquid, thereby discharging the liquid with high energy efficiency and high discharging pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, regarding the manufacturing method, the head of side chuter type is substantially the same as the head of edge chuter type, for the position of the discharge <b>18</b> provided in the grooved member, and position and structure of the common liquid chambers <b>15</b>, <b>17</b>. Accordingly, a relation between the separation wall <b>30</b> having the movable members <b>31</b> and the liquid passage walls defining the second liquid passages <b>16</b> are same in both heads.</div>
<heading>Recording System</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, an example of an ink jet recording system in which the recording is effected on the recording medium by using the liquid discharging head of the present invention as a recording head will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 42 is a schematic view for explaining a construction of an ink jet recording system using the liquid discharging head of the present invention. The liquid discharging head according to this embodiment is a head of full-line type in which a plurality of discharge ports are disposed at an interval of 360 dpi along the length of a maximum record allowable width of the recording medium <b>150</b>, and four heads <b>210</b> <i>a</i>-<b>201</b> <i>d </i>corresponding to yellow (Y) color, magenta (M) color, cyan (C) color and black (Bk) color, respectively, are fixedly held by a holder <b>202</b> at a predetermined interval in an X direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A signal is supplied from the head driver (drive signal supplying means) <b>307</b> to one of the heads <b>201</b> <i>a</i>-<b>201</b> <i>d</i>, so that the head <b>201</b> <i>a</i>-<b>201</b> <i>d </i>is driven in response to the signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Four color (Y, M, C, Bk) inks are supplied as the discharge liquids from ink containers <b>204</b> <i>a</i>-<b>204</b> <i>d </i>to the heads <b>201</b> <i>a</i>-<b>201</b> <i>d</i>, respectively. Incidentally, the reference numeral <b>204</b> <i>e </i>denotes a bubble liquid container containing the bubble liquid, and the bubble liquid is supplied from the bubble liquid container <b>204</b> <i>e </i>to the heads <b>201</b> <i>a</i>-<b>201</b> <i>d. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, head caps <b>203</b> <i>a</i>-<b>203</b> <i>d </i>including ink absorbing material such as sponge are disposed below the respective heads <b>201</b> <i>a</i>-<b>201</b> <i>d </i>so that, in an inoperative condition, the heads <b>201</b> <i>a</i>-<b>201</b> <i>d </i>is protected by covering the discharge ports of the heads <b>201</b> <i>a</i>-<b>201</b> <i>d </i>by the head caps <b>203</b> <i>a</i>-<b>203</b> <i>d. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The reference numeral <b>206</b> denotes a convey belt constituting a convey means for conveying various kinds of recording medium, as mentioned above. The convey belt <b>206</b> is mounted on a plurality of rollers and is driven by a drive roller connected to the motor driver <b>305</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the ink jet recording system according to the illustrated embodiment, there is provided a pre-treatment device <b>251</b> adapted to perform pre-treatment regarding the recording medium before the recording is started and disposed at an upstream side in a recording medium conveying path, and a post-treatment device <b>252</b> adapted to perform post-treatment regarding the recording medium after the recording is finished and disposed at a downstream side in the recording medium conveying path.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The pre-treatment and post-treatment are varied in accordance with the kind of the recording medium to be recorded and/or the kind of ink. For example, regarding the recording medium made of metal, plastic or ceramic, as the pre-treatment, ultraviolet ray and ozone are illuminated onto the recording medium to make a surface of the recording medium active, thereby improving the adhering ability of ink to the recording medium. Further, in case of the recording medium (for example, plastic) which easily generates static electricity, dirt is apt to be adhered to the surface of the recording medium due to the static electricity, resulting in prevention of good recording. Thus, such a recording medium, as the pre-treatment, the static electricity is removed from the recording medium by using an ionizer device to remove dirt on the recording medium. Further, when the cloth is used as the recording medium, in a view point of prevention of blot and improvement in coloring ability, as the pre-treatment, material selected among alkaline substance, water-soluble substance, synthetic polymer, water-soluble metal chloride, urea and chiourea may be added to the cloth. The pre-treatment is not limited above-mentioned examples, but, may include treatment for adjusting a temperature of the recording medium to a temperature suitable for the recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, the post-treatment may include heat treatment of the recorded recording medium, fixing treatment for promoting the fixing of ink by illumination of ultraviolet ray and cleaning treatment for cleaning the residual treatment agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, in the illustrated embodiment, while an example that the full line heads are used as the heads <b>201</b> <i>a</i>-<b>201</b> <i>d </i>was explained, the present invention is not limited to such an example, the recording may be effected by shifting the above-mentioned compact head in the width-wise direction of the recording medium.</div>
<heading>Head Kit</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, a head kit having the liquid discharging head of the present invention will be explained. FIG. 43 schematically shows such a head kit. In the head kit <b>500</b>, a head <b>510</b> of the present invention having ink discharge portion <b>511</b> for discharging ink, an ink container <b>520</b> integrally attached or removably connected to the head <b>510</b>, and an ink loading means <b>530</b> for holding ink and for loading the ink in the ink container are housed in a kit container <b>501</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the ink is consumed, an insert portion (for example, a needle) of the ink loading means <b>530</b> is inserted into a vent hole <b>521</b> of the ink container <b>520</b> or a connection portion between the head <b>510</b> and the ink container or a hole formed in a wall of the ink container <b>520</b>, so that the ink in the ink loading means <b>530</b> is loaded in the ink container <b>520</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By providing the head kit in which the head <b>510</b> of the present invention, ink container <b>520</b> and ink loading means <b>530</b> are housed in the single head kit container <b>501</b>, even when the ink is consumed, the ink can easily be loaded in the ink container <b>520</b> promptly, thereby re-starting the recording quickly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, in the illustrated embodiment, while the head kit <b>500</b> including the ink loading means <b>530</b> was explained, in a head kit, only a removable ink container containing ink and a head may be housed in a kit container.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in FIG. 43, while only the ink loading means <b>530</b> for loading the ink in the ink container <b>520</b> was shown, a bubble liquid loading means for loading the bubble liquid in a bubble liquid container may be housed in the kit container, as well as the ink loading means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the liquid discharging head based on the new discharging principle using the movable member having the integral side members, since the both sides of the generated bubble are covered by the side members, the pressure directing transverse to the liquid flow direction can also be oriented toward the discharge port and the growing direction of the bubble itself is also directed toward the downstream side, with the result that the bubble can be grown more greatly at the downstream side than at the upstream side. Consequently, since the liquid near the discharge port can be oriented to the discharge port efficiently, the discharging efficiency can be improved greatly in comparison with the conventional bubble jet discharging heads. Further, in case of the head of two-passage type, one of the liquid passages can surely be isolated from the other by the side member, thereby preventing the mixing between the bubble liquid and the discharge liquid and achieving the good liquid discharging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Particularly, when the movable member has the flexible thin diaphragm having the expansion/contraction portions corresponding to the side portions of the movable member so that the expansion/contraction portions can act as the side members, since the opening (toward the discharging opening) caused by the displacement of the movable member becomes constant and the bubble pressure acting toward the discharge port also becomes constant, the stable discharging can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, according to the characteristic arrangement of the present invention, even when the head is placed under a low temperature and/or low humidity condition for a long time, the poor discharging can be suppressed or prevented; and, if the poor discharging occurs, the normal condition can easily be restored by effecting simple preliminary discharge and/or suction recovery. Therefore, the recovery time and loss of liquid due to recovery can be reduced, thereby reducing the running cost greatly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, according to the arrangement of the present invention for improving the refill feature, the response in the continuous discharging, stable growth of the bubble and the stabilizing of liquid droplet can be achieved, thereby permitting the high speed recording due to high speed liquid discharge and the high quality image recording.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, regarding the head of two-passage type, when the liquid in which the bubble can easily be generated or the liquid in which deposit is hard to be accumulated on the heat generating element is used as the bubble liquid, degree of freedom of selection of the discharge liquid is increased, with the result that high viscous liquid in which the bubble is hard to be generated and the liquid in which deposit is apt to be accumulated on the heat generating element (which liquids is hard to be discharged in the conventional bubble jet discharging methods) can be discharged effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the liquid having poor resistance to heat can be discharged without deterioration of the liquid due to the heat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, by using the liquid discharging head of the present invention as a recording liquid discharging head, a high quality image can be obtained. Finally, by using the liquid discharging head of the present invention, a liquid discharging apparatus and recording system in which the liquid discharging efficiency is improved can be provided.</div>
