<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention is a low-cost, recyclable, easily replaceable vacuum or thermoformed insert or liner for mushroom-growing trays that are assembled or formed of wood or composites of wood or recyclable materials that may be subject to deterioration by rot or use.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is common practice in the mushroom growing industry to grow mushrooms in large wooden trays. Typically, mushroom-growing trays have commonly been made out of either oak or pressure-treated wood.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Wood is fairly durable and inexpensive however there may also have been an effort to manufacture the mushroom trays from other materials such as pressboard or recycled cardboard or paper. The typical wooden mushroom trays are tough enough to withstand the forces incurred when transported by forklift trucks, and a common wood used to fabricate them is oak. Typically, wooden mushroom trays are stacked to create multiple levels of trays within the same amount of floor space, as one tray would occupy. By stacking the growing trays in tiers, a larger number of mushrooms in a concentrated area can be cultivated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, the use of wooden trays or the like has several disadvantages. For example, wooden trays are difficult to clean at the end of each growing cycle. During and after the cleaning process, the porous wood becomes moisture-swollen and its fibrous surface traps spent compost material. Since the growing medium remains embedded in the wood fibers after the tray has been emptied, the wood begins to rot, which weakens the overall structure of the tray, thereby shortening its useful life. Another undesirable feature is that detrimental molds may propagate in the new growing medium, causing contamination that could result in diminished yield for any particular crop.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternate mushroom tray designs (metal, plastic, and composite) have been developed in an attempt to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,040,328 to Coon discloses a mushroom tray fabricated from a plastic that has downward-opening channels and is secured to a support structure made of corrosion-resistant material. Following the assembly of this unit, this tray is filled with mushroom growing material. There is also a plurality of clips to secure the plastic tray to the aluminum support. The '328 patent disclosing the mushroom tray describes a non-porous surface in its construction, thereby eliminating wood rot or mold growth in the structure. The '328 reference apparently is intended to provide a mushroom tray that will possess the requisite strength to withstand resulting vertical load and associated forces when multiple trays are stacked, as well as other forces endured during transportation or movement of the trays. In order to overcome some disadvantages of mushroom trays such as that described in the '328 reference, U.S. Pat. No. 6,016,627, to Nobile discloses a stackable composite mushroom-growing tray. The '627 reference discloses a structure fabricated out of a glass-reinforced plastic composite. The structure of the tray is uniquely molded to include a bottom surface having graduated height ribs and corrugations extending perpendicular to the ribs to improve rigidity. There is also a plurality of holes and specially molded recesses for the spacers necessary for stacking multiple trays. A disadvantage of this type of system may be the expense of manufacture due to the elaborate materials and details that need to be molded into the structure, which are accomplished through use of an expensive mold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, there is a need for a more cost-effective method to improve the clean-out capabilities and increase the lifespan of wooden mushroom-growing trays that are formed of various wood materials or the combination thereof from recycled, manufactured, or remanufactured biodegradable materials. Additionally, a benefit is that, when used in trays constructed with chemically pressure-treated wood, the tray liner will provide a protective layer between the treated wood tray and the growing medium. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced that wood treated with CCA (chromated copper arsenate) will be banned from residential use by January 2004. If this ban is extended to the food-growing industry, the liner may prove to be highly beneficial in protecting untreated wood growing trays (or growing trays constructed of biodegradable materials) from the wood-decaying effects of the growing medium. This will be shown in the following detailed specification of the present invention that provides an easily manufactured, protective and cost effective tray liner for mushroom-growing trays.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention concerns a tray liner that is insertable into a mushroom growing tray. The tray liner is formed as a rectangular base member with a periphery of upstanding sidewalls joined to a base portion. There is a notched section located at each corner of the rectangular base member to accommodate the upstanding frame member located at each corner of the wooden mushroom-growing tray. The notch section has a contiguous wall that is joined with the periphery of upstanding sidewalls and the base member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention has advantages over the prior art by providing an inexpensive, replaceable, and fully recyclable tray—insert (hereinafter referred to as “tray liner”) for existing wooden mushroom growing trays. Once installed, the tray liner could remain in a wooden mushroom-growing tray for the life of that tray which Will extend the usefulness of such growing trays. The tray liner as conceived in the present invention could even be reused in a new wooden tray when the original wooden tray has come to the end of its useful life.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A feature of the present invention is that the smooth radius corners that result from this one-piece tray liner as manufactured eliminates or reduces the sharp corners of the wood constructed tray. The manufacturing process is simple, and provides a smooth textured mushroom-tray liner that is easy to fabricate, handle and install. The smooth surface of the material of the tray liner facilitates the cleaning of spent material such as old growing medium from the lined wooden mushroom-growing tray at the end of each growing cycle. One of several alternative embodiments of the present invention is included to provide a replaceable tray liner that comprises a plurality of similarly shaped sections that may be installed in sections to a mushroom-growing tray. This alternate design provides additional lower manufacturing and/or shipping costs and easier handling for the mushroom grower.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In describing the present invention, reference is made to the drawings, wherein there is seen in FIG. 1, a perspective view of a replaceable tray liner <b>20</b> that is shown as it is positioned over a wooden mushroom growing tray <b>30</b>. The replaceable tray liner <b>20</b> is a simple, inexpensive liner manufactured to fit directly into existing wooden mushroom-growing trays or into alternative, existing or newly fabricated mushroom-growing trays that may be manufactured from recycled and biodegradable or other pressed wooden material that is typically manufactured and used for building materials in a variety of applications today.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The replaceable tray liner <b>20</b> is made of a one-piece material, such as polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, or other suitable thermo/vacuum formable poly-material. The material defined above is in the range of 0.020″-0.040″ thickness. The thickness can vary to suitcustomer requirements, material forming properties and manufacturing processes. The tray liner <b>20</b> is recyclable, for current conditions where recycling is.important, conceived to achieve this important factor. For example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, a high-density polyethylene material is chosen for: its physical properties. When the wooden mushroom-growing tray <b>30</b> or an equivalent biodegradable and recyclable constructed mushroom-growing tray has come to the end of its life, its tray liner may be either reused in a new wooden tray or disposed of and replaced with a new tray liner. Since these tray liners are 100% recyclable, disposal is easy and inexpensive—a great advantage in today's business climate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Manufacturing of the replaceable tray liner <b>20</b> may be accomplished by means of a thermo/vacuum forming process, as is the case for similar commercial products using plastic materials such as those described above. The costs of thermo/vacuum molds are relatively inexpensive and thus lend themselves to various sizes and shapes of construction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 1 and 2, the replaceable tray liner <b>20</b> is described in more detail in reference to its construction. In FIG. 1, the replaceable tray liner <b>20</b> is shown, as it is ready to be inserted into the wooden mushroom-growing tray <b>30</b>. In FIG. 2, the tray liner <b>20</b> is shown by itself wherein there is a periphery of upstanding sidewalls <b>20</b> <i>a</i>. These include two opposing upstanding sidewalls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and two opposing upstanding end walls <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, both of which comprise the major side portions of the box-like structure of the tray liner <b>20</b>. The side and end walls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> are all respectively joined to a substantially rectangular base member <b>25</b> at base comers <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>b</i>, <b>25</b> <i>c </i>and <b>25</b> <i>d</i>, which intersect the aforementioned side and end walls and the base member <b>25</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring again to FIG. 2, there is a pair of upstanding, reinforcing bridge members <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> that are formed from the base member <b>25</b> and joined to the opposing sidewalls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The bridge members <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> are formed in the tray liner <b>20</b> to cover and accommodate corresponding reinforcing bridge members <b>30</b> <i>a</i>, <b>30</b> <i>b </i>(FIG. 1) of the wooden tray <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring back to FIG. 1, the tray liner <b>20</b> has a plurality of notch sections <b>28</b>, specifically noted as a notch section <b>28</b> <i>a</i>, <b>28</b> <i>b</i>, <b>28</b> <i>c </i>and <b>28</b> <i>d</i>, all of which are located at the major outside corners of the tray liner <b>20</b>. The construction and juncture of the upstanding walls surrounding the notch sections <b>28</b> <i>a</i>, <b>28</b> <i>b</i>, <b>28</b> <i>c </i>and <b>28</b> <i>d </i>is typical in that the walls are joined to the periphery of upstanding walls <b>20</b> <i>a </i>(FIG. <b>2</b>), thereby forming a contiguous and continuous construction. For example, there is an upstanding wall <b>28</b> <i>e</i>, <b>28</b> <i>f </i>that forms part of the perimeter of upstanding wall around the notch section <b>28</b> <i>b</i>; the wall <b>28</b> <i>e</i>, <b>28</b> <i>f </i>both being contiguous and joined to the accompanying sidewalls <b>21</b>, <b>24</b>, and to the base member <b>25</b> at a bottom intersection corner <b>25</b> <i>e</i>, <b>25</b> <i>f </i>(FIG. <b>2</b>). The upstanding walls for notch sections <b>28</b> <i>a</i>, <b>28</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>28</b> <i>d </i>are formed similarly to upstanding walls <b>28</b> <i>e</i>, <b>28</b> <i>f </i>to cover that inside corresponding portion of the upstanding corner frame members such as <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c </i>and <b>31</b> <i>d </i>(FIG. <b>1</b>), respectively, thereby offering protection to the wooden tray <b>30</b> in that area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 2, the tray liner <b>20</b> additionally has optional outward facing lips <b>21</b> <i>a</i>, <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, <b>23</b> <i>a </i>and <b>24</b> <i>a </i>which all are respectively contiguously joined to their respective upstanding walls <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> to form stiffening and stabilizing construction of the tray liner <b>20</b>. This may aid in the handling and stacking of multiple tray liners <b>20</b> together at the time of manufacture, as well as when installing the tray liners <b>20</b> in a wooden tray <b>30</b>. The outward facing lips <b>21</b> <i>a</i>, <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, <b>23</b> <i>a</i>, <b>24</b> <i>a </i>also provide protection to a top surface <b>30</b> <i>c</i>, <b>30</b> <i>d</i>, <b>30</b> <i>e </i>and <b>30</b> <i>f </i>(FIG. 1) of the wooden tray <b>30</b>. In addition, once installed in the wooden tray <b>30</b>, the tray liner <b>20</b> can be easily separated from the wooden tray <b>30</b> by grasping the outward facing lips <b>21</b> <i>a</i>, <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, <b>23</b> <i>a</i>, and <b>24</b> <i>a</i>. It is also possible to manufacture the tray liner <b>20</b> without the outward facing lips <b>21</b> <i>a</i>, <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, <b>23</b> <i>a </i>and <b>24</b> <i>a </i>at less expense, if desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other parts of the wooden tray <b>30</b> (FIG. 1) include a bottom surface <b>30</b> <i>g </i>and a periphery of upstanding sidewalls <b>30</b> <i>h</i>, <b>30</b> <i>k</i>, <b>30</b> <i>l </i>and <b>30</b> <i>m</i>. The sidewalls <b>30</b> <i>h</i>, <b>30</b> <i>k</i>, <b>30</b> <i>l </i>and <b>30</b> <i>m </i>are all joined to the upstanding corner frame-members <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c </i>and <b>31</b> <i>d </i>respectively. For example, sidewalls <b>30</b> <i>h</i>, <b>30</b> <i>k </i>join and are suitably secured to the corner member <b>31</b> <i>a</i>. The remaining upstanding corner frame members <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c </i>and <b>31</b> <i>d </i>are similarly joined to their respective upstanding sidewalls <b>30</b> <i>h </i>&amp; <b>30</b> <i>m</i>, <b>30</b> <i>l </i>&amp; <b>30</b> <i>m</i>, and <b>30</b> <i>l </i>&amp; <b>30</b> <i>k</i>, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. It will be apparent that the general construction of the tray liner <b>20</b> will suitably cover the defined parts and components of the wooden tray <b>30</b> as defined above, with the exception of the top portions of the upstanding corner frame members <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c </i>and <b>31</b> <i>d</i>. The liner covers these corner members only up to the height of the sidewalls <b>30</b> <i>h</i>, <b>30</b> <i>k</i>, <b>30</b> <i>l </i>and <b>30</b> <i>m. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Generally, referring to FIG. 1, FIG. <b>2</b> and FIG. 3, the tray liner <b>20</b> is manufactured to dimensions that are known in the field by those companies that make their specific wooden tray <b>30</b>. For example, the tray liner <b>20</b> is manufactured to fit such a wooden tray <b>30</b> in dimensions that are approximately constructed to suit the following sizes: two feet by four feet; four feet by four feet, four feet by six feet, four feet by eight feet, or any other size that is commercially acceptable to those companies that manufacture such wooden trays. The present example of the wooden tray <b>30</b> is, for purposes of description in this specification, four feet by six feet, and, accordingly, the tray liner <b>20</b> is designed to fit inside of the dimensions of the wooden tray <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. <b>4</b> and FIG. 5 are additional views of the assembly and relationship of the tray liner <b>20</b> and the wooden tray <b>30</b>. FIG. 4 shows the relationship of tray liner <b>20</b> with a wooden tray <b>30</b> having upstanding corner frame members <b>41</b> <i>a</i>, <b>41</b> <i>d </i>at a height greater than the height of the wall <b>30</b> <i>k</i>. It is to be understood that each corner frame member for this example would be the same height. FIG. 5 shows a way to assemble the wooden mushroom-growing trays to one another in a stack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 6, a perspective view is shown of an alternative embodiment and construction of a replaceable tray liner <b>60</b>. The tray liner assembly <b>60</b> will be understood to be similar to the tray liner <b>20</b> and as such will be adaptable to fitting into the wooden tray <b>30</b> previously described. In FIG. 6, the liner assembly <b>60</b> is composed of two tray liner sections <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, <b>60</b> <i>b </i>that are overlapped at an area <b>60</b> <i>c</i>. This may be considered a two-part design and therefore is an assembly as such. The alternate construction and assembly shown in FIG. 6 and 7 may be desirable for those companies that manufacture or use wooden mushroom growing trays having large variations of dimensional tolerances of construction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The tray liner sections <b>60</b> <i>a </i>and <b>60</b> <i>b </i>are the same part or component and may be made so that each will fit the wooden tray <b>30</b> in two different directions by overlapping them at a desired point such as the area <b>60</b> <i>c</i>. FIG. 6 of the present alternate embodiment illustrates a construction that will fit width wise in reference to the wooden tray <b>30</b>. Alternatively, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the tray liner sections <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, <b>60</b> <i>b </i>may be constructed in a second or alternate direction that will fit the wooden tray <b>30</b> in a configuration that will overlap as shown overlapping at the area in a lengthwise direction in the drawing of FIG. <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 6, the liner section <b>60</b> <i>a </i>is constructed with a periphery of three upstanding sidewalls <b>61</b> that are comprised of an upstanding wall <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>and <b>61</b> <i>c</i>. The walls <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>and <b>61</b> <i>c </i>are all joined to a base portion <b>64</b> of the tray liner <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, at corner junctures <b>64</b> <i>a</i>, <b>64</b> <i>b </i>and <b>64</b> <i>c</i>, thereby forming a complete and contiguous construction of the liner section <b>60</b> <i>a </i>with three upstanding walls, as opposed to the four walls described previously with reference to the tray liner <b>20</b> and a flat end <b>60</b> <i>c</i>. The rectangular.base member <b>64</b> has a contiguous edge defining a flat end <b>60</b> <i>c </i>of the base member <b>64</b> of the tray liner <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, the flat end <b>60</b> <i>c </i>not having an upstanding side wall whereas a remainder of the rectangular base member <b>64</b> has the upstanding side walls <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>61</b> <i>c </i>located around a periphery formed of three sides of the substantially rectangular base member <b>64</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The tray liner <b>60</b> <i>a </i>additionally has an upstanding bridge member <b>60</b> <i>d </i>that is formed from the base portion <b>64</b> and is joined to the upstanding walls <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>c</i>. The upstanding bridge member <b>60</b> <i>d </i>is designed to cover the upstanding bridge member <b>30</b> <i>a </i>or <b>30</b> <i>b </i>(FIG. 1) as the case may be, since the liner sections <b>60</b> <i>a </i>and <b>60</b> <i>b </i>are symmetrical and therefore reversible to cover the wooden tray <b>30</b> with the associated components described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 6, it will be apparent that when the liner sections <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, <b>60</b> <i>b </i>are inserted into the wooden tray <b>30</b> described in reference to FIG. 1, the liner sections <b>60</b> <i>a </i>and <b>60</b> <i>b </i>will cover exposed sections of the wooden tray <b>30</b> such as those described previously. For example, the bottom surface <b>30</b> <i>g </i>of the wooden tray (FIG. <b>1</b>), the upstanding reinforcing bridge members <b>30</b> <i>a</i>, <b>30</b> <i>b</i>, and accompanying top surfaces <b>30</b> <i>c</i>, <b>30</b> <i>d</i>, <b>30</b> <i>e </i>and <b>30</b> <i>f </i>of the upstanding walls are covered by the combination of liner sections <b>60</b> <i>a </i>and <b>60</b> <i>b </i>when inserted into the wooden tray <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The flat end <b>60</b> <i>c </i>defined in FIG. 6 is illustrated in overlapping or seamed relationship, but could also be in an abutting relationship (not shown) between an edge <b>60</b> <i>e </i>and <b>60</b> <i>f </i>of the two liner sections <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, <b>60</b> <i>b</i>. It is an objective to cover sufficient areas of the wooden tray <b>30</b>, and such an abutting relationship would create a minimal gap and potential exposure of the bottom surface <b>30</b> <i>g </i>of the wooden tray <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Describing the liner section <b>60</b> <i>a </i>further (FIG. <b>6</b>), the upstanding side walls <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>and <b>61</b> <i>c </i>are contiguous and formed with an outward facing lip <b>62</b> <i>a</i>, <b>62</b> <i>b </i>and <b>62</b> <i>c </i>that are constructed and formed as part of the walls defined above being joined at a corner <b>62</b> <i>d</i>, <b>62</b> <i>e </i>and <b>62</b> <i>f </i>there between. There is a notch section <b>66</b> <i>a</i>, <b>66</b> <i>b </i>with in the construction of the liner section <b>60</b> <i>a </i>that will accommodate the upstanding corner frame members <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b </i>of the wooden tray <b>30</b> when the liner section <b>60</b> <i>a </i>is inserted into the wooden tray <b>30</b>. The notch sections <b>66</b> <i>a</i>, <b>66</b> <i>b </i>are formed from upstanding walls such as an upstanding wall <b>66</b> <i>c </i>and <b>66</b>d associated with the notch section <b>66</b> <i>a </i>and <b>66</b> <i>b</i>. The walls <b>66</b> <i>c</i>, <b>66</b> <i>d </i>are formed so as to be contiguous with the upstanding walls <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>being joined at intersections with the base portion <b>64</b> and so forth in a similar manner as that described with reference to the tray liner <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To briefly restate.some of the details and benefits described above, it is desirable to have a replaceable tray liner that is designed as a substitutable one-component liner or a combination of multiple liner sections. It may be a matter of design choice or of economic factors that the same part can be used for both sections, as in the case of the two-part design described above which is symmetrical. This configuration could lower both manufacturing costs (since a smaller mold could be used) and transportation costs (since the smaller insert sections could be shipped via standard parcel carrier).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To restate, with reference to the two-part design, both liner sections <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, <b>60</b> <i>b </i>are identical and thus replaceable at either end of the wooden tray <b>30</b> while also being accommodating to possible tolerance variations in the construction of the a wooden tray <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another embodiment of the present tray liner design involves further consideration of possible tolerance variations in the construction of wooden mushroom trays such as tray <b>30</b>. In this case, there is, in reference to FIG. 7, an embodiment of the present invention whereby the tray liner is manufactured in quarter sections. Again taking advantage of symmetry, there is, a tray liner <b>70</b> comprising equally dimensioned liner sections <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c </i>and <b>70</b> <i>d </i>that form a combination of a suitable replacement tray liner similar to that defined above with reference to the tray liners <b>20</b> and <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, <b>60</b> <i>b</i>. In the case of the tray liner <b>70</b>, each of the liner sections <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c </i>and <b>70</b> <i>d </i>comprise at least one fourth of the size of the wooden tray <b>30</b>. Diagonally opposing liner sections <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c </i>as well as sections <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>d </i>have symmetry thereby limiting the necessity of separate molds for the formation of all four of the sections defined above. The liner sections <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c </i>are the same, and the liner sections <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>d </i>are similarly constructed, thereby requiring two-forming molds instead of the one mold that would accommodate the previously described liner <b>20</b>, <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, and <b>60</b> <i>b</i>. (Liner sections <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>d </i>may be considered “right hand,” while liner sections <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c </i>may be considered to be “left hand” because of the reversing corner design).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The insertion of the liner sections <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c </i>and <b>70</b> <i>d </i>create an overlapping seam <b>70</b> <i>e </i>with an adjoining and adjacent section. For example, seam <b>70</b> <i>e </i>is created by the placement of the liner section <b>70</b> <i>a </i>adjacent to or overlapping liner section <b>70</b> <i>b </i>along with the placement of liner section <b>70</b> <i>c </i>adjacent to or overlapping liner section <b>70</b> <i>d</i>. An overlapping seam <b>70</b> <i>f </i>is created by the overlapping of liner sections <b>70</b> <i>a </i>and <b>70</b> <i>b </i>in addition to the overlapping of liner sections <b>70</b> <i>c </i>and <b>70</b> <i>d</i>. Likewise, the overlapping of liner sections <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c </i>and <b>70</b> <i>d </i>creates overlapping portion <b>70</b> <i>h</i>. The previously defined replaceable liner sections <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, <b>60</b> <i>b </i>and the liner sections <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>70</b> <i>d </i>exemplify the possible variations of sizes that can be manufactured in sections or parts that may be utilized to accommodate standard wooden trays such as the tray <b>30</b>. The tray liners defined will create an entire replaceable liner capability that will be adaptable to the commercial industry of mushroom growing. The sectional approach to the design of the liners is desirable in order to accommodate variations as a defined above in manufacture of the wooden trays and to possibly lower manufacturing and/or shipping costs. The sectional liners defined above may be manufactured in a latitudinal x-direction or a longitudinal y-direction as shown in FIG. <b>6</b> and FIG. <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another feature of the present invention will now be described while referring to FIG. 8, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>. In FIG. 8, an alternate construction of a notch section of a replaceable tray liner <b>80</b> is defined, wherein one end of the tray liner <b>80</b> is shown, and may be considered as a substitute for that described above in reference to the liner <b>20</b>, liner section <b>60</b> <i>a </i>and liner section <b>60</b> <i>b</i>, or liner sections <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>70</b> <i>d</i>. The objective is to fabricate the liner <b>80</b> for additional tolerance absorbing capability as may be necessary to fit some of the commercial wooden trays <b>30</b> defined herein. In the present invention, the tray liner <b>80</b> has a notch section <b>88</b> that is located at each of four corners (two of which are shown in FIG. <b>8</b>). The notch section <b>88</b> will be.understood to be similar to that defined above in that it will clear or fit the liner <b>80</b> to the wooden tray <b>30</b> and the upstanding corner frame members <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, etc as defined above in reference to the wooden tray <b>30</b>. The notch section <b>88</b> is similarly constructed by virtue of adjoined upstanding wall members such as those defined in regards to the liner <b>20</b>, with an exception regarding a compliant feature, which is now described. Referring to FIG. 9, an enlargement of the notch section <b>88</b> is illustrated in that there are upstanding walls <b>80</b> <i>a </i>and <b>80</b> <i>b </i>that are joined to a base portion <b>82</b> of the liner <b>88</b>, thereby forming a continuous and contiguous periphery of upstanding walls as described previously in reference to the liner <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The upstanding wall <b>80</b> <i>a</i>, <b>80</b> <i>b </i>are contiguous and joined together with a compliant semi-circular notch section <b>80</b> <i>c </i>that is blended into the wall <b>80</b> <i>a </i>and <b>80</b> <i>b</i>. It will be understood that the semi-circular form <b>80</b> <i>c </i>is designed to act as a spring like or compliant portion of the upstanding walls that will “give” (i.e., flex) when the tray liner <b>80</b> is inserted into the wooden tray <b>30</b>. The design of the semi-circular form <b>80</b> <i>c </i>defined above may be alternately shaped in many forms (elliptical, bulbous, etc) that will “give,” or be resilient, in regards to possible tolerance variations to be expected in wood construction of mushroom growing trays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To reinforce the suitability of manufacturing the aforementioned liners <b>20</b>, <b>60</b> <i>a</i>, <b>60</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>80</b>, in FIG. 10 is shown another aspect of the manufacturing design contemplated. The liner <b>80</b> is illustrated in an elevation view and there is a taper greater than 90 degrees (outwardly tapered) shown by the reference angle A. The angle A would be appropriate in a 91-94 degree range as measured to form an obtuse angle from the base portion <b>82</b> of the liner <b>80</b> to an upstanding wall <b>80</b> <i>d</i>. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that this type of construction is desirable for manufacturing and is applied to all upstanding walls of the foregoing described liners <b>20</b>, <b>60</b> <i>a </i>and <b>60</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>a</i>, <b>70</b> <i>b</i>, <b>70</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>70</b> <i>d</i>, and <b>80</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 11, an alternate embodiment is disclosed. The portions of the liner covering the wooden, structural cross-members <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> (FIG. 2) of the mushroom-growing tray that are molded into the liner are one way of molding the tray liner <b>20</b> shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. If a customer desires, the structural cross-member coverings could be omitted from the design of the molded tray liner. This alternate style of liner would be placed into newly constructed wood trays prior to the placement of the wooden structural cross-members, which, once set into place over the liner, would then secure the liner to the tray. In FIG. 11, there is a plain wooden mushroom-growing tray <b>90</b> shown, without structural cross members such as that described above. There is a plain tray liner <b>100</b>, also shown without structural cross member coverings such as that described in reference to the bridge member coverings <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>. (FIG. <b>2</b>). There is a pair of structural cross members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> shown in FIG. 11, which may be fabricated out of wood or other recyclable material as described above, and which may be added to the assembly of the tray liner <b>100</b> to the mushroom growing-tray <b>90</b>. If desired, these structural cross members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be coated or covered by a variety of means including as shown in FIG. 11 with separate cover members <b>103</b>, <b>105</b>. The members <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> may be fastened at assembly by conventional means such as stapling, screws, etc. The plain design illustrated in FIG. 11 of the fray liner <b>100</b> may be the most desirable in terms of coping with the variations of dimensional tolerances associated with construction of wood growing trays as well as being the most cost-effective design. Due to this simplistic design it could result in the lowest cost liner. Therefore, the plain wooden mushroom-growing tray <b>90</b> could be protected by inserting the tray liner <b>100</b> into a mushroom-growing tray <b>90</b> to form an assembly, securing the tray liner <b>100</b> to the mushroom growing tray <b>90</b>, adding at least one structural support members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> to an inside section of the mushroom growing tray <b>90</b> and fastening the structural support member <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> to the assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 12, FIG. <b>13</b> and again FIG. 1, there is shown another alternate embodiment of a plain version of a tray liner <b>110</b> for a mushroom-growing tray <b>30</b>. In FIG. 12 a tray liner <b>110</b> is shown, with a notch <b>112</b> in each corner. In this design, the tray liner <b>110</b> is formed, as described in the vacuum process described above, without the contiguous upstanding walls <b>28</b>e, <b>28</b>f that are designed to cover the upstanding corner frame members <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c </i>and <b>31</b> <i>d </i>of the mushroom growing tray <b>30</b>. In the construction of the tray liner <b>110</b>, there is a lip <b>116</b>, and a lip <b>118</b> on the ends and the sides of the tray liner <b>110</b>, that are designed to cover the exposed ends of the wooden mushroom-growing tray <b>30</b> described earlier. The lip <b>116</b>, and <b>118</b> typically have an aperture, a tab, or protrusion that will match with a comer-covering member designed to be a corner covering component <b>120</b> that may be added to the formed tray liner <b>110</b>. The purpose of the corner-covering component <b>120</b> is to fill the void of the notch <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 13, a corner-covering component <b>120</b> is shown, as it would be fitted to one corner of the tray liner <b>110</b>. FIG. 13 shows some possible variations a, b and c of such a component. The component <b>120</b> will fit to all four corners, and may be glued, stapled or mechanically attached by means of a protrusion <b>122</b> or equivalent method of attachment to the lip <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> as best fits the scheme of manufacturing. The material of the tray liner is the same as that described in reference to the tray liner <b>20</b> described above, and the manufacturing process for the tray liner <b>110</b>, and the component <b>120</b> would be the same in a vacuum-forming operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 14, yet another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated, as a tray liner <b>30</b> may be manufactured using a blanking process from sheet material of the same nature as described above. The material once again would probably be of a 0.020″-0.040″ thickness and resistant to moisture and deterioration from exposure to the elements or exposure to the mushroom growing medium. Again, the tray liner <b>130</b> is made of a material such as polyethylene, polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate formable material. In this case, a tray liner <b>130</b> is shown as blanked out with a notch <b>132</b> typical in each corner. The blanking process will include a pre-weakening process such as perforation, and dimpling or compression of the material to permit bending and forming of the material to create a box-like structure thereby forming the final tray liner <b>130</b> to be inserted into a mushroom-growing tray <b>30</b>. This produces a series of relief's in the material. This series of relief's extend substantially parallel to each edge of a side <b>131</b> <i>a</i>, <b>131</b> <i>b</i>, <b>131</b> <i>c</i>, <b>131</b> <i>d </i>of the substantially rectangular base member <b>131</b>. The series of relief's resulting from the perforations, dimpling or compression of the material partially pierce, or semi pierces the material so as to permit the forming of a box-like structure into the tray liner <b>130</b>. Additionally, the series of relief's can expand lineally to permit bending of the material so as to form the box-like structure and thereby the resulting tray liner <b>130</b>. A detail of the blanking process showing a typical perforation <b>134</b> is shown in the enlarged FIG. 15 taken along the lines a—a, and it will be understood that a substitutable compression process that will aid in the forming process will also be applicable to the design of this form of tray liner. The compression process that is used may cause a dimple to form that aids in the bending process. Another direction of such a compression applied to the tray liner <b>130</b> is seen in FIG. 17 as taken from FIG. 14 along the lines of b—b. The compression is directed in a direction to permit bending in a direction <b>136</b>, for example, in the case of an end <b>138</b> of the tray liner <b>130</b>. The end <b>138</b> is typical of the upstanding wall section <b>133</b> of the tray liner <b>130</b> when fully formed as represented in FIG. <b>20</b>. The compression process will be modified to aid in the forming of the tray liner <b>130</b> in any direction where the parts are formed. Referring to FIG. 22, the blanking process is represented as the blank of the tray liner <b>130</b> and may be manufactured using perforations throughout. It will be recognized that any combination of perforation and compression as described above will suffice. FIG. 22 illustrates a slight enlargement of the detail of the notch <b>132</b> described above, with the perforation applied as a series of perforations <b>140</b> where necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Yet another embodiment of a tray liner is illustrated in the perspective view of FIG. 18 wherein a tray liner <b>150</b> is shown. This is the result of yet another blanking process as illustrated in FIG. 19, manufactured from the same types of materials described above, but added details in a typical corner <b>152</b>. In this design, a tab <b>154</b> is typical, as shown, blanked out in the FIG. 19, and perforated, as described above, to be folded to accommodate the upstanding corner members <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c</i>, <b>31</b> <i>d </i>of the mushroom growing tray <b>30</b> described earlier in this specification. The resulting tray liner <b>150</b> thereby comprises a substantially rectangular base member having a periphery of upstanding sidewalls joined at each of two sides and two ends to a base portion of the rectangular base member with a notch section located at each corner of the base member. The notch section accommodates the corner frame member located at each corner of the mushroom-growing tray. A tab <b>154</b> is formed into a corner liner component and is insertable into the rectangular base member of the formed tray liner <b>150</b> so as to cover the otherwise exposed area of each corner of the mating mushroom-growing tray. The tab <b>154</b> which is the corner liner component is generally formed into an upstanding right angle member which has two upstanding side panels with a lip projecting at right angles from each side panel that will mate with a lip on an end and side portion of the formed tray liner <b>150</b>. It will be a matter of choice to manufacturer the component tray liners described herein by the various methods, and processes, as best fits cost and other considerations of the tray liner designer and manufacturer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The assembly and use of the tray liner <b>20</b> in the wooden mushroom growing tray <b>30</b> is as follows. The tray liner <b>20</b> is inserted into the wooden tray <b>30</b> directly, with the notch sections <b>28</b> <i>a</i>, <b>28</b> <i>b</i>, <b>28</b> <i>c </i>and <b>28</b> <i>d </i>fitting between the upstanding corner frame members <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>31</b> <i>d </i>of the wooden tray <b>30</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>). An employee of the mushroom farm, or an individual who will grow mushrooms, would depress the tray liner <b>20</b> into a co-mating position wherein the tray liner <b>20</b> is resting evenly on the generally horizontal bottom surface <b>30</b> <i>g </i>of the wooden tray <b>30</b>. When this is so, the upstanding side walls <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and upstanding end walls <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> (FIG. 2) of the liner <b>20</b> are adjacently positioned to the inside walls <b>30</b>h, <b>30</b> <i>k</i>, <b>30</b> <i>l </i>and <b>30</b> <i>m </i>respectively of the adjoining wooden tray <b>30</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">During the insertion process, the tray liner <b>20</b> may be stapled or otherwise fastened to the wooden tray <b>30</b> depending on the operator's preference. At this time, the mushroom growing medium may be filled into the tray liner <b>20</b>, as desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After one or more growing breaks of mushrooms in the assembly herein described, the tray liner <b>20</b> may be emptied and the mushroom growing medium replaced to repeat the cycle. Although the intent of this invention is for the tray liner <b>20</b> to last the life of the wooden tray <b>30</b>, the tray liner <b>20</b> may be replaced if necessary after a number of cycles, depending on its condition. If replaced, the tray liner <b>20</b> may be recycled, as mentioned above, to complete the process of use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Additionally, as shown in FIG. 3, there maybe a suitable arrangement of slots (not shown) located in the bottom surface <b>25</b> of the tray liner <b>20</b>. The slots may be formed manually via knife, either after liner is inserted in tray or by a machine process whereby they are punched into the bottom surface of liner <b>20</b> during manufacturing. Such slots may be desirable to achieve specific moisture levels necessary for the mushroom-growing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the present invention has been disclosed and described with reference to a single embodiment thereof, it will be apparent, as noted above, that variations and modifications may be made therein. It is also noted that the present invention is representative as an example of the articles and components described and is not limited to the application to mushroom trays. It is thus, intended in the following claims to cover each variation and modification that falls within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.</div>
