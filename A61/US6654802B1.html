<div class="abstract">A system and method for continuously monitoring neighboring network elements and determining physical connection topology and changes in topology among network elements. Each port in a network element capable of having physical connectivity to a port on an adjacent network element has a unique identification of the node and a unique identification of the port. The identification is both available to the network management system and continuously transmitted on the physical link between two ports in the network, thus identifying the transmitting port to the receiving port. As nodes and ports are added to or deleted from a network, a representation of the nodes or ports is added or removed from the network management system. The local operating program in each network element informs the network management system of changes, or changes are queried by a network management system. The transmission of identification takes place in overhead data channels, designated as topology trace channels, which are designed into the overall framework of the transmission system and its equipment. No information capacity that could support network customer traffic or network control traffic between network elements is pre-empted.</div>

<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention generally relates to automatic discovery of network topology in multi-node, multi-connection telecommunications networks. In particular, the invention relates to real-time dynamic determination of the physical topology of a network as nodes and/or ports interfacing physical inter-node connections are added to, or deleted from, the network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Large telecommunications networks are comprised of multiple network elements, each possibly having multiple ports for passing data between the various network elements. A subset of network elements used to transport information may be described as the transmission system. The transmission elements of a telecommunications network transmission system are those elements that interface various transmission links, such as optical fibers, conducting wires or cables, or wireless radio links of various types. The data transported by the transmission system may include: voice, video, digital and analog data in many different formats.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Transmission systems typically include various layers of software. For example, the Open System Interconnection reference model includes seven layers, such as the physical layer. Regardless of the model, the physical layer comprises the various network elements and the associated interconnections. The software drivers for implementing the physical layer direct how bits are placed on and removed from the physical connections between network elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">System-specific information is transferred between network elements primarily using overhead in the links between ports to communicate among nodes. Overhead may take one or both of two forms. One form is a structure where system control data is defined and formatted to always be present, coexisting with the transmission space allocated to carrying network customer information (i.e. payload), and always allowing a specific amount of customer information to be supported in a given physical path. The various designators in the overhead may change, but the change does not alter the amount of bandwidth or frame capacity dedicated to payload. Examples of standards applied for implementing the physical layer of a communications network are the Synchronous Optical NETwork standard (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) transmission systems. Another example associated with a data link layer of software is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another form of overhead is a structure where specifically formatted information is transmitted along with the payload of the network. Examples of this are Resource Management (RM) cells in an ATM system, and Neighbor Information Frames (NIF) in an Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One byte of the former type of overhead data, such as defined by SONET, is the Section Trace byte (J<b>0</b>). The Synchronous Digital Hierarchy standard defines the Section Trace byte as a 16 byte message string. As originally intended, the Section Trace byte is repetitively transmitted so that a receiving network element may verify continued connection to the intended transmitting network element. In the case where Network administrators elected not to use the Section Trace byte capability, a 01 Hex is transmitted in the byte.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Regardless of the standards used, transmission systems in large telecommunications networks may change their connectivity characteristics at irregular intervals, such as when new network elements or ports are added to or deleted from the network. Connectivity may also change due to equipment or link failures or maintenance. The current connectivity state of a network is called its topology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Precise topology information is needed to accomplish many telecommunications network functions. The ability to place a new connection for transferring information from one port to another port, or multiple ports, through a process referred to as circuit provisioning or connection management, is dependent on accurate network topology information. Other dependencies include correlation of network alarms to specific physical locations and restoration of failed connections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The overall network topology is typically manually entered into a record for use by a management system. If a network element or port is added or removed, the record of the network topology is manually altered to reflect the change. This manual process is subject to human error and requires significant time and resources. Errors result in significant resource expenditures for trouble shooting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Automatic discovery of the network topology without manual entry of the topology may be provided. These methods rely on transferring topology data between network nodes using data space, such as cells or frames, that might otherwise be used for transmitting customer payload data. One such method is disclosed by Chatwani et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,729,685. Data Link layer software, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol software, is used to transmit topology information to the network management system. Link advertisement messages on each of the ports of each ATM switch in the network are transmitted as part of the payload. The messages are received by neighbor switches and forwarded to a topology manager that constructs an overall network topology profile. However, use of the payload bandwidth reduces the amount of bandwidth for transmitting user information. Furthermore, the Data Link layer is removed from the network elements and other hardware.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">U.S. Pat. No. 5,481,674 by Mahavadi, describes a method for generating a topology map between devices on an FDDI network. In an FDDI network, a token is passed from controller to controller in a predetermined direction on a path or ring containing all controllers connected to the network. The system determines upstream and downstream neighbors and ports on the FDDI network by performing a mapping based on received Station Information Frame (SIF) responses consecutively sent to elements of the network through exiting connections and ports. The SIF occupies the same information path as the user data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above described art reduces the usable traffic capacity (i.e. payload) in a given network link to communicate topology information. The present invention is directed to improvements that allow automatic discovery of network topology without a corresponding reduction in payload bandwidth at the physical layer.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates to a system and method for determining the topology of a multi-node network such that the method used does not reduce the originally designed information-carrying capacity of the network links, or interrupt existing payload traffic. Overhead data, such as associated with the physical layer, is specifically identified for and is used to transmit unique network and port identifiers from a source node to a destination node connected by a link. The transmission may be continuous.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each port in a network element has local knowledge of the identity of the corresponding port and network element at the far end of the physical link. A network management system correlates the data in each network element in order to form a topology map for the entire network, allowing the network management system to track changes in links and ports.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Local knowledge in the network element is maintained through the use of object-oriented programming techniques, where the identification of a far-end port is maintained as an attribute associated with the object representing the local port. Changes in this far-end identification attribute causes the object to be updated, resulting in a topology change.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In one aspect described below, a method and system for determining network topology in a communications network is provided. A first network element is connected to a second network element. Data from the first network element is continuously transmitted to the second network element, each transmission of data comprising physical layer overhead data and payload data. A network element identification is provided in the physical layer overhead data without reduction of a bandwidth of the payload data. The network topology is determined from at least the network element identification transmitted to the second network element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In another aspect described below, a method and system for determining network topology in a communications network comprises: (a) providing first and second network elements, the first network element comprising at least a first port and the second network element comprising at least a second port and a register; (b) connecting the first port to the second port; (c) transmitting a first network element and first port identifier from the first network element to the second network element; (d) storing the first network element and first port identifier in the register; and (e) determining a connection relationship between at least the first and second network elements as a function of the first network element and first port identifier stored in the register.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a network and a flow chart for determining network topology is shown. The topology of the multi-node network is determined without reducing the payload information-carrying capacity or bandwidth of the network links or without interrupting existing payload traffic. Overhead data, such as associated with the physical layer, is used to transmit unique network and port identifiers from a source node to a destination node connected by a link. The topology is determined from the identifiers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 1, a graphical representation of one embodiment of a telecommunications network is shown generally at <b>20</b>. Network <b>20</b> comprises network elements <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, ports <b>26</b> and link <b>28</b>. Additional network elements <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may be provided. Additional links between network elements <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> or between one of network elements <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and another element may also be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each network element <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> comprises a node. Each network element <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> comprises a switch and includes processing and memory resources which enable operation and communication of configuration and status information to a network management system. The memory resources comprise any data storage device, such as RAM, a hard drive or other devices. The memory resources may be divided to include registers for storing information. For example, two registers are provided for every port <b>26</b> in each network element <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. In the destination network element, one register stores information identifying the destination port <b>26</b> and network element <b>22</b> or <b>24</b>. The second register is for storing information identifying the source port <b>26</b> and network element <b>24</b> or <b>22</b> connected to the destination port <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A unique network element identifier is stored in each network element <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The network element identifier distinguishes one network element <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> from all other network elements <b>24</b> or <b>22</b>. The network element identifier is stored in the memory resources. In one preferred embodiment, the network element identifier is stored in a network element identifier register of the memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each node has multiple ports <b>26</b>. Each port <b>26</b> comprises the physical interface to the transmission media and sufficient hardware and programming resources to effect performance monitoring, fault reporting, connection management and other characteristic functions needed for a techonogoly. As shown, each network element <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> includes three ports <b>26</b>, but more or fewer ports may be provided on any one or more of network elements <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The number of ports <b>26</b> or network elements <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may change.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A unique port identifier is stored in each network element <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> for each port <b>26</b>. The port identifier distinguishes one port <b>26</b> from all other ports <b>26</b> on any particular network elements <b>24</b> or <b>22</b>. The port identifier is stored in the memory resources. In one preferred embodiment, each port identifier is stored in a port identifier register of the memory where a separate register is provided for each port identifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each node is connected to one or more other nodes through ports <b>26</b> and the physical interconnecting links <b>28</b> between them. Links <b>28</b> comprise any physical connection, such as fiber optics, metal conductors or other connection for transmitting analog or digital data. Links <b>28</b> are uni- or bi-directional.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 2, a flow chart representing one preferred embodiment for determining the topology of network <b>20</b> is shown. An original or new link <b>28</b> is established in step <b>30</b> to connect two network elements <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After connecting network elements <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> with link <b>28</b>, overhead data is transmitted from a source node to a destination node. Either of the network elements <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> comprises the source node and the other network element <b>24</b> or <b>22</b> comprises the destination node. The data is formatted by physical layer software pursuant to the design requirements of the transmission system and includes overhead and payload data in frames. The dedicated overhead data may comprise the same or varying bandwidth between any two frames. Within the payload of a frame defined by the physical layer software, frames of information established pursuant to other software may be provided, such as transport layer frames of data. In alternative embodiments, the basic frame structure is defined pursuant to software other than the physical layer software, such as transport layer software.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In step <b>34</b>, each source port <b>26</b> of each node transmits the network element and port identifiers using transport overhead bytes that are part of the overall design of the transmission system. The network element and port identifiers are obtained from the memory resources of network element <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> and are inserted into the overhead of one or more frames of data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The transport overhead bytes occupy some of the capacity of the physical link <b>28</b>, but a specific amount of capacity or bandwidth of link <b>28</b> is always available for use by the payload traffic capacity. Many possible designs utilizing various overhead bytes or combinations of bytes are possible. The design incorporates overhead bytes designated for use in determining network topology. Once a particular overhead configuration is decided upon, the payload capacity is fixed at a given amount for a given frame of data. The port and network element identifiers are transmitted as part the overhead data without reducing the bandwidth available for payload data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The network element and port identifiers are received by the destination node. In step <b>34</b>, the destination node locates the overhead data designated for topology determination (i.e. the data reserved for the identifiers) and stores the source identifiers in the memory resources, such as those resources associated with the object representing the part receiving the topology data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In one embodiment, the identifiers are buffered in the memory resources and forwarded to the management system with or without long term storage. In other embodiments, network element <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> flags any changes in the identifiers to the management system. The management system then requests transfer of the identifiers. In yet another embodiment, the management system periodically checks for or receives identifiers from the various network elements <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Alternatively, one of network elements <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> comprises the management system, so identifiers stored at that network element <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> are available without transfer. The data is transferred to the management system over separate management links as overhead or payload data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In step <b>36</b>, the topology of network <b>20</b> is determined. The management system or a network element <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> determines a topology map or relationship as a function of the identifiers. Identification of each source port <b>26</b> and network element <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> is obtained from each destination port <b>26</b> and network element <b>22</b> or <b>24</b>. For example, port <b>1</b> of network element <b>22</b> comprises a source port <b>26</b>. Destination network element <b>24</b> stores the identification information received at destination port <b>1</b>. The direction of transmission and connections between network elements are determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 3, a graphical representation of another embodiment of a telecommunications network is shown generally at <b>40</b>. Network <b>40</b> includes network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, management system <b>46</b>, memory <b>48</b> and management links <b>50</b>. In alternative embodiments, network <b>40</b> comprises additional network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> comprise transmission devices, including a processor and memory. Network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> include one or more ports <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, network element identifiers <b>66</b> and <b>70</b>, port identifiers <b>64</b> and <b>68</b>, and registers <b>72</b>. Ports <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> include registers <b>72</b> for storing the received identifiers. Registers <b>72</b> comprise memory, such as buffers, RAM, hard drives or other memory devices. More or fewer ports and associated port identifiers and registers may be provided on one or more of network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Network element and port identifiers <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and/or <b>70</b> are resident in network element <b>42</b> and/or <b>44</b> or ports <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> when the device is manufactured, are entered manually through a local interface device at the time of installation, or are provided by management system <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Management system <b>46</b> comprises a processor, computer or other device for managing network <b>40</b>. Management system <b>46</b> stores data in memory <b>48</b>. Memory <b>48</b> comprises a RAM, hard drive or other memory device. Using memory <b>48</b>, management system <b>46</b> determines the topology of network <b>40</b>. The topology is determined from identifiers provided by network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> over management links <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Management links <b>50</b> comprise fiber optic, wire or other conductors for transferring management information. In one embodiment, management links <b>50</b> transfer only management information. In alternative embodiments, management links <b>50</b> transfer payload along with data associated with network users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each network element <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> is installed and connected to management system <b>46</b> over management links <b>50</b>. Management system <b>46</b> either obtains or reads network element identifier <b>66</b> and <b>70</b> from network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, respectively, or assigns a unique network element identifier <b>66</b> and <b>70</b> to network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, respectively. Management system <b>46</b> also queries or is provided by network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> which ports <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> are present. Each port <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> in each network element <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> is assigned a unique identifier, either by respective network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> (e.g. through a built-in process, or manually entered by Craft Interface Terminal (CIT)) or by management system <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Management system <b>46</b> also queries or is provided the characteristics of the ports <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, such as link information. Since network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are not yet connected to other network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>, a null or other set value representing no connection is provided to management system <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In one preferred embodiment, the identification of network element <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> and a port identification is stored in separate registers <b>72</b> for each port <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>. Thus, each port is uniquely identified by network element <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> and port <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>. These identifiers are provided to a management system <b>46</b> as tables or attributes to objects. Management system <b>46</b>, based on the identifiers and associated connection information (e.g. no current connections), determines topology <b>74</b>. If additional network elements already comprise part of network <b>40</b>, the connections and additional network elements are included as part of topology <b>74</b> of physical links and nodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For each connection between network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, the source network node, such as network element <b>42</b>, provides identification of the source network element as well as identification of the source port, such as port <b>52</b>, using byte(s) in the frame overhead to the destination node, such as network element <b>44</b>. Each destination node continuously receives the identification of the source port and source node at the far end of each link <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each destination node associates this unique identification with a programming object that represents the destination port in the operating system of the destination node. For example, the identification of the source port and network element is stored in register <b>72</b> associated with the destination port of the destination node. Destination ports that are not connected have null values assigned in this programming object, as shown in unconnected network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> of FIG. <b>3</b>. Other values may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In one preferred embodiment, management system <b>46</b> is notified of all changes in this far-end port attribute (i.e. attribute associated with the programming object stored in register <b>72</b>), as well as when ports <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> are installed in, or removed from, network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, or when network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are installed in, or removed from, transmission network <b>40</b>. Management system correlates these attributes into an overall network topology <b>74</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In one preferred embodiment, network <b>40</b> comprises a network operated pursuant to the SONET standard for operating the physical layer of network <b>40</b>. Other standards maybe used, such as SDH. Other standards may be modified to include topology information in the overhead or header, such as modifying FDDI or ATM. Current requirements for SONET networks are as outlined in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard T1.105, with generic requirements as outlined in Bellcore document GR-253-CORE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The configuration of basic frame structure <b>80</b> of a SONET transmission signal is designated as an STS-1 and is shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. Transport overhead <b>82</b> occupies a certain amount of space in every frame <b>80</b>, leaving space or bandwidth for payload envelope <b>84</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. As shown in FIG. 6, some designated path overhead <b>86</b> exists within payload envelope <b>84</b>, leaving a specific amount of payload capacity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 7, the size of a given SONET frame <b>80</b> may vary, depending on its designed size, such as STS-1, STS-3, STS-12, STS-48, STS-N, where N is an integer multiple of the basic STS-1. As shown in FIG. 8, payload envelope <b>84</b> remains fixed in proportion to the size of frame <b>80</b>, with overall payload capacity being fixed for each type of STS-N.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIGS. 9 and 10, bytes occupying transport overhead <b>82</b> and path overhead <b>86</b> have various designations. The uses of these bytes pertain to the operation of the overall SONET system. The transmission of data using these overhead bytes does not reduce the available payload capacity used to carry customer traffic. The bytes marked by X in FIG. 9 have no specific designated purpose and may be used by equipment vendors to implement specific purposes identified as desirable for particular equipment or a particular network.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Various of these overhead bytes may be used to transmit network element identifier <b>66</b> or <b>70</b> and port identifier <b>64</b> and <b>68</b>. Overhead bytes identified for other purposes may be modified and used to support this topology discovery process, or one or more of the undefined overhead bytes could be used. Using an undefined overhead byte may require that the STS-N carries multiple STS-1's. Since this may or may not be the case, one of the existing defined transport overhead bytes is re-defined in one preferred embodiment for implementation in SONET or SDH transmission systems. Future standards or other standards could have an overhead byte designated for the purpose of topology study at the time the systems or standards are designed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In one preferred embodiment, the network element and port identifiers <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> are transmitted in the overhead from the source node to the destination node using SONET section trace bytes. Thus, the section trace registers are used as registers <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The SONET section trace byte is byte J<b>0</b> in the transport overhead <b>82</b>. This byte is an overhead byte, the use of which does not reduce the customer payload of the SONET transmissions. The SONET section trace byte (J<b>0</b>) is currently defined in Bellcore GR-253-CORE as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Section Trace (J<b>0</b>)/Section Growth (Z<b>0</b>)—The byte in each of the N STS-1s an STS-N that was formerly defined as the STS-1 ID (C<b>1</b>) byte has been redefined either as the Section Trace byte (in the first STS-1 of the STS-N), or as a Section Growth byte (in the second through Nth STS-1s). Detailed criteria concerning the use of these bytes for their new functions are for further study. Until those details are determined, the following criteria apply. They will be modified as necessary when the details of the Section Trace feature and uses for the Section Growth bytes are defined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">O3-14 [17] STE that supports line-side signals should have the capability to access the J<b>0</b> byte, which is located in the first STS-1 of an STS-N.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The ability to access the J<b>0</b> byte is not required for STE that only supports drop-side signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R3-15 [18] Unless it is being used for a defined purpose (e.g., to carry a Section Trace message once the details of that feature are defined) each J<b>0</b> and Z<b>0</b> byte shall be set to a binary number corresponding to its order of appearance in the STS-N frame (i.e., the J<b>0</b> byte shall be set to 00000001, the first Z<b>0</b> byte shall be set to 00000010, the second Z<b>0</b> byte to 00000011, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The preceding requirement is applicable for both line-side and drop-side signals. In ANSI T1.105-1995 the SONET Section Trace byte (J<b>0</b>) is defined as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Section trace (J<b>0</b>): One byte is allocated to be used for a section trace function. This byte is defined only for STS-1 number 1 of an STS-N signal. This byte, J<b>0</b> (formally C<b>1</b> of STS-1 number 1) is used to repetitively transmit a one byte fixed length string so that a receiving terminal in a section can verify its continued connection to the intended transmitter. The content of this message is not to be constrained by this standard since it is assumed to be user programmable at both the transmit and receive ends. This will provide up to 256 possible values for section trace. When the Section Trace function is not supported or if no value has been programmed, then 01 Hex shall be transmitted. SDH also uses this byte as Section Trace, but prefers a 16-byte trace message.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Pursuant to this definition, the Section Trace byte is used so that a receiving terminal, such as network element <b>44</b>, in a section, after being manually provisioned with an appropriate identification, can verify continued connection to the intended transmitter, such as network element <b>42</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The section trace byte is redefined or programmed to communicate network element and port identifiers <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and/or <b>70</b>. If more than <b>256</b> identifiers are required to uniquely identify each port <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> and each network element <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, then the section trace byte may be defined as more than one byte.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although presently defined as a single byte for SONET, the Section Trace has been defined by SDH standards groups as a 16-byte repetitive message string using the section trace byte. In one embodiment, the need for a larger section trace information content in SONET is accommodated by increasing the size from one repeating byte in every frame to a repeating sequential string message of bytes in successive frames. The duration of the string, in terms of the number of successive frames that must be sent before repeating the string, must be long enough to adequately identify the data contained in the section trace as being unique in a large network. The Section Trace Byte string could be made as large as the currently existing path trace byte (J<b>1</b>) string, or even larger if necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The path trace byte, J<b>1</b>, is defined, from ANSI T1.105, below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">STS path trace (J<b>1</b>)—Class A: This byte is used to repetitively transmit a 64-byte, fixed-length string so that a receiving terminal in a path can verify its continued connection to the intended transmitter. The content of the message is not constrained by this standard, since it is assumed to be user programmable at both the transmit and receive ends. However, it is suggested that a 8-bit ASCII string padded with NULL characters and terminated with CR/LF, would be a suitable 64 byte trace message. If no message has been loaded, than 64 NULL characters (Hex 00) shall be transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">SDH uses this byte for an access point identifier and prefers a 61-byte string.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A long message string, similar in size to the SONET J<b>1</b> byte, transmitted by the Section Trace Byte, J<b>0</b>, provides unique identification for network topology auto-discovery as discussed herein. While the section trace byte is used in one embodiment, other SONET or SDH overhead data may be used, as could overhead data in other future yet to be defined systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 11, network <b>40</b> is shown with link <b>100</b> from network element <b>42</b> to network element <b>44</b>. Port <b>52</b> transmits data to port <b>58</b> over link <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Identifiers, such as identifier <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>, are entered into register <b>72</b> associated with a given output port, such as port <b>52</b>, for transmission as section trace bytes in the SONET framing overhead. The received identifiers at the destination node are accumulated and held in register <b>72</b> associated with an input port, such as port <b>58</b>, at the adjacent network element, such as network element <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The section trace information from network element <b>42</b> is communicated through the traffic stream signal framing (i.e. in the section trace (J<b>0</b>) byte). Once link <b>100</b> is established, receive section trace register <b>72</b> associated with port <b>58</b> changes from NULL to the section trace data results (e.g. identifiers <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>). This change in receive section trace register <b>72</b> is communicated to management system <b>46</b>, and the register contents are transferred to management system <b>46</b>. The transfer is provided either directly, by being associated with the alert that there has been a port status change, or indirectly, when the management system queries network element <b>44</b> following the reception of a port status change. In alternative embodiments, network element <b>44</b> periodically transmits the information to management system <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Management system <b>46</b> obtains the contents of all registers <b>72</b> in network <b>40</b>. In one embodiment, only information in registers <b>72</b> associated with changes are subsequently obtained. In alternative embodiments, information from one or more of registers <b>72</b> is periodically queried or obtained regardless of any change.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The information is used to determine associations between network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. These associations define network topology <b>74</b>. In the example of FIG. 11, link <b>100</b> comprises a two-way communications link between network elements <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. Registers <b>72</b> associated with connected ports <b>52</b> and <b>58</b> include source identifiers <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> and <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, respectively and destination identifiers <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, respectively. Management system <b>46</b> determines topology <b>74</b> from the identifiers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Whenever a new port card is installed, the new port card is assigned a unique section trace in the new port card's transmit register. When the new port card is connected through optical or other media to a corresponding far-end port, the received section trace generates an event report. In response, management system <b>46</b> retrieves the section trace information. The retrieved information is added to the existing network topology, in an “auto-discovery” process through correlation of identifiers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It should be understood that many changes and modifications can be made to the embodiments described above. For example, different standards other than SONET or SDH may be used. Different overhead bytes may also be used to provide the identifiers. It is therefore intended that the foregoing detailed description be understood as an illustration of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, and not as a definition of the invention. It is only the following claims, including all equivalents, that are intended to define the scope of the invention.</div>
