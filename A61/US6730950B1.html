<heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor memory devices and more particularly to memory structures and methods for forming a local interconnect layer within a conductive plate of a ferroelectric capacitor in a ferroelectric memory device.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In semiconductor memory devices, data is read from or written to the memory using address signals and various other control signals. In a random access memory (“RAM”), an individual binary data state (e.g., a bit) is stored in a volatile memory cell, wherein a number of such cells are grouped together into arrays of columns and rows accessible in random fashion along bitlines and wordlines, respectively, wherein each cell is associated with a unique wordline and bitline pair. Address decoder control circuits identify one or more cells to be accessed in a particular memory operation for reading or writing, wherein the memory cells are typically accessed in groups of bytes or words (e.g., generally a multiple of 8 cells arranged along a common wordline). Thus, by specifying an address, a RAM is able to access a single byte or word in an array of many cells, so as to read or write data from or into that addressed memory cell group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Two major classes of random access memories include “dynamic” (e.g., DRAMs) and “static” (e.g., SRAMs) devices. For a DRAM device, data is stored in a capacitor, where an access transistor gated by a wordline selectively couples the capacitor to a bit line. DRAMs are relatively simple, and typically occupy less area than SRAMs. However, DRAMs require periodic refreshing of the stored data, because the charge stored in the cell capacitors tends to dissipate. Accordingly DRAMs need to be refreshed periodically in order to preserve the content of the memory. SRAM devices, on the other hand, do not need to be refreshed. SRAM cells typically include several transistors configured as a flip-flop having two stable states, representative of two binary data states. Since the SRAM cells include several transistors, however, SRAM cells occupy more area than do DRAM cells. However, SRAM cells operate relatively quickly and do not require refreshing and the associated logic circuitry for refresh operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A major disadvantage of SRAM and DRAM devices is volatility, wherein removing power from such devices causes the data stored therein to be lost. For instance, the charge stored in DRAM cell capacitors dissipates after power has been removed, and the voltage used to preserve the flip-flop data states in SRAM cells drops to zero, by which the flip-flop loses its data. Accordingly, SRAMs and DRAMs are commonly referred to as “volatile” memory devices. Non-volatile (NV) memories are available, such as Flash and EEPROM. However, these types of non-volatile memory have operational limitations on the number of write cycles. For instance, Flash memory devices generally have life spans from 100K to 10MEG write operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Recently however, non-volatile ferroelectric RAM devices have been developed, which are commonly referred to as FERAMs or FRAMs. FERAM cells employ ferroelectric capacitors (FECaps) including a pair of capacitor plates with a ferroelectric material, such as SBT or PZT, as the capacitor dielectric situated between them. Ferroelectric materials have two different stable polarization states that may be used to store binary information, where the ferroelectric behavior follows a hysteresis curve of polarization versus applied voltage. FERAM memory cells are non-volatile memory devices, because the polarization state of an FECap remains when power is removed from the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Two types of memory cells are used commonly, a single capacitor memory cell and a dual capacitor memory cell. The single capacitor memory cell (referred to as a 1T/1C or 1C memory cell) requires less silicon area (thereby increasing the potential density of the memory array), but is less immune to noise, process and cycling variations. Additionally, a 1C cell requires a voltage reference for determining a stored memory state. The dual capacitor memory cell (referred to as a 2T/2C or 2C memory cell) requires more silicon area, and it stores complementary signals allowing differential sampling of the stored information. The 2C memory cell generally is more stable than a 1C memory cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As illustrated in prior art FIG. 1, a 1T/1C FeRAM cell <b>10</b> includes one transistor <b>12</b> and one ferroelectric storage capacitor <b>14</b>. A bottom electrode of the storage capacitor <b>14</b> is connected to a drain terminal <b>15</b> of the transistor <b>12</b>. The 1T/1C cell <b>10</b> is read from by applying a signal to the gate <b>16</b> of the transistor (word line WL)(e.g., the Y signal), thereby connecting the bottom electrode of the capacitor <b>14</b> to the source of the transistor (the bit line BL) <b>18</b>. A pulse signal is then applied to the top electrode contact (the drive line DL or plate line PL) <b>19</b>. The potential on the bit line <b>18</b> of the transistor <b>12</b> is, therefore, the capacitor charge divided by the bit line capacitance. Since the capacitor charge is dependent upon the bi-stable polarization state of the ferroelectric material, the bit line potential can have two distinct values. A sense amplifier (not shown) is connected to the bit line <b>18</b> and detects the voltage associated with a logic value of either 1 or 0. Frequently, the sense amplifier reference voltage is provided by a “reference cell”, which comprises a ferroelectric or non-ferroelectric capacitor connected to another bit line that is not being read. In this manner, the memory cell data is retrieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A characteristic of the shown ferroelectric memory cell is that a read operation is destructive. The data in a memory cell is then rewritten back to the memory cell after the read operation is completed. Since the polarization of the ferroelectric is switched, the read operation is destructive and the sense amplifier must rewrite (onto that cell) the correct polarization value as the bit just read from the cell. This is similar to the operation of a DRAM. One difference from a DRAM is that a ferroelectric memory cell will retain its state until it is interrogated, thereby eliminating the need of refresh.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As illustrated, for example, in prior art FIG. 2, a 2T/2C memory cell <b>20</b> in a memory array couples to a bit line <b>22</b> and an inverse of the bit line (“bit line-bar”) <b>24</b> that is common to many other memory types (for example, static random access memories). Memory cells of a memory block are formed in memory rows and memory columns. The dual capacitor ferroelectric memory cell comprises two transistors <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> and two ferroelectric capacitors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively. The first transistor <b>26</b> couples between the bit line <b>22</b> and a first capacitor <b>30</b>, and the second transistor <b>28</b> couples between the bit line-bar <b>24</b> and the second capacitor <b>32</b>. The first and second capacitors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> have a common terminal or plate line PL <b>34</b> to which a signal is applied for polarizing the capacitors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a write operation, the first and second transistors <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the dual capacitor ferroelectric memory cell <b>20</b> are enabled (e.g., via their respective word line WL <b>36</b>) to couple the capacitors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> to the complementary logic levels on the bit line <b>22</b> and the bar-bar line <b>24</b> corresponding to a logic state to be stored in memory. The common terminal <b>34</b> of the capacitors is pulsed during a write operation to polarize the dual capacitor memory cell <b>20</b> to one of the two logic states.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a read operation, the first and second transistors <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of the dual capacitor memory cell <b>20</b> are enabled via the word line <b>36</b> to couple the information stored on the first and second capacitors <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> to the bit line <b>22</b> and the bit line-bar line <b>24</b>, respectively. A differential signal (not shown) is thus generated across the bit line <b>22</b> and the bit line-bar line <b>24</b> by the dual capacitor memory cell <b>20</b>. The differential signal is sensed by a sense amplifier (not shown) that provides a signal corresponding to the logic level stored in memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ferroelectric memory cells employing these FECaps provide certain performance advantages over other forms of non-volatile data storage devices, such as Flash and EEPROM type memories. For example, ferroelectric memories offer short programming (e.g., write access) times and low power consumption and lower voltage operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Several additional memory devices have been developed utilizing FECaps, such as the four transistor (4T) two capacitor (2C) non-volatile (NV) SRAM cell (4T/2C NV SRAM), and the FECap based reference cell noted above. In these NV FERAM devices, the FECap is commonly coupled to several (e.g., 3-5) MOS transistors or other such memory circuit elements through contacts and vias to the metal layer (e.g., M<b>1</b>) for interconnection. However, as device densities and memory speed requirements continue to increase, the M<b>1</b> metal layer tends to become increasing crowded and may limit the layout area available, particularly for the memory cells. In addition, the area and length required by the interconnection contacts and vias coupling the circuit elements to the M<b>1</b> layer, further limits the layout area, the size of the FECaps, and the minimum resistance between the interconnected circuit elements. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved memory structure for interconnecting a non-volatile ferroelectric capacitor with associated circuit elements in a ferroelectric device.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of one or more aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention, and is neither intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention, nor to delineate the scope thereof. Rather, the primary purpose of the summary is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One aspect of the invention relates to an improved ferroelectric device structure and methods for forming a local interconnect layer with a conductive plate of a ferroelectric capacitor in a ferroelectric device. The device comprises a ferroelectric capacitor and a plurality of circuit elements, which are locally interconnected using the metal or otherwise conductive layer formed from one of the conductive plates of the ferroelectric capacitor. In various ferroelectric circuits that use an FECap, the FECap is required to electrically couple to several MOS transistors or other such circuit elements. Typically, this interconnection is done by routing through a contact and/or via from the FECap down to the circuit element in an active region, then back up through the M<b>1</b> layer interconnect layer, then finally back down again to multiple circuit elements thru respective contacts and/or vias associated with respective circuit elements. This extensive use of the M<b>1</b> tends to crowd the M<b>1</b> and may limit layout density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By contrast, the present invention uses a plate of the ferroelectric capacitor as a local interconnection layer for multiple circuit elements, rather than using the M<b>1</b>. Although the invention is described and illustrated in exemplary circuits and structures using the bottom electrode of the FECap, it is anticipated that either the top or bottom electrodes of the FECap may be used as the local interconnection layer for the purpose of interconnecting multiple circuit elements. It is further anticipated that both the top and bottom electrodes may be used as local interconnection layers for interconnecting various combinations of multiple circuit elements and multiple segments of one or more metal layers such as the M<b>1</b> layer. Circuit elements may include, for example, active regions such as the source, drain or gate of a MOS transistor or other such circuit elements in or on a semiconductor substrate. It should be noted, however, that the use of the term “substrate” herein, includes the base semiconductor wafer and any epitaxial layers or other type semiconductor layers formed thereover or associated therewith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention, therefore, takes advantage of the increased FECap surface area required in the layout to interconnect the FECap to the various circuit elements. In addition, the total overall length of the interconnections is shorter in this interconnection structure and scheme, in part, because the interconnection vias are shorter. Manufacturability is also improved due to a reduced number of vias and interconnects. Further, the layout area or layout complexity is reduced in the present invention, as the FECap surface area is unbroken by the area required for contacts and/or vias between the selected circuit elements and the M<b>1</b> layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The ferroelectric memory device of the instant invention is beneficially adapted to provide an additional interconnection layer (local interconnect layer) between multiple circuit elements. As such, the inventor has realized that when the scheme is applied to memory devices requiring larger numbers of interconnections, more benefits of the invention may be derived. The ferroelectric memory device of the present invention comprises first and second circuit elements associated with the ferroelectric memory device, and a ferroelectric capacitor having a conductive plate residing over a first interlevel dielectric layer (ILD). The plate (e.g., top or bottom electrode) of the FECap extends between the first and second circuit elements, providing a local interconnect layer for electrically coupling the first circuit element to the conductive plate directly through a first via, and electrically coupling a second circuit element to the conductive plate directly through a second via, thereby electrically coupling together the circuit elements of the memory device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The FECap local interconnect layer may be any form or type of conductive plate material used in the ferroelectric capacitor, where the plate forms an integral part of the electrical coupling path between two or more interconnected circuit elements. The FECap local interconnect layer may be used in numerous exemplary FERAM devices, such as the four transistor two capacitor non-volatile SRAM cell (4T/2C NV SRAM), the non-volatile FECap based reference cell, and any other device which requires that an FECap interconnect with two or more circuit elements. For example, one 4T/2C NV SRAM cell requires that each FECap interconnect with three other circuit elements, such as three active regions of three MOS transistors. In another example, a non-volatile reference cell requires that an FECap interconnect with five other circuit elements, such as five active regions of five MOS transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another aspect of the present invention provides an FECap comprising a first and second conductive plate, where the plates have about the same capacitive surface shape and surface area in the FECap. Beneficially, this provision provides for a formation method in accordance with the present invention, requiring no additional processing in a ferroelectric memory device, (e.g., masking, etching operations). Still another aspect of the present invention provides the FECap comprising a capacitor under bitline architecture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another aspect of the invention provides a memory device for storing data in a semiconductor device, which comprises an SRAM memory cell and ferroelectric cell including first and second coupling transistors, first and second access transistors, first and second bitlines, a wordline, and first and second ferroelectric capacitors and which is adapted to store a binary non-volatile data state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Still another aspect of the invention provides methods for forming a FECap in a FERAM device, in which a plurality of circuit elements associated with the FERAM device in a semiconductor material are provided and individually coupled to one of a plurality of contacts formed over the circuit elements and through openings in a first ILD layer overlying the plurality of circuit elements. The FECap formation method also comprises forming a bottom electrode layer, a ferroelectric dielectric layer, a top electrode layer, and a hard mask over the first ILD layer and the plurality of contacts associated with the circuit elements, and patterning the hard mask layer extending over the plurality of contacts. The FECap formation method further includes selectively etching the bottom electrode layer, the ferroelectric dielectric layer, and the top electrode layer using the hard mask to define a capacitor stack residing over the first ILD layer, where the stack extends between the plurality of contacts and electrically couples together the plurality of circuit elements of the device through the plurality of contacts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects and implementations of the invention. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed. Other aspects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. The invention relates to a ferroelectric memory structure in which a local interconnect layer is formed within a conductive plate of a ferroelectric capacitor used in a ferroelectric memory device. In order to better appreciate one or more features of the invention, a conventional ferroelectric memory device and an associated interconnect is hereinafter illustrated and described with respect to FIG. <b>3</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3A illustrates a conventional interconnect in a memory device <b>40</b>A consisting of an FECap (C<sub>FE</sub>) a memory circuit element E<b>1</b>, and an interconnect <b>41</b> <i>a</i>. A plate connection <b>43</b> (e.g., from the M<b>1</b> metal layer) may be supplied thru a via <b>45</b> to FECap C<sub>FE</sub>, which includes a top plate <b>46</b>, a bottom plate <b>47</b>, and a ferroelectric dielectric <b>48</b> therebetween. The exemplary interconnect <b>41</b> <i>a </i>electrically couples C<sub>FE </sub>and circuit element E<b>1</b> (e.g., the gate of a MOS transistor) thru a single interconnect structure (e.g., a via, plug, or contact), typically comprising one or more layers of conductive material and where needed, a diffusion barrier layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3B further illustrates the fragmentary cross-sectional view of a partially fabricated prior art memory device <b>40</b>A containing the FECap (C<sub>FE</sub>) and a transistor associated therewith represented by the circuit element E<b>1</b> of FIG. <b>3</b>A. Memory device <b>40</b>A also illustrates the exemplary single interconnect structure <b>41</b> <i>a </i>of FIG. 3A comprising a via <b>41</b> <i>a </i>used to couple the ferroelectric capacitor C<sub>FE </sub>and the memory circuit element E<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Circuit element E<b>1</b> is provided as an exemplary MOS transistor formed in a substrate <b>49</b> <i>a </i>having active regions (e.g., source and drain regions) <b>49</b> <i>b</i>, and a poly region (e.g., a gate, or gate region) <b>49</b> <i>c </i>over the substrate <b>49</b> <i>a </i>formed within a first interlevel dielectric (ILD) layer <b>49</b> <i>d </i>of memory device <b>40</b>A. The exemplary interconnect via <b>41</b> <i>a </i>is formed within the first ILD layer <b>49</b> <i>d </i>to electrically couple the gate <b>49</b> <i>c </i>of transistor E<b>1</b> to the ferroelectric capacitor C<sub>FE</sub>. C<sub>FE </sub>comprises a bottom plate <b>47</b> formed with a conductive material (e.g., iridium or Ir/IrO<sub>2 </sub>electrodes) over the first ILD layer <b>49</b> <i>d</i>, a ferroelectric dielectric <b>48</b> (e.g., a thin lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ferroelectric material layer) overlying the bottom plate <b>47</b>, and a top plate <b>46</b>, also of a conductive material, formed overlying the ferroelectric dielectric <b>48</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After C<sub>FE </sub>is formed and etched to define a capacitor stack, C<sub>FE </sub>is coupled to the M<b>1</b> metal layer <b>43</b> through a via <b>45</b>, formed within a second ILD layer <b>49</b> <i>e </i>overlying the capacitor stack C<sub>FE</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3B also shows a typical contact/via <b>45</b>′ coupling one of the active regions <b>49</b> <i>b </i>of the circuit element E<b>1</b> to another segment <b>43</b>′ of the M<b>1</b> metal layer. Thus, although FIG. 3B illustrates a single short interconnect contact <b>41</b> <i>a</i>, which directly couples the bottom plate <b>47</b> of the FECap C<sub>FE </sub>to the circuit element E<b>1</b>, only one circuit element is operably coupled to the FECap.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 3C and 3D illustrate another conventional interconnect in a memory device <b>40</b>B consisting of an FECap (C<sub>FE</sub>) a memory circuit element E<b>1</b>, and a multi-segmented interconnect structure comprising (e.g., the three segments <b>41</b> <i>a</i>, <b>41</b>, and <b>41</b>′). Electrically, memory device <b>40</b>B is similar to memory device <b>40</b>A of FIG. 3A and 3B, in that C<sub>FE </sub>is coupled electrically thru the interconnect structure to circuit element E<b>1</b>, and as such need not be described again in detail for the sake of brevity. By contrast, however, the FECap C<sub>FE</sub>, of memory device <b>40</b>B, includes a bottom plate <b>47</b>, extended using extra mask and etch operations, to provide a plate extension region <b>47</b>′ for contact <b>41</b> <i>a</i>. The exemplary multi-segmented interconnect further comprises two vias (<b>41</b> <i>a </i>and <b>41</b>′) which may both traverse greater distances than contact <b>41</b> <i>a </i>of memory device <b>40</b>A. This extra conductor length, in addition to the length of a segment <b>41</b> of the M<b>1</b> metal layer, creates an increased interconnect resistance. Interconnect (<b>41</b> <i>a</i>, <b>41</b>, and <b>41</b>′), therefore, electrically couples C<sub>FE </sub>to a single circuit element E<b>1</b> (e.g., the gate of a MOS transistor), indirectly thru three interconnect segments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The multiple segments (<b>41</b> <i>a</i>, <b>41</b>, and <b>41</b>′) of the interconnect of memory device <b>40</b>B demonstrates a complex and relatively high resistance interconnection between the bottom plate <b>47</b> of the FECap C<sub>FE </sub>and the circuit element E<b>1</b>. In addition, memory device <b>40</b>B has a capacitance, which is limited to the smaller surface area of the top plate <b>46</b> and may require additional processing operations. Thus, the illustrated prior art interconnect structures of FIGS. 3A-3D are unacceptable for the devices considered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate another exemplary schematic and fragmentary cross-sectional view, respectively, of a partially fabricated memory device <b>50</b> containing a prior art interconnection between an FECap (C<sub>FE</sub>) and several memory circuit elements E<b>1</b>-En. FIGS. 4A and 4B have similarities to those of FIGS. 3A-3D, using like numbering where possible, and as such, may not be fully described again for the sake of brevity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Typically, as shown in memory device <b>50</b>, when an FECap is to interconnect with multiple circuit elements, the interconnections are made centrally from an M<b>1</b> metal layer. The M<b>1</b> layer then couples to the multiple circuit elements through contacts associated with each element. The interconnect comprises a contact <b>41</b> <i>a </i>from the bottom plate of C<sub>FE </sub>to a first element E<b>1</b> in an active region <b>49</b> <i>b</i>, and vias (<b>41</b>′, <b>41</b> <i>b</i>, <b>41</b> <i>c</i>, <b>41</b> <i>d</i>) coupling elements E<b>1</b>-E<b>4</b> respectively to a common interconnect segment <b>41</b> in the M<b>1</b> metal layer. The exemplary interconnect structure of memory device <b>50</b> electrically couples C<sub>FE </sub>and several memory circuit elements E<b>1</b>-E<b>4</b> indirectly through the M<b>1</b> layer, vias and a contact. FIGS. 4A and 4B further illustrate that a common connection is made at one element (e.g., E<b>1</b>, <b>49</b> <i>b</i>), and then all other circuit element interconnections are made back up through the common interconnect of the M<b>1</b> layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, the M<b>1</b> layer may tend to be congested in the prior art limiting the circuit density and the FECap surface area, due to the number of via and contact connections between the M<b>1</b> and the active areas of the circuit elements E<b>1</b>-E<b>4</b>. The multiple interconnect segments (<b>41</b> <i>a</i>, <b>41</b>′, <b>41</b>, <b>41</b> <i>b</i>, <b>41</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>41</b> <i>d</i>) of the memory device <b>50</b>, again demonstrate a complex and a relatively high resistance and high capacitance interconnection between the bottom plate <b>47</b> of the FECap C<sub>FE </sub>and the circuit elements E<b>1</b>-E<b>4</b>. In addition, the capacitance of C<sub>FE </sub>is still limited by the surface area of the plates <b>46</b>/<b>47</b> within the ILD layers <b>49</b> <i>d</i>/<b>49</b> <i>e</i>, which is congested by the field of vias coupling the elements E<b>1</b>-E<b>4</b> and the M<b>1</b> layer. Thus, the illustrated prior art interconnect structure of FIGS. 4A-4B is also unacceptable for the devices considered requiring interconnection of multiple elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 5A-5C, illustrate schematic and fragmentary cross-sectional diagrams of a partially fabricated memory device of the present invention, wherein a local interconnect layer is formed within a conductive plate of a ferroelectric capacitor C<sub>FE</sub>. FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate the general case for interconnection between the FECap and a plurality of circuit elements E<b>1</b>-En in a memory device <b>60</b>, and FIG. 5C for a more detailed view of one exemplary interconnection between the FECap and four specific circuit elements E<b>1</b>-E<b>4</b> in a memory device <b>60</b>A. FIGS. 5B and 5C illustrate local interconnections between C<sub>FE </sub>and active regions of the circuit elements (e.g., p-type, n-type, or polysilicon regions) E<b>1</b>-En (e.g., E<b>1</b>-E<b>4</b> of device <b>60</b>A), comprising, for example, a source, drain, or gate of a MOS transistor. Memory devices <b>60</b> and <b>60</b>A, further illustrates that a conductive plate of C<sub>FE </sub>provides a local interconnect node (or interconnect layer) <b>61</b> for direct coupling to the circuit elements through corresponding contacts, rather than being routed indirectly through the M<b>1</b> layer and vias.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A plate connection <b>63</b> (e.g., from the M<b>1</b> metal layer) may be supplied thru a via <b>65</b> <i>a </i>to a top plate <b>66</b> of FECap C<sub>FE</sub>. FECap C<sub>FE </sub>includes the top plate <b>66</b>, a bottom plate <b>67</b>, and a ferroelectric dielectric <b>68</b> therebetween. One plate of the FECap (e.g., the bottom plate <b>67</b>), forms the local interconnect layer <b>61</b> for electrically coupling C<sub>FE </sub>to a plurality of circuit element E<b>1</b>-En, thru a plurality of short contacts, or contacts (e.g., <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>n </i>of device <b>60</b>, or <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>d </i>of device <b>60</b>A) associated with each circuit element (e.g., E<b>1</b>-En of device <b>60</b>, or E<b>1</b>-E<b>4</b> of device <b>60</b>A). Beneficially, the plate area may be increased as an integral part of this local interconnection layer <b>61</b> residing over and extending between the circuit elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, in FIG. 5C the circuit elements E<b>1</b>-E<b>4</b> are formed in a substrate <b>69</b> <i>a </i>having active regions (e.g., source and drain regions) <b>69</b> <i>b</i>, and a poly region (e.g., a gate, or gate region) <b>69</b> <i>c </i>over the substrate <b>69</b> <i>a </i>formed within a first interlevel dielectric (ILD) layer <b>69</b> <i>d </i>of memory device <b>60</b>A. The plurality of vias (e.g., <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>d</i>) are formed within a first ILD layer <b>69</b> <i>d </i>overlying the plurality of circuit element E<b>1</b>-E<b>4</b>, which couple directly to the ferroelectric capacitor C<sub>FE </sub>through the plurality of vias. C<sub>FE </sub>comprises a capacitor stack of two conductive plates and a dielectric layer therebetween, overlying the first ILD layer <b>69</b> <i>d</i>. The capacitor stack comprises the bottom plate <b>67</b> formed with a conductive material (e.g., iridium electrodes) over the first ILD layer <b>69</b> <i>d</i>, the ferroelectric dielectric <b>68</b>, for example, a thin lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ferroelectric material layer formed overlying the bottom plate <b>67</b>, and the top plate <b>66</b>, also of a conductive material, formed overlying the ferroelectric dielectric <b>68</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, either conductive plate (e.g., the top plate <b>66</b>, or the bottom plate <b>67</b>) of the FECap may be used as a local interconnect to directly couple the plurality of circuit elements of the memory device together, as will be further appreciated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 6A, and <b>6</b>B, illustrate a schematic and fragmentary cross-section diagram, respectively, of an exemplary non-volatile 4T-2C SRAM ferroelectric memory cell <b>70</b>, in accordance with the present invention. Memory cell <b>70</b> uses two ferroelectric capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. Each FECap is coupled directly to three MOS transistor circuit elements using an interconnect comprising the conductive plate of an FECap. Interconnections for C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> in this example are identical, thus a description of one such interconnection will convey the concept in accordance with the present invention. For example, FECap C<b>2</b> provides a node (e.g., 71 for C<b>2</b>, or 81 for C<b>1</b>) for direct local electrical interconnections (<b>71</b> <i>a</i>, <b>71</b> <i>b</i>, <b>71</b> <i>c</i>) between four circuit elements (e.g., C<b>2</b>, and three MOS transistors <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, and <b>96</b>) using a conductive plate (e.g., <b>77</b>) of FECap C<b>2</b>, without utilizing another metal layer such as the M<b>1</b> layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 6B further details the exemplary interconnection structure of the partially fabricated memory device <b>70</b> of FIG. 6A, which are similar in many respects to that of FIGS. 5A and 5C, and as such need not be described again in detail for the sake of brevity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, in the exemplary ferroelectric memory device of SRAM ferroelectric memory cell <b>70</b>, two ferroelectric capacitors are used, with each FECap coupled directly to three MOS transistor circuit elements using a conductive plate of the FECap. A local interconnect layer is formed with the conductive plate of the ferroelectric capacitor (e.g., C<b>2</b>) for interconnection between the FECap and two or more circuit elements (e.g., three MOS transistors) in accordance with an aspect of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The SRAM cell <b>70</b> includes two NMOS coupling transistors <b>94</b> and <b>92</b>, which are cross-coupled to FECaps C<b>2</b> and C<b>1</b> respectively, for coupling C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, respectively, to V<sub>SS</sub>. C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are accessed from complementary bitlines BL and <u>BL</u>, respectively, by two NMOS access transistors <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>, wherein the gates of the access transistors <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> are coupled to, and enabled by a wordline WL. The upper terminals of C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are coupled to a single plateline signal PL (<b>73</b>). Internal SRAM nodes <b>71</b> and <b>81</b> are cross-coupled between coupling transistors <b>94</b> and <b>92</b>, and FECaps C<b>2</b> and C<b>1</b> respectively, with the node <b>81</b> coupled with the gate of transistor <b>92</b> and the source of transistor <b>98</b>, and the node <b>71</b> coupled with the gate of transistor <b>94</b> and the source of transistor <b>96</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In contrast to prior art ferroelectric memory devices, as discussed previously, the FECap surface area available for C<b>2</b> may be increased in this scheme, due to the elimination of the surface area conventionally required by the contact/vias between the M<b>1</b> layer and active regions of the substrate. Further, the overall length of the interconnection vias (e.g., <b>71</b> <i>a</i>, <b>71</b> <i>b</i>, <b>71</b> <i>c</i>), are shorter in this structure relative to a conventional scheme, permitting decreased overall interconnect resistance and capacitance, and increased memory device speed. In addition, M<b>1</b> thereover is available for other routing needs, thereby improving layout flexibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This SRAM memory cell is adapted to store a binary non-volatile data state. However, the purpose, operations and functions of the SRAM and other such memory cells is well known and as such, is outside the scope of the present invention, except to provide an exemplary implementation of a memory device incorporating a local interconnect structure in accordance with the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 7, an exemplary non-volatile reference cell <b>100</b> is illustrated for storing a reference voltage in a ferroelectric memory device. The memory device <b>100</b> comprises a ferroelectric capacitor C<b>1</b>, five MOS transistor circuit elements, and a local interconnect structure <b>101</b> for coupling the circuit elements directly to C<b>1</b>. C<b>1</b> comprises a ferroelectric capacitor stack having a top conductive plate <b>106</b> and a bottom conductive plate <b>107</b>, with a ferroelectric dielectric material disposed therebetween. Local interconnect structure <b>101</b> further comprises five single contacts (e.g., <b>101</b> <i>a</i>-<b>101</b> <i>e</i>) which are individually in contact with a respective MOS transistor circuit element and the bottom conductive plate <b>107</b> of C<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As with the examples of FIGS. 5A-5C, and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B, FIG. 7 illustrates a conductive plate of the FECap used as an interconnection structure (e.g., <b>101</b>) to directly couple between the five exemplary circuit elements (e.g., NMOS transistors <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>) of the memory device <b>100</b> in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The conductive plate of C<b>1</b> is further operable to conduct the circuit currents between the various circuit elements and to provide ferroelectric capacitor plate functions. Further, by eliminating the need for additional vias to a metal layer (e.g., the M<b>1</b> metal layer), the FECap surface area may be increased to accommodate the conduction paths ordinarily used by the metal layer to provide both interconnection and FECap plate functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Therefore, the reference cell <b>100</b>, according to an aspect of the invention provides a device, comprising an FECap based reference cell including an FECap coupled to a plate line and a reference node, a “blb” access transistor <b>112</b> coupled to a “blb” terminal, a “rfwlb” access input and the reference node <b>101</b> <i>e</i>, a drain coupling transistor <b>114</b> coupled to a supply voltage V<sub>DD</sub>, a “rfpc” access input and the reference node <b>101</b> <i>d</i>. The reference cell also comprises an “rfdc” access transistor <b>118</b> coupled to a source terminal V<sub>SS</sub>, an “rfdc” access input and the reference node <b>101</b> <i>b</i>, an “rfwl” access transistor <b>116</b> coupled to a “bl” terminal, an “rfwl” access input and the reference node <b>101</b> <i>a</i>. The reference cell further comprises a reference “ref” transistor <b>120</b> coupled to a “ref” input terminal, a “rfcol” access input and the reference node <b>101</b> <i>c </i>adapted to store and supply a reference voltage from the ferroelectric capacitor C<b>1</b> to the “bl” or “blb” outputs for various memory functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One aspect of the invention provides a method for forming a ferroelectric capacitor integrally with an interconnection structure of an FERAM memory device. The FERAM device comprises a plurality of circuit elements associated with the FERAM memory device and a plurality of contacts formed over the circuit elements and through openings in a first ILD layer overlying the plurality of circuit elements and coupled thereto, respectively. The method also includes forming a ferroelectric capacitor stack extending over the plurality of contacts formed over the plurality of circuit elements. The forming of the stack comprises forming a bottom electrode layer (e.g., a conductive plate), a ferroelectric dielectric layer, a top electrode layer (e.g., another conductive plate), and a hard mask over the first ILD layer and the plurality of contacts associated with the circuit elements, and patterning the hard mask layer extending over the capacitor stack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The FECap formation method further includes selectively etching the top electrode layer, the ferroelectric dielectric layer, and the bottom electrode layer using the hard mask to define the shape and size of the capacitor stack residing over the first ILD layer, where the stack extends between and to the plurality of contacts and provides local electrical coupling between the plurality of circuit elements of the device through the plurality of contacts that are in direct contact with the FECap and with respective circuit elements of the plurality of circuit elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The FECap thus formed, is operably adapted as the primary interconnection layer between multiple circuit elements to provide a local interconnect function with greater FECap surface area, yet with shorter total interconnection lengths, resistances and capacitance than some prior art devices. Further, the FECap memory device of the inventive method reduces interconnection crowding of the existing metal layers (e.g., the M<b>1</b> layer), providing reduced layout areas while requiring no additional device processing operations. These and other benefits will become more apparent as the following figures are described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An exemplary method of forming an FeRAM capacitor in accordance with the present invention which is similar in many respects to the capacitor C<sub>FE </sub>of FIGS. 5A-5C, will now be discussed in conjunction with FIG. 8, wherein a method <b>200</b> of forming an FeRAM capacitor with an integral interconnection structure is disclosed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the method <b>200</b> and other methods herein are illustrated and described below as a series of acts or events, it will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the illustrated ordering of such acts or events. For example, some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events apart from those illustrated and/or described herein, in accordance with the invention. In addition, not all illustrated steps may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention. Furthermore, the methods according to the present invention may be implemented in association with the formation and/or processing of structures illustrated and described herein as well as in association with other structures not illustrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The method <b>200</b> comprises forming a ferroelectric capacitor with an integral interconnection structure in an FERAM memory device. Initially, standard front end processing may proceed conventionally. Then, beginning at <b>202</b>, the method <b>200</b> comprises providing a plurality of circuit elements (e.g., E<b>1</b>-En, or the sources and drains <b>69</b> <i>b </i>and the gates <b>69</b> <i>c </i>of FIGS. 5A-C) associated with the ferroelectric memory device in a semiconductor material (e.g., substrate <b>69</b> <i>a </i>of FIG. <b>5</b>C). At <b>204</b> a first interlayer dielectric layer (e.g., ILD <b>69</b> <i>d </i>of FIG. 5C) is formed overlying the plurality of circuit elements and a plurality of contacts, for example, tungsten (W) contacts <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>n </i>of FIGS. 5A-C are formed therein over the circuit elements and coupled thereto, respectively, through openings in the first interlayer dielectric layer <b>69</b> <i>d. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Formation of the first interlayer dielectric layer <b>69</b> <i>d </i>and the contacts <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>n </i>may be formed by various means and any such process is contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention. Then the FeRAM capacitor(s) are formed over the interlayer dielectric <b>69</b> <i>d </i>and the contacts <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>n</i>, as illustrated in FIG. <b>5</b>C and described in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">At <b>206</b> a bottom electrode layer <b>67</b> of the FECap C<sub>FE </sub>is formed with a conductive material (e.g., iridium or Ir/IrO<sub>2 </sub>electrodes) extending over the first ILD layer, the plurality of contacts associated with the circuit elements, and the entire wafer. The bottom electrode layer <b>67</b> is further formed in contact with the plurality of contacts <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>n </i>that are formed in contact with respective circuit elements E<b>1</b>-En of the device. Thus, in one exemplary aspect of the invention, the bottom electrode layer <b>67</b> of the FECap C<sub>FE </sub>provides a local interconnection layer <b>61</b> between the FECap C<sub>FE </sub>and the plurality of circuit elements E<b>1</b>-En.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">At <b>208</b> a ferroelectric dielectric layer <b>68</b>, for example, a thin lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ferroelectric material layer is formed overlying the bottom plate <b>67</b> of the FECap and the entire wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">At <b>210</b> second conductive plate (e.g., a top electrode layer) <b>66</b> of the FECap C<sub>FE </sub>is formed with a conductive material (e.g., iridium or Ir/IrO<sub>2 </sub>electrodes) overlying the ferroelectric dielectric layer <b>68</b>, the bottom electrode layer <b>67</b>, and the entire wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">At <b>212</b> a hard mask (e.g., an oxynitride material layer, not shown) is formed over the top electrode layer <b>66</b>, the ferroelectric dielectric layer <b>68</b>, and the bottom electrode layer <b>67</b>. The hard mask is patterned to define one or more capacitor stacks and one stack has a dimension that overlies the plurality of contacts <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>n </i>that are formed in contact with respective circuit elements E<b>1</b>-En of the device. The method may then continue by selectively etching the top electrode layer, the ferroelectric dielectric layer, and the bottom electrode layer using the patterned hard mask to pattern or define the shape and size of a capacitor stack residing over the first ILD layer. Formed in this manner, the capacitor stack extends over the plurality of contacts <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>n</i>, providing direct local interconnection between the FECap and the plurality of circuit elements E<b>1</b>-En of the device, through the plurality of contacts <b>61</b> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>n </i>that are in direct contact with the FECap C<sub>FE </sub>and respective circuit elements of the plurality of circuit elements E<b>1</b>-En.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">At <b>250</b>, a second interlevel dielectric layer <b>69</b> <i>e </i>is formed over the defined capacitor stack of FECap C<sub>FE</sub>. A via <b>65</b> <i>a </i>may be formed by patterning, etching, and deposition of a conductive material through openings in the interlevel dielectric layer <b>69</b> <i>e </i>to contact the top electrode layer <b>66</b> of the FECap C<sub>FE</sub>. A metal layer (e.g., the M<b>1</b> layer) <b>63</b> is then formed over the via <b>65</b> <i>a </i>as a plate connection to the top electrode <b>66</b> of the FECap and as the traditional interconnection layer to other such FECaps or devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thereafter, method <b>200</b> ends and standard back end processing may continue as usual to complete the memory device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 9, illustrates a further aspect <b>300</b> of the method <b>200</b> of FIG. 8, while FIGS. 10A-10C illustrate a further aspect of the FECap and interconnection structures of FIGS. 5A-5C, wherein FIGS. 10A-10C of device <b>400</b> and <b>400</b>A are similar to that of FIGS. 5A-5C of device <b>60</b> and <b>60</b>A, and as such need not be fully described again for the sake of brevity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 9, a further aspect <b>300</b> of the method <b>200</b> of FIG. 8 is illustrated, wherein after the formation and definition of the capacitor stack of <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b>, and the formation of the second interlevel dielectric layer <b>69</b> <i>e </i>at <b>304</b>, two or more vias <b>65</b> <i>a</i>-<b>65</b> <i>n </i>may be patterned, etched, and formed at <b>308</b> for coupling two or more respective segments (e.g., <b>63</b> <i>a</i>-<b>63</b> <i>n </i>of FIG. 10A-10C) of a metal layer (e.g., the M<b>1</b> layer <b>63</b> of FIGS. 5A-C) providing an extra local interconnect layer using the top electrode layer <b>66</b>. The metal layer <b>63</b> or metal layer segments <b>63</b> <i>a</i>-<b>63</b> <i>n </i>are then formed over the vias <b>65</b> <i>a</i>-<b>65</b> <i>n </i>as a plate connection to the top electrode <b>66</b> of the FECap in accordance with the present invention. Thus, in much the same way that the bottom electrode of the FECap may be used as a local interconnect layer for circuit elements, the top electrode layer may be used as a local interconnect layer for various segments of a metal layer. Thereafter, method <b>300</b> ends and standard back end processing may continue as usual to complete the memory device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In one example of device <b>400</b>A of FIG. 10C, according to an aspect of the invention, the top electrode <b>66</b> of FECap C<sub>FE </sub>is used as a local interconnect layer to join to segments <b>63</b> <i>a </i>and <b>63</b> <i>b </i>of the M<b>1</b> metal layer, for example, to bypass around an unrelated M<b>1</b> metal layer segment <b>403</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the FECap bottom electrode has been illustrated and described with respect to use as a local interconnect layer for a plurality of circuit elements, and the top electrode for a local interconnect layer for a plurality of metal layer segments or a plurality of segments from a plurality of metal layers, either top or bottom electrodes are anticipated as possible local interconnection layers between multiple circuit elements, between multiple segments of one or more metal layers, or between combinations thereof, and as such are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention.</div>
