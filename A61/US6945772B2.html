<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a disposable lighter, and more particularly to a child resistant disposable lighter which comprises a shielding frame for shielding the striker wheel therein so as to prevent the disposable lighter from being ignited accidentally or by children.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of Related Arts</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Modern butane lighters have become very popular, especially the flint type disposable lighters, since the lighters are economy, cheap and easy operation. Due to the safety purpose, both the government and the consumers in United States demand a safety device employed in every lighter to prevent unwanted ignition accidentally or by a child. Most of the disposable lighters are employed with a safety lock that normally locks up a depression of the gas releasing button of the disposable lighter so as to prevent the disposable lighter from unwanted ignition. However, the structure of such safety lock is more complicated that highly increases the manufacturing cost of the disposable lighter. Furthermore, not all the countries require the lighter to employ with the safety device such that it is not economy for the manufacturer to make the lighters to fit both the markets whether the markets require the safety device or not.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,123,541, owned by Yang, generally suggests a safety windshield comprising a pair of safety shells integrally extended from two sides of a frame body to coaxially encircle two outer sides of two driving wheels respectively in such a manner that the safety shells form a physical barrier to prevent a thumb of a child from fully engaging with the driving wheels, as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. Moreover, the '541 patent requires a radius of each safety shells being slightly larger than that of the driving wheel. However, practically speaking, the child's fingers have a smaller size that when a little child use his or her finger of one hand, such as his or her left hand thumb, to press down the gas lever, the child is still free to independently press a litter finger tip of him or her another hand, such as the index finger of his or here right hand, into the safety shells' top front opening positioned close to the gas nozzle and able to deform his or her finger tip's muscle to reach the driving wheels and frictionally engage with the driving wheels, as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>B. Practically, since there is a particular room between the thumb and the index finger, once the child's finger can rotate the driving wheels for about a one-third to half the circumferential length thereof, the disposable lighter can be ignited. Which not only may cause unexpected accident but also may burn the child's finger because the position where the finger is pressed on the safety shells is closed to the gas nozzle where the flame released.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Moreover, the measurement of the safety shells must be precise during the manufacturing process. When the radius of each safety shell is too large, even an adult may fail to deform his or her thumb to frictionally engage with the driving wheels in order to ignite the disposable lighter. When the radius of each safety shell is too small such as smaller than that of the driving wheel, the safety shells fail to well encircle the driving wheels and lose their safety purpose as the safety windshield.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> to <b>4</b> of the drawings, a child resistant disposable lighter according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated, wherein the child resistant disposable lighter, such as a conventional disposable lighter, comprises a lighter body <b>10</b> having a gas reservoir <b>11</b>, and a supporting frame <b>20</b>, which is sealedly mounted on the lighter body <b>10</b>, comprising a first and a second supporting wall <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> parallely and longitudinally extended from two sides of the supporting frame <b>20</b>. The supporting frame <b>20</b> further has a vertical spring chamber <b>23</b> provided between the first and second supporting walls <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The child resistant disposable lighter further comprises a spring <b>24</b> being received in the spring chamber <b>23</b>, a gas lever <b>30</b> being pivotally mounted between the first and second supporting walls <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and having a front lifting end <b>31</b> and a depressible end <b>32</b>, and a gas nozzle <b>40</b> being upwardly extended from the gas reservoir <b>11</b> to a position above the supporting frame <b>20</b>. The gas nozzle <b>40</b> is engaged with the lifting end <b>31</b> of the gas lever <b>30</b> in such a manner that when the depressible end <b>32</b> of the gas lever <b>30</b> is pushed downwardly, the lifting end <b>31</b> of the gas lever <b>30</b> pivotally lifts up the gas nozzle <b>30</b> to release gas from the gas reservoir <b>11</b> through the gas nozzle <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">An ignition device <b>50</b> comprises a flint <b>51</b> having a bottom portion inserted into the spring chamber <b>24</b> and being supported by the spring <b>24</b>, a striker wheel <b>52</b> having a circumferential coarse striking surface positioned right above the flint <b>51</b> and being rotatably mounted between the first and second supporting walls <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, and two driving wheels <b>52</b>, each having a diameter larger than a diameter of the striker wheel <b>52</b>, coaxially and integrally attached at two sides of the striker wheel <b>52</b> respectively and arranged in such a manner that when the driving wheels <b>53</b> are rotated, the striker wheel <b>52</b> is driven to rotate and strike against the flint <b>51</b> to produce sparks towards the gas nozzle <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the child resistant disposable lighter further comprises a shielding frame <b>60</b> which comprises a U-shaped frame body <b>61</b> mounted on the supporting frame <b>20</b>. The frame body <b>61</b> has two sidewalls <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B positioned at two outer sides of the supporting walls <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> respectively. Two front ends of the two sidewalls <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B inwardly curved to meet and form a gas shelter <b>610</b> to surround the gas nozzle <b>40</b> and shelter the root of the flame released from the gas nozzle <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">A top edge of each sidewall of the frame body <b>61</b> bends inwardly to form a slanted top edge rim <b>611</b> extended from a front end rearwardly, upwardly and tangentially to a rear end thereof with respect to each of the driving wheels <b>53</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, front portions of the two slanted top edge rims <b>611</b>, for some disposable lighter, inwardly extend to form a shelter top <b>610</b>A having a flame opening <b>610</b>B thereon to cover and encircle a front portion and a bottom portion of the respective driving wheel <b>53</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Rear portions of the two slanted top edge rims <b>611</b> which continuously extend from the shelter top <b>610</b>A and two rear portions of the sidewalls <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B form two shielding guards <b>62</b> each of which encircles and covers a bottom portion and a top portion of the outer side of the respective driving wheel <b>53</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a rear portion of each of the two slanted top edge rims <b>611</b> is curved to have an arc-shaped to better encircle the top portion of the outer side the of respective driving wheel <b>531</b>. An ignition cavity <b>621</b> is defined between the two shielding guards <b>62</b> to rotatably receive the driving wheels <b>53</b> therein, wherein a center <b>620</b> of each of the shielding guards <b>62</b> is positioned eccentrically to a center <b>530</b> of the respective driving wheel <b>53</b> in such a manner that the centers <b>530</b> of the driving wheels <b>53</b> is preferred to be allocated behind and/or below the centers <b>620</b> of the shielding guards <b>62</b> so as to ensure the front portions and the top portions of the two driving wheels <b>53</b> are positioned below the two slanted top edge rims <b>611</b> to prevent a child's finger from contacting with the periphery edges of the driving wheels <b>53</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">According to the preferred embodiment, the slanted top edge rim <b>611</b> of each shielding guard <b>62</b> of each sidewall <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B of the frame body <b>61</b> is upwardly, rearwardly and inclinedly extended to form a predetermined slope tangentially to the respective sidewall <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B in such a manner that the two slanted top edge rims <b>611</b> of the frame body <b>61</b> function as a physical barrier to especially prevent a finger of a child from engaging with the front portions of the driving wheels <b>53</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">By means of the eccentric arrangement of the centers <b>530</b>, <b>620</b> of the driving wheels <b>53</b> and the shielding guards <b>62</b>, each of the shielding guards <b>62</b> can be made to have a radius equal to a radius of the respective driving wheel <b>53</b>. Thus, preferably, the center <b>530</b> of each driving wheel <b>53</b> is positioned behind the center <b>620</b> of the respective shielding guard <b>62</b> in such a manner that the shielding guards <b>62</b> substantially encircle and cover the front portions, the bottom portions and the top portions of the outer sides of the two driving wheels <b>53</b> while rear portions of the driving wheels <b>53</b> form manipulation portions <b>531</b> (i.e. about one-fourth or less than one-fourth of the circumferential length of the driving wheel) of the two driving wheels <b>53</b>, which are protruded from the rear side of the ignition cavity <b>621</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The reason of doing this is that, referencing to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, when the front and top portions of the driving wheels <b>53</b> are encircled by the shielding frame <b>60</b>, a child's finger tip is blocked by the slanted top edge rims <b>611</b> of the shielding frame <b>60</b> so that the child is unable to make finger contact with the front top portions of the two driving wheels <b>53</b> to rotate the driving wheels. However, since the manipulation portions <b>531</b> of the driving wheels <b>53</b> are adjacent to the gas lever <b>32</b>, there is no room for the child to use both hands to ignite the lighter as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, while the child's thumb does not have the power and strength to press down the gas lever <b>32</b> and strike such short manipulation portions <b>531</b> to provide sparks to ignite the lighter in such a short and tight operation space. However, while an adult's finger is able to drive the driving wheels <b>53</b> from their top portions to that manipulation portions <b>531</b> to produce sparks, the manipulation portions <b>531</b> substantially provide a better and solid contact of the adult's driving finger with the driving wheels <b>53</b> at the last second before pressing on the gas lever <b>32</b> so as to ensure the ignition operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">It is worth to mention that by means of the eccentric arrangement, even the driving wheels <b>53</b> are made slightly smaller than the size of the shielding guards <b>62</b>, the shielding frame <b>60</b> still functions well to prevent the children from finger contact with the front portion and the top portion of the driving wheels <b>53</b> to ensure the child safety while having less burden of size matching problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">According to the present invention, the slanted top edge rims are smooth surfaces provided above the top portion of the driving wheels <b>53</b> to block any unwanted rotation of the driving wheels <b>53</b> so as to prevent the disposable lighter from being accentually. Moreover, even though the children may try to ignite the child resistant disposable lighter by rotating the driving wheels <b>53</b> along a scrubbing surface such as the floor while pushing down the driving wheels <b>32</b>, the smooth slanted top edge rims <b>611</b> substantially shelter the driving wheels <b>53</b> from contact with the scrubbing surface, so as to prevent any rotational movement of the driving wheels <b>53</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">As mentioned above, preferably, the center <b>530</b> of each driving wheel <b>53</b> is positioned slightly below the center <b>620</b> of the respective shielding guard <b>62</b> so that top edges of the driving wheels <b>53</b> are ensured to be positioned below the rear portions of the smooth slanted top edge rims <b>611</b> of the shielding guards <b>62</b>, so that top portions of the outer sides of the driving wheels <b>53</b> are fully covered by the shielding guards <b>62</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">According to the embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a rear end of each of the shielding guards <b>62</b> is a vertical wall that enables a rear chord portion of each of the driving wheels <b>53</b> being exposed out of the ignition cavity <b>621</b> of the shielding frame <b>60</b> so as to define the manipulation portion <b>531</b> of each driving wheel <b>53</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">In order to ignite the child resistant disposable lighter, the adult's thumb must apply a sufficient pressure on the top portions of the shielding guards <b>62</b> to deform his or her thumb surface into the ignition cavity <b>621</b> so as to frictionally engage with the top portions of the driving wheels <b>53</b>. Then, a rotational force is applied on the driving wheels <b>53</b> rearwardly and downwardly to drive the striker wheel <b>52</b> to rotate, so as to strike against the flint <b>51</b> to produce sparks towards the gas nozzle <b>40</b>. At the same time, the depressible end <b>32</b> of the gas lever <b>30</b> is depressed downwardly to lift up the gas nozzle <b>40</b> for releasing gas which is ignited by the sparks. Since the manipulation portions <b>531</b> of the driving wheels <b>53</b> are exposed out of the ignition cavity <b>621</b>, the adult's thumb can easily engage with the driving wheels <b>53</b> to maintain continuous rotation of the striker wheel <b>52</b> while depressing the gas lever <b>32</b>. As stated above, the rotational distance of the manipulation portion <b>531</b> of the driving wheel <b>53</b> is limited for the child's finger to responsively rotate the driving wheels <b>53</b> and press down the gas lever <b>32</b> at the same time within such tight space right above the gas lever <b>32</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a first alternative mode of the shielding frame <b>60</b>′, which substantially has the same structure of the above preferred embodiment except, instead of the vertical walls, the rear ends of the shielding guards <b>62</b> are curved in semi-circular shape to form a pair of rear covers <b>63</b>′ to further encircle the rear portions of the outer sides of the driving wheels <b>53</b>′ respectively. In other words, each of the two shielding guard <b>62</b>′ forms a circular shelter that, when a radius of each of the shielding guards <b>62</b>′ is equal to or slightly smaller than the radius of the driving wheels <b>53</b>′, a small rear edges of the driving wheels <b>53</b>′ may still expose out of the shielding guards <b>62</b>′, i.e. to extend out of the ignition cavity <b>621</b>′, to define the manipulation portions <b>531</b>′ of the driving wheels <b>53</b>′ to function as recited above. Of course, when the radius of the shielding guards <b>62</b>′ is even slightly larger than that of the driving wheels <b>53</b>′, the entire outer sides of the driving wheels <b>53</b>′ will be completely covered by the shielding guards <b>62</b>′ of the shield frame <b>60</b>′ respectively while an adult is still capable of igniting the lighter without difficulty. In other words, each of the slanted top edge rims <b>611</b>′, which is smooth surfaces integrally extended from the front end of the frame body <b>61</b>′ upwardly, rearwardly and inclinedly to a rear end of the frame body <b>61</b>′, further comprises a rear section extended rearwardly, downwardly and curvedly in arc-shaped along the curvature of the rear portion of the respective driving wheel <b>53</b>′.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another alternative mode of the above preferred embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> to <b>4</b> and the first alternative mode of the preferred embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, wherein the shielding frame <b>60</b>″ is modified to have an rearwardly lengthened gas shelter <b>610</b>″. Comparing <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the front portions and two middle portions of the two slanted top edge rims <b>611</b>″ inwardly extend to form an enlarged shelter top <b>610</b>A″ having an additional top cover <b>64</b>″ that it not only shelters the gas nozzle <b>40</b>″ but also covers front and top portions of the top driving edges of driving wheels <b>53</b>″ as illustrated as the dotted lines in FIG. <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Therefore, the front portions and part of the top portions of the driving wheels <b>53</b>″ are covered by the top cover <b>64</b>″ so as to further ensure that the child's finger has no way to contact with the front portions of the driving wheels <b>53</b>″. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is appreciated that the top cover <b>64</b>″ can be incorporated with the rear cover <b>63</b>′ of the above first alternative in order to enhance the safety purpose of the shielding frame <b>60</b>″ to prevent the child's finger engaging with the driving wheels <b>53</b>″.</div>
