<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a lithographic printing plate precursor and a lithographic printing method using the same. Specifically, the invention relates to a lithographic printing plate precursor capable of direct plate-making by scanning with infrared laser beams on the basis of digital signals of, e.g., a computer, i.e., a so-called direct plate-making lithographic printing plate precursor, and also relates to a lithographic printing method of directly developing the lithographic printing plate precursor on a printing press and performing printing without going through development process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">A lithographic printing plate generally comprises a lipophilic image area that receives ink and a hydrophilic non-image area that receives a fountain solution in printing. Lithographic printing is a printing method of making difference in ink-adhering property on the surface of a lithographic printing plate with the lipophilic image area of the lithographic printing plate as the ink-receptive area and the hydrophilic non-image area as the fountain solution-receptive area (ink-repellent area) by making use of the natures of water and oil ink of repelling to each other, adhering ink only on the image area, and transferring the ink to the material to be printed, e.g., paper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">For manufacturing this lithographic printing plate, a lithographic printing plate precursor (a PS plate) comprising a hydrophilic support having provided thereon a lipophilic photosensitive resin layer (an image-recording layer) has so far been widely used. The lithographic printing plate is generally obtained by a plate-making method of exposing a lithographic printing plate precursor through an original image of a lith film and the like, and then, for leaving the image-recording layer of the image area behind, dissolving and removing the image-recording layer of the non-image area with an alkali developing solution or an organic solvent, to thereby bare a hydrophilic support surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In a conventional plate-making process of a lithographic printing plate precursor, a process of dissolving and removing a non-image area with a developing solution and the like corresponding to the image-recording layer after exposure is necessary, but the exclusion or simplification of such an additional wet process is one of the objects in the industry. Since the discard of waste solutions discharged with wet processes is a particularly great interest in the industry at large in recent years from the consideration of the global environment, the solution of the above problem is increasingly desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Concerning this requirement, as a simple plate-making method, a method that is called on-press development is proposed, which is a method of using an image-recording layer capable of being removed a non-image area of a lithographic printing plate precursor in an ordinary printing process, and removing a non-image area after exposure on a printing press to obtain a lithographic printing plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">As the specific examples of on-press development, e.g., a method of using a lithographic printing plate precursor having an image-recording layer soluble or dispersible with, e.g., a fountain solution, an ink solvent, or an emulsified product of a fountain solution and ink, a method of mechanically removing an image-recording layer by the contact with the rollers and the blanket of a press, and a method of mechanically removing an image-recording layer by the contact with the rollers and the blanket after weakening the cohesive strength of the image-recording layer or the adhesive strength of the image-recording layer and a support by the permeation of a fountain solution and an ink solvent are exemplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In the present invention, unless otherwise indicated, “development process” means a process of removing the area of an image-recording layer of a lithographic printing plate precursor not irradiated with an infrared laser by being brought into contact with a liquid (generally an alkali developing solution) to thereby bare the hydrophilic support surface with an apparatus other than a printing press (an automatic processor, in general), and “on-press development” means a method and a process of removing the area of an image-recording layer of a lithographic printing plate precursor not irradiated with an infrared laser by being brought into contact with a liquid (generally printing ink and/or a fountain solution) to thereby bare the hydrophilic support surface with a printing press.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">However, when a conventional image-recording layer of an image-recording system utilizing ultraviolet rays and visible rays is used, it is necessary to take methods requiring much labor, such that the exposed lithographic printing plate precursor must be stored under a completely light-shielding condition or a constant temperature condition until it is mounted on a printing press, since the image-recording layer is not fixed after exposure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">On the other hand, in recent years, digitized techniques of electronically processing, accumulating and outputting image data using a computer have prevailed, and various image output systems corresponding to these digitized techniques have been put to practical use. Under such circumstances, a computer-to-plate technique of directly making a printing plate is attracting public attention, which comprises scanning exposing a lithographic printing plate precursor with high convergent radiant rays such as laser beams carrying digitized image data without using a lith film, With such a tendency, it is an important technical subject to obtain a lithographic printing plate precursor well adapted to this purpose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Accordingly, in recent years, the simplification of plate-making operation, and the realization of dry system and non-processing system have been more and more strongly required from both aspects of the above-described global environmental protection and the adaptation for digitization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Since high output lasers such as semiconductor lasers and YAG lasers radiating infrared rays of the wavelength of from 760 to 1,200 nm are inexpensively available nowadays, methods of using these high output lasers as the image recording means are now promising as the manufacturing method of a lithographic printing plate by scanning exposure that is easy to be integrated in digitized techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In conventional plate-making methods, a photosensitive lithographic printing plate precursor is imagewise exposed by low to middle intensity of illumination, and image recording is performed by the imagewise changes of physical properties by photochemical reaction in the image-recording layer. While in the above method of using high output lasers, an exposure area is irradiated with a great quantity of light energy in an extremely short period of time to efficiently convert the light energy to heat energy, the heat energy is used to cause heat changes such as chemical changes, phase changes and morphological or structural changes in the image-recording layer, and these changes are utilized in image recording. Accordingly, image data are inputted by light energy, e.g., laser beams, but image recording is performed in the state including the reaction by heat energy in addition to light energy. A recording system making use of beat generation by such high power density exposure is generally called heat mode recording, and converting light energy to heat energy is called light/heat conversion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Great advantages of the plate-mating method using beat mode recording are that image-recording layers are photo-insensitive to the lights of ordinary levels of illuminance such as room illumination, and that the fixation of images recorded by high illuminance exposure is not necessary. That is, lithographic printing plate precursors for use in heat mode recording are free of sensitization by room illumination before exposure and the fixation of images is not essential after exposure. Accordingly, a printing system that an image is not influenced even if exposed to room light after exposure becomes possible by using, e.g., an image-recording layer which is solubilized or insolubilized by exposure with high output laser beams and performing plate-making process by on-press development to make an exposed image-recording layer to an imagewise lithographic printing plate. Therefore, it is expected that a lithographic printing plate precursor preferably used for on-press development will be possible to be obtained if heat mode recording is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">As one example concerning this mode, a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising a hydrophilic support having provided thereon an image-forming layer containing hydrophobic thermoplastic polymer particles dispersed in a hydrophilic binder is disclosed in patent literature 1 (Japanese Patent 2938397). The patent literature 1 discloses that it is possible to perform on-press development with a fountain solution and/or ink by subjecting the lithographic printing plate precursor to exposure with infrared laser beams to coalesce the hydrophobic thermoplastic polymer particles by beat to thereby form an image, and then mounting the lithographic printing plate precursor on the cylinder of a printing press.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">However, although a method of forming an image by coalescence of fine particles by mere heat fusion as above certainly shows good on-press developing properties, there are problems that image strength (the adhesion of an image-forming layer and a support) is extremely weak and press life is insufficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Further, lithographic printing plate precursors having an image-recording layer (a heat-sensitive layer) containing microcapsules encapsulating a polymerizable compound on a hydrophilic support are disclosed in patent literature 2 (JP-A-2001-277740 (The term “JP-A” as used herein refers to an “unexamined published Japanese patent application”.)) and patent literature 3 (JP-A-2001-277742).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Further, patent literature 4 (JP-A-2002-287334) discloses a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising a support having provided thereon an image-recording layer (a heat-sensitive layer) containing an infrared absorber, a radical polymerization initiator and a polymerizable compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">These methods of using a polymerization reaction are characterized in that relatively high image strength can be obtained, since chemical bonding density of an image area is high as compared with an image area formed by coalescence of polymer fine particles. However, from the practical point of view, any of on-press developing properties, fine line reproducibility and press life is insufficient and these systems have not been put to practical use yet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Further, a lithographic printing plate precursor capable of on-press development comprising a support having thereon an image-recording layer containing a polymerizable compound, a graft polymer having polyethylene oxide chains on the side chain or a block polymer having a polyethylene oxide block is disclosed in patent literature 5 (U.S. patent application publication 2003/0,064,318).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">However, according to this technique, good on-press developing properties can be obtained but fine line reproducibility and press life are still insufficient.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The mechanism of the function of a graft polymer having a hydrophilic graft chain is not clear, but it is presumed that the hydroplilic area is localized in the image recording layer by the presence of the graft polymer, and water permeability increases by the localized hydrophilic area in the unexposed area of the image recording layer, which results in the improvement of on press developing properties, and water permeability is inhibited in the exposed area of the image recording layer, since the neighborhood of the hydrophilic area is also hardened by polymerization, as a result an on-press development type lithographic printing plate precursor can be obtained. It is thought that by using a hydrophilic graft chain having a high glass transition temperature, mechanical strength of the part corresponding to the skeleton of the hydrophilic area can be improved in the invention, as a result fine line reproducibility and press life which have so far been insufficient can be brought into a sufficient level while maintaining good on-press developing properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In addition, the mechanism of the function of a graft polymer having a hydrophilic main chain and a graft chain of a hydrophobic segment is not clear, but it is presumed that the hydrophilic area and the hydrophobic area are localized in the image recording layer by the presence of the graft polymer, and water permeability increases by the localized hydrophilic area in the unexposed area of the image recording layer, which results in the improvement of on-press developing properties, and water permeability is inhibited in the exposed area of the image recording layer, since the neighborhood of the hydrophilic area is also hardened by polymerization, as a result a good image is formed. Further, since the graft chain overwhelmingly predominant in the graft polymer are hydrophobic, the image hardened by polymerization in the vicinity have a sufficient water resisting property and mechanical strength, as a result, presumably fine line reproducibility and press life are excellent differently from the case of using a graft polymer having polyethylene oxide chains and a hydrophobic main chain as in patent literature 5.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0004">[Image Recording Layer]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The above first embodiment is described in the first place.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0005">Graft Polymer Having a Graft Chain of Hydrophilic Segment:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">In the first embodiment, the graft polymer is a graft polymer comprising a hydrophobic trunk having a graft chain of a hydrophilic segment as branches, and the hydrophilic segment is a polymer containing at least one hydrophilic monomer unit selected from an amido group-containing monomer, an acid group-containing monomer, an alkali metal salt of an acid group-containing monomer, a quaternary ammonium salt-containing monomer, and a hydroxyl group-containing monomer in proportion of 50 mol % or more. The hydrophilic segment preferably contains 70 mol % or more of the hydrophilic monomer unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The hydrophilic segment may be a polymer copolymerized with a hydrophobic monomer besides the hydrophilic monomer to adjust the degree of hydrophilicity. In that case, the proportion of the hydrophobic monomer in the hydrophilic segment is preferably less than 50 mol %, more preferably less than 30 mol %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">By using graft polymers having such a hydrophilic segment, a lithographic printing plate precursor excellent in fine line reproducibility and press life while maintaining good on-press developing properties can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The synthesis of graft polymers is fundamentally classified to 1) a method of forming a branch monomer from a trunk polymer by polymerization, 2) a method of bonding a branch polymer to a trunk polymer, and 3) a method of copolymerizing a branch polymer to a trunk polymer (a macromer method).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The graft polymers for use in the invention can be synthesized by any of these three methods, but “3) a macromer method” is superior particularly for manufacturing aptitude and easiness of synthesis.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">As the pigments used in the present invention, commercially available pigments and the pigments described in <i>Color Index </i>(<i>C.I</i>.) <i>Binran </i>(<i>Color Index Bulletin</i>), <i>Shaishin Ganryo Binran </i>(<i>The Latest Pigment Handbook</i>), compiled by Nippon Ganryo Gijutsu Kyokai (1977), <i>Shaishin Ganryo Oyo Gijutsu </i>(<i>The Latest Pigment Applied Techniques</i>), CMC Publishing Co. Ltd. (1986), <i>Insatsu Ink Gijutsu </i>(<i>Printing Ink Techniques</i>), CMC Publishing Co. Ltd. (1984) can be used.</div>

Of these pigments, carbon black is preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">These pigments can be used without surface treatment or may be surface-treated. As the methods of surface treatments, a method of coating the surfaces of pigments with resins and waxes, a method of adhering surfactants, and a method of bonding reactive substances (e.g., silane coupling agents, epoxy compounds, or polyisocyanate) on the surfaces of pigments can be exemplified. These surface treatment methods are described in <i>Kinzoku Sekken no Seishitsu to Oyo </i>(<i>Natures and Applications of Metal Soaps</i>), Saiwai Shobo Co., Ltd., <i>Insatsu Ink Gijutsu </i>(<i>Printing Ink Techniques</i>), CMC Publishing Co., Ltd.

When the particle size of pigments is in this range, the stability of the pigment dispersion in an image-recording layer coating solution and uniformity of an image-recording layer can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">Well-know dispersing techniques used in the manufacture of inks and toners can be used as the dispersing methods of pigments.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">These infrared absorbers may be added to the same layer with other components, or a different layer may be provided and added thereto. However, it is preferred that infrared absorbers are added so that the absorbance of an image recording layer at the maximum absorption wavelength in the range of the wavelength of from 760 to 1,200 nm is from 0.3 to 1.2 by reflection measuring method when a negative lithographic printing plate precursor is prepared, more preferably from 0.4 to 1.1. When the addition amount of infrared absorbers is in this range, the polymerization reaction proceeds uniformly in the depth direction of the image-recording layer and good layer strength of the image area and the adhesion to the support can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">The absorbance of an image-recording layer can be adjusted by the amount of an infrared absorber added to the image-recording layer and the thickness of the image-recording layer. Absorbance can be measured by ordinary methods, e.g., a method of forming an image-recording layer having a thickness in a dry coating weight necessary as the lithographic printing plate on a reflective support, e.g., an aluminum support, and measuring the reflection density with an optical densitometer, and a method of measuring the absorbance by a reflection method with a spectrophotometer using an integrating sphere are exemplified.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">It is preferred for the image-recording layer of the invention to contain a polymerization initiator capable of generating radicals by heat or light, or both energies thereof, and initiating and accelerating the hardening reaction of the later-described polymerizable compound. Above all, thermal decomposing type radical generators that are decomposed by heat and generate radicals are useful. By using these radical generators in combination with the above infrared absorbers, the infrared absorbers generate heat when irradiated with infrared lasers to thereby generate radicals by the heat, so that heat mode recording becomes possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">As the radical generators, onium salts, triazine compounds having a trihalomethyl group, peroxides, azo-based polymerization initiators, azide compounds and quinone diazide are exemplified. Of these, onium salts are preferred for high sensitivity. Onium salts that can be preferably used as radical initiators are described below.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">It is also possible to form an image-recording layer in the invention by preparing a plurality of coating solutions by dispersing or dissolving the same or different components in the same or different solvents, and repeating the coating and drying a plurality of times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">Although the coating amount of an image-forming layer (solids content) on a support obtained after coating and drying varies according to uses, it is generally preferably from 0.3 to 3.0 g/m<sup>2</sup>. When the coating amount is in this range, good sensitivity and good film properties of an image-recording layer can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">Various coating methods can be used. For example, bar coating, rotary coating, spray coating, curtain coating, dip coating, air knife coating, blade coating, and roll coating can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0025">&lt;Support&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">Supports for use in the lithographic printing plate precursor of the invention are not particularly limited and any materials can be used so long as they are dimensionally stable and plate-like materials. For example, paper, paper laminated with plastics (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, etc.), metal plates (e.g., aluminum, zinc, copper, etc.), plastic films (e.g., cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose butyrate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose nitrate, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polyvinyl acetal, etc.), and paper and plastic films laminated or deposited with the above metals can be exemplified as the materials of the support. Preferred supports are a polyester film and an aluminum plate. Above all, aluminum plates, which are dimensionally stable and comparatively inexpensive, are preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">Aluminum plates are a pure aluminum plate, alloy plates containing aluminum as a main component and a trace amount of different elements, and aluminum or aluminum alloy thin films laminated with plastics. The examples of different elements contained in aluminum alloys include silicon, iron, manganese, copper, magnesium, chromium, zinc, bismuth, nickel, titanium, etc. The different element content in aluminum alloys is preferably 10 wt % or less. In the invention, a pure aluminum plate is preferred but 100% pure aluminum is difficult to produce from the refining technique, accordingly, an extremely small amount of different elements may be contained. Thus, the compositions of aluminum plates used in the invention are not specified, and conventionally well known and commonly used materials can be optionally used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">A support for use in the invention has a thickness of preferably from 0.1 to 0.6 mm, more preferably from 0.15 to 0.4 mm, and still more preferably from 0.2 to 0.3 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">Prior to the use of an aluminum plate, it is preferred to perform surface treatment, e.g., surface roughening treatment and anodizing treatment. By performing surface treatment, the improvement of hydrophilicity and the security of the adhesion of an image-recording layer and a support become easy. Prior to the surface roughening treatment of an aluminum plate, if necessary, degreasing treatment with a surfactant, an organic solvent or an alkaline aqueous solution is carried out to remove the rolling oil on the surface of an aluminum plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">Surface roughening treatment of the surface of an aluminum plate is performed by various methods, e.g., mechanical surface roughening treatment, electrochemical surface roughening treatment (surface roughening treatment of electrochemically dissolving the surface), and chemical surface roughening treatment (surface roughening treatment of chemically selectively dissolving the surface) are exemplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">As the method of mechanical surface roughening treatment, well-known methods, e.g., a ball rubbing method, a brush abrading method, a blast abrading method, or a buffing method, can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">As the method of electrochemical surface roughening treatment, a method of roughening an aluminum plate in an electrolyte containing an acid such as a hydrochloric acid or a nitric acid by alternating current or direct current can be used. Further, a method of using mixed acids can be used as disclosed in JP-A-54-63902.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0206">The aluminum plate subjected to surface roughening treatment is, if necessary, subjected to alkali etching treatment with an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide and neutralizing treatment and then, if necessary, to anodizing treatment to increase the abrasion resistance of the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0207">Various electrolytes can be used in the anodizing treatment of an aluminum plate for forming porous oxide film, and sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, oxalic acid, chromic acid and mixed acids of these acids are generally used. The concentrations of these electrolytes are arbitrarily determined according to the kinds of electrolytes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0208">Anodizing treatment conditions vary according to electrolytes used and cannot be specified unconditionally, but in general preferably the concentration of an electrolytic solution is from 1 to 80 wt %, the liquid temperature is from 5 to 70° C., the electric current density is from 5 to 60 A/dm<sup>2</sup>, the voltage is from 1 to 100 V, electrolytic time is from 10 seconds to 5 minutes. The amount of the anodic oxide film formed is preferably from 1.0 to 5.0 g/m<sup>2</sup>′ more preferably from 1.5 to 4.0 g/m<sup>2</sup>. In this range of the amount of the anodic oxide film, good press life and good scratch resistance of the non-image area of a lithographic printing plate can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0209">After anodizing treatment, if necessary, the surface of the aluminum plate is subjected to hydrophilization treatment. As the hydrophilization treatment, alkali metal silicate methods as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,714,066, 3,181,461, 3,280,734 and 3,902,734 are known. These are methods of immersing a support in an aqueous solution of sodium silicate, or electrolytically treating. Besides these methods, a method of treating a support with a potassium fluorozirconate as disclosed in JP-B-36-22063, and a method of treating a support with a polyvinyl phosphonic acid as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,276,868, 4,153,461 and 4,689,272 are exemplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0210">A support preferably has central line average surface roughness of from 0.10 to 1.2 μm. In this range of surface roughness, good adhesion of a support with an image-recording layer, good press life and good soiling resistance can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0211">As the color density of a support, from 0.15 to 0.65 in a reflection density value is preferred. In this range of color density, good image forming property due to prevention of halation at image exposure and good detecting property of the printing plate after development can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0026">&lt;Back Coat&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0212">After surface treatment of a support or after forming an undercoat layer, if necessary, a back coat can be provided on the back surface of the support.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0213">As the back coat, e.g., coating layers comprising organic polymer compounds as disclosed in JP-A-5-45885, and coating layers comprising metallic oxides obtained by hydrolysis and polycondensation of organic or inorganic metallic compounds as disclosed in JP-A-6-35174 are preferably used. Alkoxy compounds of silicon, e.g., Si(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Si(OC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Si(OC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>are preferably used for the inexpensiveness and easy availability of the materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0027">[Undercoat Layer]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0214">In a lithographic printing plate precursor for use in a lithographic printing method of the invention, if necessary, an undercoat layer can be provided between an image-recording layer and a support. Since the undercoat layer functions as a heat-insulating layer, the heat generated by infrared laser exposure does not diffuse to the support and is efficiently utilized, so that the improvement of sensitivity can be contrived. Further, the image-recording layer comes to be easily peeled off the support at unexposed area, so that on-press developing properties are improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0215">As the undercoat layer, specifically the silane coupling agent having an addition polymerizable ethylenic double bond reactive group disclosed in JP-A-10-282679, and phosphorus compounds having an ethylenic double bond reactive group are preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0216">The coating amount of an undercoat layer (solids content) is preferably from 0.1 to 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, more preferably from 3 to 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0028">[Protective Layer]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0217">In a lithographic printing plate precursor for use in a lithographic printing method of the invention, for preventing the generation of scratches on an image recording layer, for shielding oxygen, and for preventing ablation at the time of exposure with high intensity laser, if necessary, a protective layer may be provided on an image recording layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0218">Exposure is generally performed in the air in the present invention, and the protective layer prevents the mixture of low molecular weight compounds into the image recording layer, e.g., oxygen and basic substance in the air that hinder the image-forming reaction generated in the image recording layer by exposure, by which the hindrance of the image-forming reaction by exposure in the air can be prevented. Accordingly, the characteristics required of the protective layer are to be low in permeability of low molecular weight compounds such as oxygen, good in transmission of light used for exposure, excellent in adhesion with an image-recording layer, and capable of being removed easily by on-press development after exposure. Protective layers having such characteristics have so far been variously examined and they are disclosed in detail, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 3,458,311 and JP-A-55-49729.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0219">As the materials that are used for the protective layer, for example, water-soluble polymer compounds relatively excellent in crystallizability are exemplified. Specifically, water-soluble polymers, e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, acid celluloses, gelatin, gum arabic, and polyacrylic acid are exemplified. Above all, when polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is used as the main component, the best results can be given to the fundamental characteristics such as an oxygen-shielding property and the removal by development. Polyvinyl alcohols may be partially substituted with ester, ether or acetal, or may partially contain other copolymer components so long as they contain an unsubstituted vinyl alcohol unit for imparting an oxygen-shielding property and solubility in water that are necessary to the protective layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0220">As the specific examples of polyvinyl alcohols, those having a hydrolyzed rate of from 71 to 100 mol % and the degree of polymerization of from 300 to 2,400 are preferably exemplified. Specifically, PVA-105, PVA-110, PVA-117, PVA-117H, PVA-120, PVA-124, PVA-124H, PVA-CS, PVA-CST, PVA-HC, PVA-203, PVA-204, PVA-205, PVA-210, PVA-217, PVA-220, PVA-224, PVA-217BE, PVA-217E, PVA-220E, PVA-224E, PVA-405, PVA-420, PVA-613, and L-8 (manufactured by Kuraray Co., Ltd.) are exemplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0221">The components of the protective layer (the selection of PVA, the use of additives, etc.), and the coating amounts are suitably selected by considering fogging characteristic, an adhesion property and scratch resistance besides the oxygen shielding property and the removal by development. In general, the higher the hydrolyzing rate of PVA (that is, the higher the unsubstituted vinyl alcohol unit content in the protective layer), and the higher the layer thickness, the higher is the oxygen-shielding property, so that advantageous in the point of sensitivity. Moreover, for the prevention of the generation of unnecessary polymerization reaction during manufacture and storage, or the generation of unnecessary fog at image exposure and thickening of image lines, it is preferred that the oxygen-permeating property is not too high. Therefore, oxygen permeability A at 25° C. under 1 atm is preferably, 0.2≦A≦20 (ml/m<sup>2</sup>·day).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0222">As other components of the protective layer, glycerol, dipropylene glycol and the like can be added in several wt % equivalent to the water-soluble polymer compounds to provide flexibility, and further, anionic surfactants, e.g., sodium alkylsulfate and sodium alkylsulfonate; ampholytic surfactants, e.g., alkylaminocarboxylate and alkylamino-dicarboxylate; and nonionic surfactants, e.g., polyoxy-ethylene alkyl phenyl ether, can be added to the (co)polymers each in an amount of several wt %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0223">The layer thickness of the protective layer is preferably from 0.1 to 5 μm, particularly preferably from 0.2 to 2 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0224">The adhesion property of the protective layer with an image area and scratch resistance are also very important in treating a lithographic printing plate precursor. That is, when a protective layer that is hydrophilic by containing a water-soluble polymer compound is laminated on a lipophilic image-recording layer, layer peeling of the protective layer due to insufficient adhesion is liable to occur, and sometimes a defect such as film hardening failure attributing to polymerization hindrance by oxygen is caused at the peeled part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0225">Various countermeasures have been proposed for improving the adhesion of an image-recording layer and a protective layer. For example, it is disclosed in JP-A-49-70702 and unexamined published British Patent Application No. 1,303,578 that sufficient adhesion can be obtained by mixing from 20 to 60 wt % of an acryl-based emulsion or a water-insoluble vinyl pyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer with a hydrophilic polymer mainly comprising polyvinyl alcohol and laminating the resulting product on an image-recording layer. Any of these well-known techniques can be used in the present invention. The coating methods of a protective layer are disclosed in detail, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 3,458,311 and JP-A-55-49729.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0226">Further, other functions can be imparted to a protective layer. For example, by the addition of colorants excellent in transmission of infrared rays that are used in exposure and capable of efficiently absorbing lights of other wavelengths (e.g., water-soluble dyes), safelight aptitude can be improved without causing sensitivity reduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0029">[Exposure]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227">In a lithographic printing method of the invention, the above-described lithographic printing plate precursor is imagewise exposed with an infrared laser.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">The infrared lasers for use in the present invention are not particularly restricted, but solid state lasers and semiconductor lasers radiating infrared rays of the wavelengths of from 760 to 1,200 nm are preferably used. The output of infrared lasers is preferably 100 mW or higher. It is preferred to use a multi-beam laser device for expediting exposure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">The exposure time per a pixel is preferably not longer than 20 μsec. The quantity of irradiation energy is preferably from 10 to 300 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0030">[Printing Method]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">In a lithographic printing method of the invention, as described above, after being subjected to imagewise exposure with infrared laser beams, the lithographic printing plate precursor in the invention is used in lithographic printing by feeding oily ink and an aqueous component without undergoing any development process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0231">Specifically, a method of subjecting a lithographic printing plate precursor to infrared laser exposure, and then mounting the exposed printing plate precursor on a printing press without undergoing development process and perform printing, and a method of mounting a lithographic printing plate precursor on a printing press, and then exposing the printing plate precursor with infrared laser beams on the printing press, and perform printing without subjecting to development process are exemplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0232">When a lithographic printing plate precursor is imagewise exposed with infrared laser beams and printing is performed by feeding an aqueous component and oily ink without being subjected to development process such as wet development process, the image-recording layer hardened by exposure forms an oil ink-accepting area having a lipophilic surface at the exposed area of the image-recording layer, On the other hand, at the unexposed area, an unhardened image-recording layer is dissolved or dispersed with the supplied aqueous component and/or oil ink and removed, whereby a hydrophilic surface is bared at that area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0233">As a result, the aqueous component adheres to the bared hydrophilic surface, the oil ink adheres to the image recording layer in the exposed area, and printing is initiated. Here, the one supplied first to the printing plate may be oil ink or may be an aqueous component, but for preventing the aqueous component from becoming ditty by the image-recording layer at the unexposed area, it is preferred to feed oil ink in the first place. As the aqueous component and the oil ink, fountain solutions and oily inks for ordinary lithographic printing are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">In this manner, a lithographic printing plate precursor is subjected to on-press development on an offset printer and used in printing of a plenty of sheets.</div>

&lt;Exposure and Printing&gt;
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0252">Each of the obtained lithographic printing plate precursors was subjected to exposure with Trendsetter 3244VX (manufactured by Creo) loading a water-cooling type 40 W infrared semiconductor laser on the conditions of output of 9 W, external drum rotation speed of 210 rpm, and resolution of 2,400 dpi, so that a fine line chart was contained in the exposed image. The exposed printing plate precursor was mounted on SOR-M cylinder (manufactured by Heidelberg Japan K.K.) without performing development. A fountain solution (EU-3 (an etching solution manufactured by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.)/water/isopropyl alcohol=1/89/10 (by volume)) and TRANS-G (N) sumi ink (manufactured by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc.) were fed as the fountain solution and ink, and printing was performed at a printing speed of 6,000 sheets per hour.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0042">&lt;Evaluation&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0253">In general, in the case of a negative lithographic printing plate precursor, the degree of hardening of an image-recording layer (a photosensitive layer) is low when the exposure amount is small, and the degree of hardening is high when the exposure amount is large. When the degree of hardening of an image-recording layer is too low, the press life of the lithographic printing plate is low and the reproducibility of small dots and fine lines becomes failure. On the other hand, when the degree of hardening of an image-recording layer is high, the press life is high and the reproducibility of small dots and fine lines becomes good.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0254">In the invention, as shown below, the press life and fine line reproducibility of the obtained negative lithographic printing plate precursors 1 to 10 and 1′ were evaluated on the same exposure condition as described above and the results of evaluation were taken as the criteria of the sensitivity of each lithographic printing plate precursor. That is, the more the number of printed sheets in the press life, and the finer the fine line width in the fine line reproducibility, the higher is the sensitivity of the lithographic printing plate precursor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0043">(1) On-press Developing Properties</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0255">Printing was started in the same manner as above, after printing 100 sheets of paper, the number of the printed sheets required until the time when the printed sheet having no ink soiling on the non-image area was obtained was counted and this was taken as the number of sheets of on-press development. The fewer the number of sheets, the higher is the evaluation of on-press developing properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0044">(2) Fine Line Reproducibility</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0256">After 100 sheets of paper were printed as described above and it was confirmed that a printed sheet free from the soiling of ink on the non-image area was obtained, 500 sheets of paper were further printed. The fine line chart (a chart on which 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 200 μm fine lines were exposed) of the 600<sup>th </sup>printed sheet was observed with a loupe of 25 magnifications, and fine line reproducibility was evaluated from the fine width reproduced with the ink without cutting. The results obtained are shown in Table 3 below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0045">(3) Press Life</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0257">After performing printing of the evaluation of fine line reproducibility as above, printing was further continued. Since the image-recording layer gradually wore down and ink receptive property lowered as the number of printing increased, the density of ink on the printed sheets lowered. Press life was evaluated by the number of the printed sheets required until the time when the ink density (reflection density) lowered by 0.1 from the starting time of printing. The results obtained are shown in Table 3 below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0259">From the above results it can be seen that in Comparative Example 1 using C-1 having a graft chain of polyethylene oxide chains having a low glass transition temperature (Tg: −45° C.), fine line reproducibility and press life are insufficient, although on-press developing properties are good. On the other hand, the lithographic printing plate precursors in the invention using graft polymers of hydrophilic segments having high glass transition temperature are excellent not only in on-press developing properties but also in fine line reproducibility and press life. Accordingly, it can be said that the lithographic printing plate precursors in the invention are also excellent in sensitivity.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0279">Subsequently, electrochemical surface roughening treatment of the aluminum plate was performed in the same manner as in the above nitric acid electrolysis with an electrolyte containing a 0.5 wt % hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (containing 0.5 wt % of an aluminum ion) at a liquid temperature of 50° C. on the condition of 50 C/dm<sup>2 </sup>of the quantity of electricity in the case where the aluminum plate was the anode, and the plate was then subjected to spray washing. The plate was provided with 2.5 g/m<sup>2 </sup>of a direct current anodic oxide film with a 15 wt % sulfuric acid aqueous solution (containing 0.5 wt % of an aluminum ion) as the electrolyte and the electric current density of 15 A/dm<sup>2</sup>, washed with water, dried, and further subjected to treatment with a 2.5 wt % sodium silicate aqueous solution at 30° C. for 10 seconds. The central line average surface roughness (Ra) of the plate measured with a needle having a diameter of 2 μm was 0.51 μm.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0284">From the above results it can be seen that in Comparative Example 3 using (C′-1) having graft polymers of hydrophilic polyoxyethylene, fine line reproducibility and press life are insufficient, although on-press developing properties are good. On the other hand, the lithographic printing plate precursors in the invention are excellent not only in on-press developing properties but also in fine line reproducibility and press life. Since the lithographic printing plate precursors in the invention are excellent in fine line reproducibility and press life, it can be said that they are also excellent in sensitivity, as described above.</div>
