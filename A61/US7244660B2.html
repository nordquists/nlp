<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This invention relates, in general, to semiconductor components and, more particularly, to masking layers used in semiconductor components.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Semiconductor component manufacturers are constantly striving to increase the performance of their products, while decreasing their cost of manufacture. Because semiconductor components such as microprocessors and memory elements can contain millions of transistors or devices, one focus for increasing performance and lowering manufacturing cost has been to shrink the sizes of the transistors making up the semiconductor components. As those skilled in the art are aware, typical semiconductor manufacturing process flows involve a series of steps that include photolithography, etching and material deposition. However, as the semiconductor devices are made smaller, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to use optical lithography because of limitations in the resolution and etch capabilities of photoresist. These problems are further complicated by the poor selectivity of newer photoresists and their inability to withstand plasma etch processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have a semiconductor device and a method for decreasing the size of the semiconductor device using photolithography. It would be of further advantage for the structure and method to be cost and time efficient and compatible with semiconductor component manufacturing processes.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The present invention satisfies the foregoing need by providing a method for manufacturing the semiconductor component. In accordance with one embodiment, the present invention includes a method comprising providing a substrate and forming a first layer of dielectric material on the substrate. At least one dielectric post is formed from the first layer of dielectric material. A hard mask material is formed adjacent to the at least one dielectric post, wherein the hard mask material is different from the first layer of dielectric material. A portion of the at least one dielectric post is removed.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Generally, the present invention provides a semiconductor component having one or more posts suitable for use as etch stop and disposable masking features and a method for manufacturing the semiconductor component. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, one or more posts are formed from a layer of dielectric material. A material that is different from the layer of dielectric material is formed adjacent to and on the one or more posts. The material is planarized using the one or more posts as etch stop features. The posts are removed leaving openings or trenches in the layer of dielectric material. Because the posts can be removed, they are also referred to as sacrificial features or disposable masking features or structures. Electrically conductive material is formed in the trenches. The electrically conductive material can serve as an electrical contact, an electrical interconnect, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional side view of a semiconductor component <b>10</b> during manufacture in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. What is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a portion of a semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> from which a semiconductor device <b>14</b> has been fabricated. Semiconductor device <b>14</b> is electrically isolated from other regions of semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> by Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) structures <b>15</b>. Semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> has a major surface <b>16</b>. By way of example, semiconductor device <b>14</b> is an insulated gate field effect transistor that includes a gate structure <b>18</b>, a source region <b>20</b>, a source extension region <b>21</b>, a drain region <b>22</b>, and a drain extension region <b>23</b>. Gate structure <b>18</b> has sidewalls <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> and a top surface <b>28</b> and comprises a gate electrode <b>30</b> disposed on a gate dielectric <b>32</b> which is disposed on major surface <b>16</b>. Spacers <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are adjacent sidewalls <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, respectively. Source region <b>20</b> extends into a semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> from a portion of major surface <b>16</b> that is laterally adjacent spacer <b>36</b> and drain region <b>22</b> extends into semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> from a portion of major surface <b>16</b> that is laterally adjacent spacer <b>38</b>. Source extension region <b>21</b> extends into semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> from a portion of major surface <b>16</b> that is laterally adjacent sidewall <b>24</b> and drain extension region <b>23</b> extends into semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> from a portion of major surface <b>16</b> that is laterally adjacent sidewall <b>26</b>. Although not shown, semiconductor device <b>14</b> may have source and drain halo regions. The source and drain regions and the source and drain halo regions may be symmetric or asymmetric, i.e., there may be a source extension region but not a drain extension region or vice versa or there may be a source halo region but not a drain halo region or vice versa. A silicide layer <b>34</b> is formed from a portion of gate electrode <b>30</b>, a silicide layer <b>37</b> is formed from a portion of source region <b>20</b>, and a silicide layer <b>39</b> is formed from a portion of drain region <b>22</b>. Silicide layers <b>34</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>39</b> are also referred to as silicided regions. It should be understood that semiconductor device <b>14</b> is not limited to being an insulated gate field effect transistor but may be any active element such as, for example, a complementary insulated gate field effect transistor, a bipolar junction transistor, a junction field effect transistor, or the like, as well as any passive element such as, for example, a resistor, a capacitor, an inductor, or the like. Likewise, the material of semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> is not a limitation of the present invention. Substrate <b>12</b> can be silicon, Semiconductor-On-Insulator (SOI), Semiconductor-On-Sapphire (SOS), silicon germanium, germanium, an epitaxial layer of silicon formed on a silicon substrate, or the like. In addition, semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> may be comprised of compound semiconductor materials such as gallium-arsenide, indium-phosphide, or the like. Techniques for manufacturing semiconductor devices such as insulated gate field effect transistor <b>14</b> are known to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">A dielectric material <b>40</b> having a surface <b>42</b> and a thickness ranging from approximately 4,000 Angstroms (Å) to approximately 10,000 Å is formed on semiconductor substrate <b>12</b>, semiconductor device <b>14</b>, and STI isolation structures <b>15</b>. Suitable materials for dielectric layer <b>40</b> include high dielectric constant (high κ) inorganic dielectric materials such as, for example, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, or the like; organic high κ dielectric materials such as, for example, hydrogenated oxidized silicon carbon material or the like; organic low dielectric constant (low κ) dielectric materials such as, for example, polyimide, spin-on polymers, poly(arylene ether) (PAE), parylene, xerogel, fluorinated aromatic ether (FLARE), fluorinated polyimide (FPI), dense SiLK, porous SiLK (p-SiLK), polytetrafluoroethylene, benzocyclobutene (BCB) or the like; and inorganic low κ dielectric materials such as, for example, hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), methyl silsesquioxane (MSQ), fluorinated glass, NANOGLASS, or the like. It should be understood that the type of dielectric material for dielectric layer <b>40</b> is not a limitation of the present invention and that other organic and inorganic dielectric materials may be used. Similarly, the method for forming dielectric layer <b>40</b> is not a limitation of the present invention. For example, insulating layer <b>40</b> may be formed using spin-on coating, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD), or Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Dielectric layer <b>40</b> is planarized and a layer of photoresist <b>44</b> is formed thereon. Preferably, the photoresist of photoresist layer <b>44</b> is a negative tone photoresist. An advantage of using a negative tone photoresist is that it enables imaging of contact posts instead of contact holes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, layer of photoresist <b>44</b> is exposed to Ultraviolet (UV) light and developed. For a negative tone photoresist, those portions of the photoresist not exposed to the UV light dissolve in a developer and are removed during the development process. Thus, the exposure and development of photoresist layer <b>44</b> leaves portions <b>46</b> of photoresist layer <b>44</b> and openings <b>47</b> over dielectric layer <b>40</b>. Portions <b>46</b> and openings <b>47</b> cooperate to form an etch mask <b>48</b>. Portions <b>46</b> protect the regions of dielectric layer <b>40</b> on which they are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the exposed portions of dielectric layer <b>40</b> that are unprotected by portions <b>46</b> of etch mask <b>48</b> are preferably anisotropically etched using, for example, an anisotropic reactive ion etch. Alternatively, the exposed portions of dielectric layer <b>44</b> can be isotropically etched using a wet chemical etch. In accordance with one embodiment, the anisotropic reactive ion etch is a timed etch that forms trenches <b>49</b> that extend from approximately 500 Å to approximately 2,000 Å into dielectric layer <b>40</b> from surface <b>42</b>. In other words, the anisotropic etch forms a plurality of posts or pillars <b>50</b> from dielectric layer <b>40</b>, wherein trenches <b>49</b> are between or adjacent posts <b>50</b>. In accordance with one embodiment, a post <b>50</b>A of plurality of posts <b>50</b> is formed over gate structure <b>18</b>, a post <b>50</b>B of plurality of posts <b>50</b> is formed over source region <b>20</b>, and a post <b>50</b>C of plurality of posts <b>50</b> is formed over drain region <b>22</b>. The etch is terminated leaving portions of dielectric layer <b>40</b> over silicide layers <b>34</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>39</b> which provide electrical isolation between gate structure <b>18</b>, source region <b>20</b>, and drain region <b>22</b>. It should be understood that for the sake of clarity the letters A, B, and C have been appended to the reference character <b>50</b> to identify specific posts of the plurality of posts <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a layer of amorphous silicon <b>52</b> is formed on dielectric layer <b>40</b>, i.e., amorphous silicon layer <b>52</b> is formed on posts <b>50</b> and either fills or partially fills trenches <b>49</b>. Amorphous silicon layer <b>52</b> serves as a hard mask. Preferably, amorphous silicon layer <b>52</b> is thicker than the thickness of dielectric layer <b>40</b> that is removed in forming posts <b>50</b>. Even more preferably, amorphous silicon layer <b>52</b> is at least two times thicker than the thickness of the portion of dielectric layer <b>40</b> that is removed in forming posts <b>50</b>. By way of example, the thickness of the portion of amorphous silicon layer <b>52</b> over surface <b>42</b> ranges from approximately 1,000 Å to approximately 4,000 Å. It should be noted that the type of material of layer <b>52</b> is not limited to being amorphous silicon. The material for layer <b>52</b> is selected to have a different etch rate than the material of dielectric layer <b>40</b>. For example, if dielectric layer <b>40</b> is silicon dioxide, layer <b>52</b> may be silicon nitride. Other suitable materials for layer <b>52</b> include tungsten silicon, titanium nitride, or the like. When dielectric layer <b>40</b> is a low κ dielectric material, layer <b>52</b> may be silicon oxynitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, amorphous silicon layer <b>52</b> is planarized using, for example, a Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) technique having a high selectivity to dielectric layer <b>40</b>. Thus, the planarization stops on dielectric layer <b>40</b> and forms a planarized surface <b>54</b>. In particular, the planarization stops on posts <b>50</b> that are formed from dielectric layer <b>40</b>. After planarization, portions <b>56</b> of amorphous silicon layer <b>52</b> remain in trenches <b>49</b>. As those skilled in the art are aware, Chemical Mechanical Polishing is also referred to as Chemical Mechanical Planarization. Other suitable planarization techniques include electropolishing, electrochemical polishing, chemical polishing, and chemically enhanced planarization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, posts <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B, and <b>50</b>C are removed using a dry etch such as, for example, a reactive ion etch. Removal of posts <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B, and <b>50</b>C forms contact openings <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B, and <b>58</b>C that expose silicide layers <b>34</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>39</b> of gate electrode <b>18</b>, source region <b>20</b>, and drain region <b>22</b>, respectively. Contact opening <b>58</b>A has sidewalls <b>59</b>A and a floor <b>61</b>A, contact opening <b>58</b>B has sidewalls <b>59</b>B and a floor <b>61</b>B, and contact opening <b>58</b>C has sidewalls <b>59</b>C and a floor <b>61</b>C. In accordance with one embodiment, silicide layers <b>34</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>39</b> serve as floors <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B, and <b>61</b>C, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a layer of titanium nitride <b>60</b> having a thickness ranging from approximately 200 Å to approximately 350 Å is formed on amorphous silicon layer <b>56</b> and on sidewalls <b>59</b>A, <b>59</b>B, and <b>59</b>C of openings <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B, and <b>58</b>C, respectively. Titanium nitride layer <b>60</b> may be formed using Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD), sputtering, evaporation, or the like. Preferably, titanium nitride layer <b>60</b> is conformally deposited on amorphous silicon layer <b>56</b>, and on sidewalls <b>59</b>A, <b>59</b>B, and <b>59</b>C to form a barrier-lined opening. Titanium nitride layer <b>60</b> serves as a barrier layer to prevent diffusion from a subsequently deposited metal into dielectric layer <b>40</b>, amorphous silicon layer <b>56</b>, and semiconductor device <b>14</b>. In addition, titanium nitride layer <b>60</b> provides a low contact resistance to silicide layers <b>34</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>39</b>. Other suitable materials for barrier layer <b>60</b> include titanium (Ti), tantalum (Ta), tantalum nitride (TaN), a combination of tantalum (Ta) and tantalum nitride (TaN), where the tantalum nitride is sandwiched between the tantalum and the surfaces of openings <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B, and <b>58</b>C; tungsten (W), tungsten nitride (WN), titanium silicon nitride (TiSiN), and refractory metal compounds such as refractory metal nitrides, refractory metal carbides, or refractory metal borides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">A film or layer <b>62</b> of an electrically conductive material such as, for example, tungsten is formed on barrier layer <b>60</b> and preferably fills openings <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B, and <b>58</b>C, thereby forming a metal-filled barrier-lined opening. Alternatively, layer <b>62</b> may be copper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, tungsten layer <b>62</b> is planarized using, for example, a CMP technique having a high selectivity to dielectric layer <b>40</b> to form a planar surface <b>57</b>. Thus, the planarization removes amorphous silicon layer <b>56</b>. After planarization, portion <b>64</b> of barrier layer <b>60</b> and portion <b>66</b> of copper film <b>62</b> remain in opening <b>58</b>A to form a contact <b>67</b>, portion <b>68</b> of barrier layer <b>60</b> and portion <b>70</b> of copper film <b>62</b> remain in opening <b>58</b>B to form a contact <b>71</b>, and portion <b>72</b> of barrier layer <b>60</b> and portion <b>74</b> of copper film <b>62</b> remain in opening <b>58</b>C to form a contact <b>75</b> (openings <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B, and <b>58</b>C are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Other suitable planarization techniques include electropolishing, electrochemical polishing, chemical polishing, and chemically enhanced planarization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">By now it should be appreciated that a semiconductor component having posts or protrusions and a method for manufacturing the semiconductor component have been provided. Preferably, the posts are formed by patterning a negative tone photoresist on the dielectric material and removing portions of the dielectric material. However, masking materials such as positive tone photoresist and dielectric materials can also be used for forming the posts or masking structures. An advantage of using a negative tone photoresist is that it enables imaging of contact posts instead of holes. Thus, most of the photoresist is exposed to UV light leaving photoresist over those portions of the dielectric material from which the posts will be formed. This allows for a sharper photoresist pattern definition and the formation of semiconductor components having smaller feature sizes. Because of the sharper photoresist pattern definition, the cost of manufacturing semiconductor components is decreased. What is more, the method can be implemented in a multitude of processing flows including single and dual damascene processing techniques, i.e., trenches and vias can also be formed in accordance with the present invention.</div>
