<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a magnetic sensor-type, radio wave-receiving antenna suitable for radio-controlled timepieces receiving radio waves including time information for time adjustment, smart keyless entry systems for detecting the access of owners by radio waves to open keys of automobiles or a houses, etc. (hereinafter referred to as “keyless entry systems”), or RFID tag systems for giving and receiving information by modulation signals carried by radio waves (hereinafter referred to as “RFID systems”), etc.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">A radio-controlled timepiece receiving time information conveyed by a carrier wave having a predetermined frequency to adjust its own time based on that time information has been finding various applications such as clocks, wristwatches, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The radio waves used for the radio-controlled timepieces, etc. are 40-200 kHz, having as long wavelengths as several kilometers. Because antennas as long as more than several hundred meters are needed to efficiently receive these radio waves, it is practically difficult to use them in wristwatches, keyless entry systems, RFID systems, etc. Accordingly, magnetic cores having the same function as that of the antennas are generally used for receiving radio waves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Two radio waves of 40 kHz and 60 kHz are used as carrier waves for time information in Japan. Radio waves having frequencies of 100 kHz or less are mainly used overseas to provide time information. To receive radio waves of these frequencies, magnetic sensor-type antennas having coils wound around magnetic cores are mainly used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">A wristwatch is mainly constituted by a housing, a movement (driver module) and its peripheral parts (dial, motor, battery, etc.), a non-metal (glass) cover, and a rear metal cover. When an antenna is contained in a wristwatch, it is conventionally disposed outside the housing in many cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">However, the recent trend of reducing size and weight has required an antenna to be disposed in a housing. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows one example of wristwatches containing an antenna in a housing. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, it should be noted that a movement <b>92</b>, a rear cover <b>94</b>, and peripheral parts <b>96</b> such as a battery, a motor for moving a pointer, etc. are disposed in a housing <b>95</b>, and an antenna <b>1</b> is placed in a gap between the movement <b>92</b> and the rear cover <b>94</b>. Though the antenna <b>1</b> is shown by a solid line in the front view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the antenna <b>1</b> is contained in a closed space defined by the housing <b>95</b>, the movement <b>92</b>, the peripheral parts <b>96</b> and the rear cover <b>94</b>. Thus, the antenna <b>1</b> is not actually seen from front.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">When a radio wave coming from outside passes through a magnetic core, voltage is induced in a coil. As shown in the equivalent circuit of FIG. <b>22</b>, this voltage resonates at a desired frequency by a coil <b>8</b> and a capacitor C connected to the coil <b>8</b> in parallel. A Q-times voltage is generated in the coil <b>8</b> by resonance, to cause current to flow. This resonance current causes the coil <b>8</b> to generate a magnetic field, whose magnetic flux mainly flows in and out of both ends of the magnetic core. If there is a metal around the antenna, the magnetic flux generated by this resonance current penetrates the metal, generating eddy current. Thus, if there is a metal near the antenna, the energy of a magnetic field is lost as eddy current at the time of resonance, resulting in antenna coil loss and thus decrease in a Q value and antenna sensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">JP 2003-110341 A discloses a small antenna comprising a magnetic core constituted by an amorphous metal laminate, and a coil wound around it. JP 8-271659 A discloses a small antenna comprising a magnetic core made of ferrite and a coil wound around it. These small antennas are disposed mainly outside the housings of the wristwatches. From the aspect of not hindering the receiving of radio waves as described above, a wristwatch comprising the antenna described in JP 2003-110341 A or JP 8-271659 A preferably has a resin housing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">However, the resin housing poses restrictions in design and ornamentation. Generally, design is a selling point for wristwatches, and metal housings are preferred for high-quality impression and beautifulness. Accordingly, most high-quality timepieces have metal housings. However, if the small antenna described in JP 2003-110341 A or JP 8-271659 A is mounted in a wristwatch with a metal housing the metal housing acts as a radio wave shield, resulting in drastic reduction of receiving sensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">JP 2002-168978 A discloses an antenna comprising a conductive seal member between a metal housing and an antenna. The antenna of this reference is disposed outside the metal housing via a shield member to keep a Q value. However, because the seal member is indispensable, it suffers restrictions in size reduction and design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Japanese Patent 3,512,782 discloses an antenna comprising a magnetic main path member comprising a coil wound around a magnetic core, and a magnetic sub-path member comprising a magnetic core without a coil, an air gap being provided in part of a closed magnetic loop along the magnetic core, such that a magnetic flux generated inside at the time of resonance less leaks outside. Japanese Patent 3,512,782 describes that this antenna selectively guides a magnetic flux flowing outward at the time of resonance to the magnetic sub-path member, thereby making the magnetic flux less likely to leak outside to suppress the reduction of a Q value due to an eddy current loss.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Keyless entry systems and RFID systems also suffer the problem that a metal hinders an antenna from transmitting and receiving radio waves. The keyless entry system and the RFID system also contain a magnetic sensor-type antenna disposed in a metal housing or near metal parts. The keyless entry system capable of doing the remote control of an automobile key, etc. comprises a receiving unit having an antenna for doing a switching operation by a particular electromagnetic wave, and a unit for transmitting an electromagnetic wave. When a key holder, a transmitting unit, goes close to or away from the receiving unit, a door can be opened or closed without touching the key. The RFID (radio frequency identification) system gives and receives information stored in a tag through an antenna operated at a particular electromagnetic wave. For instance, when an RFID tag, to which destination information, etc. are input, is mounted to a bus, etc., and when an RFID tag, to which timetable information is input, is embedded in a display board, etc. at a bus stop, various transportation information can be seen. In these systems, too, the size reduction and sensitivity increase of an antenna are required.</div>
<heading>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a high-sensitivity magnetic sensor-type antenna disposed in a metal housing, which is free from an eddy current loss without needing large installation area and volume, and a radio-controlled timepiece, a keyless entry system and an RFID system, each of which comprises such magnetic sensor-type antenna.</div>
<heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">As a result of intense research in view of the above object, the inventors have found that a high-sensitivity magnetic sensor-type antenna with a suppressed eddy current loss can be obtained without needing a shield by (a) bending end portions of a magnetic core in the antenna in a direction away from a metal housing, (b) providing a magnetic core with a magnetic sub-path member having a smaller specific permeability than that of the magnetic core, or (c) disposing a magnetic core in a magnetic material case. The present invention has been completed based on such findings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Thus, the first magnetic sensor-type antenna of the present invention comprises a magnetic core and a coil wound around the magnetic core for receiving a radio wave, the antenna being disposed in a housing, and end portions of the magnetic core being bent in a direction away from the housing or a metal part of the housing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">The magnetic core preferably further has bent tip end portions. The magnetic core preferably has pluralities of branched end portions, at least one of which is bent in a direction away from the housing or a metal part of the housing. Also, at least one of the remaining end portions may be bent in a different direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">End portions of the magnetic core are preferably shaped along an inner wall of the housing. The end portions of the magnetic core are preferably inclined by about 20-50° to a portion having the coil. The tip end portions of the magnetic core are preferably bent such that they are in parallel with the portion having the coil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The second magnetic sensor-type antenna of the present invention for receiving a radio wave comprises a magnetic main path member comprising a magnetic core and a coil wound around the magnetic core, and a magnetic sub-path member attached to the magnetic core, the magnetic sub-path member having a smaller specific permeability than that of the magnetic core.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">In a preferred embodiment, there is a gap of 0.025-3 mm between one end of the magnetic sub-path member and the magnetic core. In another preferred embodiment, the ends of both magnetic sub-path members are positioned in a center portion of the magnetic core with a gap of 0.025-3 mm therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The magnetic sub-path member preferably has a specific permeability of 2 or more, lower than that of the magnetic main path member. A cross section area ratio of the magnetic sub-path member to the magnetic core is preferably /100-1/2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">A further example of the magnetic sensor-type antenna of the present invention comprises a magnetic main path member comprising a magnetic core and a coil wound around the magnetic core, and a magnetic sub-path member attached to the magnetic core; the magnetic sub-path member being constituted by a first magnetic sub-path member, and a second magnetic sub-path member sandwiched by the first magnetic sub-path member and the magnetic core without an air gap; and the second magnetic sub-path member having a smaller specific permeability than that of the first magnetic sub-path member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">In any magnetic sensor-type antenna, the magnetic core is preferably a bundle of plural metal wires, or a laminate of plural thin ribbons. When the magnetic core is a laminate of plural thin ribbons, the magnetic sub-path member is preferably disposed on a stratum-appearing surface of the magnetic main path member. More preferably, the magnetic sub-path member is a laminate of plural thin ribbons, and disposed such that its lamination direction is the same as that of the magnetic main path member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The third magnetic sensor-type antenna of the present invention for receiving a radio wave comprises a magnetic core, a coil wound around the magnetic core, and a case receiving the magnetic core and the coil, the case having a specific permeability of 2 or more, smaller than that of the magnetic core.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The magnetic core has a body portion disposed in the case and end portions exposed from the case. The case is preferably constituted by (a) a soft magnetic case portion for receiving a body portion of the magnetic core, and end portions extending from the soft magnetic case portion for receiving the end portions of the magnetic core, the end portions of the case having a smaller specific permeability than that of the soft magnetic case portion, or (b) a soft magnetic case portion for receiving a body portion of the magnetic core, and non-magnetic case portions extending from the soft magnetic case portion for receiving end portions of the magnetic core. In any case, the soft magnetic case portion preferably has a specific permeability of 2 or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In the magnetic sensor-type antenna comprising a case, the magnetic main path member is preferably fit in the case. The case is preferably injection-molded, or obtained by curing a curable slurry charged into a mold, in which the magnetic main path member comprising the magnetic core and the coil wound around the magnetic core is placed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">When the magnetic sensor-type antenna is disposed in a metal housing, the end portions of the magnetic core are preferably bent in a direction away from the metal housing. When the magnetic sensor-type antenna is disposed in a metal or non-metal housing together with other metal parts than the antenna, the end portions of the magnetic core are preferably bent in a direction away from the metal parts. The tip end portions of the magnetic core are preferably substantially in parallel with a bottom surface of the metal or non-metal housing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The radio-controlled timepiece of the present invention comprises any one of the magnetic sensor-type antennas of the present invention in a metal housing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The keyless entry system of the present invention comprises a transmitter and a receiver, at least one of the transmitter and the receiver containing any one of the magnetic sensor-type antennas of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The RFID system of the present invention comprises the antenna of the present invention in an RFID tag.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Because the end portions of the magnetic core in the antenna of the present invention are bent in a direction away from a housing, it is less influenced by the housing even when the housing is made of a metal. Accordingly, even when the antenna is disposed in a radio-controlled timepiece having a metal housing, high sensitivity and Q value can be obtained. In a preferred embodiment, branched tip end portions are spread substantially in parallel with a bottom surface of the housing, the magnetic flux coming from any directions can be captured, resulting in higher sensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The mounting of a member for forming a magnetic sub-path in addition to the main magnetic circuit provides the following effects: Because a magnetic flux flowing from a magnetic sub-path member also enters a main magnetic path, the amount of a magnetic flux passing through the main magnetic path increases, resulting in higher output voltage. When the case receiving the magnetic main path member constitutes the magnetic sub-path member, a brittle magnetic core can be protected from impact, resulting in high output voltage. The use of a case having such a shape as not to magnetically shut the end portions of the magnetic main path member provides the antenna with little loss.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The construction of a contact portion of the magnetic sub-path member and the magnetic main path member with a low-permeability material, through which a magnetic flux passes therebetween, reduces a plane-passing magnetic flux by fringing, thereby suppressing the generation of eddy current. The adjustment of inductance (magnetic circuit constants) by changing the cross section area of the low-permeability material and its contact area with the magnetic main path member, which can be done precisely, is much easier and better operable than when the adjustment is done by changing an air gap by the positional adjustment of the magnetic main path member and the magnetic sub-path member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">In a preferred embodiment, the magnetic main path member constituted by laminated thin metal ribbons is used, so that a magnetic flux flowing between the magnetic main path member and the magnetic sub-path member substantially passes the end surfaces of the thin metal ribbons of the magnetic main path member. In this case, there is preferably little eddy current generated in the ribbon surface of the magnetic main path member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Using the antenna of the present invention having the above characteristics, as high sensitivity and Q value as those of radio-controlled timepieces, in which antennas are disposed at positions evading metal housings or metal parts, can be obtained without needing increased installation areas in the radio-controlled timepieces. Accordingly, a radio-controlled timepiece comprising the antenna of the present invention is little restricted in design. In addition, because of little radiation of a magnetic flux by a resonance current, high effective sensitivity is obtained. Such antenna is suitable not only for radio-controlled timepieces, but also for keyless entry systems, RFID systems, etc.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">An antenna <b>10</b> <i>a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>a</i>) comprises a ferrite rod <b>14</b> <i>a</i>, and a coil <b>8</b> wound around the rod <b>14</b> <i>a </i>in its center portion. Both end portions <b>11</b> <i>a</i>, <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the rod <b>14</b> <i>a </i>are bent perpendicularly to its center portion. Though not particularly restricted, a wire of the coil <b>8</b> preferably has a circular cross section from the aspect of productivity. Though both end portions <b>11</b> <i>a</i>, <b>11</b> <i>a </i>are bent in the antenna <b>10</b> <i>a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>a</i>), the antenna of the present invention is not restricted to be bent in both end portions, but may be bent in only one end portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">An antenna <b>10</b> <i>b </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>b</i>) comprises a laminate of thin sheets <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, and a coil <b>8</b> wound around the laminate in its center portion. The thin sheet <b>14</b> <i>b </i>is a metal foil of 20 μm or less in thickness integrally punched out in a U shape, which is made of an amorphous metal, etc. The antenna <b>10</b> <i>b </i>comprising the laminate of the integrally punched-out thin sheets <b>14</b> <i>b </i>has excellent mechanical strength. Punching is advantageous because it can produce any shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">An insulating layer is preferably disposed between the thin sheets <b>14</b> <i>b</i>. The insulating layer lowers eddy current generated in each thin sheet <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, thereby suppressing loss. When the magnetic core is formed by a thin amorphous ribbon, etc., it is necessary to conduct a heat treatment at 350-450° C., preferably at 380-430° C., to improve magnetic properties. When the heat treatment temperature is lower than 350° C., sufficient magnetic properties cannot be obtained. The heat treatment at higher than 450° C. makes the thin ribbon too brittle, making it likely that the thin ribbon is broken when its end portions are bent, or when the housing drops. The heat treatment is carried out preferably in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen gas, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">An antenna <b>10</b> <i>c </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>c</i>) is the same as the antenna <b>10</b> <i>b </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>b</i>), except that it comprises a laminate of rectangular thin sheets <b>14</b> <i>c </i>having both end portions <b>11</b> <i>c</i>, <b>11</b> <i>c </i>bent in a U shape. The bent magnetic core is made stronger by sandwiching the end portions or bent portions of the magnetic core by a case, or by applying a silicone adhesive or a vanish resin, etc. to its end portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">An antenna <b>10</b> <i>d </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>d</i>) comprises a coil <b>8</b> wound around a center portion of a bundle of plural thin wires <b>14</b> <i>d</i>. Each thin wire <b>14</b> <i>d </i>is preferably coated with an insulating layer. The antenna <b>10</b> <i>e </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>e</i>) is substantially the same as the antenna <b>10</b> <i>c </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>c</i>), except for the bending angles of both end portions <b>11</b> <i>e</i>, <b>11</b> <i>e </i>of the thin sheets <b>14</b> <i>e</i>. The end portions <b>11</b> <i>e</i>, <b>11</b> <i>e </i>are inclined to the center portion at about 45°. When the bending angle of the end portions <b>11</b> <i>e</i>, <b>11</b> <i>e </i>is less than 90°, the bent portions have relatively large strength, making it possible to use thin sheets <b>14</b> <i>e </i>of such a brittle material as a heat-treated amorphous material, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">An antenna <b>30</b> <i>a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref> <i>a</i>) is the same as the antenna <b>10</b> <i>a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>a</i>), except that end portions <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, <b>31</b> <i>a </i>have outward bent tip end portions <b>32</b> <i>a</i>, <b>32</b> <i>a</i>. Accordingly, only differences will be explained below. The tip end portions <b>32</b> <i>a</i>, <b>32</b> <i>a </i>are in parallel with the center portion <b>34</b> <i>a </i>of the magnetic core. Because the outward bent tip end portions <b>32</b> <i>a</i>, <b>32</b> <i>a </i>can catch a magnetic flux coming in various angles, the antenna <b>30</b> <i>a </i>exhibits high sensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">An antenna <b>30</b> <i>b </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref> <i>b</i>) is substantially the same as the antenna <b>10</b> <i>b </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>b</i>), except for the shape of punched thin sheets. Accordingly, only differences will be explained below. Each thin sheet is integrally punched out in a shape comprising a linear center portion <b>34</b> <i>b</i>, end portions <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b </i>perpendicular to the center portion <b>34</b> <i>b</i>, and tip end portions <b>32</b> <i>b</i>, <b>32</b> <i>b </i>perpendicular to the end portions <b>31</b> <i>b</i>, <b>31</b> <i>b </i>and in parallel with the center portion <b>34</b> <i>b</i>. The antenna <b>30</b> <i>c </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref> <i>c</i>) is substantially the same as the antenna <b>10</b> <i>c </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>c</i>), except that end portions <b>31</b> <i>c</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c </i>have outward bent tip end portions <b>32</b> <i>c</i>, <b>32</b> <i>c</i>. The tip end portions <b>32</b> <i>c</i>, <b>32</b> <i>c </i>are bent substantially perpendicularly to the end portions <b>31</b> <i>c</i>, <b>31</b> <i>c</i>, and in parallel with the center portion <b>34</b> <i>c</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">An antenna having a magnetic sub-path member will be explained referring to the drawings. An antenna <b>20</b> <i>a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>a</i>) comprises a rod-shaped magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a </i>made of ferrite, a coil <b>8</b> wound around the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a</i>, and L-shaped, magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>attached to the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a</i>. The magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>are attached to the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a</i>, such that their longer portions are in parallel with the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a </i>with a gap G between their ends. The magnetic sub-path member <b>25</b> <i>a </i>need only be made of a magnetic material, preferably such as manganese ferrite, nickel ferrite, or cobalt-based amorphous alloys.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">The gap G is preferably 0.025-3 mm, more preferably 0.1-2 mm. When the gap G is less than 0.025 mm, the magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>have too small resistance to receive the incoming magnetic flux. When it exceeds 3 mm, the magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>have undesirably large resistance to keep current flowing. When there is one gap G like in this embodiment, it is particularly preferably 0.2-2 mm, practically about 1 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">In the antenna <b>20</b> <i>a </i>having the magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, part of the incoming magnetic flux flows into a main magnetic circuit (magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a</i>) via the magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, resulting in an effectively large amount of a magnetic flux passing through the coil <b>8</b>. Each magnetic sub-path member <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>preferably has a smaller cross section area than that of the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a</i>. A cross section area ratio of the magnetic sub-path member <b>25</b> <i>a </i>to the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a </i>is preferably 1/10000-2, more preferably 1/1000-1/2, particularly 1/100-1/5. With the cross section area ratio within this range, the magnetic sub-path members and the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a</i>, a main circuit, exhibit their functions clearly, resulting in a larger amount of a magnetic flux passing through the coil <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">When the antenna <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is placed in the metal housing, the end portions of the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a </i>and/or the end portions of the magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>should be directed away from the metal housing. When part of the housing is made of a metal, the end portions of the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a </i>and/or the end portions of the magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>are directed away from the metal part. For instance, when the antenna is installed in a radio-controlled wristwatch, it is preferably directed toward a glass cover. With the end portions of the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a </i>and/or the end portions of the magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>directed toward the incoming magnetic flux, a lot of magnetic flux can be gathered, thereby providing the antenna with high sensitivity. Because a magnetic flux generated by a resonance current generated by the coil <b>8</b> and a capacitor connected in parallel to the coil <b>8</b> flows mainly into and out of both end portions of the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a</i>, the orientation of the end portions of the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a </i>away from the metal housing reduces the amount of a magnetic flux passing through the metal housing. As a result, less eddy current is generated in the metal housing, resulting in a higher electric Q value and a higher sensitivity of the antenna.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">The Q value is defined as ωL/R, wherein ω represents the angular frequency of a radio wave, R represents the resistance of a resonance circuit constituted by the antenna <b>20</b> <i>a </i>and a capacitor, and L is the self-inductance of the coil <b>8</b>. R is a sum of the DC resistance and AC resistance of the coil <b>8</b>. When the antenna <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is disposed in the metal housing, the antenna <b>20</b> <i>a </i>has an increased AC resistance, because a resonance voltage as large as Q times the applied voltage is generated at both ends of the coil <b>8</b> due to the resonance occurring in the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a </i>by the coil <b>8</b> and the capacitor, thereby generating a magnetic flux near both ends of the antenna <b>20</b> <i>a</i>. When a magnetic flux generated by resonance passes through the metal housing, an eddy current loss occurs. The magnetic flux enters one end of the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a </i>and exits from the other end thereof via the coil <b>8</b>. In the antenna <b>20</b> <i>a </i>having the magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, however, part of the magnetic flux returns to the magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>and passes the coil <b>8</b> again. As a result, a substantially large voltage is generated. A magnetic flux generated by a resonance current returns to the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>a </i>via the magnetic sub-path members <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, so that the total amount of a magnetic flux radiated from both ends of the antenna <b>20</b> <i>a </i>can be reduced. When the antenna <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is placed in the metal housing, too, a smaller amount of a magnetic flux passes through the metal, thereby suppressing increase in AC resistance. Thus, increase in the resistance R is minimized, resulting in an increased Q value and thus a reduced loss by eddy current, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">An antenna <b>20</b> <i>b </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref> <i>b</i>) is the same as the antenna <b>10</b> <i>a </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>a</i>), except that a magnetic sub-path member <b>25</b> <i>b </i>is disposed inside a U-shaped magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>b</i>.

The magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>b </i>has a step in each bent portion, and the rod-shaped, magnetic sub-path member <b>25</b> <i>b </i>engages the steps. The steps function as the stopper of a winding, too. The magnetic sub-path member <b>25</b> <i>b </i>is preferably made of ferrite, etc. There are gaps G, G between both ends of the magnetic sub-path member <b>25</b> <i>b </i>and the end portions <b>21</b> <i>b</i>, <b>21</b> <i>b</i>.

Accordingly, there are magnetic gaps G, G between the magnetic sub-path member <b>25</b> <i>d </i>and the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>d</i>. The magnetic sub-path member <b>25</b> <i>d </i>is preferably formed by an amorphous foil of the same material as that of the magnetic core <b>24</b> <i>d</i>. Thus, the term “gap G” used herein includes, in addition to a physically vacant air gap, a magnetically isolated mass (magnetic gap G), which is physically filled, but does not permit or makes it extremely difficult for a magnetic flux to flow.</div>

Though most of the magnetic flux enters the magnetic core <b>74</b> from one end and flows toward the other end, part of the magnetic flux enters the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> and returns to the magnetic core <b>74</b>.

The magnetic core <b>4</b> <i>a </i>having the coil <b>8</b> <i>a </i>constitutes a magnetic main path member <b>5</b> <i>a</i>. The magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>a </i>constitutes a closed magnetic path with the magnetic main path member <b>5</b> <i>a</i>. The magnetic core <b>4</b> <i>a </i>is produced by laminating <b>30</b>-<b>40</b> thin ribbons via insulators. The thin ribbon is preferably made of a soft magnetic material having a permeability of about 100-300,000. Specific examples of the soft magnetic material include soft magnetic metals such as amorphous alloys, Fe—Si magnetic alloys, etc., silicon steel, Parmalloy, nanocrystalline metals of Fe—Cu—Nb—Si—B, ferrite, etc. The permeability of the magnetic core <b>4</b> <i>a </i>is more preferably 500-100,000.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">The coil <b>8</b> <i>a </i>is wound around a center portion of the magnetic core <b>4</b> <i>a </i>in about 800-1400 turns.

The specific permeability of the magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is less than that of the magnetic main path member <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, preferably 5-100. When the specific permeability of the magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is 100 or less, most of the magnetic flux generated by a resonance current passes through the magnetic main path member <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, so that the coil suffers less reduction of the Q value, resulting in high sensitivity. When the specific permeability is higher than 100, the magnetic flux passes more through the magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, resulting in lower voltage induced by the coil, and thus likelihood of reduced sensitivity. When the specific permeability is less than 5, the magnetic flux scarcely circulates the magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, so that the magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>a </i>fails to fully exhibit its own function. The flowability of the magnetic flux depends on the permeability and cross section area of the magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>a </i>and, and its area opposing the magnetic main path member <b>5</b> <i>a</i>. The adjustment of the permeability and cross section area of the magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>a </i>and its area opposing the magnetic main path member <b>5</b> <i>a </i>is much easier than the adjustment of an air gap provided in the magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, thereby making the working extremely easier.</div>

For instance, when the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> is arranged in parallel with the thin ribbons of the magnetic core <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a magnetic flux flows in a direction penetrating the sheets of the magnetic core <b>4</b>. Accordingly, large eddy current <b>9</b> is generated in the magnetic core <b>4</b>, resulting in a large loss and a reduced Q value. In the arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, however, the magnetic flux <b>8</b> passes through the magnetic core <b>4</b> perpendicularly to its laminate direction and enters the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b>. In this case, no magnetic flux needs to enter the thin ribbons constituting the magnetic core <b>4</b> perpendicularly to their surfaces, resulting in less generation of eddy current and loss. Of course, the lamination direction of the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> is also preferably set such that the magnetic flux <b>8</b> does not pass through the laminated thin ribbons of the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b>.</div>

The second magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>b </i>has lower permeability than that of the first magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> <i>b</i>. When the permeability of the second magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> <i>b </i>is lower than that of the first magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> <i>b</i>, a large amount of a magnetic flux returns to the magnetic main path member <b>5</b> <i>b </i>even when the first magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> <i>b </i>has relatively high permeability, resulting in a small eddy current loss.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">Though not particularly restricted, the first and second magnetic sub-path members <b>7</b> <i>b</i>, <b>3</b> <i>b </i>may preferably have such a structure as comprising an electromagnetic wave-reflecting layer having conductive fibers dispersed in a flexible polymer, first electromagnetic wave-absorbing layers having flat magnetic metal powder dispersed in a flexible polymer, and second electromagnetic wave-absorbing layers having granular magnetic metal powder dispersed in a flexible polymer, the first and second electromagnetic wave-absorbing layers being thermally press-bonded in this order to both surfaces of the electromagnetic wave-reflecting layer. Alternatively, they may comprise either one of the first and second electromagnetic wave-absorbing layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">The electromagnetic wave-reflecting layer is preferably, for instance, a sheet formed by dispersing carbon fibers or metal fibers in a flexible polymer. The magnetic metal powder is preferably flat powder obtained by disintegrating granular powder produced by a water atomization method from nanocrystalline magnetic alloys such as Fe—Cu—Nb—Si—B, etc. The flat powder preferably has an average particle size of 0.1-50 μm and an average thickness of about 1-5 μm. To provide a preferred electromagnetic wave-absorbing layer, this flat powder is preferably dispersed in a flexible polymer and formed into a sheet. Flat magnetic metal powders of carbonyl iron alloys, amorphous alloys, Fe—Si alloys, molybdenum Parmalloy, Supermalloy, etc. may also be used for the electromagnetic wave-absorbing layer. The flexible polymer is preferably soft and has a specific gravity of 1.5 or less and weathering resistance.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">The use of such a soft composite provides a magnetic gap despite no physical gap.

The case <b>7</b> <i>a </i>also prevents a magnetic flux from leaking outside from the magnetic core <b>4</b>. A cross section area ratio of the case <b>7</b> <i>a </i>to the magnetic core <b>4</b> is preferably 1/1000-1/2, more preferably 1/100-1/5.</div>

When the specific permeability is more than 100, it is difficult to concentrate a magnetic flux in the magnetic main path member. When the case <b>7</b> <i>a </i>is made by a composite, a proper specific permeability can be achieved by controlling a ratio of soft magnetic powder to a resin, etc., and the thickness of the case <b>7</b> <i>a </i>can be easily changed. The composite is also easily worked because of softness. If the magnetic sub-path member is difficult to assemble, the case <b>7</b> <i>a </i>(magnetic sub-path member) may be formed by applying a viscous paint containing soft magnetic powder such as soft magnetic ferrite powder, etc. to the magnetic main path member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">Though it is unexpectedly difficult to attach the magnetic sub-path member to a small, brittle antenna in a practical assembling, the use of a case made of a soft magnetic material can easily exhibit a function as a magnetic sub-path member only by its contact with the end portions of the magnetic core <b>4</b>. Accordingly, a high-sensitivity antenna can be obtained without needing the positioning of the magnetic main path member and the magnetic sub-path member. Thus, the use of the case per se as a magnetic sub-path member makes it easy to assemble the magnetic main path member and the magnetic sub-path member with reduced numbers of parts, and makes it possible to install the antenna in a housing without needing another case.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">The case <b>7</b> absorbs impact from outside to protect the magnetic core <b>4</b>, and functions as a magnetic sub-path to make it unnecessary to have a magnetic sub-path member separately, thereby needing only a limited space.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">The antenna <b>1</b> is arranged such that the end portions of the magnetic core <b>4</b> extend from the bottom surface toward the glass cover <b>93</b>. Accordingly, the end portions or tip end portions of the magnetic core are in alignment with the direction of the incoming radio wave. As long as they are directed to easily receive radio waves, the direction of the end portions and their angles to the bottom surface are not restrictive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">Because indispensable movement and dial occupy most of the timepiece in volume, the antenna <b>1</b> has to be disposed near the rear cover <b>94</b>, thereby being surrounded by metal parts. However, because the end portions of the magnetic core are directed not toward the housing <b>95</b> but toward non-metal parts (glass cover <b>93</b>, etc.), the antenna <b>1</b> easily receives radio waves from outside. Namely, with the end portions of the magnetic core, which are most important to receive electromagnetic waves, directed toward non-metal parts such as a glass cover <b>93</b>, etc., the radio wave-shielding effect of the metal housing <b>95</b> can be minimized. When part of the housing <b>95</b> is made of a non-metal material, the end portions of the magnetic core may be directed toward the non-metal part of the housing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">When the housing <b>95</b> is made of a metal, the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> is preferably away from the housing <b>95</b> to reduce the generation of eddy current. However, there are generally so many restrictions in space in the housing <b>95</b> that the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> cannot necessarily be arranged away from the housing <b>95</b>. In addition, if the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> for adjusting sensitivity were directed inward the housing <b>95</b>, its adjustment would be difficult. When the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> made of a soft composite is arranged along the inner periphery of the housing <b>95</b>, the adjustment of thickness and area of the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> is easy, with space in the housing <b>95</b> effectively used. Thus, despite the disadvantage of eddy current, overwhelming advantages can be obtained. Of course, when there is no restriction in space, etc., the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> may be arranged separate from the housing <b>95</b>. When the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> is separate from the metal housing <b>95</b>, the incoming radio wave is easily focused in the magnetic core of the magnetic main path member, but less focused in the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">Examples 7-10 exhibited higher output voltage and Q value than Comparative Example 1, confirming the effect of having a magnetic sub-path member with a magnetic gap G. However, the output voltage and the Q value were lower in Example 10 having a gap G of 4.0 mm than in Example 9 having a gap G of 3.0 mm. Also, when the gap G is less than 1.0 mm, the output voltage tends to decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">In Examples 11-16, the gap G for providing a well-balanced combination of output voltage and a Q value was 0.5 mm. Though a smaller gap G tends to lower output voltage, a higher output voltage was obtained even in Example 12 having a gap G of 0.025 mm than in Comparative Example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">Output voltage measurement was not conducted in Reference Example 2, which resembles the structure of JP 2002-168978 A with a conductive shield member, because its output voltage appeared to be incommensurably lower than those of Examples 7-16. When the gap G is 0 mm, it is considered that a magnetic flux is not well captured, resulting in drastic decrease in output voltage. Why a high Q value was obtained at a gap G of 8.0 mm appears to be due to the fact that the influence of the copper sheet disappeared.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">As described above, the magnetic sub-path member with a magnetic gap could retain part of the magnetic flux flowing into the magnetic core, resulting in high Q value and output voltage. The preferred size of the gap G is between about 0.025 mm and about 3 mm, despite some difference by the antenna structure. Because the antenna with a magnetic sub-path member radiates only a small amount of magnetic flux by a resonance current, advantageous results were obtained even when the antennas of Examples 7-10 and 12-16 were disposed in a metal housing.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">It was confirmed that the provision of the magnetic sub-path member contributed to improving the Q value and sensitivity. The Q value and sensitivity depended on the thickness of the soft composite. Accordingly, to obtain the maximum effect of the magnetic sub-path member, the first and/or second magnetic sub-path member should be in a preferred thickness range. The thickness t providing high Q value and sensitivity was, for instance, 0.5-1.0 mm in Examples 17-22, and 1.0-2.0 mm in Examples 23-27.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">It is considered that even when the magnetic main path member and the first magnetic sub-path member are laminates or made of different materials from above, high Q value and sensitivity can be easily obtained by changing the thickness of the second magnetic sub-path member. The same adjustment can be done by a contact area, too. Thus, the adjustment of a Q value and sensitivity by the thickness of the magnetic sub-path member or by the contact area with the magnetic core is much easier than the micron-level adjustment of a gap, which is necessary for an air gap.</div>
<heading>Example 28</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0164">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a magnetic path member <b>7</b> and a pair of magnetic sub-path members <b>3</b> were attached to a printed circuit board <b>200</b> in this order, and end portions of a magnetic core were bonded to the magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> to produce a key body. The end portions of the magnetic core were directed away from the printed circuit board. Incidentally, the magnetic core was made of Mn—Zn ferrite (MT80D available from Hitachi Metals, Ltd.), the magnetic sub-path member <b>3</b> was formed by Absorshield® K-E050 available from Hitachi Metals, Ltd., and the magnetic sub-path member <b>7</b> was formed by Absorshield® K-E025 available from Hitachi Metals, Ltd.

An iron sheet <b>201</b> was attached to an entire rear surface of the printed circuit board on an opposite side of an antenna-installing surface. The measurement of sensitivity (output voltage) was conducted in a magnetic field of 45 nT at a frequency of 125 KHz. The measured output voltage and Q value are shown in Table 7.
