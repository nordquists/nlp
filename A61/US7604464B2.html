<div class="abstract" num="p-0001">A reciprocating downhole pump has a gas separator located at its bottom end. The separator forms a chamber that is expanded and contracted when the pump is reciprocated. Expansion and contraction of the chamber occurs by either the plunger reciprocating in the chamber or a piston coupled to the plunger reciprocating in the chamber. The chamber has an orifice therein so that during reciprocation fluid flows in and out of the orifice. The orifice is sized so as to subject the fluid to a pressure drop, wherein gas in the fluid is separated from the liquid.</div>

<heading>SPECIFICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional patent application of application Ser. No. 10/447,050, filed May 28, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,945,762, which application claimed the benefit of application Ser. No. 60/383,537, filed May 28, 2002.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to subsurface, or downhole, pumps, such as are used to pump oil and other fluids and bases from wells.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">When an oil well is first drilled and completed, the fluids (such as crude oil) may be under natural pressure that is sufficient to produce on its own. In other words, the oil rises to the surface without any assistance. In many oil wells, and particularly those in fields that are established and aging, natural pressure has declined to the point where the oil must be artificially lifted to the surface. Subsurface pumps are located in the well below the level of the oil. A string of sucker rods extends from the pump up to the surface to a pump jack device, beam pump unit or other devices. A prime mover, such as a gasoline or diesel engine, an electric motor or a gas engine, on the surface causes the pump jack to rock back and forth, thereby moving the string of sucker rods up and down inside of the well tubing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The string of sucker rods operates the subsurface pump. A typical pump has a plunger that is reciprocated inside of a barrel by the sucker rods. The barrel has a standing one-way valve, while the plunger has a traveling one-way valve, or in some pumps the plunger has a standing one-way valve, while the barrel has a traveling one-way valve. Reciprocation charges a chamber between the valves with fluid and then lifts the fluid up the tubing towards the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">One problem encountered in downhole pumps is that the chamber between the valves fails to fill completely with liquid. Instead, the chamber contains undissolved gas, air, or vacuum, which are collectively referred to herein as gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Such failure to completely fill the chamber is attributed to various causes. In a gas lock situation or a gas interference situation, the formation produces gas in addition to liquid. The gas is at the top of the chamber, while the liquid is at the bottom, creating a liquid-to-gas interface. If this interface is relatively high in the chamber, gas interference results. In gas interference, the plunger (on the downstroke) descends in the chamber and hits the liquid-to-gas interface. The change in resistances causes a mechanical shock or jarring. Such a shock damages the pump, the sucker rods and the tubing. In addition, a loss of pumping efficiency results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">If the liquid-to-gas interface is relatively low in the chamber, a gas lock results, wherein insufficient pressure is built up inside of the chamber on the downstroke to open the plunger valve. The plunger is thus not charged with fluid and the pump is unable to lift anything. A gas locked pump, and its associated sucker rods and tubing, may experience damage from the plunger hitting the interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">I am a co-inventor of U.S. Pat. No. 6,273,690, which addresses the problem of gas in the compression chamber by allowing the gas to bleed off from the chamber. The pump has worked very well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In some instances, however, the gas remains in solution with the liquid in the compression chamber. Thus, any attempts to bleed off the gas are frustrated by the lack of separation between the gas and liquid. Consequently, the gas either interferes with, or else if present in sufficient quantities, locks the pump.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In the prior art, there are several types of gas separators used in conjunction with sucker rod downhole pumps. One type of prior art separator uses a dip tube located at the bottom of the pump. Surrounding the dip tube is a mud anchor, with a bull plug at the bottom. The mud anchor forms a chamber around the dip tube. The mud anchor has perforations, wherein the fluid enters the chamber through the perforations and travels down where it then enters the dip tube. The distance between the mud anchor perforations and the entry to the dip tube is referred to as the quiet zone, which is typically 1.5-2 times the pump volume. The fluid temporarily resides in the quiet zone on the pump downstroke, allowing gas to bubble out and escape through the mud anchor perforations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Another type of prior art separator utilizes a stationary rotor. Fluid is forced into the angled rotor vanes to rotate the fluid, wherein gas is separated from the fluid. The reciprocating action of the pump moves the fluid through the rotor.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">It is an object of the present invention to provide a downhole pump that minimizes the effects of gas on the operation of the pump.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">It is further object of the present invention to provide a downhole pump that separates gas from liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The present invention provides a downhole pump that comprises a barrel and a plunger located inside of the barrel, with one of the plunger and the barrel reciprocating with respect to the other. There is a first one-way valve located in the plunger and a second one-way valve located in the barrel. A first compression chamber is located between the first and second one-way valves.

The separator comprises a first extension tube having upper and lower ends with the upper end structured and arranged to be coupled to a lower end of the pump barrel. The first extension tube is closed at the lower end. The first extension tube forms a chamber and has an orifice for allowing communication between the chamber and the exterior of the extension tube. There is a second extension tube having upper and lower ends with the upper end being structured and arranged to be coupled to a lower end of the plunger. The second extension tube has a piston coupled thereto and is located for reciprocation in the chamber. The second extension tube has an intake opening that is located outside of the chamber.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The downhole pump of the present invention incorporates a mechanically actuated gas separator which serves to separate the downhole fluids into liquid and gas phases. The downhole fluids may include crude oil, water, natural gas, etc. The separated gas is vented away from the pump while the liquid enters the pump for lifting to the surface. The gas separator utilizes the reciprocating action of the pump itself to provide the work necessary for the separation. Separation is achieved by causing the fluid to flow through an orifice such that the fluid is subjected to a pressure drop. The reciprocating action of the pump serves to move the fluid through the orifice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a schematic diagram of a producing oil well <b>11</b>. The well has a borehole that extends from the surface <b>13</b> into the earth, past an oil-bearing formation <b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The borehole has been completed and therefore has casing <b>17</b> which is perforated at the formation. A packer or other method (not shown) optionally isolates the formation <b>15</b> from the rest of the borehole. Tubing <b>19</b> extends inside of the casing from the formation <b>15</b> to the surface <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">A subsurface pump <b>21</b> is located in the tubing <b>19</b> at or near the formation <b>15</b>. A string of sucker rods <b>23</b> extends from the pump <b>21</b> up inside of the tubing <b>19</b> to a polished rod and a stuffing box <b>25</b> on the surface <b>13</b>. The sucker rod string <b>23</b> is connected to a pump jack unit <b>24</b> which reciprocates up and down due to a prime mover <b>26</b>, such as an electric motor, a gasoline or diesel engine, or a gas engine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate the pump <b>21</b> of the present invention, in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The pump <b>21</b> is of the insert type, where it is inserted into the tubing <b>19</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, only a portion of the casing <b>17</b> and tubing <b>19</b> are shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The pumps described herein can be a top hold down or bottom hold down or some other type of pump. In addition, the pumps can be a tubing pump, wherein the pump is incorporated as part of the tubing string (specifically the barrel is part of the tubing string).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The pump <b>21</b> has a barrel <b>31</b> and a plunger <b>33</b> located inside of the barrel. The barrel and the plunger reciprocate relative to each other. In the embodiment shown, the barrel is fixed while the plunger reciprocates. The barrel <b>31</b> is inserted into the tubing <b>19</b> and secured with a hold down <b>35</b> and a seating nipple <b>36</b>. The hold down <b>35</b> has packing to seal the barrel to the tubing. The invention can also be used on a pump with a fixed plunger and a traveling or reciprocating barrel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The barrel <b>31</b> has an upper cage <b>37</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) for a sliding valve <b>39</b>. The upper cage <b>37</b> has a seat <b>41</b> that receives the sliding valve <b>39</b>. The cage <b>37</b> has openings <b>43</b> to allow communication with the inside of the tubing <b>19</b>. Below the seat <b>41</b> is a chamber <b>45</b> for receiving the plunger <b>33</b>. The plunger <b>33</b> can reciprocate up and down inside of the barrel chamber <b>45</b>. The plunger <b>33</b> divides the chamber <b>45</b> into an upper chamber <b>45</b>A and a lower chamber <b>45</b>B. An upper rod <b>47</b> extends from the top of the plunger <b>33</b> through the seat <b>41</b> and the sliding valve <b>39</b>. The rod <b>47</b> couples to the lower end of the sucker rods <b>23</b>. The sliding valve <b>39</b> slides along the rod <b>47</b>. Near the bottom of the lower chamber <b>45</b>B (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) are perforations <b>49</b> in the barrel <b>31</b> to allow fluid to flow inside. At the lower end of the lower chamber <b>45</b>B is packing <b>51</b>. A lower rod <b>53</b> depends from the plunger <b>33</b> through the packing <b>51</b>. The packing <b>51</b> is fixed to the barrel <b>31</b> and allows the lower rod <b>53</b> to reciprocate therein. The lower rod <b>53</b> is coupled to the plunger <b>33</b> by way of a perforated cage <b>55</b>. Thus, fluid can flow through the barrel perforations <b>49</b> into the cage <b>55</b> and into the plunger <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The plunger <b>33</b> has a one-way valve <b>57</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) therein. A preferred location for the valve is near the top of the plunger, although this need not be the case. The plunger <b>33</b> has perforations <b>58</b> or openings above the valve <b>57</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">The barrel <b>31</b> extends below the packing <b>51</b> for some distance. The lower end <b>59</b> of the barrel is closed. This lower extension of the barrel need not be the barrel itself, but can be an extension member of some type. The extension forms a lower chamber <b>61</b> below the packing <b>51</b>. A piston <b>63</b> is located in the lower chamber <b>61</b>, which piston is coupled to the lower rod <b>53</b>. The piston reciprocates inside of the lower chamber <b>61</b>. Thus, the lower chamber is divided by the piston into first and second lower chambers <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B. Each first and second lower chamber <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B has at least one, and perhaps several, orifices <b>65</b> through the barrel wall <b>67</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an orifice <b>65</b>. The orifice <b>65</b> can have an insert <b>68</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to allow changing of the orifice size so as to suit the pump size and well conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In operation, the plunger <b>33</b> is reciprocated up and down inside of the barrel by the sucker rods <b>33</b>. As the plunger <b>33</b> reciprocates, so does the piston <b>63</b> inside of the lower chamber <b>61</b>. Fluid from the formation flows through perforations <b>71</b> in the casing <b>17</b> and through perforations <b>73</b> in the tubing <b>19</b>, which are located below the packing <b>35</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The fluid contains liquids such as oil and also contains gas. The gas may be in small bubbles and entrained in the fluid or the gas may be in solution with the liquid. The piston <b>63</b> and lower chamber <b>61</b> separate gas from liquid using pressure differentials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">On the downstroke, the plunger <b>33</b> and piston <b>63</b> descend. Fluid is drawn into the first lower chamber <b>61</b>A through the respective orifices <b>65</b> and fluid is expelled from the second lower chamber <b>61</b>B through the respective orifices <b>65</b>. On the upstroke, fluid is expelled from the first lower chamber <b>61</b>A and is drawn into the second lower chamber <b>61</b>B through the respective orifices <b>65</b>. The orifices <b>65</b> are sized so as to cause the fluid to experience a pressure drop, wherein gas is separated from liquid. Thus, with each pass through the orifice, the fluid undergoes some phase or gas separation. The piston <b>63</b> arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is double acting in that separation work is done on both the upstroke and the downstroke.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">After the fluid is alternately expelled from the first and second lower chambers <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B, the gas rises and exits through the tubing perforations <b>73</b>. The liquid also rises and enters the barrel <b>31</b> through the barrel perforations <b>49</b>. The liquid enters the lower rod cage <b>55</b> and then enters the plunger <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">On the downstroke, the sliding valve <b>39</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) is closed while the plunger valve <b>57</b> is open. The respective open and closed valve positions are determined by pressure differentials across the valves. As the plunger <b>33</b> descends, pressure above the sliding valve <b>39</b> is greater and so causes the sliding valve to close against the seat <b>41</b>. The expanding upper chamber <b>45</b>A creates a low pressure above the plunger valve <b>57</b>. This opens the plunger valve <b>57</b> and the liquid passes through. On the upstroke, the rising plunger <b>33</b> compresses the upper chamber <b>45</b>A, thereby closing the plunger valve <b>57</b> and lifting the fluid above the plunger valve. The pressure in the upper chamber <b>45</b>A increases and opens the sliding valve <b>39</b>. Fluid passes through the open sliding valve <b>39</b>. The fluid exits the barrel through the perforations <b>43</b> and flows into the tubing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">While the fluid is lifted due to the reciprocation of the plunger inside of the barrel and the opening and closing of the valves <b>39</b>, <b>57</b>, the reciprocation of the piston <b>63</b> does not lift any fluid. Instead, the piston <b>63</b> forces the fluid through one or more pressure drops. Consequently, the operation of the piston <b>63</b> adds only slightly to the work performed by the prime mover <b>26</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">The orifices <b>65</b> are sized relative to the smallest of the valves <b>39</b>, <b>57</b>. The orifice should be smaller than the inside diameter of the smallest valve seat. This ensures that the fluid flowing through the orifices <b>65</b> will experience a greater pressure drop than when flowing through the valve seats. Thus, if the fluid contains any gas, the gas will be separated by the orifices <b>65</b>, instead of by a valve seat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">In addition, the orifices <b>65</b> can be shaped to cause the desired pressure drop. For example, orifices with sharp edges produce a greater pressure drop than do orifices with round edges.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">The valve seat that is at the entry of the compression chamber is of the most interest in sizing or shaping the orifice. This is because as fluid flows through the valve seat to enter the compression chamber in the pump, any gas that becomes separated will locate inside of the compression chamber, with consequences of gas locking or interference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a valve assembly <b>81</b> which can be used to supplement the orifice <b>65</b>. The valve assembly <b>81</b> includes two one-way valves. A valve assembly is coupled to an opening on each of the first and second lower chambers <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B. One valve <b>83</b> allows fluid to enter the chamber <b>61</b> while the other valve <b>85</b> allows fluid to exit the chamber. With the valve arrangement <b>81</b>, the orifice <b>65</b> formed by the seat of the exit valve <b>85</b> is sized so as to create a pressure drop to entice the gas to separate from the liquid as fluid is expelled from the respective lower chamber <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B. The gas is separated from the liquid when the fluid is discharged from the respective chamber <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B. Thus, the gas is not separated as the fluid flows into the respective lower chamber. Alternatively, each respective chamber <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B can be provided with an entry orifice having a one-way valve allowing fluid into the chamber and an exit orifice having a one-way valve allowing fluid to exit the chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows another embodiment of the pump. The upper portions of the barrel and plunger of the pump of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are substantially similar to the upper portions of the pump of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. Therefore, only the lower portion will be described. The piston <b>91</b> and lower rod <b>93</b> are hollow so as to allow the flow of fluid therethrough. Depending from the piston <b>91</b> is a hollow intake tube <b>95</b> which exits the lower end <b>59</b> of the barrel <b>31</b>. The intake tube <b>95</b> reciprocates with respect to the lower end of the barrel; consequently, packing or a seal <b>104</b> is provided at the junction. The first and second lower chambers <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B are provided with orifices <b>65</b> or valve assemblies <b>81</b> as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">In operation, the pump of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> operates in a manner similar to the pump of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The piston <b>91</b> reciprocates up and down in the lower end portion of the barrel <b>31</b>. The action of the piston <b>91</b> draws fluid through the orifices <b>65</b>, thereby separating the gas in the fluid from the liquid. When the gas is separated from the liquid, the gas flows upwardly and out of the tubing perforations <b>73</b>. The liquid flows downwardly to the lower end of the intake tube <b>95</b>. The liquid flows up through intake tube <b>95</b>, the piston <b>91</b>, the lower rod <b>93</b> and ultimately through the plunger <b>33</b>. A vent hole <b>97</b> is provided in the barrel lower chamber <b>45</b>B between the packing <b>51</b> and the plunger <b>33</b> so that the plunger reciprocation will not be inhibited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, still another embodiment of the pump is shown. The upper portions of the pump are substantially similar to the upper portions of the pump shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The plunger <b>33</b> has a depending hollow intake tube <b>101</b> in place of the rod. The intake tube passes through the lower end of the barrel. The chamber <b>103</b> between the lower end of the barrel <b>31</b> and the plunger <b>33</b> has one or more orifices <b>65</b> or valves <b>81</b> as described above. On the upstroke, fluid enters the chamber <b>103</b> by way of the orifices <b>65</b>, whereas on the downstroke, the fluid is forced from the chamber. Passing the fluid through the orifices <b>65</b> subjects the fluid to a pressure drop wherein gas is separated from liquid. The gas exits through the tubing perforations and the liquid enters the plunger at the lower end of the barrel through the intake tube <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the intake tube <b>95</b>, <b>101</b> has sufficient length so that it will always remain within the packing <b>104</b>. In addition, the intake tube <b>95</b>, <b>101</b> can be sufficiently long and depend below the bottom end of the barrel, so that a quiet zone is formed between the bottom end of the intake tube and the bottommost orifice. The quiet zone is discussed in more detail hereinafter in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the pump in accordance with another embodiment. The plunger <b>33</b> has, at its lower end, an intake tube <b>121</b>. The plunger <b>33</b> reciprocates between an upper chamber <b>123</b> and an intermediate chamber <b>125</b>. At the bottom of the intermediate chamber <b>125</b> is a wall <b>127</b>. The wall forms an opening <b>129</b> around the intake tube <b>121</b>. The opening <b>129</b> is sized so as to allow fluid to flow therethrough. The transverse cross-sectional area of the opening <b>129</b> is sized so as to cause a greater pressure drop to the fluid flowing therethrough, than when the fluid flows through openings (such as valve seats) inside of the pump. Alternatively, the wall <b>127</b> need not have a single annular opening, but could have several openings, all sized to create the desired pressure drop.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">Below the wall <b>127</b> is a bottom chamber <b>131</b>. In the top portion of the bottom chamber <b>131</b> are openings <b>133</b> in the wall of the mud anchor <b>135</b>. The intake tube <b>121</b> is open at its bottom end; the bottom end is located below the openings <b>133</b>. The bottom of the barrel <b>31</b> is plugged with the mud anchor <b>135</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">The plunger <b>33</b> has upper and lower valves <b>137</b>, <b>139</b>, both of which communicate with the upper chamber <b>123</b>. Above the upper chamber, the plunger opens <b>141</b> to the interior of the tubing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">In operation, on the upstroke of the plunger <b>33</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, fluid is drawn inside of the barrel bottom chamber <b>131</b> through the openings <b>133</b> and then is drawn into the intermediate, or gas separation, chamber <b>125</b> through the opening <b>129</b>. As the fluid flows through the opening <b>129</b> and enters the intermediate chamber, the fluid is subjected to a pressure drop and the gas separates from the liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Also on the upstroke, the lower valve <b>139</b> is closed. Fluid (liquid) in the plunger <b>33</b> and the intake tube <b>121</b> below the lower valve <b>139</b> is not displaced relative to the plunger. The upper chamber <b>123</b> serves as a compression chamber, forcing the upper valve <b>137</b> open. The fluid in the upper chamber <b>123</b> flows through the open upper valve <b>137</b> into the upper portion of the plunger and out through the openings <b>141</b> into the tubing. Furthermore, fluid in the lower chamber <b>131</b> below the openings <b>133</b> does not move. A “quiet” zone, Z, is formed in the lower chamber between the openings <b>133</b> and the bottom of the intake tube <b>121</b>. The quiet zone is typically between one and two times the volume of the pump.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">On the downstroke of the plunger <b>33</b>, fluid (both liquid and gas) in the intermediate chamber <b>125</b> is forced back through the opening <b>129</b> and into the lower chamber <b>131</b>, once again being subjected to a pressure drop and consequently further separating the gas from the liquid. The gas exits the lower chamber <b>131</b> through the openings <b>133</b>. The upper chamber <b>123</b> extends, opening the lower valve <b>139</b> and drawing fluid from inside the plunger <b>33</b> through the lower valve and into the upper chamber. Fluid (liquid) flows from the quiet zone Z of the mud anchor into the intake tube <b>121</b>. The velocity of the fluid in the quiet zone Z on the downstroke is slow in order to allow gas bubbles to rise to the openings <b>133</b>. Preferably, the fluid velocity is less than six inches per second.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">In the intermediate chamber <b>125</b>, a gas-to-liquid interface is likely to form. Moving the plunger on the downstroke into this interface will not subject the pump to gas locking or gas interference because the liquid and gas escapes the chamber <b>125</b> through the opening <b>129</b>. Thus, the plunger is offered little resistance, effectively preventing interference and locking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the pump in accordance with another embodiment. The mud anchor <b>135</b> below the barrel <b>131</b> has upper and lower sets <b>151</b>, <b>153</b> of openings. The upper set <b>151</b> of openings is the same as the openings <b>133</b> described in the pump of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, except that a one-way valve <b>155</b> covers the openings <b>151</b>. Fluid can flow from the lower chamber <b>131</b> out through the openings <b>151</b> and the valves <b>155</b>. However, fluid cannot flow into the lower chamber through the openings <b>151</b> and valves <b>155</b>. Thus, gas, once discharged from the lower chamber <b>131</b>, is not drawn back in on the upstroke through the openings <b>151</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">The lower set of openings <b>153</b> is located below the upper set of openings <b>151</b>. The lower set of openings <b>153</b> are orifices that are sized to separate gas from the liquid as the fluid flows therethrough, as previously discussed herein. The lower chamber <b>131</b> is a gas separation chamber. A quiet zone Z is formed between the bottom of the intake tube <b>121</b> and the lower set of openings <b>153</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">In operation, the pump of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> draws fluid into the mud anchor through the openings <b>153</b> as the plunger moves on the upstroke. The gas is separated from the liquid by passing through the orifices <b>153</b>. The gas moves upwardly to vent out through the openings <b>151</b>. As the plunger moves on the downstroke, the liquid is moved into the quiet zone where it resides on the next upstroke.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">The valves <b>155</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can be flapper type valves, can be of the type shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or can be another type. The flapper type valves <b>155</b> can open facing downwardly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, or it can open upwardly (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">The pump of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is similar to the pump of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, except instead of valves over the upper set of openings <b>151</b>, there are provided shields <b>157</b>. The shields <b>157</b> are oriented so as to allow gas to vent from the openings and to face upwardly. Thus, any gas that is located outside of the barrel will rise but will be prevented from entering the openings <b>151</b> due to deflection of the shields <b>157</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows still another embodiment of the pump. The pump is a standard sucker rod pump having a barrel <b>31</b> and a plunger <b>33</b>, with a standing valve <b>161</b> on the barrel and a traveling valve <b>163</b> on the plunger. Below the standing valve <b>161</b> is a mud anchor <b>165</b>, which serves as a lower extension of the barrel. A dip tube <b>167</b>, or intake tube, extends from the standing valve <b>161</b> down into the mud anchor <b>165</b>. The intake tube <b>167</b> is stationary with respect to the plunger <b>33</b> and extends down inside the mud anchor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">The mud anchor is perforated at its upper end with openings <b>169</b>. The openings <b>169</b> form orifices to subject the fluid to a pressure drop and separate gas from liquid. The openings <b>169</b> are sized smaller than the smallest opening in the pump. The pump has a number of openings through which fluid flows, namely the standing valve seat and the traveling valve seat. By locating the smallest openings that the fluid flows through in the mud anchor, the fluid is subjected through the greatest pressure drop upon entering the mud anchor. Thus, any gas in the fluid will separate upon entry into the mud anchor instead of inside of the pump.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">The pump operates as normal, with the plunger reciprocating inside of the barrel. On the upstroke, the fluid is drawn into the mud anchor through the openings <b>169</b> and into the annulus <b>171</b>, or gas separation chamber, around the intake tube <b>167</b>. In the annulus, the gas is separated from the liquid. The fluid is then drawn into the quiet zone, which is between the openings <b>169</b> and the bottom of the intake tube <b>167</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">On the downstroke, the plunger descends and the standing valve is closed. The fluid in the quiet zone is not moving wherein gas rises and exits the mud anchor through the openings <b>169</b>. Fluid (mostly liquid) in the compression chamber flows through the open traveling valve <b>163</b> and into the plunger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">On the next upstroke, the fluid in the quiet zone is drawn into the intake tube <b>167</b> and the pump.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">The present invention subjects fluid to a pressure drop to separate gas from liquid. The gas is allowed to vent to the casing tubing annulus, where it can be captured at the surface, while the liquid enters the pump for lifting to the surface through the tubing. Upon separation, the liquid and gas are intermingled with each other. However, the gas will not reenter solution in the liquid given the relatively short period of time involved (typically several seconds). Much of the gas is vented quickly after the separation. However, some gas bubbles may be carried below the vent openings. The provision of a quiet zone and the moving of the liquid at slow velocities allows gas bubbles to rise to the vent openings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Thus, with the present invention, the mechanical actuation plunger or piston is used to provide flow of the fluid through one or more orifices and across a pressure drop in order to separate all or some of the gas from liquids. The orifice is sized so as to be smaller than the smallest opening inside of the pump (typically the valve seats). The orifice is located outside of the pump and the gas is provided with an escape path. By preventing the separation of gas from liquid inside of the pump, gas lock and gas interference are avoided. In addition, the pump operates efficiently because the amount of work required to flow the fluid through the orifice is negligible compared to the work required to lift the fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">The foregoing disclosure and showings made in the drawings are merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and are not to be interpreted in a limiting sense.</div>
