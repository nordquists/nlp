<heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is based on a Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-320784 filed on Nov. 4, 2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a collision detection system, which can be suitably used for a vehicle, for example.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Generally, a vehicle can be provided with a passenger protection device such as side airbags to protect passengers from a side collision between the vehicle side surface and an obstacle. The passenger protection device is actuated when the side collision has been detected. For example, as disclosed in JP-2-249740A, pressure sensors are provided to detect pressure variations (due to collision load) in closed spaces (air tanks) in side doors of the vehicle, and the side airbags are deployed based on detection signals of the pressure sensors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">A collision detection system according to a related art will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, doors <b>102</b>-<b>105</b> of a vehicle are respectively provided with side airbags <b>112</b>-<b>115</b> as the passenger protection device for the side collision. Pressure sensors <b>108</b> <i>a</i>, <b>108</b> <i>b</i>, <b>108</b> <i>c </i>and <b>108</b> <i>d </i>are respectively arranged in spaces defined in the doors <b>102</b>-<b>105</b> to detect inner pressures (which will vary due to side collision of vehicle) of the doors <b>102</b>-<b>105</b>. Moreover, the pressure sensors <b>108</b> <i>a</i>-<b>108</b> <i>d </i>are electrically connected with a collision detection ECU <b>109</b>, respectively through wires <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b</i>, <b>110</b> <i>c </i>and <b>110</b> <i>d. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">That is, in this case, the number of the pressure sensors is the same with that of the doors of the vehicle. Thus, it is also necessary to provide the pressure sensors with the wires which have the same number with the doors. Therefore, the cost of the collision detection system is increased.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In view of the above-described disadvantages, it is an object of the present invention to provide a collision detection system which can have a lowered cost by reducing a sensor number.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">According to the present invention, a collision detection system for a vehicle has multiple hollow members each of which is arranged at a periphery portion of the vehicle and defines therein a substantially closed space, at least one housing which defines therein a substantially closed space, multiple transferring members for respectively communicating the spaces in the hollow members with the space in the housing, at least one detection unit which is arranged in the housing to detect a status of air in the housing, and a control unit for determining whether or not there occurs a collision of the vehicle based on detection signals from the detection unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">When there occurs the collision at the periphery portion of the vehicle, the inner capacity of the hollow member in the vicinity of the collision portion varies. In this case, the variation of the air status of the space in the hollow member can be transferred into the housing through the transferring member, to be detected by the detection unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">That is, the detection unit which is arranged in the housing can detect the air statuses in the multiple hollow members which are positioned at the vehicle periphery portion and communicated with the housing. Therefore, the number of the detection unit can be reduced to be smaller than that of the hollow members of the vehicle periphery portion. Furthermore, the number of wire through which the detection signals of the detection unit are sent to the control unit can be reduced. Accordingly, the cost can be lowered.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading>First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">A collision detection system according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The collision detection system can be suitably used for a vehicle, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the vehicle has multiple doors (e.g., four doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b>) positioned at a periphery portion of the vehicle to partially construct the vehicle side surfaces (right side surface and left side surface). Each of the doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> is provided with therein a substantially closed space <b>2</b> <i>c</i>-<b>5</b> <i>c </i>to construct a hollow member. The doors <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are respectively positioned at a right front portion and a left front portion of the vehicle. The doors <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are respectively positioned at a right rear portion and a left rear portion of the vehicle. In this case, the vehicle left-right direction corresponds to the vehicle width direction, and the vehicle front-rear direction corresponds to the vehicle longitudinal direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The collision detection system is provided with a tube combination housing <b>6</b> (housing) which defines therein a substantially closed space <b>61</b>, multiple transferring members (e.g., four transferring members <b>72</b>-<b>75</b>) for respectively connecting the spaces <b>2</b> <i>c</i>-<b>5</b> <i>c </i>in the doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> with the space <b>61</b> in the housing <b>6</b>, a pressure detection unit <b>8</b> (e.g., pressure sensor) which is arranged in the space <b>61</b>, and a control unit <b>9</b> (e.g., collision detection ECU) for determining whether or not there occurs a collision of the vehicle based on detection signals from the pressure detection unit <b>8</b>. The transferring member <b>72</b>-<b>75</b> can be constructed of a tube, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The vehicle is provided with a passenger protection device including multiple side airbags (e.g., four side airbags <b>12</b>-<b>15</b>) or the like which are respectively attached to vicinities of the doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the door <b>2</b> has an inner panel <b>2</b> <i>a </i>arranged at the inner side of the vehicle and an outer panel <b>2</b> <i>b </i>positioned at the outer side of the vehicle. The substantially closed space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>is arranged between the inner panel <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and the outer panel <b>2</b> <i>b</i>. Similarly, the doors <b>3</b>-<b>5</b> are also respectively provided with therein the substantially closed spaces <b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>5</b> <i>c. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">In this case, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, each of the tubes <b>72</b>-<b>75</b> has two ends which are open. The tubes <b>72</b>-<b>75</b> are respectively provided with therein hollow portions <b>72</b> <i>c</i>-<b>75</b> <i>c</i>, each of which is communicated with the two ends of the tube.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The tube <b>72</b> is connected with the door <b>2</b> and the housing <b>6</b>, in such a manner that the opening ends <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and <b>72</b> <i>b </i>of the tube <b>72</b> respectively face (are communicated with) the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>of the door <b>2</b> and the space <b>61</b> of the housing <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Similarly, the tube <b>73</b> is connected with the door <b>3</b> and the housing <b>6</b>, in such a manner that the opening ends <b>73</b> <i>a </i>and <b>73</b> <i>b </i>of the tube <b>73</b> respectively face (are communicated with) the space <b>3</b> <i>c </i>of the door <b>3</b> and the space <b>61</b> of the housing <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The tube <b>74</b> is connected with the door <b>4</b> and the housing <b>6</b>, in such a manner that the opening ends <b>74</b> <i>a </i>and <b>74</b> <i>b </i>of the tube <b>74</b> respectively face (are communicated with) the space <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the door <b>4</b> and the space <b>61</b> of the housing <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The tube <b>75</b> is connected with the door <b>5</b> and the housing <b>6</b>, in such a manner that the opening ends <b>75</b> <i>a </i>and <b>75</b> <i>b </i>of the tube <b>75</b> respectively face (are communicated with) the space <b>5</b> <i>c </i>of the door <b>5</b> and the space <b>61</b> of the housing <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The housing <b>6</b> can be arranged at a substantial center of the vehicle. The pressure sensor <b>8</b> arranged in the housing <b>6</b> is provided to detect the air pressure in the space <b>61</b> of the housing <b>6</b>. The pressure sensor <b>8</b> can be provided with a sensing portion (not shown) of a semiconductor type or the like, a circuit portion (not shown) which generates electrical signals based on the pressure detected by the sensing portion, and a casing portion (made of resin, for example) for housing therein the sensing portion and the circuit portion. The circuit portion is electrically connected with the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> through a wire <b>10</b> or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The collision detection ECU <b>9</b> can be constructed of a signal processing circuit in which a microcomputer is embedded. The collision detection ECU <b>9</b> receives the signals (which corresponds to air pressure in space <b>61</b> of the housing <b>6</b>) through the wire <b>10</b> from the circuit portion of the pressure sensor <b>8</b>, and determines whether or not there occurs a collision with the vehicle (e.g., vehicle side surface) based on the received signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">For example, in the case where the pressure value detected by the pressure sensor <b>8</b> is larger than or equal to a predetermined threshold value, it is determined that there occurs the collision of the vehicle. Thus, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> outputs a collision detection signal for deploying the side airbags <b>12</b>-<b>15</b>, to an airbag ECU (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Next, a collision detecting process in the case of the collision at the door <b>2</b> will be described as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows the door <b>2</b> before the collision occurrence, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows the door <b>2</b> after the collision occurrence. When there occurs the collision at the door <b>2</b>, the outer panel <b>2</b> <i>b </i>of the door <b>2</b> is deformed to become closer to the inner panel <b>2</b> <i>a </i>as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> where the outer panel <b>2</b> <i>b </i>before the collision is indicated by the broken line and that after the collision is indicated by the solid line. Thus, the inner capacity (volume) of the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>of the door <b>2</b> decreases so that the air pressure in the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The air pressure in the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>of the door <b>2</b> can be transferred to the space <b>61</b> of the housing <b>6</b> through the tube <b>72</b>, which is communicated with the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>at the end <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and communicated with the space <b>61</b> at the end <b>72</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In this case, the pressure sensor <b>8</b> generates the signals corresponding to the pressure variation detected by the sensing portion thereof, and sends the signals to the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> through the wire <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The collision detection ECU <b>9</b> determines that there occurs a collision (for example, side collision due to which vehicle-width-direction impact is applied to vehicle) of the vehicle, in the case where the pressure value detected by the pressure sensor <b>8</b> is larger than or equal to the predetermined threshold value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Thus, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> sends the collision detection signal to the airbag ECU, after determining the collision occurrence. Then, the airbag ECU outputs an actuation signal to the side airbags <b>12</b>-<b>15</b> so that the side airbags <b>12</b>-<b>15</b> are deployed to protect passengers from the collision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">On the other hand, in the case where the detected pressure value is smaller that the predetermined threshold value, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> determines that there does not occur the collision of the vehicle. Thus, the collision detection signal is not sent to the airbag ECU, and the airbags <b>12</b>-<b>15</b> are not deployed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">As described above, the multiple transferring members <b>72</b>-<b>75</b> which have the tubular shape or the like are provided to transfer the air pressure variation of the spaces <b>2</b> <i>c</i>-<b>5</b> <i>c </i>in the doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> to the space <b>61</b> in the housing <b>6</b>. That is, the opening ends <b>72</b> <i>a</i>-<b>75</b> <i>a </i>of the tubes <b>72</b>-<b>75</b> respectively face the spaces <b>2</b> <i>c</i>-<b>5</b> <i>c</i>, and the opening ends <b>72</b> <i>b</i>-<b>75</b> <i>b </i>of the tubes <b>72</b>-<b>75</b> face the space <b>61</b>. Thus, the spaces <b>2</b> <i>c</i>-<b>5</b> <i>c </i>in the doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> are communicated with the space <b>61</b> in the housing <b>6</b> respectively through the tubes <b>72</b>-<b>75</b>, so that the pressure variation in the door <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> due to the collision occurred thereat can be substantially transferred to the interior of the housing <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The pressure sensor <b>8</b> arranged in the housing <b>6</b> detects the air pressure in the housing <b>6</b> and generates the corresponding signals. Therefore, the collision occurrence at the multiple doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> of the vehicle can be detected via the single pressure sensor <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">In this case, the collision detection system has the single pressure sensor <b>8</b>, and the single wire <b>10</b> for sending the signals from the pressure sensor <b>8</b> to the collision detection ECU <b>9</b>. Moreover, the single housing <b>6</b> is provided, and the four tubes <b>72</b>-<b>75</b> are connected with the housing <b>6</b> to be combined. Therefore, the number of the components of the collision detection system is decreased, thus lowering the cost.</div>
<heading>Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">In the above-described first embodiment, the vehicle is provided with the single housing <b>6</b> and the single pressure detection unit <b>8</b> which is arranged in the housing <b>6</b>. According to a second embodiment of the present invention, the multiple housings (e.g., two housings <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b</i>) and the multiple pressure detection units (e.g., two pressure detection units <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>) are provided. In this case, the number of the housings and that of the pressure sensors are smaller than the number of the doors of the vehicle, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the first housing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and the second housing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>can be respectively arranged at a right portion and a left portion of the vehicle with respect to the vehicle width direction. Each of the housings <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>defines therein a substantially closed space <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>(not shown). The first pressure detection unit <b>81</b> and the second pressure detection unit <b>82</b> (e.g., pressure sensors) are respectively arranged in the spaces in the first housing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and the second housing <b>6</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">In this case, the two opening ends <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and <b>72</b> <i>b </i>of the tube <b>72</b> can be respectively communicated (connected) with the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>in the door <b>2</b> and the space <b>61</b> <i>a </i>in the first housing <b>6</b> <i>a</i>. The two opening ends <b>74</b> <i>a </i>and <b>74</b> <i>b </i>of the tube <b>74</b> can be respectively communicated (connected) with the space <b>4</b> <i>c </i>in the door <b>4</b> and the space <b>61</b> <i>a </i>in the first housing <b>6</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">On the other hand, the two opening ends <b>73</b> <i>a </i>and <b>73</b> <i>b </i>of the tube <b>73</b> are respectively communicated (connected) with the space <b>3</b> <i>c </i>in the door <b>3</b> and the space <b>61</b> <i>b </i>in the second housing <b>6</b> <i>b</i>. The two opening ends <b>75</b> <i>a </i>and <b>75</b> <i>b </i>of the tube <b>75</b> are respectively communicated (connected) with the space <b>5</b> <i>c </i>in the door <b>5</b> and the space <b>61</b> <i>b </i>in the second housing <b>6</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The pressure sensors <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> are electrically connected with the collision detection ECU <b>9</b>, respectively through a wire <b>10</b>R and a wire <b>10</b>L or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">According to this embodiment, the pressure sensor <b>81</b> detects the air pressure in the first housing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>which is connected with the doors <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, and outputs the corresponding signals to the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> through the wire <b>10</b>R. In the case where the pressure value detected by the pressure sensor <b>81</b> is larger than or equal to a predetermined threshold value, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> determines that there occurs a collision at the right side surface (where doors <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> are positioned) of the vehicle and sends a right collision detection signal to the airbag ECU (not shown). Thus, the airbag ECU outputs an actuation signal to the side airbags <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> which are arranged at the vicinities of the doors <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, so that only the side airbags <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are deployed. In this case, the actuation signal for actuating the side airbags <b>13</b> and <b>15</b> which are arranged at the vicinities of the doors <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> is not outputted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">On the other hand, the pressure sensor <b>82</b> detects the air pressure in the second housing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>and outputs the corresponding signal to the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> through the wire <b>10</b>L. In the case where the pressure value detected by the pressure sensor <b>82</b> is larger than or equal to a predetermined threshold value, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> determines that there occurs a collision at the left side surface (where doors <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> are positioned) of the vehicle and sends a left collision detection signal to the airbag ECU. Thus, the airbag ECU outputs an actuation signal to the side airbags <b>13</b> and <b>15</b>, so that only the side airbags <b>13</b> and <b>15</b> are deployed. In this case, the actuation signal for actuating the side airbags <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> is not outputted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">According to this embodiment, the number of the housings (e.g., two housings <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b</i>) and that of the pressure sensors (e.g., two pressure sensors <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>) are smaller than the number of the doors (e.g., four doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b>) of the vehicle. The number of the tubes (e.g., four tubes <b>72</b>-<b>75</b>) is the same with the doors of the vehicle. In this case, the pressure sensors share the detections of the air pressures in the spaces of the doors, which have the larger number than the pressure sensors. Correspondingly, the housings are share-connected with the tubes, which have the larger number than the housings. That is, the housings are shared by the tubes, to be respectively connected with the different tubes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Therefore, the collision occurrence at the vehicle side surface can be detected via the pressure sensors with the smaller number than that of the doors of the vehicle. Therefore, the cost can be lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Moreover, according to this embodiment, the collision can be determined based on the signals from the first pressure sensor <b>81</b> for detecting the air pressures of the spaces in the doors <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> of the vehicle right side, and the second pressure sensor <b>82</b> for detecting the air pressures of the spaces in the doors <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> of the vehicle left side. Therefore, it becomes possible to selectively actuate only the airbags of the right side or those of the left side, where the collision occurrence has been determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">About the collision detection system, what has not been described in the second embodiment is the substantially same with the first embodiment.</div>
<heading>Third Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">A third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. In this case, the collision detection system is further provided with multiple flow detection units.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">According to this embodiment, a valve member <b>72</b> <i>d </i>and an opening/closing detection member <b>72</b> <i>e </i>construct the flow detection unit for detecting the air flow from the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>of the door <b>2</b> toward the housing <b>6</b>. Similarly, a valve member <b>73</b> <i>d </i>and an opening/closing detection member <b>73</b> <i>e</i>, a valve member <b>74</b> <i>d </i>and an opening/closing detection member <b>74</b> <i>e</i>, a valve member <b>75</b> <i>d </i>and an opening/closing detection member <b>75</b> <i>e </i>respectively construct the flow detection units for detecting the air flow from the spaces <b>3</b> <i>c</i>-<b>5</b> <i>c </i>of the doors <b>3</b>-<b>5</b> toward the housing <b>6</b>. The opening/closing detection members <b>72</b> <i>e</i>-<b>75</b> <i>e </i>can be constructed of switches, for example.</div>

The valve members <b>72</b> <i>d</i>-<b>75</b> <i>d </i>and the switches <b>72</b> <i>e</i>-<b>75</b> <i>e </i>can be arranged in the housing <b>6</b>. The switches <b>72</b> <i>e</i>-<b>75</b> <i>e </i>become ON/OFF respectively responding to opening/closing of the valve members <b>72</b> <i>d</i>-<b>75</b> <i>d</i>. In this case, when the valve member <b>72</b> <i>d</i>-<b>75</b> <i>d </i>is opened due to the air flow from the door <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> toward the housing <b>6</b>, the switch <b>72</b> <i>e</i>-<b>75</b> <i>e </i>will become ON so that electrical signals are generated and inputted to the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> through a wire <b>10</b>A or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">For example, when the collision occurs at the door <b>2</b>, air will flow from the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>in the door <b>2</b> toward the housing <b>6</b> through the tube <b>72</b>. In this case, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the valve member <b>72</b> <i>d </i>deviates from the end <b>72</b> <i>b </i>of the tube <b>72</b> to become open, so that the switch <b>72</b> <i>e </i>is ON. Based on the detection signal from the switch <b>72</b> <i>e</i>, the collision at the door <b>2</b> can be determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In this case, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> determines whether or not there occurs the collision of the vehicle based on the signals from the pressure sensor <b>8</b> through the wire <b>10</b>, and determines which of the doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> collides with the obstacle according to the signals from the switches <b>72</b> <i>e</i>-<b>75</b> <i>e </i>through the wire <b>10</b>A. Therefore, the airbags <b>12</b>-<b>15</b> can be selectively actuated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">About the collision detection system, what has not been described in the third embodiment is the substantially same with the first embodiment.</div>
<heading>Other Embodiments</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">In the first embodiment, in the case where it is determined that there occurs the collision at one of the doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b>, all of the airbags <b>12</b>-<b>15</b> will be actuated. However, the vehicle can be also further provided with an acceleration sensor (not shown). Based on the output of the acceleration sensor, it is determined that there occurs the collision at the vehicle right side or the vehicle left side. Thus, it becomes possible to selectively actuate the airbags <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> which are arranged at the vicinities of the doors <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> of the vehicle right side, or the airbags <b>13</b> and <b>15</b> which are arranged at the vicinities of the doors <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> of the vehicle left side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">Moreover, in the above-described embodiments, the pressure detection unit <b>8</b> is provided to detect the variation in air status in the housing <b>6</b>. However, other detection unit can be also used to detect the variation in the air status in the housing <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">For example, a flow-rate detection unit which is capable of detecting the flow rate of air in the housing <b>6</b>, can be used as a substitute for the pressure detection unit. For example, in the case where there occurs the collision at the door <b>2</b> or the like, the interior capacity of the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>of the door <b>2</b> will decrease. Thus, air flows from the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>in the door <b>2</b> toward the space <b>61</b> in the housing <b>6</b>, through the tube <b>72</b> which communicates the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>with the space <b>61</b>. In this case, the flow-rate detection unit can be arranged in the housing <b>6</b> to detect the variation of the air flow rate in the housing <b>6</b> and generate the corresponding signals. Therefore, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> can determine whether or not there occurs the collision at the vehicle side surface, based on the signals from the flow-rate detection unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Alternatively, a sound detection unit which is capable of detecting the sound in the housing <b>6</b> can be also used as a substitute for the pressure detection unit. For example, when there occurs the collision at the door <b>2</b>, the sound will be caused due to the metal deformation of the door <b>2</b> or the like. The sound will be transferred to the housing <b>6</b> from the door <b>2</b>, through the tube <b>72</b> which communicates the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>in the door <b>2</b> with the space <b>61</b> in the housing <b>6</b>. In this case, the sound detection unit detects the sound transferred into the space <b>61</b> of the housing <b>6</b> and generates the corresponding signals. Therefore, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> can determine whether or not there occurs the collision at the vehicle side surface, based on the signals from the sound detection unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">More alternatively, a temperature detection unit can be also used as a substitute for the pressure detection unit. For example, when there occurs the collision at the door <b>2</b>, the interior capacity of the door <b>2</b> will decrease so that the air pressure in the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>increases. The air pressure increase of the space <b>2</b> <i>c </i>of the door <b>2</b> can be transferred to the space <b>61</b> in the housing <b>6</b> through the tube <b>72</b>, so that the air temperature in the housing <b>6</b> becomes high. In this case, the temperature detection unit detects the air temperature variation in the housing <b>6</b> and generates the corresponding signals. Therefore, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> can determine whether or not there occurs the collision at the vehicle side surface, based on the signals from the temperature detection unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Furthermore, the housing <b>6</b> in which the detection unit is arranged can be also connected with the substantially closed spaces (of hollow members) which are arranged at the vehicle periphery portion other than the vehicle side surface. For example, the hollow members having the substantially closed spaces can be arranged at the front portion and the rear portion of the vehicle, for a detection of a front-rear-direction collision of the vehicle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Moreover, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> and the airbag ECU can be also constructed of the single ECU. That is, the single ECU functions as the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> for determining whether or not there occurs the collision of the vehicle, and the airbag ECU for outputting the actuation signal for deploying the side airbags <b>12</b>-<b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Moreover, in the case where the two housings <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>are arranged in the vehicle with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flow detection units can be also provided. In this case, for example, the valve members <b>72</b> <i>d</i>, <b>74</b> <i>d </i>and the opening/closing detection members <b>72</b> <i>e</i>, <b>74</b> <i>e </i>can be arranged in the housing <b>6</b> <i>a </i>which are communicated with the spaces <b>2</b> <i>c </i>and <b>4</b> <i>c </i>of the doors <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>. The valve members <b>73</b> <i>d</i>, <b>75</b> <i>d </i>and the opening/closing detection members <b>73</b> <i>e</i>, <b>75</b> <i>e </i>can be arranged in the housing <b>6</b> <i>b </i>which are communicated with the spaces <b>3</b> <i>c </i>and <b>5</b> <i>c </i>of the doors <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>. Thus, the collision detection ECU <b>9</b> can further determine which of the doors <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> there occurs the collision at, based on the detection signals from the opening/closing detection members <b>72</b> <i>e</i>-<b>75</b> <i>e. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Such changes and modifications are to be understood as being in the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</div>
