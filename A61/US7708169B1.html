<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The present invention relates to motor driven caulking gun and the like for dispensing caulk, adhesive and other viscous materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">There have been attempts in the past to invent a compact motor driven caulking gun that does not have a plunger rod protruding at the back of the motor driven caulking gun. Examples of such caulking guns are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,503,307, invented by Steven J. Wilson and John H. Klock; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,321,945, invented by Gaston Girouard and Elinor Girouard; and U.S. Pat. Application No. US 2002/0108971 A1, invented by Luc Lafond. Unfortunately, all these inventions have their inherent impractical drawbacks. Additionally each of the aforementioned patents possesses a bulky handle, which sometimes can be in the way when applying caulk in tight spaces.</div>
<heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide a relatively compact caulking gun that can be easily manipulated with only one hand if required while dispensing caulk, adhesive and other viscous materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The preferred embodiments of the compact powered caulking gun comprises of a body consisting of two clamshells, with a plurality of electrical contacts incorporated into one of the clamshells. A removable cartridge cradle with a three position, rheostatic extrusion speed regulator, Forward-On, Off, Reverse-On switch attached to the body. The removable cartridge cradle having a plurality of embedded electrical terminals connected to a plurality of insulated electrical wires embedded and connected to the three position, rheostatic extrusion speed regulator, Forward-On, Off, Reverse-On switch. A motor electrically connected via the electrical contacts to the three position, rheostatic extrusion speed regulator, Forward-On, Off, Reverse-On switch. A battery electrically connected via the electrical contacts to the three position, rheostatic extrusion speed regulator, Forward-On, Off, Reverse-On switch. Two Cut-Off switches are electrically connected via the electrical contacts to the three position, rheostatic extrusion speed regulator, Forward-On, Off, Reverse-On switch. The motor operatively coupled to an actuator shaft with two oppositely pitched threads thereon. An upper link member actuator with a pitched thread formed therewithin, rotatably situated on the actuator shaft. A lower link member actuator with a pitched thread formed therewithin, rotatably situated on the actuator shaft. A scissor-type mechanism, with a pusher plate, operatively connected to the upper link member actuator and operatively connected to the lower link member actuator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">An optional attachable, detachable rear handle and an optional attachable, detachable gun-type handle are provided to the operator if so desired.</div>

To securely install the cartridge cradle (<b>2</b>) into the body (<b>4</b>), the cartridge cradle (<b>2</b>) is positioned so that tab (<b>22</b> <i>a</i>) and tab (<b>22</b> <i>b</i>) lines up with and slides into opening (<b>11</b>) and opening (<b>12</b>) respectively. And the rear part of cartridge cradle (<b>2</b>) slides into recesses (<b>96</b> <i>a</i>, <b>96</b> <i>b</i>) of clamshell (<b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b</i>) respectively. Opening (<b>11</b>) consists of recesses (<b>11</b> <i>a</i>, <b>11</b> <i>b</i>) formed into clamshell (<b>4</b> <i>a</i>, <b>4</b> <i>b</i>) respectively.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">To operate the compact powered caulking gun (<b>1</b>), the operator grasps the cartridge cradle (<b>2</b>), with a cartridge (<b>78</b>) therewithin, with one hand, and with thumb of the same hand actuates the rheostatic extrusion speed regulator, Forward-On, Off, Reverse-On switch (<b>3</b>) to the Forward-On direction indicated by arrow (<b>3</b> <i>a</i>). By pushing the switch (<b>3</b>) in the Forward-On direction, the operator activates a built in rheostatic control, which regulates the amount of voltage applied to the motor (<b>35</b>) from the rechargeable battery (<b>5</b>). The farther the operator's thumb pushes the switch (<b>3</b>) in the direction indicated by arrow (<b>3</b> <i>a</i>) the more voltage is applied to the motor (<b>35</b>) thereby increasing the extrusion speed of the material from the cartridge (<b>78</b>) through the nozzle (<b>77</b>).</div>
