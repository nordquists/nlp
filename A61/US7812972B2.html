<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The present invention relates to photolithographic projection and in particular to a reticle, an apparatus for monitoring optical system, a method for monitoring optical system, and a method for manufacturing the reticle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Since photolithography patterns formed on a semiconductor wafer are continually becoming increasingly fine and precise, it becomes more important to arrange precisely the wafer in the focal point. Defocus caused by wrong arrangement of the wafer brings defective products. Therefore, methods for arranging the wafer in the focal point correctly have been developed. For example, asymmetrical diffracting gratings are employed. The asymmetrical diffracting gratings have asymmetrical diffracting portions, which generate phase different of light reaching value that is larger than 0 degrees and lower than 180 degrees. Such asymmetrical diffracting gratings generate a positive first order diffracting light and a negative first order diffracting light in different diffracting efficiencies. When the asymmetrical diffracting gratings are exposed with laser light, projection images on the wafer of the asymmetrical diffracting gratings shift perpendicularly to the optical axis if the wafer is shifted in the direction of the optical axis. The shift of the projection images and the shift of the wafer have linear relation. Therefore, once the linear relation is obtained, it is possible to calculate the wafer position from measured position of the projection images. However, existing method requires preparing two reticles, one for the inspection of the wafer position, and another for exposing the device pattern on the wafer. This is because it is difficult to fabricate both the asymmetrical diffracting gratings and the device pattern on single substrate. Therefore, preparing two reticles leads the development cost to high, and exchanging the reticles interrupts continuous production. Further, defocus may be caused while the reticles are exchanged.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">In the case where the reticle <b>5</b> includes the asymmetrical diffraction gratings <b>22</b> <i>a </i>through <b>22</b> <i>d </i>as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>, and when the reticle <b>5</b> is exposed with the reduction projection exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image projected on the wafer <b>31</b> by each of the asymmetrical diffraction gratings <b>22</b> <i>a </i>through <b>22</b> <i>d </i>shifts perpendicularly to the optical axis when the wafer stage <b>32</b> is shifted in the direction of the optical axis.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">The above phenomenon can be demonstrated in theory as well.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">With the above, it can be seen that the amount of shift (dx) of the projection image from the asymmetrical diffraction grating, and the amount of shift (dz) of the wafer in the optical axis direction have a proportionate relationship.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">It has been difficult to establish both an asymmetrical diffracting portion and a diffracting portion having differing phases together on the same mask substrate.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">In observing the projection images shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> under the SEM, the AFM or the like, the attained light shielding band projection images <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, <b>104</b> <i>c</i>, <b>104</b> <i>d</i>, <b>104</b> <i>e</i>, <b>104</b> <i>f </i>have a width represented by L, the substrate surface projection images <b>95</b> <i>a</i>, <b>95</b> <i>b</i>, <b>95</b> <i>c</i>, . . . , have a width represented by S<b>1</b>, and the asymmetrical diffracting portion projection images <b>96</b> <i>a</i>, <b>96</b> <i>b</i>, <b>96</b> <i>c</i>, . . . , have a width represented by S<b>2</b>. In this instance, there are two conditions which express the amount of exposure: exposure A, and an exposure B, which has 1.5 times the intensity of the exposure A. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> is a graph plotting the measurement of L+S<b>2</b> when the wafer stage <b>32</b> of the reduction projection exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is moved in the optical axis direction under the two exposure amount conditions A and B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">There is a substantially linear relationship between the amount of change in the length of L+S<b>2</b> and the amount of the movement of the wafer <b>31</b> toward the optical axis, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>. Also, the value of the length of L+S<b>2</b> undergoes no real change for the most part in switching the exposure from A to B. On one hand, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, the length of L alone does not change very much in the fixed exposure condition of when the wafer <b>31</b> is moved from the focal point to −200 nm to +200 nm. However, the length of L does show some change when the wafer <b>31</b> is in a fixed position and the exposure is changed from A to B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">As shown above, if the wafer <b>31</b> is exposed with the reduction projection exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> having the reticle <b>5</b> that includes the asymmetrical diffraction grating shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 to 38</figref>, it becomes possible to calculate how much the wafer <b>31</b> has deviated from the focal point in the direction of the optical axis, without depending on the exposure amount. This becomes possible by observing the projection image of the wafer <b>31</b>. Furthermore, detection is even possible in instances where there occurs a change in the exposure amount on a reduction projection exposure device as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">Next, an apparatus for monitoring optical system according to the fourth modification of the embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>. The part of a CPU <b>400</b> that differs with the CPU <b>300</b> of the apparatus for monitoring optical system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is that the CPU <b>400</b> further includes an exposure information extractor <b>314</b>.

An optical information memory <b>435</b> differs from the optical information memory <b>335</b> by further including a line width storage portion <b>321</b>. Other structural aspects are identical to those of the apparatus for monitoring optical system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and so description thereof is omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">Here the exposure information extractor <b>314</b> extracts a line width L of the light shielding band projection images <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, <b>104</b> <i>c</i>, <b>104</b> <i>d</i>, <b>104</b> <i>e</i>, <b>104</b> <i>f </i>at the optimum exposure amount as the optimum line width value of L, from image information of a projection image shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. The line width storage portion <b>321</b> stores the optimum line width value of L extracted by the exposure information extractor <b>314</b>. The line width judgment module <b>305</b> compares the optimum line width value with the actual measured values of the line width of L that is measured at the wafer to be inspected and input by the input device <b>312</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">By disposing the reticle <b>5</b> includes an asymmetrical diffraction grating shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref> on the reduction projection exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and using the apparatus for monitoring optical system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, it becomes possible to inspect for aberration and focal point deviation on the optical system <b>140</b>, and it also becomes possible to inspect for changes in the exposure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">Next, a method for monitoring the optical system so as to inspect the changes in the exposure of the exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> using <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>39</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">(a) In a step S<b>101</b> on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, the wafer <b>31</b> is exposed with the reduction projection exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the reticle <b>5</b> having the test patterns <b>20</b> <i>a </i>through <b>20</b> <i>c </i>at the optimum exposure. After exposing and developing the wafer <b>31</b>, image information of the projection image of the wafer <b>31</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> observed under the SEM, or the AFM is input from the input device <b>312</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> to the projection image information extractor <b>425</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">(b) In a step S<b>152</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, the exposure information extractor <b>314</b> of the projection image information extractor <b>425</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> extracts the line widths of the light shielding band projection images <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, <b>104</b> <i>c</i>, <b>104</b> <i>d</i>, <b>104</b> <i>e</i>, <b>104</b> <i>f </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> as the optimum line width value, from the image information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">(c) In a step S<b>102</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, the optimum line width value extracted in the step S<b>152</b> is stored in the line width storage portion <b>321</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> along with the information of the optical axis intersecting points of the wafer <b>31</b>. In a step S<b>170</b>, the production of semiconductor integrated circuitry begins at the reduction projection exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">(d) In the step S<b>170</b>, after semiconductor integrated circuitry has been produces on several lots, the optimum line width value stored by the line width storage portion <b>321</b> and the actual measured values of the line width input by the input device <b>312</b> are stored away at the line width judgment module <b>305</b> in a step S<b>164</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. The line width judgment module <b>305</b> compares the optimum line width value and the actual measured values of the line width, and calculates the change in the line width. In a step S<b>103</b>, the calibration information provider <b>315</b> transmits the calculated change in the line width to the output device <b>313</b>, thus ending the test.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">As shown above, the reticle <b>5</b> includes asymmetrical diffraction gratings shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>, and is disposed on the reduction projection exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. If the method for monitoring the optical system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, and the apparatus for monitoring optical system shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> are used, it becomes possible to inspect whether or not there occurs a change in the exposure on the reduction projection exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, on a semiconductor integrated circuit production process. For instance, by observing the projection images of an asymmetrical diffraction grating as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> at the beginning and the end of a semiconductor integrated circuit production process, it becomes possible to recognize a decrease in the exposure on the reduction projection exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, if the line width L of the light shielding band projection images <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, <b>104</b> <i>c</i>, <b>104</b> <i>d</i>, <b>104</b> <i>e</i>, <b>104</b> <i>f </i>is observed to have increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">Therefore, it becomes possible to focus in on problems occurring with the reduction projection exposure device's exposure as a countermeasure. It also becomes possible to shorten maintenance-checking time that is used to preserve quality standards. Also, it is possible to establish the asymmetrical diffraction grating according to the fourth modification of the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref> on the same mask substrate as both the device pattern and test pattern, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This makes it unnecessary to exchange from the production reticle to the test reticle that has been employed conventionally as maintenance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">Accordingly, if the production yield rates worsen, the wafer <b>31</b> can be tested right where it is according to the methods shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b>, and <b>43</b>. It becomes possible to clearly verify whether or not aberration is occurring on the optical system <b>140</b> of the reduction projection exposure device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, whether or not the wafer <b>31</b> is disposed in a spot deviating from the focal point, or whether or not the exposure of the optical system <b>140</b> is falling. Further, aside from optical based observation methods that might be used to observe the projection image of the test pattern shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, if the observation is limited to using the SEM, or the AFM, it becomes possible to reduce the size of the test pattern region on the reticle shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>.</div>
