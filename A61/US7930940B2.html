<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to an ultrasonic transducer. More specifically, the present invention relates to an ultrasonic transducer which is a device functioning as a source for projecting an ultrasonic wave to a sample to be examined and functioning as a source for receiving a wave reflected from the sample.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of the Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">An ultrasonic inspection apparatus is known as an apparatus which projects an ultrasonic wave to a sample to be examined, dipped in water, through the water, receives a reflected wave from the sample and detects a defect such as a break away or a flaw in the sample based on a wave form of an echo signal of the reflected wave (for example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open 6-80169),</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an example of a conventional ultrasonic inspection apparatus. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the conventional ultrasonic inspection apparatus <b>100</b> comprises a water bath <b>11</b> filled with water W, a sample to be examined <b>12</b> provided to be dipped in water bath <b>11</b>, an ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b> functioning as a source for projecting an ultrasonic wave to the sample to be examined <b>12</b> and functioning as a source for receiving a reflected wave from the sample <b>12</b>, a transmitter/receiver circuit <b>16</b> sending a drive pulse to the ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b> and amplifying an echo signal received, an electric connecting cord <b>17</b> for electrically connecting between the ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b> and the transmitter/receiver circuit <b>16</b>, a scanning device <b>13</b> for moving the ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b> in horizontal and vertical directions, a power source <b>14</b> for supplying power to the respective parts, and a determination device <b>15</b> for determining existence of defect in the sample <b>12</b> based on the wave form of the echo signal outputted from the transmitter/receiver circuit <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The ultrasonic wave projected from ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b> has a high-frequency component of from about 10 MHz to about 200 MHz. Further, the electric signal outputted from ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b> after receiving the reflected wave is a signal having a very low voltage of about several mV.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In such a conventional apparatus, the length of the electric connecting cord <b>17</b> for electrically connecting between the ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b> and the transmitter/receiver circuit <b>16</b> was several-tens cm at shortest, and in a case of a long cord, it was several meters. If the electric connecting cord <b>17</b> is thus long, when a drive pulse is sent from the transmitter/receiver circuit <b>16</b> to the ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b>, there is a case where the drive pulse is attenuated and weakened. Similarly, when an echo signal is sent from the ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b> to the transmitter/receiver circuit <b>16</b>, there is a case where the high-frequency component of the echo signal is attenuated and weakened. As a result, there occurs a problem that the examination accuracy may deteriorate. Recently, miniaturization of electronic parts is proceeded, and when such electronic parts are employed as the samples to be examined <b>12</b>, it is an important subject to be able to detect very fine defects. Therefore, it is important to be able to send and receive high-frequency wave components having a high resolution without weakening.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an ultrasonic transducer incorporated into an ultrasonic inspection apparatus, which can detect a defect at an excellent examination accuracy even for a small sample to be examined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">To achieve the foregoing and other objects, an ultrasonic transducer according to the present invention is incorporated into and used for an ultrasonic inspection apparatus, which projects an ultrasonic wave to a sample to be examined, dipped in water, through the water, receives a reflected wave from the sample and detects a defect such as a break away or a flaw in the sample based on a wave form of an echo signal of the reflected wave. The ultrasonic transducer comprises a transducer main part having an oscillator which emits the ultrasonic wave in accordance with a drive pulse, receives the reflected wave from the sample and outputs the received reflected wave as the echo signal; a transmitter substrate provided for producing the drive pulse which gives an energy for emitting the ultrasonic wave to the oscillator in the transducer main part; a receiver substrate provided for amplifying the echo signal received by the oscillator in the transducer main part; a housing formed as a cylindrical shape for containing a transmitter/receiver circuit substrate assembly (assembly of circuit substrates for sending and receiving wave signals) which is formed by electrically connecting the transmitter substrate and the receiver substrate at a form confronted with each other and at a condition free to be attached and detached; and connecting means for electrically connecting between a signal input/output terminal means, provided on the transmitter substrate and functioning as an output terminal for outputting the drive pulse to the oscillator as well as functioning as an input terminal for inputting the echo signal outputted from the oscillator, and the oscillator in the transducer main part. In this ultrasonic transducer, when a maximum operational frequency of the ultrasonic wave emitted from the oscillator is referred to as fmax [MHz], the connecting means is set at a length of 100/fmax [cm] or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In the above-described ultrasonic transducer, the transducer main part and the transmitter/receiver circuit substrate assembly may be integrated with each other. Further, the signal input/output terminal means and the oscillator may be electrically connected via a solder. Alternatively, the signal input/output terminal means and the oscillator may be electrically connected via a lead wire. Moreover, the signal input/output terminal means and the oscillator may be electrically connected via a connector which is free to be connected and disconnected. This connector can be employed even in a case using the above-described solder or lead wire. Further, the signal input/output terminal means and the oscillator may be electrically connected via a matched circuit substrate. Furthermore, because the transmitter substrate and the receiver substrate are disposed in the housing at a relatively close condition, in order to prevent the receiver substrate from picking up a noise, an electromagnetic wave shielding means may be interposed between the transmitter substrate and the receiver substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In the present invention, the oscillator provided in the transducer main part and the signal input/output terminal means provided on the transmitter/receiver circuit substrate assembly are electrically connected to each other by the connecting means. This connecting means is formed at a length of 100/fmax [cm] or less when the maximum operational frequency of the ultrasonic wave emitted from the oscillator is referred to as fmax [MHz].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">The reason will be explained why the upper limit of the length of the connecting means is set at 100/fmax [cm] as described above. Because the impedance of the connecting means becomes greater as the operational frequency of the ultrasonic wave is higher, in order to prevent weakening of signal, the upper limit length of the connecting means must be a length inversely proportional to the maximum operational frequency. The reason why 100/fmax [cm] is adequate is based on the actually determined data (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the frequency property in the embodiment described later. In the present invention, when the maximum operational frequency is relatively high, for example, such as 200 MHz, it is necessary to set the upper limit of the length of the connecting means at 100/200=0.5 [cm]. On the contrary, when the maximum operational frequency is relatively low, for example, such as 50 MHz, the upper limit of the length of the connecting means may be set at 100/50=4 [cm].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In the present invention, because the length of the connecting means is set at the upper limit, adequately decided in accordance with the maximum operational frequency, or less, when the drive pulse is sent from the signal input/output terminal means to the transducer main part, very rarely occurs a case where the drive pulse is attenuated and weakened. Similarly, when the echo signal is sent from the transducer main part to the signal input/output terminal means, very rarely occurs a case where the high-frequency component of the echo signal is attenuated and weakened. Consequently, even in a case where the sample to be examined is small, the defect examination can be carried out at an excellent examination accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Thus, in the ultrasonic transducer according to the present invention, even when a sample to be examined is small, a defect in the sample can be detected at an excellent examination accuracy.</div>

By this drive pulse S<b>2</b>, oscillator <b>24</b> emits ultrasonic wave S<b>5</b> having a frequency component decided by the electrical and mechanical design of transducer main part <b>2</b>. The frequency of this ultrasonic wave S<b>5</b> is set, for example, at a value in a range of about 10 MHz to about 200 MHz. In this embodiment, because the frequency band of a used sensor is from 20 MHz to 80 MHz, 90 MHz is set as the upper limit of the frequency. Of course, it is possible to set the upper limit at a value more than 200 MHz. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, ultrasonic wave S<b>5</b> emitted from oscillator <b>24</b> is propagated in water, and after time t<b>1</b>, it reaches the surface of sample to be examined <b>12</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The vibration of oscillator <b>24</b> is transformed into an electric signal, and it is taken into transmitter substrate <b>51</b> as echo signal S<b>3</b> and then taken into receiver substrate <b>52</b> via connector <b>58</b>.

Therefore, the upper limit of the length of solder <b>53</b> <i>a</i>, <b>53</b> <i>b </i>becomes 100/90=1.1 [cm]. Because the length of the connecting means is set at a length of the upper limit adequately determined in accordance with the maximum operational frequency or less, when drive pulse S<b>2</b> is sent from signal input/output terminal <b>51</b> <i>a</i>, <b>51</b> <i>b </i>to transducer main part <b>2</b>, the drive pulse S<b>2</b> is suppressed to be attenuated and weakened. Similarly, when echo signal S<b>3</b> is sent from transducer main part <b>2</b> to signal input/output terminal <b>51</b> <i>a</i>, <b>51</b> <i>b</i>, the echo signal is suppressed to be attenuated and weakened. As a result, even in a case of a small sample to be examined <b>12</b>, a desirable defect examination can be achieved at an excellent examination accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Such an excellent effect according to the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> more concretely. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the comparison in frequency property between a case using the ultrasonic transducer according to the present invention and a case using a conventional ultrasonic transducer such as one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the solid line G<b>1</b> shows a frequency property of the case using the ultrasonic transducer <b>1</b> according to the present invention, and the dotted line G<b>2</b> shows a frequency property of the case using the conventional ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b>. The solid line G<b>1</b> is higher in gain than the dotted line G<b>2</b> in the range of 90 MHz or less, and this represents an advantage according to the present invention. Where, the length of lead wire <b>17</b> used for the electrical connection between the conventional ultrasonic transducer <b>50</b> and the transmitter/receiver circuit <b>16</b> was set at 1 m.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In the above-described embodiment, although solders <b>53</b> <i>a </i>and <b>53</b> <i>b </i>are employed for the electrical connection between signal input/output terminal <b>51</b> <i>a </i>for transmitter substrate <b>51</b> and anode <b>21</b> in transducer main part <b>2</b> and the electrical connection between signal input/output terminal <b>51</b> <i>b </i>for transmitter substrate <b>51</b> and a part of copper foil <b>26</b> positioned at the side opposite to cathode <b>25</b>, instead of solders <b>53</b> <i>a </i>and <b>53</b> <i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, lead wires <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b </i>each having a length of 1.1 [cm] or less may be employed (a second embodiment). Even in this case, an advantage similar to that in the above-described first embodiment can be expected. Where, as the electrically connecting means, instead of solders <b>53</b> <i>a </i>and <b>53</b> <i>b </i>and lead wires <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b</i>, for example, means by thermocompression bonding, conductive paste or sputtering.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, connector <b>55</b> may be interposed at respective intermediate positions of solders <b>53</b> <i>a </i>and <b>53</b> <i>b </i>(a third embodiment). Similarly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, connector <b>55</b> may be interposed at respective intermediate positions of lead wires <b>54</b> <i>a </i>and <b>54</b> <i>b </i>(a fourth embodiment). In these cases, it is preferred that another resin mold <b>8</b>′ capable of being separated from resin mold <b>8</b> is formed around connector <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> at the side of transducer main part <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Further, in the present invention, because transmitter substrate <b>51</b> and receiver substrate <b>52</b> are provided in housing <b>4</b> so as to confront each other, the housing <b>4</b> can be made small. Furthermore, because transmitter substrate <b>51</b> and receiver substrate <b>52</b> are connected to each other by connector <b>58</b> at a condition free to be attached and detached, by using connector <b>55</b> or <b>56</b> as shown in the third and fourth embodiments, it is possible to separate transmitter substrate <b>51</b> and receiver substrate <b>52</b> as respective individual parts. Therefore, an excellent maintenance property can be realized, and an additional function may be easily added particularly in a technology development stage as needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Further, in the present invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> as a fifth embodiment, the electrical connection between signal input/output terminals <b>51</b> <i>a</i>, <b>51</b> <i>b </i>and oscillator <b>24</b> may be carried out via a matched circuit substrate <b>57</b>. By using such a matched circuit substrate <b>57</b>, electric signals between signal input/output terminals <b>51</b> <i>a</i>, <b>51</b> <i>b </i>and oscillator <b>24</b> may be well matched for exhibiting the desirable function of ultrasonic transducer <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Furthermore, because transmitter substrate <b>51</b> and receiver substrate <b>52</b> are disposed in housing <b>4</b> at a relatively close condition, there may be a fear that the receiver substrate <b>52</b> is affected by the electromagnetic wave from the transmitter substrate <b>51</b> and the affection becomes a noise in the receiver substrate <b>52</b>. In order to prevent such an affection, it is preferred that an electromagnetic wave shielding means is interposed between transmitter substrate <b>51</b> and receiver substrate <b>52</b>. Concretely, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> as a sixth embodiment of the present invention, a shield case <b>61</b> <i>a </i>is preferably interposed between transmitter substrate <b>51</b> and receiver substrate <b>52</b>, and more preferably, a shield case <b>61</b> <i>b </i>is provided at the outer surface side of the receiver substrate <b>52</b>, so that the receiver substrate <b>52</b> can be covered with shield cases <b>61</b> <i>a </i>and <b>61</b> <i>b</i>. Each of these shield cases <b>61</b> <i>a </i>and <b>61</b> <i>b </i>is preferably made from a shield material formed by covering an iron base material with another metal layer having a high surface conductivity such as a plating layer of tin. By shield cases <b>61</b> <i>a </i>and <b>61</b> <i>b </i>thus constructed, electric wave and magnetic wave forming an electromagnetic wave can be both shielded. Because the electromagnetic wave is shielded for receiver substrate <b>52</b>, the signal grant may be reinforced.</div>
