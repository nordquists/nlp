<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a sheet conveying apparatus; an image scanning apparatus such as a copier, a facsimile machine, a printer, a printing machine, an inkjet recording device, and a scanner provided with the sheet conveying apparatus; or an image forming apparatus such as a multifunction peripheral combining functions of at least two of the above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Conventionally, in order to reduce the overall sizes of image forming apparatuses including copiers such as a PPC (plain paper copier) and an electrophotographic copier, facsimile machines, printers such as a laser beam printer, printing machines, and inkjet recording devices, the sizes of conveying units provided therein also tend to be reduced. Specifically, the conveying unit is used for conveying a medium or a sheet-type recording medium onto which an image is formed (hereinafter, “sheet”). The sheet is conveyed from a sheet storing unit or a sheet stacking unit where sheets are stacked to a main unit of an image forming unit (hereinafter, “image forming unit main unit”). In the following, the sheet storing unit is described as a representative example of a unit for storing sheets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Furthermore, the image forming apparatuses typically accommodate various sheet sizes and sheet types. For example, sheets of different sheet sizes and different sheet types are previously stored in plural sheet storing units. A sheet is fed from the sheet storing unit selected by a user or automatically selected by the image forming apparatus. In such a configuration, the sheet storing units occupy a large space in the image forming apparatus, and therefore, it is particularly necessary to reduce the size of the conveying unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">One approach is to have a conveying path between the sheet storing unit and the image forming unit main unit that considerably changes its direction midway (bends) depending on the positional relationship between the two units, so as to reduce the space occupied by the conveying path. Thus, in order to change the conveying direction in a continuous and smooth manner in the conveying path, the conveying path is provided with a curvature section having a curved shape. The curvature section is made to have a relatively small curvature radius so that a regular-sized recording sheet normally used in the image forming apparatus can be conveyed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">An example of a conventional sheet conveying apparatus in an image forming apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-338923 (Patent Document 1). As shown in FIGS. 6, 7 of Patent Document 1, sheet feeding trays acting as sheet storing units are arranged beneath the image forming unit main unit. Predetermined numbers of sheets of predetermined sheet sizes and sheet types are stacked in the sheet feeding trays. In between the sheet feeding trays and the image forming unit main unit is provided a sheet conveying apparatus for extracting a sheet of paper in a substantially horizontal direction from the selected sheet feeding tray and feeding the extracted sheet in an upward direction toward the image forming unit main unit arranged above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In the following description, reference numerals shown in the figures of Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-338923 are indicated in parentheses. A sheet (P) in a sheet feeding tray (1) is separated from the stack of sheets by the conventional FRR (Feed Reverse Roller) separating method, and is sent to an image forming unit main unit through a conveying path provided with a curvature section formed with an upper guide plate (8) and a lower guide plate (7). The curvature section acts as a “curve fix guiding member” including the upper guide plate (8) and the lower guide plate (7). When the sheet passes through the curvature section, the sheet is first conveyed along the lower guide plate (7). As the sheet is conveyed further on, the sheet is pressed from above by the upper guide plate (8). The sheet (P) is conveyed by an elastically deformable guide piece (6) positioned at the outlet end of the lower guide plate (7) and reaches a pair of conveying rollers (5). Hereinafter, the upper guide plate (8) and the lower guide plate (7) are referred to as the “curve fix guiding member”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">However, in the sheet conveying apparatus with the above configuration, the following problem arises when conveying a special type of sheet (P) with high rigidity, such as a cardboard recording paper or an envelope. That is, when the sheet (P) bends and moves along the curvature, such a highly rigid recording paper or special paper receives a much larger resistance compared to a regular sheet such as a plain paper sheet used for copying. This is because the curvature section in the conveying path has a small radius. As a result, the highly rigid sheet (P) cannot move along the conveying path, causing a paper jam failure or a conveyance failure. Thus, the sheet feeding operation cannot be steadily performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Further details of the above operation are described as follows. When the leading edge of the sheet (P) in the sheet conveying direction reaches the curve fix guiding member configured with the upper guide plate (8) and the lower guide plate (7), the front half the sheet (P) including the leading edge curves (bends) in its thickness direction. Accordingly, when a highly rigid sheet (P) is conveyed, a large force resists this bending action, in such a manner that a large resistance obstructs the sheet conveyance. As a result, the leading edge of the highly rigid sheet (P) may not reach the pair of conveying rollers (5) at the downstream side so that the sheet (P) is conveyed only by a pair of rollers (2<i>a, </i>2<i>b</i>) on the upstream side. However, when the sheet (P) is bent by the curve fix guiding member, the conveying force of the pair of rollers (2<i>a, </i>2<i>b</i>) alone is insufficient for conveying the highly rigid sheet (P) to counter to the resistance caused by the bending action. As a result, the following conveyance failures may be caused. Specifically, the sheet (P) is caused to move in an oblique manner because the center line of the highly rigid sheet (P) does not match the center line of the conveying path, or a paper jam occurs because the highly rigid sheet (P) becomes caught inside the curve fix guiding member and stops moving.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Accordingly, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-338923 also discloses the following sheet feeding device. A sheet is sent out from a first conveying member and conveyed to a second conveying member arranged at a position downstream in the conveying direction and substantially perpendicularly above the first conveying member. A pair of linear guiding members is provided between the first conveying member and the second conveying member, and the sheet is conveyed by being guided by these linear guiding members. In this sheet feeding device, the guiding members do not have curved shapes but have linear shapes, and therefore, the conveyance load can be maintained at a low level. That is, the load can be prevented from rising abruptly so that conveyance failures such as a paper jam or oblique movements can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">That is, according to the above described sheet feeding device, the conveyed sheet is not caused to deform (bend) only at one position, but is caused to deform at two positions, i.e., near the front and the back ends of the linear guiding members in the conveying direction. Furthermore, the linear guiding members are arranged in oblique manners at substantially intermediate angles, so that the sheet bends by the same amount at the aforementioned two positions. Therefore, the conveyance load is prevented from rising abruptly. Specifically, the sheet changes its traveling direction by bending at the two positions, namely, when the sheet is passed from the pair of rollers located at the upstream side to the linear guiding member, and when the sheet is passed from the linear guiding member to the pair of rollers located at the downstream side. Thus, the sheet bends by smaller extents at these two positions compared to abruptly bending at one position. Thus, the resistance caused by the bending action of the sheet can be reduced at each of the two positions, thus preventing the conveyance load from rising abruptly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Another type of sheet feeding device with a first conveying member and a second conveying member having substantially the same configurations as those of Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-338923 (Patent Document 1) is described as follows. This type includes a reverse guiding member provided in an inclined manner between the first conveying member and the second conveying member. This reverse guiding member is configured to move toward the second conveying member (see, for example, Patent Document 2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In this sheet feeding device, when the trailing edge of the sheet contacts the reverse guiding member, the reverse guiding member shifts its position in a direction substantially according to the trailing edge of the sheet. This shift makes it possible to absorb the shock caused when the trailing edge of the sheet contacts the reverse guiding member. Hence, a flipping noise can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Yet another type of sheet feeding device has been disclosed. This sheet feeding device includes plural sheet storing units for storing sheets, and each of the sheet storing units is provided with a conveying path and a sheet conveying unit. The ends of the conveying paths merge into a common conveying path. Each of the conveying paths has a curvature section at the end thereof where it merges with the common conveying path. At least one of the conveying paths provided for a sheet storing unit storing highly rigid sheets has a first curvature section with a larger curvature radius than those of the other conveying paths (see, for example, Patent Document 3).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Therefore, in this sheet feeding device, highly rigid sheets are caused to bend more moderately compared to plain paper sheets. A highly rigid sheet moves along the conveying path and passes through the first curvature section having a large curvature radius, so that it does not bend as much as a plain paper sheet passing through a curvature section having a smaller curvature radius. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the resistance while conveying a highly rigid sheet, so that the sheet is conveyed to the common conveying path without being suspended or stopped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">The following is a description of a sheet reversing unit provided in an image forming apparatus. This sheet reversing unit includes a pair of reverse rollers and a reverse conveying path for conveying/guiding a sheet received from the pair of reverse rollers. The reverse conveying path includes a direction changing section for changing the direction of conveying a sheet. Rotatable rollers are arranged inside the direction changing section in a direction orthogonal to the sheet conveying direction, so that a sheet sent into the reverse conveying path can be sent out while being in abutment with the rollers (see, for example, Patent Document 4).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">According to this sheet reversing unit, when a sheet is sent inside, it is ensured that the portion of the sheet inside of the direction changing section contacts the rollers, and the rollers are caused to rotate by (rotate following) the movement of the sheet in the conveying direction. Thus, compared to a conventional guiding plate, the conveying resistance can be reduced. Specifically, it is possible to eliminate frictional resistance occurring between a fixed guiding member and the moving sheet while changing the conveying direction of the sheet at the direction changing section.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0019">Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-338923 (pp. 1-3, FIGS. 1-7)</li> <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0020">Patent Document 2: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2005-89008 (pp. 2-3, FIGS. 4, 5)</li> <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0021">Patent Document 3: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. H10-129883 (pp. 1-2, FIG. 1)</li> <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0022">Patent Document 4: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2005-1771 (pp. 1-2, FIG. 1)</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">However, the sheet conveying apparatus disclosed in Patent Document 1 merely provides a fixed member for guiding a conveyed sheet, and thus does not eliminate the speed difference between the conveyed sheet, which is a mobile object, and the fixed guiding member. Accordingly, regardless of the shape or position of the guiding member, resistance occurs in such a direction to obstruct the sheet from being conveyed, resulting in a conveyance load.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">That is, this conventional configuration is insufficient for preventing conveyance failures or paper jams. Although the linear guiding member can reduce the conveyance load from rising abruptly, a conveyance load is generated nonetheless. Particularly when conveying a highly rigid sheet, such as a cardboard recording paper or an envelope, conveyance failures and paper jams frequently occur and flipping noises made by the trailing edge of the sheet become considerably large.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Furthermore, as described in Patent Document 2, the reverse guiding member can shift its position in a direction according to the trailing edge of the sheet contacting the reverse guiding member; however, the reverse guiding member merely functions as a fixed guide member in terms of changing the direction of the sheet. Accordingly, similar to the above, this conventional technology does not eliminate the relative speed difference between the sheet and the reverse guiding member when changing the direction of/guiding the sheet, thus generating a conveyance load. Particularly when conveying a highly rigid sheet, such as a cardboard recording paper or an envelope, conveyance failures and paper jams frequently occur and flipping noises made by the trailing edge of the sheet become considerably large.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Furthermore, as described in Patent Document 3, the conveying path with a large curvature radius dedicated for highly rigid sheets makes it possible for sheets traveling therethrough to bend moderately so as to reduce the conveyance resistance applied from the conveying path on the sheet. However, a conveyance load is somewhat generated nonetheless. Particularly when conveying a highly rigid sheet, such as a cardboard recording paper or an envelope, conveyance failures and paper jams frequently occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Furthermore, as described in Patent Document 4, movable members such as rollers are provided at predetermined positions inside the direction changing section of the conveying path. Therefore, in the process of conveying the sheet, the frictional resistance between the sheet and the guiding member can be effectively reduced while the internal rollers are supporting the middle portion of the sheet between the leading edge and the trailing edge. However, there are no measures provided for reducing the conveyance load before and after the sheet is supported by the internal rollers, i.e., when the sheet is in contact with the conveying path outside the direction changing section. Furthermore, nothing is particularly mentioned about behaviors of the leading edge and the trailing edge of the sheet while being conveyed. Particularly when conveying a highly rigid sheet, such as a cardboard recording paper or an envelope, conveyance failures and paper jams frequently occur and flipping noises made by the trailing edge of the sheet become considerably large.</div>

<heading>First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> illustrate a first embodiment of a sheet conveying apparatus to which the present invention is applied and an image forming apparatus including the same. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an overall configuration of a copier <b>1</b> as an example of an image forming apparatus according to an embodiment to which the present invention is applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">The copier <b>1</b> is a monochrome copier that scans an image from a face of an original and forms a copied image onto various sheet-type recording media (hereinafter, “sheet”) such as recording paper, transfer paper, paper sheets, and OHP transparencies. The copier <b>1</b> includes an image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b>, a sheet feeding device <b>3</b> on which the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b> is mounted, and an original scanning device <b>4</b> attached on the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b>. The image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b> includes an image forming section for performing a predetermined image forming process based on a scanned original image. The sheet feeding device <b>3</b> supplies one sheet S at a time to the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b>. The original scanning device <b>4</b> scans an original image and sends the original image information to the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">A sheet eject tray <b>9</b> is provided at the upper portion of the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b>, forming a space beneath the original scanning device <b>4</b>. Sheets that have passed through the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b> are ejected to and stacked on the sheet eject tray <b>9</b>. A sheet conveying path R<b>1</b> (hereinafter, also referred to as “conveying path R<b>1</b>”) extends from the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> to the sheet eject tray <b>9</b>. A large proportion of the conveying path R<b>1</b> extends between the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> and the upper portion of the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b> in a substantially vertical direction with respect to a substantially horizontal direction. Sheet conveying units including pairs of conveying rollers and pairs of subordinate rollers are provided along the conveying path R<b>1</b> with predetermined intervals therebetween determined according to the smallest sheet S size. Some of these sheet conveying units are configured to hold (sandwich) the sheet S to ensure that the sheet S continues to be conveyed along the conveying path R<b>1</b>. Furthermore, the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> includes a sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> for feeding/conveying the sheets S stored in paper trays of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">Inside the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b>, a photoconductor unit <b>10</b> and a fixing device <b>11</b>, acting as the image forming section for forming images, are arranged in this order from the upstream side toward the downstream side of the conveying path R<b>1</b>. As the sheet S is conveyed from the upstream side toward the downstream side of the conveying path R<b>1</b>, the photoconductor unit <b>10</b> transfers a toner image that it has generated onto the sheet S and the fixing device <b>11</b> fixes the transferred toner image onto the sheet S. The sheet S on which the toner image is fixed is ejected onto the eject tray <b>9</b> arranged at the end of the conveying path R<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">The photoconductor unit <b>10</b> includes a single drum-type photoconductor <b>10</b>A acting as an image carrier. The photoconductor <b>10</b>A is supported by a not shown side panel inside the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b> so as to rotate around a substantially horizontal axis. The photoconductor <b>10</b>A has a cylindrical shape of a predetermined diameter and a generally known configuration. The photoconductor <b>10</b>A receives a rotational driving force from a driving source such as a motor provided on one end of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A, either on the photoconductor unit <b>10</b> side or on the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b>. Accordingly, the photoconductor <b>10</b>A rotates in a direction indicated by an arrow shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at a steady, constant speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">Around the photoconductor <b>10</b>A, elements are arranged in the following order in the direction indicated by the arrow: a developing device <b>12</b>, a transfer device <b>13</b>, a photoconductor cleaning device <b>18</b>, a discharge device, and a charging device <b>14</b>. Within a range corresponding to one rotation of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A in the anticlockwise direction, there are a developing position, a transferring position, a cleaning position, a discharging position, and a charging position from upstream to downstream positions for each of the above-described devices <b>12</b>-<b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">Between the charging position and the developing position, there is a latent image forming position. An exposing device <b>47</b> is provided at a position somewhat spaced apart from and diagonally downward from the photoconductor <b>10</b>A. At the latent image forming position, the exposing device <b>47</b> irradiates a predetermined laser beam onto the photoconductor <b>10</b>A to form an invisible latent image thereon according to image information. In synchronization with the rotation of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A in the anticlockwise direction, the above-described devices <b>12</b>-<b>14</b> and the exposing device <b>47</b> perform interlinked operations so as to execute a sequence of an image forming process in cooperation with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">The developing device <b>12</b> has an appropriate, generally known configuration including a developing roller for generating a toner brush by causing toner particles to stand erect on the surface of the developing device <b>12</b> in a radial direction. The developing device <b>12</b> causes the toner particles at the tips of the toner brush to adhere onto the latent image formed on a predetermined position on the surface of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A, as the latent image moves in a circumferential direction of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A and passes through the developing position in accordance with the rotation of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A. Accordingly, the invisible latent image is turned into a visible, monochrome toner image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">The transfer device <b>13</b> includes two support rollers <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> spaced apart from each other in a substantially vertical direction and a transfer belt <b>17</b>, which is an endless belt stretched around the support rollers <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. The transfer device <b>13</b> transfers the toner image from the circumferential surface of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A onto the sheet S, and conveys the sheet S onto which an unfixed toner image is transferred to the downstream side of the conveying path R<b>1</b>. Specifically, a portion of the lower support roller <b>16</b> where the transfer belt <b>17</b> is stretched around is pressed against a substantially diagonally downward right portion of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A, and the transferring position corresponds to where the surface of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A and the transfer belt <b>17</b> contact each other. The upper support roller <b>15</b> is arranged in front of the inlet of the fixing device <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">The photoconductor cleaning device <b>18</b> includes either one or both of a not shown blade member and a rotating brush. The blade member has a blade edge at the tip thereof that abuts against the cleaning position on the photoconductor <b>10</b>A while maintaining a predetermined pressure level. The rotating brush contacts the cleaning position and is caused to rotate following the rotation of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A. The photoconductor cleaning device <b>18</b> removes toner or foreign matter remaining on the surface of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A after the transfer operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">The discharge device is primarily configured with a lamp that can emit a light beam of a predetermined light intensity. This lamp irradiates a light beam used for the discharging onto the discharging position to neutralize the charged surface of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A passing by the discharging position. Accordingly, the discharge device initializes the surface potential of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A that had passed by the transferring position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">The fixing device <b>11</b> includes a heating roller <b>31</b> with a built-in electrothermal heater acting as a heat source and a pressuring roller <b>32</b> facing and pressed against the heating roller <b>31</b> in a substantially horizontal direction. When the heating roller <b>31</b> is rotated by a not shown driving source such as a motor, the pressuring roller <b>32</b> in contact with the heating roller <b>31</b> is caused to rotate following the rotation of the heating roller <b>31</b>. At the same time, the portion where the heating roller <b>31</b> and the pressuring roller <b>32</b> contact each other is made to have a predetermined heating temperature and predetermined pressure so as to function as a nip section for fixing the toner image onto the sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <b>20</b> denotes a toner storing container, which is a toner bottle storing unused/new toner. A not shown toner conveying path extends from the toner storing container <b>20</b> to the developing device <b>12</b>. When the developing device <b>12</b> has consumed the toner provided therein and there is a toner shortage, the new replenishment toner is supplied from the toner storing container <b>20</b> into the developing device <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">The sheet feeding device <b>3</b> is provided beneath the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b>, so that the sheet size can be chosen automatically or according to a user's manual input. The sheet feeding device <b>3</b> includes plural sheet feeding trays <b>51</b> acting as sheet storing units arranged therein in multiple stages. Each of the sheet feeding trays <b>51</b> can be individually pulled outside of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> so as to be replenished with an appropriate number of sheets corresponding to that individual sheet feeding tray <b>51</b>. Different types of sheets S that are of various sheet sizes and oriented in vertical/horizontal directions with respect to the sheet conveying direction are stacked/stored in the sheet feeding trays <b>51</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">The original scanning device <b>4</b> includes a scanning device main unit <b>4</b>A acting as a framework of the original scanning device <b>4</b>. On top of the scanning device main unit <b>4</b>A, an exposure glass <b>57</b> is arranged across a predetermined range. A scanning unit is housed inside the scanning device main unit <b>4</b>A for optically scanning an original image by scanning the predetermined range of the exposure glass <b>57</b>. The scanning unit primarily includes at least a first traveling body <b>53</b>, a second traveling body <b>54</b>, an imaging lens <b>55</b>, and a scanning sensor <b>56</b> such as a CCD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">The original scanning device <b>4</b> includes a platen cover <b>58</b> configured to open and close between a closed position covering the exposure glass <b>57</b> and an open position. The platen cover <b>58</b> is arranged on the top surface of the scanning device main unit <b>4</b>A. The platen cover <b>58</b> has larger length/width sizes than those of the exposure glass <b>57</b>, and one side thereof is fixed to the top surface of the scanning device main unit <b>4</b>A so as to freely open/close.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">On the basis of the above configuration, operations of the copier <b>1</b> are described below. First, in order to make a copy of an original with the copier <b>1</b>, the user manually opens the platen cover <b>58</b> of the original scanning device <b>4</b> from the closed position to the open position, places/sets the original on the exposure glass <b>57</b>, and then manually brings the platen cover <b>58</b> to the closed position, so that the platen cover <b>58</b> presses the original set on the exposure glass from above. Accordingly, the original spreads out in a planar manner in close contact with the exposure glass <b>57</b> so that the original face can be scanned accurately, and the original is fixed on the exposure glass <b>57</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">As the user presses a start key of a not shown operation panel section initially provided in the copier <b>1</b>, a scanning operation of the original scanning device <b>4</b> immediately starts, and a not shown driving mechanism causes the first traveling body <b>53</b> and the second traveling body <b>54</b> to travel. A light beam from a light source of the first traveling body <b>53</b> is irradiated toward the original; the light beam is reflected from the original face and is directed toward the second traveling body <b>54</b>; the light beam is then reflected by a mirror of the second traveling body <b>54</b>; and the light beam enters the scanning sensor <b>56</b> via the imaging lens <b>55</b>. As a result, the image of the original is photoelectrically converted and scanned by the scanning sensor <b>56</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">When the start key is pressed, the photoconductor <b>10</b>A of the photoconductor unit <b>10</b> starts rotating and an operation starts for forming a toner image on the photoconductor <b>10</b>A based on the scanned original image. Specifically, as the photoconductor <b>10</b>A rotates, a predetermined position on the circumferential surface of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A sequentially passes by the respective positions between the charging device <b>14</b>, the exposing device <b>47</b>, the developing device <b>12</b>, the transfer device <b>13</b>, the photoconductor cleaning device <b>18</b>, and the discharge device. Accordingly, the predetermined position on the photoconductor <b>10</b>A is charged to a predetermined charged status, a latent image is generated thereon, the latent image is turned into a visible toner image, the toner image is transferred onto the sheet S, residual toner is removed from the photoconductor <b>10</b>A, and the charged status is cancelled, thus completing one cycle of operations in the above order. This cycle is continued until the toner image is created in an area of a predetermined size on the circumferential surface of the photoconductor <b>10</b>A in the rotational direction, according to the size of the image to be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">When the start key is pressed, one sheet S is extracted from the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b> in the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> corresponding to the sheet feeding stage storing the type of sheet S selected automatically or manually, and the extracted sheet S is conveyed to the conveying path R<b>1</b> via a predetermined sheet conveying path by the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> attached to the corresponding sheet feeding stage. This sheet S is conveyed in a substantially vertically upward direction through the sheet conveying path R<b>1</b> in the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b> by conveying rollers, and is temporarily stopped when the leading edge of the sheet S abuts against a pair of resist rollers <b>21</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">In a case where manual sheet feeding is performed, the sheet S is set on a bypass tray <b>67</b>, and is rolled out by the rotation of a sheet feeding roller <b>67</b>A provided for the bypass tray <b>67</b>. When plural sheets S are stacked/set on the bypass tray <b>67</b>, separating rollers <b>67</b>B, <b>67</b>C separate the sheets S one by one. The sheet is conveyed to a bypass sheet feeding path R<b>2</b>, conveyed from the bypass sheet feeding path R<b>2</b> to the conveying path R<b>1</b>, and is temporarily stopped when the leading edge of the sheet S abuts against the pair of resist rollers <b>21</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">The pair of resist rollers <b>21</b> starts rotating at an accurate timing in synchronization with the relative movement of the toner image on the rotating photoconductor <b>10</b>A so as to send the sheet S, that has been temporarily stopped, into the transferring position. As a result, the toner image is transferred onto the sheet S by the transfer device <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">The sheet S, onto which an unfixed monochrome toner image is transferred, is then conveyed to the fixing device <b>11</b> by the transfer belt <b>17</b> of the transfer device <b>13</b> acting as part of the conveying path R<b>1</b>. The sheet S passes through the nip section of the fixing device <b>11</b>. The nip section applies predetermined heat and pressure onto the sheet S so that the image is fixed on the sheet S. The sheet S with the fixed image is guided by a switching claw <b>34</b> to the conveying path R<b>1</b> extending to the sheet eject tray <b>9</b>, ejected onto the sheet eject tray <b>9</b> by eject rollers <b>35</b>-<b>38</b>, and is stacked on the sheet eject tray <b>9</b>. The user can retrieve the sheet S stacked on the sheet eject tray <b>9</b> through an opening, which is between the sheet eject tray <b>9</b> and the original scanning device <b>4</b> facing the front of the apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">When a double-sided copy mode is selected by user input, the sheet S with an image fixed on one side thereof is guided by the switching claw <b>34</b> to be conveyed toward a sheet reversing device <b>42</b>. Plural rollers <b>66</b> and not shown guiding members arranged inside the sheet reversing device <b>42</b> convey the sheet S back and forth along a reverse conveying path R<b>3</b> to reverse the sides of the sheet S. Then, the sheet S is conveyed from a position in front of the photoconductor unit <b>10</b> back to the sheet conveying path R<b>1</b> through the pair of resist rollers <b>21</b>. The sheet S is conveyed upward along the conveying path R<b>1</b> and guided to the transferring position once again, where an image is transferred and fixed this time onto the backside of the sheet S. Finally, the sheet S is ejected onto the sheet eject tray <b>9</b> by the eject rollers <b>35</b>-<b>38</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">A description is given of features of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> according to the first embodiment to which the present invention is applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> extracts one sheet S from the stack of sheets S stacked/stored in the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b> of a predetermined stage (in this example, the lower stage) in the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, changes the sheet conveying direction of the extracted sheet S, and conveys the sheet S substantially vertically upward to the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">The sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> primarily includes a first conveying unit <b>6</b> for conveying the sheet S, a second conveying unit <b>7</b> arranged on a downstream side of the first conveying unit <b>6</b> in the sheet conveying direction for conveying the sheet S received from the first conveying unit <b>6</b> in a sheet conveying direction different from that of the first conveying unit <b>6</b>, and a first conveying path A formed between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">In the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>, both the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b> act as a holding/conveying unit to hold and convey the sheet S with a pair of rotating conveying members. Specifically, the first conveying unit <b>6</b> includes two rotating conveying members arranged facing each other, namely a feed roller <b>61</b> and a reverse roller <b>62</b>, and acts as a first pair of rotating conveying members. The second conveying unit <b>7</b> includes two rotating conveying members arranged facing each other, namely a grip roller <b>81</b> and a conveyor belt <b>82</b> stretched around a roller-type pulley <b>83</b> and a roller-type pulley <b>84</b>, and acts as a second pair of rotating conveying members. One member of the second pair of rotating conveying members is a belt conveying unit <b>8</b> (moving/guiding unit) provided with the conveyor belt <b>82</b> to move/guide (convey) the sheet S toward a holding section (nip section) of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> while keeping the leading edge of the sheet S in contact with the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. A conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>, which is a belt traveling surface on the conveyor belt <b>82</b> of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>, is arranged along an outer side of the first conveying path A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">As described above, the sheet conveying direction of the first pair of rotating conveying members including the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b> is different from the sheet conveying direction of the second pair of rotating conveying members including the grip roller <b>81</b> and the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. Specifically, the sheet conveying direction of the first pair of rotating conveying members is substantially horizontal and directed to a diagonally upward right position, whereas the sheet conveying direction of the second pair of rotating conveying members is directed in a substantially vertically upward direction, as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>. Accordingly, the first conveying path A formed between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b> includes a curved section (curvature section) with a small radius, which causes the sheet conveying direction to change abruptly in the first conveying path A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">A more specific description is given of the sheet conveying directions of the first and second conveying units <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the sheet conveying direction orthogonally intersecting the center of the nip section of the first conveying unit <b>6</b> is substantially horizontal with respect to a line connecting three points, namely the rotational center of the feed roller <b>61</b>, the rotational center of the reverse roller <b>62</b>, and the holding section (also referred to as “nip section”) of the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">Similarly, the sheet conveying direction orthogonally intersecting the center of the nip section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> is substantially vertical with respect to a line connecting three points, namely the rotational center of the grip roller <b>81</b>, the rotational center of the roller-type pulley <b>83</b>, and the holding section (also referred to as “nip section”) of the grip roller <b>81</b> and the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">That is, in the sheet conveying path formed between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, the sheet conveying direction changes. The sheet conveying path includes two opposite surfaces that define the orientation of the conveyed sheet S in the thickness direction of the sheet S. When the sheet S is sent out from the first conveying unit <b>6</b>, the leading edge of the sheet S abuts against a conveying guiding surface, which is one of the two above-mentioned surfaces. The conveying guiding surface moves continuously and constantly within a predetermined range, starting at least from the position where the sheet S abuts against the conveying guiding surface, along the lengthwise direction of the sheet conveying direction, toward the holding section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. This conveying guiding surface corresponds to the belt traveling surface (the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>) on the conveyor belt <b>82</b> of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>. The area surrounded by an extended line along the sheet conveying direction of the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and an extended line along the sheet conveying direction of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> is referred to as an inner area, and the rest of the areas are referred as an outer area (an inner side and an outer side refer to sides closer toward the inner area and a side closer toward the outer area, respectively). The conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, which is the planar belt traveling surface used for conveying a sheet, is arranged along the outer edge of the inner area, and substantially intersects the sheet traveling direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> primarily includes the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, and the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> and the roller-type pulley <b>84</b> configuring a pair of belt holding rotating members for rotatably holding the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">It is imperative that the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> be arranged in such a manner that the leading edge of the sheet S conveyed from the first conveying unit <b>6</b> abuts (contacts) the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, at portions of the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>other than portions where the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is held by the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> and the roller-type pulley <b>84</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> is arranged in such a manner that the axial center of the roller-type pulley <b>84</b> (center of a pulley shaft <b>84</b> <i>a</i>) is arranged above the bottom edge of the reverse roller <b>62</b> and beneath the height of the downstream end of a guide surface <b>71</b> <i>a </i>of a conveying guiding member <b>71</b>. Accordingly, the leading edge of the sheet S collides with the abdominal portion (i.e., an “effective conveying portion”) of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, where the conveyor belt <b>82</b> constantly and appropriately becomes elastically displaced/deformed (when colliding with the sheet S), so that the leading edge of the sheet S does not bounce back. Hence, it is ensured that the leading edge of the sheet S is kept in abutment with the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>(also referred to as “belt conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>”) of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, so that the effects described below can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">If the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> is arranged in such a manner that the leading edge of the sheet S may abut (contact) the conveyor belt <b>82</b> at the portions where the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is held by (in contact with) the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> and the roller-type pulley <b>84</b>, the following problem arises. That is, the portions where the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is held by the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> and the roller-type pulley <b>84</b> are generally harder than the abdominal portion of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, and thus do not become elastically displaced/deformed as much as the abdominal portion. Hence, this arrangement is disadvantageous as the sheet S would bounce back from the conveyor belt <b>82</b> because the conveyor belt <b>82</b> would not constantly and appropriately become elastically displaced/deformed when the leading edge of the sheet S abuts against the portions where the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is held by the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> and the roller-type pulley <b>84</b>. The same applies to other embodiments, modification examples, and practical examples according to the present invention described below (hereinafter, also referred to as “the same applies to other examples”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is imperative that the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> be arranged in such a manner that the leading edge of the sheet S conveyed from the first conveying unit <b>6</b> approaches the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>at an acute collision angle θ. By arranging the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> in such a manner, the leading edge of the sheet S constantly abuts the abdominal portion of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. Accordingly, it is ensured that the leading edge of the sheet S is kept in abutment with the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>, so that the effects described below can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">If the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> is arranged in such a manner that the leading edge of the sheet S approaches the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>at a substantially perpendicular or an orthogonal collision angle θ, the leading edge of the sheet S may abut the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>in an irregular manner. For example, the sheet S may bend in the opposite direction to which the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is moving or bounce back from the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. Hence, this arrangement is disadvantageous (the same applies to other examples).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">Each of the sheet feeding trays <b>51</b> in the stages of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> has a planar shape large enough to store the maximum size of the sheet S used in the copier <b>1</b>. Each of the sheet feeding trays <b>51</b> is a substantially flat box with an upper opening and a bottom plate <b>50</b> provided at the bottom acting as a sheet stacking unit. The rear end of the bottom plate <b>50</b>, on the left side as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is fixed to a horizontal shaft <b>50</b>A supported by the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b> so that the bottom plate <b>50</b> can freely rotate within a predetermined angle range, i.e., so as to pivot back and forth (oscillate). The free end of the bottom plate <b>50</b> on the right side as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can pivot back and forth about the shaft <b>50</b>A inside the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">At the bottom of the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b>, there is a hollow section of a predetermined shape. A rising arm <b>52</b> is provided in the hollow section. The rear end of the rising arm <b>52</b> is fixed to a horizontal shaft <b>52</b>A so that the rising arm <b>52</b> can freely rotate within a predetermined angle range, i.e., so as to pivot back and forth, in the hollow section. The horizontal shaft <b>52</b>A receives a driving force from a not shown rotational driving source, causing the horizontal shaft <b>52</b>A to rotate in arbitrary directions. As the horizontal shaft <b>52</b>A rotates, the rising arm <b>52</b> is caused to pivot about the horizontal shaft <b>52</b>A to come to a predetermined tilted position. Accordingly, the free end of the rising arm <b>52</b> pushes up the bottom plate <b>50</b> so that one edge of the topmost face of the sheets S stacked on the bottom plate <b>50</b> is maintained at a predetermined height.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">As described above, in the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b>, the sheets S are stacked on the bottom plate <b>50</b> and stored therein. Furthermore, the free end of the bottom plate <b>50</b> on the right side as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> rises so that the bottom plate <b>50</b> tilts and the sheets S stacked thereon are pushed up. Therefore, even if the sheets S are fed out one by one and the number of stacked sheets decreases, the topmost surface of the sheets S can be maintained at a predetermined height.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">As described above, the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b> can be freely attached to/detached from and inserted in/removed from the main unit of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b>. Specifically, the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b> can be set at an inserted position in the main unit of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> so that sheet feeding can be performed. The sheet feeding tray <b>51</b> can be pulled out and detached from the main unit of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> toward the front as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to a detached position, so that sheets S can be supplied or sheets S can be replaced with sheets S of a different size.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">At least the first conveying unit <b>6</b>, the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, and the sheet conveying path arranged between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b> remain in the main unit even when the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b> is pulled out. Although the image forming apparatus of this example is an in-body paper eject type (i.e., the sheet eject tray <b>9</b> is located within the main unit of the image forming apparatus), by providing the moving/guiding unit (belt conveying unit <b>8</b>), the curvature of the conveying path can be kept equal to or less than that of the conventional technology. Hence, the width of the image forming apparatus does not need to be increased, so that the advantage of the in-body paper eject type is not diminished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">A pickup roller <b>60</b> is axially rotatably supported by a housing <b>80</b> that configures the outer shape of a structure provided on the main unit of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b>, in such a manner that the pickup roller <b>60</b> contacts the topmost face of the sheets S raised to the predetermined height. On an extended line along the direction in which the pickup roller <b>60</b> extracts the sheet S, a sheet feed separating mechanism is provided for separating one sheet S from the stack of sheets S and feeding out the separated sheet S. In the sheet feed separating mechanism, the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b> contact each other by a predetermined pressure level to form a nip section therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">As illustrated in detailed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pickup roller <b>60</b> can be a generally known roller that is integrally fixed around a shaft <b>60</b> <i>a </i>that is integrally formed with a not shown cored bar, and is supported together with the shaft <b>60</b> <i>a </i>so as to freely rotate. Alternatively, a one-way clutch (not shown) can be provided between the shaft <b>60</b> <i>a </i>and the cored bar, and the pickup roller <b>60</b> can be supported so as to freely rotate with respect to the shaft <b>60</b> <i>a </i>when it is not driven. The circumferential section of the pickup roller <b>60</b> (including its circumferential surface) is made of a soft, highly frictional material such as rubber, which has a high frictional coefficient with respect to the sheet S, so as to easily pick up the sheet S by contacting the sheet S. Furthermore, in order to increase the frictional resistance, substantially sawtooth-shaped projections can be formed over the entire circumferential surface of the pickup roller <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">There are various sheet feeding methods for separating a sheet from a stack of sheets S to prevent multifeeding of sheets (i.e., prevent plural sheets from being sent out at once). In this example, the FRR sheet feeding method is employed, which is a return separate method. Specifically, when two or more sheets S are picked up by the pickup roller <b>60</b>, one sheet in contact with the feed roller <b>61</b> is separated from the other sheet in contact with the reverse roller <b>62</b>. The feed roller <b>61</b> continues to send the sheet in contact therewith in the sheet conveying direction while the reverse roller <b>62</b> returns the other sheet in the opposite direction to the sheet conveying direction, back to the original position on the stack of sheets. Furthermore, the reverse roller <b>62</b> is configured not to obstruct the sheet conveying operation performed by the feed roller <b>61</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">More specifically, the sheet feed separating mechanism employing the FRR sheet feeding method as a sheet separating mechanism includes the feed roller <b>61</b> that is rotated in the forward direction of the sheet conveying direction and the reverse roller <b>62</b> that is rotated in the reverse direction by receiving a rotational driving force in the reverse direction via a torque limiter. The feed roller <b>61</b> contacts the top face of the topmost sheet S fed out from the bottom plate <b>50</b>, while the reverse roller <b>62</b> contacts the bottom face of at least one sheet S under the feed roller <b>61</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">The feed roller <b>61</b> can be a roller that is integrally fixed around a shaft <b>61</b> <i>a </i>that is integrally formed with a not shown cored bar, and is supported together with the shaft <b>61</b> <i>a </i>so as to freely rotate. Alternatively, the feed roller <b>61</b> can be supported in a similar manner to the pickup roller <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">Similarly to the pickup roller <b>60</b>, the circumferential section of the feed roller <b>61</b> (including its circumferential surface) is made of a soft, highly frictional material such as rubber, which has a high frictional coefficient with respect to the sheet S, so as to easily convey the sheet S in the sheet conveying direction by contacting the sheet S. Furthermore, in order to increase the frictional resistance, substantially sawtooth-shaped projections can be formed over the entire circumferential surface of the feed roller <b>61</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">The reverse roller <b>62</b> is integrally formed with a not shown cored bar, and is supported together with a reverse roller driving shaft <b>62</b> <i>a </i>by the housing <b>80</b> so as to freely rotate by receiving a rotational driving force via the torque limiter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">In the FRR separating method, the reverse roller <b>62</b> receives a low level of torque in a direction opposite to that of the rotational direction of the feed roller <b>61</b> via the torque limiter (not shown). Therefore, when the reverse roller <b>62</b> is in contact with the feed roller <b>61</b>, or when one sheet S enters in between the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b>, the reverse roller <b>62</b> is caused to rotate following the rotation of the feed roller <b>61</b>. That is, the function of the torque limiter causes the reverse roller <b>62</b> to slip on the reverse roller driving shaft <b>62</b> <i>a</i>, so that the reverse roller <b>62</b> rotates in a forward direction in the sheet feeding direction, similarly to the feed roller <b>61</b>. Conversely, when the reverse roller <b>62</b> is separated from the feed roller <b>61</b> or when two or more sheets S enter in between the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b>, the reverse roller <b>62</b> rotates in the opposite direction. Therefore, when more than one sheet S enters in between the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b>, the reverse roller <b>62</b> returns the sheets S other than the topmost sheet S in contact with the feed roller <b>61</b>, i.e., the sheets S in contact with the reverse roller <b>62</b>, toward the upstream side of the sheet conveying direction. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent multifeeding of sheets S (feeding more than one sheets S at once).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">Therefore, the conveying force applied from the reverse roller <b>62</b> to the sheet S in contact therewith is large enough in the reverse direction for returning the sheet S to its original position on the stack of sheets S. However, this conveying force is sufficiently smaller than the conveying force applied from the feed roller <b>61</b> to the sheet S for conveying the sheet S in the forward direction, so as not to obstruct the feed roller <b>61</b> from conveying the sheet S in the forward direction. Due to this configuration, the conveying force applied from the feed roller <b>61</b> to the sheet S is reduced by the opposite conveying force applied from the reverse roller <b>62</b> to the sheet S.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <b>65</b> denotes an idler gear joined to a driving shaft that outputs a rotational driving force from a driving source provided in the main unit of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b>. The idler gear <b>65</b> distributes and transmits a rotational driving force supplied from the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> through the engagement of gears or through a belt to the pickup roller <b>60</b> and the feed roller <b>61</b> to rotate them at predetermined speeds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">At a diagonally upper position of the feed roller <b>61</b>, a grip roller <b>81</b> is provided as the other rotating conveying member of the second pair of rotating conveying members configuring the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. The grip roller <b>81</b> is rotatably supported by the housing <b>80</b> via a rotational driving shaft <b>81</b> <i>a </i>integrally formed with the grip roller <b>81</b>. Similarly to the feed roller <b>61</b>, the circumferential section of the grip roller <b>81</b> (including its circumferential surface) is made of a soft, highly frictional material such as rubber, which has a high frictional coefficient with respect to the sheet S, so as to easily convey the sheet S in the sheet conveying direction by contacting the sheet S.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">The pulley <b>83</b> is provided near the grip roller <b>81</b>. The pulley <b>83</b> is axially rotatably supported by the housing <b>80</b> so as to contact the circumferential surface of the grip roller <b>81</b> via the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, facing the grip roller <b>81</b> in a horizontal direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">The pulley <b>83</b> is integrally formed with a pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>a</i>, and is rotatably supported together with the pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>a </i>by the housing <b>80</b>. The pulley <b>84</b> is arranged at a diagonally downward left position of the pulley <b>83</b>, and is axially rotatably supported by the housing <b>80</b>. The pulley <b>84</b> is integrally formed with a pulley shaft <b>84</b> <i>a</i>, and is rotatably supported together with the pulley shaft <b>84</b> <i>a </i>by the housing <b>80</b>.

Each of the pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>a</i>, <b>84</b> <i>a </i>is a single, continuous shaft, and is made a metal material such as steel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">The arrangement of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> is not limited to the aforementioned descriptions; the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> can be arranged as follows. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, etc., (<b>79</b>) in parenthesis denotes an opening/closing guide that opens and closes with respect to the housing <b>80</b>, which opening/closing guide is part of the main unit of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>. The opening/closing guide (<b>79</b>) is configured to open and close by pivoting about a fulcrum shaft hinge (not shown) below the housing <b>80</b> so that the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be separated from the grip roller <b>81</b>, making it easier for a user to resolve a paper jam in the first conveying path A or the vertical conveying path extending substantially upward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">When the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> is provided with the opening/closing guide (<b>79</b>), the pulley <b>83</b>, the pulley <b>84</b>, and their respective pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>a</i>, <b>84</b> <i>a</i>, are rotatably supported by the opening/closing guide (<b>79</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">The conveyor belt <b>82</b> is an endless belt stretched around the pulley <b>83</b> and the pulley <b>84</b>, as described above. The axes of the pulley <b>83</b> and the pulley <b>84</b> are spaced apart by a predetermined distance. The linear belt traveling surface (conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>) of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> between the pulley <b>83</b> and the pulley <b>84</b> is arranged at a position to ensure that it is contacted by the leading edge of the sheet S sent out from the first conveying unit <b>6</b>. As described above, the circumferential surface of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> stretched around the circumferential surface of the pulley <b>83</b> directly contacts the circumferential surface of the grip roller <b>81</b> at a predetermined pressure level. The portion where the conveyor belt <b>82</b> contacts the grip roller <b>81</b> corresponds to the holding section (nip section). More specifically, a not shown forcing unit (e.g., springs <b>92</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> described below) is attached to a not shown bearing member or supporting member (e.g., belt supporting members <b>86</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> described below) for supporting the pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>a</i>. This forcing unit presses the conveyor belt <b>82</b> against the grip roller <b>81</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">The conveyor belt <b>82</b> is made of an elastic material such as rubber. The frictional coefficient of the surface of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is specified at a predetermined value with respect the conveyed sheet S. The frictional coefficient is defined by characteristics of the material of the belt itself or by treating the surface with an appropriate process. Specifically, the frictional coefficient is specified to ensure that the surface of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> acting as the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>transmits a conveying/propelling force to the face of the sheet S in contact with the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, without allowing the sheet face to slip along the belt surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">The belt width of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> in a sheet width direction orthogonal to the sheet conveying direction is at least substantially equal to the width of a maximum-size sheet to be conveyed. That is, the belt width of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is substantially equal to or wider than the width of a maximum-size sheet to be conveyed. The sizes in the sheet width direction (axial lengthwise direction) of the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> around which the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is stretched and the grip roller <b>81</b> facing/contacting the conveyor belt <b>82</b> are equal to or larger than the aforementioned belt width of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. Hence, it is ensured that the entire width of the sheet S sent out from the first conveying unit <b>6</b> contacts the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, so that the contact area therebetween can be maximized. Accordingly, it is possible to maximize the conveying/propelling force for conveying the sheet S in the conveying direction, which force is constantly transmitted to the sheet S from the conveyor belt <b>82</b> moving in the sheet conveying direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">A not shown rotational driving source such as an electric motor provided specifically for rotating the grip roller <b>81</b> is connected to the rotational driving shaft <b>81</b> <i>a </i>of the grip roller <b>81</b> via a not shown driving force transmitting unit such as a gear or a belt (e.g., a driving mechanism <b>22</b> according to a fourth embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23</figref>, <b>24</b>). The grip roller <b>81</b> is rotated by receiving a rotational driving force of a predetermined rotational speed from the rotational driving source via the driving force transmitting unit. Accordingly, the grip roller <b>81</b> acts as a driving roller; the conveyor belt <b>82</b> in contact with the grip roller <b>81</b> acts as a subordinate belt that is caused to move following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b> acting as the driving roller; and the pulley <b>83</b> supporting the contact portion between the conveyor belt <b>82</b> and the grip roller <b>81</b> from inside the belt acts as a subordinate roller that is caused to rotate via the subordinate belt (conveyor belt <b>82</b>). As a matter of course, the pulley <b>84</b> also acts as a subordinate roller that is caused to rotate via the subordinate belt (conveyor belt <b>82</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">If the effects of the fourth embodiment described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23</figref>, <b>24</b> are not particularly desired, the driving system for driving the grip roller <b>81</b> can be removed from the driving mechanism <b>22</b> to make the grip roller <b>81</b> act as the subordinate side, and the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be driven with a not shown driving mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a conveying guiding member <b>70</b> is positioned in the inner area of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>, including a curved guide surface <b>70</b> <i>a </i>swelling in a substantially downward direction with which the sheet S comes in contact. The conveying guiding member <b>71</b> is positioned in the outer area of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>, including the guide surface <b>71</b> <i>a </i>curved in a caved-in shape in accordance with the conveying guiding member <b>70</b>. Furthermore, the conveying guiding member <b>71</b> is spaced apart with a predetermined gap from the guide surface <b>70</b> <i>a </i>of the conveying guiding member <b>70</b>. The conveying guiding members <b>70</b> and <b>71</b> are both fixed to the housing <b>80</b>. Accordingly, the first conveying path A is formed between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b> by the guide surface <b>70</b> <i>a </i>of the conveying guiding member <b>70</b>, the guide surface <b>71</b> <i>a </i>of the conveying guiding member <b>71</b> facing the conveying guiding member <b>70</b>, and the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a conveying guiding member <b>72</b> is positioned along the outer side of the vertical conveying path extending substantially upward from the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, including a vertical conveying guide surface <b>72</b> <i>a </i>facing the guide surface <b>70</b> <i>a </i>with a predetermined gap therebetween. A conveying guiding member <b>73</b> forms a sheet conveying path from the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b> to the holding section (nip section) between the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b>, and forms an inlet for guiding the sheet S into the nip section. Accordingly, the vertical conveying path communicating with (connected to) the sheet conveying path R<b>1</b> is formed by the vertical conveying guide surface <b>72</b> <i>a </i>of the conveying guiding member <b>72</b> and the guide surface <b>70</b> <i>a </i>of the conveying guiding member <b>70</b>. The curved surface (guide surface <b>70</b> <i>a</i>) of the conveying guiding member <b>70</b> swells in a substantially downward direction (toward the conveying guiding member <b>71</b> provided on the outer side), beneath a line connecting the nip sections of the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. The degree of swelling is defined so that the sheet S moderately bends to ensure that the leading edge of the sheet S reaches the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the configuration of the upper stage of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> is the same as that of the conventional technology. The difference between the lower stage described above is that a sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>′ is employed instead of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>. The sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>′ is different from the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> in that it employs a second conveying unit <b>7</b>′ instead of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. The second conveying unit <b>7</b>′ is different from the second conveying unit <b>7</b> in that the second pair of rotating conveying members only includes the grip roller <b>81</b> and a subordinate roller that is caused to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b> (practically the same size/shape as the pulley <b>83</b>). The sheet feeding tray <b>51</b> of the upper stage and the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>′ are used for sheets S of a relatively low rigidity such as plain paper and not for sheets S of a relatively high rigidity such as cardboard or envelopes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">Next, a description is given of an operation of feeding a sheet from a predetermined stage in the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> and a conveying operation of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> that starts in conjunction with the sheet feeding operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sheets S stacked on the bottom plate <b>50</b> are raised by the pivoting/rising movement of the rising arm <b>52</b> so that the topmost face is at a predetermined height. First, the pickup roller <b>60</b> rotates to extract the topmost sheet S, and sends it to the sheet feed separating mechanism including the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b>. In the sheet feed separating mechanism, the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b> cooperate with each other to separate only the topmost sheet from the others. The separated sheet S is conveyed to the downstream side of the sheet conveying path. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the leading edge of the sheet S is guided and moved as the conveyor belt <b>82</b> travels in the direction indicated by the arrow while being kept in contact with the belt conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>. When the leading edge of the sheet S reaches the nip section between the grip roller <b>81</b> and the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, the grip roller <b>81</b> and the conveyor belt <b>82</b> hold the sheet S and convey it further vertically upward, and finally send out the sheet S in a vertical manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">More specifically, the leading edge of the sheet S is held by the nip section of the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b>, sent out from the nip section, and then reaches the belt conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>is caused to move in the sheet conveying direction by the movement of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> in the direction indicated by an arrow a, the sheet S gradually bends starting from the leading edge thereof. As the sheet S bends further, the contact area between the belt conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and the sheet S face becomes larger. Hence, even if the sheet S is a highly rigid sheet, a sufficient amount of conveying/propelling force can be applied from the belt conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>to the face of the sheet S face in order to convey the sheet S in the sheet conveying direction. When conveyance resistance is generated while the highly rigid sheet S is being conveyed and considerably bent, the conveying/propelling force applied to the sheet S by the first conveying unit <b>6</b> alone is insufficient for conveying the sheet S. This insufficiency can be thoroughly compensated for by the conveying/propelling force applied to the sheet S from the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent conveyance failures of the sheet S at least between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b> so that the leading edge of the sheet S reaches the nip section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142">The conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> continuously extends to the nip section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, thus ensuring that the leading edge of the sheet S in contact with the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>smoothly and constantly reaches the holding section (nip section). More specifically, a highly rigid sheet S being conveyed by the first conveying unit <b>6</b> is caused to bend moderately so that the leading edge of the sheet S surely contacts the belt conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>. The belt conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>applies an active conveying/guiding effect to the leading edge of the sheet S in contact thereto. Accordingly, the sheet S receives a second conveying/propelling force from the belt conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>for moving in the sheet conveying direction. Subsequently, the sheet S is caused to bend even further so as to reach the holding section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">After the leading edge of the sheet S reaches the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, the sheet S is held and conveyed by both the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. Thus, a sufficient amount of conveying force is applied to the sheet S from both the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. Therefore, it is possible to continue conveying the highly rigid sheet S in a smooth manner. After the trailing edge of the sheet S is separated from the first conveying unit <b>6</b>, the sheet S can no longer receive a conveying force from the first conveying unit <b>6</b>. However, this loss is compensated for by the conveying/propelling force from the belt conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>applied once again to the sheet S, depending on how the sheet S is contacting the belt conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>between the holding section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> and the trailing edge. Furthermore, the sheet S gradually becomes less bent. Therefore, it is possible to continue conveying the sheet S even after the trailing edge of the sheet S is separated from the first conveying unit <b>6</b>. Accordingly, in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>, it is ensured that the sheet S from the first conveying unit <b>6</b> is steadily sent to the second conveying unit <b>7</b> and then to the downstream sheet conveying path, regardless of the rigidity of the sheet S.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">As described above, the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> is arranged along the outer side of the first conveying path A formed between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. The belt conveying unit <b>8</b> functions as the moving/guiding unit for moving/guiding the sheet S toward the second conveying unit <b>7</b> while keeping the leading edge of the sheet S in contact with the belt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">In this example, the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> acting as the moving/guiding unit also has a function of changing, with the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, the conveying direction of the sheet S into a direction toward the holding section (nip section) of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>.</div>
<heading>First Practical Example</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">Next, a reference first practical example (hereinafter, “first practical example”) of the first embodiment to which the present invention is applied is described.

Among the components of “imagio Neo 453” manufactured by RICOH, only the sheet feeding device was modified to be used for the “belt method” of this test. The modified sheet feeding device used for the “belt method” basically has the same configurations and specifications as that of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. For the “conventional method”, “imagio Neo 453” manufactured by RICOH was used, in this case including a sheet feeding device with a conventional sheet conveying apparatus (referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the conventional sheet conveying apparatus corresponds to the conventional sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>′ of the sheet feeding device <b>3</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in which the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> is the only rotating conveying member facing and contacting the grip roller <b>81</b>, and the conveyor belt <b>82</b> and the roller-type pulley <b>84</b> are removed).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">As the basic test conditions, the weight of a sheet (meter basis weight) was employed to represent the stiffness (rigidity) of the sheet. Six types of sheets with different weights were passed through the above copiers from sheet feeding trays corresponding to the same stages under an environment of normal temperature (23° C., relative humidity 50%). Other test conditions described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> were also applied to test the differences in conveying time between the different types of sheets. The test results indicating the differences in conveying time are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and Table 1 indicates a summary of the sheet passing properties based on the test results shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a sheet feeding sensor <b>88</b> detects the leading edge of the sheet S picked up by the pickup roller <b>60</b> and a vertical conveyance sensor <b>89</b> detects the leading edge of the sheet S conveyed by the second conveying unit <b>7</b> (belt method) or the pair of the grip roller <b>81</b> and the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> (conventional method). The sheet feeding sensor <b>88</b> and the vertical conveyance sensor <b>89</b> are both reflection type photo-sensors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0150">The conveying path length (sheet conveying distance) between the positions where the sheet feeding sensor <b>88</b> and the vertical conveyance sensor <b>89</b> are arranged is 57 mm both in the belt method and the conventional method.

Accordingly, the total conveying path length is 57 mm for both methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151">The curvature radius at the center of the curved sheet conveying path (first conveying path A) between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b> of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> is 20 mm for both the belt method and the conventional method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">For both the belt method and the conventional method, tests were conducted for two different values of a parameter indicating the pickup pressure (sheet feeding pressure) of the pickup roller <b>60</b>, namely 1.1 N and 2.2 N. The linear speed of both the feed roller <b>61</b> on the driving side and the grip roller <b>81</b> on the driving side was 154 mm/s. The time required for the leading edge of the sheet S to be conveyed from the sheet feeding sensor <b>88</b> to the vertical conveyance sensor <b>89</b>, corresponding to 57 mm of the conveying path, was measured for five different types of paper with an oscilloscope. Results indicating differences between the conveyance times between different types of paper are shown in a graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">The test results in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> say that in the conventional method, if the sheet is 256 g/m<sup>2 </sup>basis weight or more, the conveyance time considerably changes (becomes long) and the sheet is caused to slip considerably. Meanwhile, in the belt method to which the present invention is applied, even if the sheet is 256 g/m<sup>2 </sup>basis weight or more, the conveyance time changes only scarcely (does not become as long as the conventional method), and the sheet is caused to slip only scarcely. Furthermore, if the pickup pressure is reduced, the conveying force decreases. However, in the belt method to which the present invention is applied, the conveying force is not affected as much even if the pickup pressure is reduced. This means that the pickup pressure can be made smaller by employing the belt method to which the present invention is applied, and therefore, the power of the driving motor can be reduced. As a result, the apparatus can be made compact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">Table 1 summarizes the sheet passing properties based on the test results shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">In the first test results shown in Table 1, if the paper type is 256 g/m<sup>2 </sup>basis weight or more, the results were “sheet passing property is unacceptable” in the conventional method, whereas all of the results were “sheet passing property is good” in the belt method according to the first embodiment to which the present invention is applied shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">By comparing the sheet passing/conveying properties observed in the test, it was found that in the in the conventional method, if the paper type is 256 g/m<sup>2 </sup>basis weight or more, the sheet is too stiff to bend along the curved sheet conveying path. Hence, the leading edge of the sheet S is disadvantageously crushed against the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> that faces/contacts the grip roller <b>81</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0160">Furthermore, tests were conducted with sheets of 256 g/m<sup>2 </sup>basis weight or more with coated surfaces and uncoated surfaces to observe whether it makes a difference in sheet passing/conveying properties; however, no particular results distinguishable from those of the first test shown in Table 1 were obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0161">The conclusions described below can be made from the tests results observed in the first practical example. That is, when conveying a highly rigid sheet that is 256 g/m<sup>2 </sup>basis weight or more from the first conveying unit <b>6</b> to the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> via the first conveying path A, the following configuration is possible. Specifically, because the highly rigid sheet is capable of being conveyed in a rectilinear manner, various guiding members configuring the first conveying path A can be made to have simplified shapes so as to reduce the conveyance load resistance, or the various guiding members can be completely omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">Therefore, in the sheet conveying apparatus dedicated for conveying the sheet S with a relatively high rigidity, the essential components are the first conveying unit <b>6</b>, the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, and the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> (moving/guiding unit) for guiding the sheet to the second conveying unit <b>7</b> while keeping the leading edge of the sheet S in contact with the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>. The belt conveying unit <b>8</b> is arranged along the outer side of the first conveying path A (in this case, guiding members are unnecessary) formed between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">For the above reasons, the various guiding members forming the first conveying path A are necessary for conveying a sheet S with a relatively low rigidity, such as plain paper (PPC). As such a PPC sheet S cannot be conveyed in a rectilinear manner compared to the case of a highly rigid sheet S such as cardboard, the various guiding members of the first conveying path A are necessary to compensate for this disadvantage in guiding the sheet S to the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>. That is, as the rigidity of the sheet S becomes lower, it moves in a less rectilinear manner. Therefore, to assist the sheet S to move in a rectilinear manner, guiding surfaces of the various guiding members in the first conveying path A need to have appropriate shapes so as to ensure that the leading edge of the sheet S abuts against the abdominal portion of the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0164">This means that the higher the rigidity of the sheet S (more meter basis weight), more freedom is allowed in designing the shapes and positions of the various guide members configuring the sheet conveying path with a curvature section of a relatively small curvature radius.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0165">The material of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is not limited to that of the above comparative test; the material can be, for example, chloroprene rubber, urethane rubber, or silicon rubber. The hardness of the rubber of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be JIS K6253 A type 40 degrees-80 degrees (JIS: Japan Industrial Standard).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0166">As described above, with the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and the copier <b>1</b> including the same, it is possible to provide a sheet conveying apparatus and an image forming apparatus that is compact and space-saving, having a simple and low-cost configuration, and capable of conveying various sheet types. The basic configuration is made by adding the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> configured with a conveyor belt stretched around conventional rollers including one of the second conveying unit, and a driving source dedicated to the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> can be omitted. Therefore, it is possible to realize a sheet conveying apparatus in an image forming apparatus that has a simple configuration that is thus low-cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0167">In the conventional configuration, a conveyance failure occurs when conveying a highly rigid type of sheet. The failure is caused by a large conveyance resistance generated as the sheet contacts the conveying guiding member <b>70</b>, or by a conveyance load in the first conveying path A between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. However, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> according to an embodiment to which the present invention is applied can convey highly rigid sheets without failures, and is thus capable of conveying various sheet types. That is to say, the conventional configuration merely provides a fixed member for guiding a sheet, and thus does not eliminate the speed difference between the conveyed sheet, which is a mobile object, and the fixed guiding member. As a result, a conveyance resistance is always generated. However, in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> and the copier <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment to which the present invention is applied, the conveyance resistance can be substantially completely eliminated, and moreover, the sheet can be guided by actively applying a conveying/propelling force to move the sheet in the downstream direction (or the conveying force of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> is applied to the sheet in addition to the conveying force of the first conveying unit <b>6</b> so as to counter the conveyance load in the first conveying path A between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b> and move the sheet in the downstream direction). In the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>, the frictional resistance between the sheet S and the conveyor belt <b>82</b> does not obstruct the sheet S from being conveyed; the frictional resistance functions as a negative resistance to apply a conveying/propelling force to the sheet S. That is, the frictional resistance does not obstruct the sheet S from being conveyed, but is converted into an advantageous negative resistance to apply a conveying/propelling force to the sheet S.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0168">Furthermore, in the conveying direction of the sheet S, as the leading edge of the sheet S abuts the moving surface (conveying surface) of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> and is then conveyed forward by the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, the leading edge of the sheet S gradually overlaps the moving surface of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, although there may be differences according to the rigidity of the sheet type. As a result, the area of the sheet in contact with the moving surface of the belt gradually increases. Thus, the resistance between the sheet and the moving surface of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> increases as the contact area increases, so that an even larger conveying/propelling force for moving the sheet S in the conveying direction can be applied from the conveyor belt <b>82</b> to the sheet S. Moreover, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can change the direction of the sheet S in a direction toward the nip section between the grip roller <b>81</b> and the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. This configuration ensures a steady increase of the conveying/propelling force transmitted from the moving surface (conveying surface) of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> to the sheet surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0169">Therefore, even if the sheet S is highly rigid, it is possible to overcome this rigidity and appropriately deform (bend) the sheet S in its thickness direction, so as to ensure that the sheet S is steadily conveyed toward the holding section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> in the downstream direction. In this manner, it is possible to address the factors of major conveyance failures caused by the fact that the sheet S is highly rigid. Therefore, it is ensured that the sheet S can be steadily conveyed after the leading edge of the sheet S reaches the holding section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. As a result, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> is able to convey various sheet types and achieve excellent sheet conveyance properties.</div>
<heading>Modification Examples of First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref> illustrate modification examples of the first embodiment to which the present invention is applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, one member of the pair of rollers facing/contacting each other in the first conveying unit <b>6</b> can be the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, one member of the pair of rollers facing/contacting each other in the in the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and one member of the pair of rollers facing/contacting each other in the second conveying unit <b>7</b> can be the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> and a belt conveying unit <b>8</b>′, respectively. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, a separate, independent belt conveying unit <b>8</b> can be provided as a moving/guiding unit alternative to one member of the pair of rollers in the first conveying unit <b>6</b> arranged on the upstream side or one member of the pair of rollers in the second conveying unit <b>7</b> arranged on the downstream side, and arranged between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">In the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> of the modification examples shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and at the bottom of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, there is provided an intermediate roller-type pulley (not shown) with an outside diameter somewhat smaller than the outside diameter of the reverse roller <b>62</b>. The reverse roller <b>62</b> is divided into a shish-kebab-like structure in its axial direction, and the intermediate roller-type pulley is arranged inside the divided reverse roller <b>62</b> (at a position where the reverse roller <b>62</b> does not exist) via a not shown rolling bearing, on the outer circumference of a shaft holding the reverse roller <b>62</b>. The intermediate roller-type pulley is arranged so as not to affect the separating function of the reverse roller <b>62</b> (rotation in the anticlockwise direction for returning the sheet S). By providing this intermediate roller-type pulley, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be moved/rotated in the clockwise direction to convey the sheet S to the second conveying unit <b>7</b> or the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>′ at the downstream side of the conveying path. The conveyor belt <b>82</b> is one step lower than the circumferential surface of the reverse roller <b>62</b> so that the conveyor belt <b>82</b> does not form part of the nip section between the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b>. Accordingly, after the sheet S is separated from the rest of the sheets at the nip section between the feed roller <b>61</b> and the reverse roller <b>62</b>, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can provide the above-described functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">Hence, in any of the above described modification examples, the same effects as those of the first embodiment can be achieved.</div>
<heading>Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0174">A second embodiment to which the present invention is applied is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>. Elements/members corresponding to those of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> are denoted by the same reference numerals and descriptions thereof are omitted or summarized. Although not particularly mentioned, configurations of the sheet conveying apparatus, etc., and operations that are not particularly described in the second embodiment are the same as those of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> of the first embodiment and the first practical example described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">The main differences between the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> are as follows. In addition to the first conveying path A acting as a first sheet conveying path formed between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, a second conveying path B acting as a second sheet conveying path is formed. The second conveying path B, which is different and separate from the first conveying path A, extends from an upstream position of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> to the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. The first conveying path A and the second conveying path B merge at an upstream side of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, thereby forming a merged conveying path. The belt conveying unit <b>8</b>, which is one of the members of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, is arranged along the outer side of the first conveying path A and the second conveying path B. Apart from these differences, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> is the same as the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">That is, in the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>, the pulley <b>84</b> around which the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is stretched, which pulley <b>84</b> is one member of the pair of roller-type pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>, is axially rotatably supported by the housing <b>80</b>, and is arranged beneath the pulley <b>83</b> with a space therebetween. Therefore, it is ensured that the leading edge of the sheet S conveyed by the first conveying unit <b>6</b> into the first conveying path A abuts the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, and that the sheet S conveyed along the second conveying path B by a not shown conveying unit is not obstructed from reaching the second conveying unit <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0177">The conveying guiding member <b>71</b> is different from that of the first embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> in that it has a vertical conveying guide surface <b>71</b> <i>c </i>on the right side thereof as viewed in the drawings. The conveying guiding member <b>72</b> is different from that of the first embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> in that it is arranged along the outer side of the second conveying path B extending downward from the above-described vertical conveying path. Furthermore, a vertical conveying guide surface <b>72</b> <i>a </i>is formed on the conveying guiding member <b>72</b> for guiding the sheet S conveyed from an upstream side of the second conveying path B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0178">As described above, the second conveying path B is formed by the vertical conveying guide surface <b>71</b> <i>c </i>of the conveying guiding member <b>71</b> and the vertical conveying guide surface <b>72</b> <i>a </i>of the conveying guiding member <b>72</b> facing the vertical conveying guide surface <b>71</b> <i>c </i>with a predetermined gap therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0179">Next, conveying operations of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> are described. The sheet S is extracted and conveyed from a stack of sheets stacked horizontally in the sheet feeding tray <b>51</b>. Therefore, the sheet conveying direction in the sheet feed separating mechanism of the first conveying unit <b>6</b> is a substantially horizontal direction. Subsequently, the sheet S is conveyed upward toward an image creating unit of the image forming apparatus main unit <b>2</b> positioned above, and therefore, the sheet S needs to be conveyed in a substantially vertical and upward direction, which is orthogonal to the substantially horizontal direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0180">Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, after the sheets S are separated one by one in the sheet feed separating mechanism, the sheet S bends moderately while being conveyed to minimize the conveyance resistance, and then the leading edge of the sheet S abuts the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">The conveyor belt <b>82</b> moves in a substantially vertically upward (substantially directly upward) direction as indicated by an arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the leading edge of the sheet S abutting the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is conveyed to the holding section (nip section) between the grip roller <b>81</b> and the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, and is then conveyed to the downstream side in the substantially directly upward direction by the grip roller <b>81</b> and the conveyor belt <b>82</b> while being held therebetween. As described above, a conveying/propelling force is transmitted from the conveyor belt <b>82</b> to the sheet S for moving the sheet S in the conveying direction. Moreover, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> changes the direction of the sheet S toward the nip section between the grip roller <b>81</b> and the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. Accordingly, even a highly rigid sheet S can be steadily conveyed without causing conveyance failures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0182">As described above, with the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> provided with the merged conveying path shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, the same effects as those of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> can be achieved. That is, a highly rigid sheet such as cardboard can be steadily conveyed, so that various sheet types can be conveyed, and excellent sheet conveyance properties can be achieved. Moreover, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> of the second embodiment can be applied as a sheet conveying apparatus having plural conveying paths, at least the first conveying path A and the second conveying path B, so as to be applied to a wider range of machine types.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">Incidentally, the second embodiment is not limited to the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> including the conventional pair of second conveying rollers <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>; the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> can be provided separately from the pair of second conveying rollers <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, as in the modification example of the first embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>.</div>
<heading>Third Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0184">A third embodiment to which the present invention is applied is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Elements/members corresponding to those of the second embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals and descriptions thereof are omitted or summarized. Although not particularly mentioned, configurations of the sheet conveying apparatus, etc., and operations that are not particularly described in the third embodiment are the same as those of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> of the second embodiment described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0185">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when a trailing edge Se of the sheet S that is bent while being conveyed is released from the conveying guiding member <b>71</b>, the reaction force of the bent sheet S causes the trailing edge Se of the sheet S to move in a direction indicated by an arrow b shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, i.e., causes a flipping phenomenon. Particularly, if the sheet S is stiff (highly rigid) such as cardboard, the reaction force is larger, and therefore, a sudden noise caused by this flipping phenomenon becomes a problem.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0186">Specifically, in the process of being conveyed, the sheet S is held at least two supporting points and is forcibly bent. When the trailing edge Se of the sheet S is released from the holding section of the first conveying unit <b>6</b> or the conveying guiding member <b>71</b> acting as one of the supporting points, the sheet S is only supported at the leading edge. Thus, an elastic restoring force of the bent sheet S causes the trailing edge of the sheet S to immediately collide against the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>. The impact of the collision becomes larger as the rigidity of the sheet S becomes higher. Accordingly, the sudden noise made when the trailing edge Se of the sheet S is caused to collide against the conveyor belt <b>82</b> by the flipping phenomenon is not only unpleasant for the user but may also cause the user to have a misperception that a failure has occurred. That is, even if the sheets S are being conveyed normally, regardless of whether the sheet S is a regular type or a highly rigid type, the above-described sudden noises may give the wrong impression to the user that the apparatus is malfunctioning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0187">To address this issue, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>, a contacting member such as a tension roller <b>85</b> is not provided on the side of the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. This tension roller <b>85</b> is a member that contacts the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, other than the pair of roller-type pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> around which the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is stretched, and the grip roller <b>81</b>. Accordingly, the portion of the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>is made to have appropriate elasticity, so that the impact caused by the flipping phenomenon of the trailing edge Se of the sheet S can be absorbed by the elastic property of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. Thus, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> can remain silent even while a highly rigid sheet S such as cardboard is being conveyed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0188">Among the two linear portions of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> stretched around the pair of pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>, the tension roller <b>85</b> is not arranged on the side of the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>, but on the opposite side and in contact with the inside perimeter of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. Furthermore, the tension roller <b>85</b> is axially supported so as to be movable in an outward direction from inside the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, and is pressed outward in the right direction as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> by a not shown forcing unit. Therefore, the tension roller <b>85</b> is caused to rotate by the movement of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, and contacts the inside perimeter of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> while constantly receiving a predetermined pressing force in an outward direction, so that the conveyor belt <b>82</b> maintains a fixed tension without slackening in its circumferential direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">Accordingly, in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> of the third embodiment, the following advantage is achieved. That is, as the leading edge of the sheet S in the sheet conveying direction is held and conveyed by the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, the trailing edge Se of the sheet S is released from being supported by the conveying guiding member <b>71</b> and is made to collide against the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>. However, the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>can elastically deform enough and change its position in the direction of collision as indicated by the chain double-dashed line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Accordingly, the impact caused by the flipping phenomenon of the trailing edge Se of the sheet S can be absorbed, and the noise caused by the impact can be reduced, so that abnormal noises can be reduced and mitigated during the operation of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">As described above, in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> of the third embodiment, as one of the contacting members to support the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, the tension roller <b>85</b> is provided in contact with the conveyor belt <b>82</b> where the trailing edge Se of the conveyed sheet S does not come in contact with the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>. When the sheet S that is bent to a predetermined extent is conveyed and the trailing edge Se of the sheet S is released from either one of the nip section of the first conveying unit <b>6</b> or the conveying guiding member <b>71</b>, the trailing edge Se collides against the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>. However, the portion of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> where this collision occurs elastically bends enough to absorb the impact of the collision. Therefore, the sudden noise (flipping noise) caused by the collision can be reduced. That is, when the trailing edge Se of the sheet S contacts the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, the contacting member (tension roller <b>85</b>) does not obstruct the deforming motion of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> where it is contacted by the trailing edge Se of the sheet S. Thus, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> sufficiently bends in the same direction as the direction in which the trailing edge Se of the sheet S contacts the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">Particularly, when a highly rigid sheet S such as cardboard is being conveyed, and the trailing edge Se of the sheet S in the sheet conveying direction strongly collides against the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, the elastic deforming motion of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> absorbs and mitigates the impact caused by the collision so that an impulsive noise is sufficiently reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0192">Accordingly, as sudden noises can be reduced while conveying the sheet S, operations can be performed quietly so that unpleasant noises are prevented and misperceptions that a failure has occurred are not created. This results in advantageous usability of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">In the process of conveying the sheet S, even if a sudden noise is not generated when the leading edge of the sheet S first contacts the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, the above-described configuration still has an advantageous effect. That is, as the conveyor belt <b>82</b> elastically deforms to some extent, the leading edge of the sheet S is prevented from bouncing back from the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>. Instead, the leading edge of the sheet S softly abuts the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and stays in contact with the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>. Specifically, when the leading edge of the sheet S conveyed by the first conveying unit <b>6</b> first abuts the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> moving in the sheet conveying direction at an oblique collision angle θ (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the leading edge of the sheet S is prevented from bouncing back from the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>. Rather, the leading edge of the sheet S is caused to follow the direction of movement of the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a </i>and change its direction to that of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">The third embodiment is not limited to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> as long as the conveyor belt can be deformed in such a manner that the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> operates sufficiently quietly. For example, among the two substantially linear belt moving surfaces of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> stretched around the pair of pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> spaced apart in a predetermined manner, the tension roller <b>85</b> is not limited to being provided on the linear surface opposite to the conveying side of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, i.e., the side not facing the first conveying unit <b>6</b>. The tension roller <b>85</b> can be provided on the belt moving surface facing the first conveying unit <b>6</b>. That is, regardless of the rigidity of the sheet S in its thickness direction, the trailing edge of the sheet S always contacts substantially the same position of the belt conveying surface. Accordingly, the tension roller <b>85</b> is to be arranged in contact with the conveyor belt <b>82</b> at a position sufficiently spaced apart from where the trailing edge of the sheet S contacts the belt conveying surface so as to allow the belt to deform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">In the third embodiment, the tension roller <b>85</b> is arranged at a position defined as above to apply a pressing force from inside to stretch the belt outward. Conversely, the tension roller <b>85</b> can be arranged so as to apply a pressing force from outside the belt to stretch the belt inward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">In such a configuration, the tension roller <b>85</b> can also have a function of cleaning the circumferential surface of the belt in addition to the function of applying tension to the belt. With such a tension roller having functions of both applying pressure to the belt and cleaning the belt conveying surface, the belt conveying surface can be maintained in a clean condition, which may improve the image quality. Furthermore, at a position defined as above, both a tension roller and a cleaning roller can be provided separately, or only a cleaning roller that primarily functions as a cleaning unit and does not primarily function as a tensioning unit can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">As described above, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> has a width in a sheet width direction Y that is at least substantially equal to the width of a maximum-size sheet to be conveyed. That is, the belt width of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> extends across the entire width of the sheet, so as to be substantially equal to or wider than the width of a maximum-size sheet to be conveyed. The pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> around which the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is stretched and the grip roller <b>81</b> facing/contacting the conveyor belt <b>82</b> extends across the entire width of the sheet, in such a manner that their sizes in the sheet width direction Y (axial lengthwise direction) are equal to or larger than the aforementioned width of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. Hence, it is ensured that the entire width of the sheet S sent out from the first conveying unit <b>6</b> contacts the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, so that the contact area therebetween can be maximized. Accordingly, it is possible to maximize the conveying/propelling force for conveying the sheet S in the conveying direction, which force is constantly transmitted to the sheet S from the conveyor belt <b>82</b> moving in the sheet conveying direction. Next, a fourth embodiment according to the present invention is described below.</div>
<heading>Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">A sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>23</b>, and <b>24</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref> schematically illustrate the driving mechanism <b>22</b> acting as a sheet feeding driving unit (sheet feeding driving system) of the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b> in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A according to the fourth embodiment. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 24</figref> illustrate the surroundings of a belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A according to the fourth embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">The primary differences between the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b> and the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A are as follows. In the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A, the relationship between the driving member and the subordinately driven member of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> acting as a holding/conveying unit is clearly defined. Furthermore, the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A is employed instead of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>. Elements of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A including the conveyor belt <b>82</b> are arranged in a discontinuous manner (i.e., in a spaced-apart manner) along the sheet width direction Y so as to contact parts of the sheet S in the sheet width direction Y (i.e., not in contact with the entire sheet width). Apart from these differences, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A according to the fourth embodiment is the same as the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">Specifically, in the second conveying unit <b>7</b> of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A, the nip section (the holding section) is formed by a pair of members facing each other, namely, the grip roller <b>81</b> and the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A. The grip roller <b>81</b>, which is one of the two members of the pair, functions as a rotating conveying driving unit/rotating conveying driving member that transmits a driving force by rotating. The belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A (moving/guiding unit) including the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, which is the other member of the pair, is arranged along the outer side of the sheet conveying path (first conveying path A) formed between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. The conveyor belt <b>82</b> directly contacts the grip roller <b>81</b>, and is caused to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b>. The conveyor belt <b>82</b> conveys (moves/guides) the sheet S toward the nip section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> while keeping the leading edge of the sheet S in contact with the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">The sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A according to the fourth embodiment is different from the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b> as follows. In the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b>, the width of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is equal to or wider than the width of a maximum-size sheet to be conveyed, and the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> and the grip roller <b>81</b> are formed across the entire sheet width direction Y so that their sizes are equal to or larger than the aforementioned belt width of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. Instead of this configuration, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A according to the fourth embodiment, elements of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A including the conveyor belt <b>82</b> are arranged in a discontinuous manner along the sheet width direction Y so as to contact parts of a leading edge section the sheet S in the sheet width direction Y (the leading edge section includes the leading edge, the sheet surface around the leading edge, the corners and edges at the leading edge).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">The grip roller <b>81</b> includes plural rotating/conveying members fixed/arranged in a discontinuous manner along the rotational driving shaft <b>81</b> <i>a </i>in the sheet width direction Y in a shish-kebab-like structure. Meanwhile, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> and the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> in the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A are arranged facing at least one of the plural grip rollers <b>81</b> (forming at least one pair of facing members). Specifically, in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there are three grip rollers <b>81</b> arranged along the rotational driving shaft <b>81</b> <i>a </i>in the second conveying unit <b>7</b> acting as the holding/conveying unit. One conveyor belt <b>82</b> is arranged facing the center one of the three grip rollers <b>81</b>, having a substantially equal width to that of the center grip roller <b>81</b>. The grip rollers <b>81</b> positioned at the outermost edges in the sheet width direction Y are arranged so that their outer edges are within the width of a minimum-sized sheet S (sheet size in the sheet width direction Y) used in the copier <b>1</b> provided with the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, as a matter of convenience in describing the driving mechanism <b>22</b> of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A, the grip rollers <b>81</b> are purposely arranged with irregular intervals in the direction of the rotational driving shaft <b>81</b> <i>a</i>. However, in reality, the grip rollers <b>81</b> are equally spaced apart at positions facing the conveyor belts <b>82</b> and the pulleys <b>83</b>, as a matter of course.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the driving mechanism <b>22</b> primarily includes the following elements: a sheet feeding motor <b>23</b> that is a stepping motor acting as the only driving source/driving unit; a motor gear <b>24</b> fixed on an output shaft of the sheet feeding motor <b>23</b>; an idler gear <b>25</b> in engagement with the motor gear <b>24</b>; a feed roller driving gear <b>61</b>B in engagement with the idler gear <b>25</b> and fixed to one end of the shaft <b>61</b> <i>a </i>of the feed roller <b>61</b>; an idler gear <b>26</b> in engagement with the feed roller driving gear <b>61</b>B; a grip roller driving gear <b>81</b>A in engagement with the idler gear <b>26</b> and fixed to one end of the rotational driving shaft <b>81</b> <i>a </i>of the grip rollers <b>81</b>; a feed roller gear <b>61</b>A fixed to the other end of the shaft <b>61</b> <i>a </i>near the feed roller <b>61</b>; an idler gear <b>65</b> in engagement with the feed roller gear <b>61</b>A; and a pickup roller gear <b>60</b>A in engagement with the idler gear <b>65</b> and fixed to the other end of the shaft <b>60</b> <i>a </i>near the pickup roller <b>60</b>. The sheet feeding motor <b>23</b> is fixed to the housing <b>80</b>. The idler gears <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>65</b> are rotatably supported by the housing <b>80</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">As described above, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A according to the fourth embodiment is configured to be compact and space-saving by making the first conveying path A have a curvature section of a relatively small curvature radius as described in the first practical example, etc. The sheet feeding motor <b>23</b> is the only driving source provided for driving both the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>, which also contributes in reducing the size of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0206">The reverse roller <b>62</b> is driven by a different system including, for example, a solenoid for releasing pressure from the feed roller <b>61</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, <b>62</b> <i>b </i>denotes the torque limiter described as not being shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0207">In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the rotating/driving relationship between the pickup roller <b>60</b> and the feed roller <b>61</b> is described only briefly.

Accordingly, for the pickup action, a not shown combination of a solenoid and a spring causes the pickup roller <b>60</b> to pivot/move about the shaft <b>61</b> <i>a </i>of the feed roller <b>61</b> via the pickup arm member <b>64</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0208">In the actual driving mechanism <b>22</b>, there are many driving force transmitting members such as gears and timing belts arranged between the sheet feeding motor <b>23</b> and the feed roller <b>61</b>. However, the example of the driving mechanism <b>22</b> is shown only schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23</figref>, <b>24</b> for the sake of clearly indicating that the grip rollers <b>81</b> function as rotating conveying driving members.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0209">As a matter of course, the driving mechanism <b>22</b> is also applicable to the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> and embodiments and modification examples thereof described subsequently. Moreover, the copier <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment employs a driving mechanism that is practically the same as the driving mechanism <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0210">If the effects described above are not particularly desired, the driving system for driving the grip roller <b>81</b> can be removed from the driving mechanism <b>22</b> to make the grip roller <b>81</b> act as the subordinate side, and the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be driven by a not shown driving mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0211">In the fourth embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A is made to face/contact the grip roller <b>81</b> at the center position in the lengthwise direction of the pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>a </i>(axial direction). Subordinate rollers that are substantially the same as the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> are made to face/contact the grip rollers <b>81</b> on both sides of the center grip roller <b>81</b>. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. A subordinate roller can be made to face/contact the grip roller <b>81</b> in the center, and two conveyor belts <b>82</b> of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A can be made to face/contact the grip rollers <b>81</b> on both sides of the center grip roller <b>81</b>.</div>
<heading>First Modification Example</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0212"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a first modification example of the fourth embodiment. The first modification example is different from the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A according to the fourth embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>23</b>, and <b>24</b> as follows. That is, in a sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>B according to the first modification example, there are conveyor belts <b>82</b> provided for all of the pairs of members facing each other in the holding/conveying units of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. More specifically, three conveyor belts <b>82</b> are facing three of the grip rollers <b>81</b> arranged with substantially the same intervals therebetween. Each of the three conveyor belts <b>82</b> of the belt conveying units <b>8</b>A is movably held/arranged in the same manner by the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> fixed to the pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>a</i>, <b>84</b> <i>a</i>, respectively, facing each of the three grip rollers <b>81</b>. Apart from these differences, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>B according to the first modification example is the same as the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>23</b>, and <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0213">Thus, based on the fourth embodiment and the first modification example, a user can select any one of the sheet conveying apparatuses <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>A, or <b>5</b>B according to the user's requirements by comparing performance and cost. As a matter of course, in terms of cost, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> including the conveyor belt <b>82</b> covering the entire widthwise direction is most expensive, while the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>A including only one conveyor belt <b>82</b> covering one part in the widthwise direction is most inexpensive, and the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>B including three conveyor belts <b>82</b> covering three parts in the widthwise direction is second most inexpensive. Maximum performance can be attained by the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> including the conveyor belt <b>82</b> covering the entire widthwise direction, and a user can select any one of the sheet conveying apparatuses <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>A, or <b>5</b>B according to the user's requirements by comparing performance and cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0214">In addition, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A according to the fourth embodiment and the first modification example is pressed against the grip roller <b>81</b> that drives the pulley <b>83</b> by a pressing force of a not shown spring, so as to directly contact the grip roller <b>81</b>. Therefore, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is caused to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b>, which is rotated by the driving mechanism <b>22</b>. Irregularities in the linear speed of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be reduced more by driving the grip roller <b>81</b>, compared to the case where the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is driven. Therefore, the following advantages can be achieved by arranging the conveyor belt <b>82</b> along the outer side of the turning (curving) section of the first conveying path A, which conveyor belt <b>82</b> rotates toward the holding section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. That is, it is possible to enhance sheet conveying properties for conveying relatively rigid sheets such as cardboard at the turning section of the first conveying path A. Furthermore, by causing the conveyor belt <b>82</b> to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b> facing/directly contacting the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, the sheet S can be conveyed at a steady linear speed beyond the second conveying unit <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0215">These advantages/effects are easily understandable by considering the following technology. By driving the grip roller <b>81</b>, the linear speed of the grip roller <b>81</b> is determined by the outside diameter of the grip roller <b>81</b> and the rotational speed. Conversely, in order to drive the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, it is usually necessary to drive the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> (belt driving roller, main pulley) provided inside the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0216">In this case, the linear speed of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is determined not only by the outside diameter and the rotational speed of the pulley <b>83</b> provided inside the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. The linear speed is also affected by irregularities in the thickness of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> caused by irregularities in components, changes of the thickness of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> caused by attrition, or slipping actions between the conveyor belt <b>82</b> and the pulley <b>83</b>. Therefore, irregularities in the linear speed of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be reduced more by driving the grip roller <b>81</b> rather than driving the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>

<heading>Second Modification Example</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0220"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>14</b> illustrate a second modification example of the fourth embodiment. The second modification example is different from the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>B according to the first modification example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> as follows.

As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>14</b>, in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>C, the conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>, which is where the sheet S contacts the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, protrudes out from the vertical conveying guide surface <b>72</b> <i>a </i>of the conveying guiding member <b>72</b> inward into the conveying path. Apart from these differences, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>C of the second modification example is the same as the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>B.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0221">As illustrated in detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in the sheet width direction Y, on the vertical conveying guide surface <b>72</b> <i>a </i>of the conveying guiding member <b>72</b> other than where the conveyor belts <b>82</b> are arranged, there are conveying guide ribs <b>72</b> <i>b </i>protruding inward into the sheet conveying path (the sheet conveying path extending vertically upward continuing from the second conveying path B).

The conveying surfaces <b>82</b> <i>a </i>protrude inward into the conveying path by a predetermined protruding amount d (corresponding to step height/size) so that the portion of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> stretched around the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> forming a vertical surface slightly protrudes out from the conveying guide ribs <b>72</b> <i>b</i>. With such a configuration, when the sheet S, particularly a cardboard sheet (relatively rigid sheet), is conveyed from the first conveying unit <b>6</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, etc., the sheet S can be elastically deformed in a direction toward the right side as viewed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> so that the leading edge of the cardboard sheet can be gripped/held and conveyed to the nip section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>.

Because the pulleys <b>83</b> <i>b </i>are loosely fit in the supporting holes <b>90</b> <i>a</i>, the conveying surfaces <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the three conveyor belts <b>82</b> are substantially parallel with the sheet width direction Y and are arranged slidably substantially in the sheet conveying direction. The pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>b </i>protrude outside from the supporting holes <b>90</b> <i>a </i>of the shaft supporting member <b>90</b>, and not shown retaining rings can be provided near the six portions of the protruding pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>b </i>to stop the pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>b </i>from slipping out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0256">The springs <b>92</b> are attached between an inner wall of the shaft supporting member <b>90</b> supporting the belt conveying units <b>8</b>H and the spring stages <b>86</b> <i>a </i>of the belt supporting members <b>86</b>. The springs <b>92</b> press the conveyor belts <b>82</b> via the belt supporting members <b>86</b> in such a direction that the conveyor belts <b>82</b> constantly contact the grip rollers <b>81</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0257">The three belt conveying units <b>8</b>H are assembled by the same components described above.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0258">As described above, the conveyor belts <b>82</b> of the three belt conveying units <b>8</b>H are caused to move/rotate separately from each other by the rotation of the grip rollers <b>81</b>.</div>

For example, compared to the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>A shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> where plural conveyor belts <b>82</b> are supported by a single pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>a</i>, it is possible to eliminate irregularities in linear speed caused by irregularities in the conveyor belts <b>82</b> or other components.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0260">As described above, according to the fourth embodiment and modification examples thereof, the user can make a selection from a variety of sheet conveying apparatuses according to the user's requirements by comparing performance and cost.

Next, the springs <b>106</b> are attached to the spring stages <b>105</b> <i>e </i>and the spring latching sections <b>72</b>Kf on the left and right. Then, not shown retaining rings are attached to both ends of the pulley shaft <b>84</b> <i>a </i>protruding outside from the left and right ribs <b>72</b>Kd of the conveying guiding member <b>72</b>K, so that the pulley shaft <b>84</b> <i>a </i>is attached/supported by the left and right ribs <b>72</b>Kd of the conveying guiding member <b>72</b>K and prevented from moving in the sheet width direction Y of the conveying guiding member <b>72</b>K.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0293">As described above, the belt unit <b>104</b> is arranged at a position in such a manner that the conveying surfaces <b>82</b> <i>a </i>of the conveyor belts <b>82</b> protrude from the openings <b>72</b>Kc of the conveying guiding member <b>72</b>K by a predetermined amount (step height). Furthermore, the pressing force of the pair of left and right springs <b>106</b> presses the belt unit <b>104</b> in such a direction that the upper pulleys <b>83</b> pivot in an anticlockwise direction about the pulley shaft <b>84</b> <i>a</i>. Accordingly, the conveying surfaces <b>82</b> <i>a </i>are pressed against the grip rollers <b>81</b> not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> via the pulleys <b>83</b> by a predetermined pressure level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0294">As a matter of course, the relevant configurations of the second-thirteenth modification examples and the fifth embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-21</figref> are applicable to the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>K shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-29</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0295">According to the fifteenth modification example, the basic effects of the belt conveying units <b>8</b>K can be achieved, and the following additional advantages and effects can also be achieved.

<heading>Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0296">A sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>30</b>-<b>33</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref> schematically illustrate the driving mechanism <b>22</b> acting as a sheet feeding driving unit (sheet feeding driving system) of the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b> in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M according to the sixth embodiment. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>30</b>-<b>33</b> illustrate the surroundings of a belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M according to the sixth embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0297">The primary differences between the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b> and the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M according to the sixth embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>30</b>-<b>33</b> are as follows. In the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M, the relationship between the driving member and the subordinately driven member of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> acting as a holding/conveying unit is clearly defined. Moreover, the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M is employed instead of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>, and elements of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M including the conveyor belt <b>82</b> are arranged in a discontinuous manner along the sheet width direction Y so as to contact parts of the sheet S in the sheet width direction Y, and the material of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is specified. Apart from these differences, the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M according to the sixth embodiment is the same as the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0298">Specifically, in the second conveying unit <b>7</b> of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M, a pair of members facing each other configures the holding/conveying unit, namely, the grip roller <b>81</b> and the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M. The grip roller <b>81</b>, which is one member of the pair, functions as a rotating conveying driving unit/rotating conveying driving member that transmits a driving force by rotating. The belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M (moving/guiding unit) including the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, which is the other member of the pair, is arranged along the outer side of the sheet conveying path (first conveying path A) formed between the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. The conveyor belt <b>82</b> directly contacts the grip roller <b>81</b>, and is caused to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b>. The conveyor belt <b>82</b> conveys (moves/guides) the sheet S toward the holding section (nip section) of the second conveying unit <b>7</b> while keeping the leading edge of the sheet S in contact with the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0299">The sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M according to the sixth embodiment is different from the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b> as follows.

Instead of this configuration, in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M according to the sixth embodiment, elements of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M including the conveyor belt <b>82</b> are arranged in a discontinuous manner along the sheet width direction Y so as to contact parts of a leading edge section of the sheet S in the sheet width direction Y (the leading edge section includes the leading edge, the face at the leading edge, the corners and edges at the leading edge).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0300">The grip roller <b>81</b> includes plural rotating/conveying members fixed/arranged in a discontinuous manner along the rotational driving shaft <b>81</b> <i>a </i>in the sheet width direction Y in a shish-kebab-like structure.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0301">The sixth embodiment employs the same driving mechanism <b>22</b> as that described in the fourth embodiment with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23</figref>, <b>24</b>, and therefore, redundant descriptions are omitted.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0303">The belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M is primarily different from the belt conveying unit <b>8</b> of the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b> in the following points and subsequently described characteristics. That is, the material of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is specified as below. Instead of having the three pulleys <b>83</b> fixed to the pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>a</i>, the three pulleys <b>83</b> are rotatably supported by the pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>b</i>. The pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> are made of a resin material such as polyacetal resin. The belt supporting members <b>86</b> are provided to rotatably support the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>. Instead of the pulley shaft <b>84</b> <i>a </i>with a long length continuously extending in its axial direction, there are three metal pulley shafts <b>84</b> <i>b </i>with short lengths in their axial directions provided for the belt conveying units <b>8</b>M.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0304">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the grip roller <b>81</b> and the conveyor belt <b>82</b> contact each other on a line connecting the center of the rotational driving shaft Bla of the grip roller <b>81</b> and the center of the pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>b</i>, similarly to the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The holding section (nip section) is formed at the portion including this contact point. The pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> are made of a resin material such as polyacetal resin that has good lubricity, abrasion resistance, and durability, and are thus light-weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0305">The conveyor belts <b>82</b> provided at three positions have the same configurations except for their spring loads as described below. Thus, only one of the conveyor belts <b>82</b> is described as a representative example. The conveyor belt <b>82</b> is an elastic member made of, for example, ethylene propylene rubber (EPDM), without using a base material (a belt is typically formed by attaching rubber onto a base material such as a cloth made by weaving threads). The conveyor belt <b>82</b> is made only of rubber. The conveyor belt <b>82</b> can also be made of urethane rubber (U).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0306">The conveyor belt <b>82</b> is stretched around the pulley <b>83</b> rotatably supported by the pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>b </i>and the pulley <b>84</b> rotatably supported by the pulley shaft <b>84</b> <i>b </i>with a predetermined tension determined by the positional relationship between the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> attached to the belt supporting member <b>86</b> via the pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>b</i>, <b>84</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0307">The pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>b</i>, <b>84</b> <i>b </i>are fixed/supported by the belt supporting member <b>86</b> in such a manner that a fixed distance is maintained between their axes.

Accordingly, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is elastically stretched so that the conveyor belt <b>82</b> has a longer circumference when the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M is assembled in the belt supporting member <b>86</b>, compared to when the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is by itself (in a non-stretched state).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0308">Two bearings <b>87</b> are provided on the pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>b </i>held by the three belt supporting members <b>86</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0309">Each of the belt supporting members <b>86</b> is a single component made of a resin material such as polyacetal resin, and is thus light-weight.

Near the portions where the pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>b</i>, <b>84</b> <i>b </i>protrude out from the belt supporting members <b>86</b>, retaining rings are provided to stop the pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>b</i>, <b>84</b> <i>b </i>from slipping out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0310">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the springs (pressuring springs) <b>92</b> are provided between the spring stages <b>86</b> <i>a </i>of the belt supporting members <b>86</b> and spring bearing members <b>93</b>. The springs <b>92</b> act as forcing units for pressing the backsides of the belt supporting members <b>86</b> in such a direction that the conveyor belts <b>82</b> constantly contact the grip rollers <b>81</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0311">As indicated by the hatched portions shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, positioning sections <b>86</b> <i>b </i>are integrally formed at the bottom of the belt supporting member <b>86</b> for positioning the conveyor belt <b>82</b> at a predetermined position.

Therefore, the conveyor belts <b>82</b> are positioned at predetermined positions so as to protrude from the conveying guiding member <b>72</b> at a belt protruding height h.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0312">As shown in detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, each of the bearings <b>87</b> has a U-shaped slot <b>87</b> <i>a</i>, and the pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>b </i>is loosely fit in the U-shaped slot <b>87</b> <i>a</i>. Accordingly, the pressing force of the spring <b>91</b> presses the conveyor belt <b>82</b> against the grip roller <b>81</b> via the pulley shaft <b>83</b> <i>b</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0313">As described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-33</figref>, one end of the spring <b>92</b> applies a force on the belt supporting member <b>86</b>. The other end of the spring <b>92</b> is supported/latched by a spring pressuring stage <b>94</b>. The spring pressuring stage <b>94</b> can move along a slit <b>93</b> <i>a </i>formed in the spring bearing member <b>93</b> in the direction of the pressing force of the spring <b>92</b>, and can also be fixed at an arbitrary position. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-33</figref>, the spring pressuring stage <b>94</b> is fastened/fixed by a screw. With such a configuration, the springs <b>92</b> can be arbitrarily pressed to different lengths so that the spring load acting as the pressing force, i.e., the pressuring force of the springs <b>92</b> can be arbitrarily changed. In the sixth embodiment, the two springs <b>91</b> have the same spring specifications such as spring load, spring length, shape, etc. Similarly, the three springs <b>92</b> have the same spring specifications such as spring load, spring length, shape, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0314">As described above, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M according to the sixth embodiment is stretched around the pair of roller-type pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> with a predetermined tension determined by the positional relationship between the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> attached to the belt supporting member <b>86</b> via the pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>b</i>, <b>84</b> <i>b</i>. The conveyor belt <b>82</b> is pressed by the pressing force of the spring <b>92</b> against the grip roller <b>81</b> that drives the pulley <b>83</b>. The pulley <b>83</b> is provided in a freely rotatable manner, and is thus caused to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0315">When fitting the conveyor belt <b>82</b> around the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>, if the rubber of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is too hard, the straight portions (linear belt traveling surfaces) of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> between the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> tend to swell outward due to the hardness of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. In an effort to prevent this, the stretch rate of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be increased. However, when the stretch rate is increased, the tension of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> increases. As a result, the rotational load of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> increases, making it difficult to cause the conveyor belt <b>82</b> to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b>.</div>
<heading>Second Practical Example</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0316">As a second practical example, a test was conducted under the same test conditions as the test described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and Table 1.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0318">Results shown in Table 2 say that even if the stretch rate is high, when the rubber hardness is low, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is not obstructed from being rotated. When the rubber hardness is high (80 degrees), the same effects can be obtained by reducing the thickness of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. However, if the thickness of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is reduced, the mechanical strength of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> decreases. Therefore, in consideration of abrasion with the passage of time, it is not preferable to reduce the thickness/size of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. Accordingly, it was found that the effects described below can be achieved by making the rubber hardness of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> to be relatively low at 30-90 degrees on a JIS A scale, without reducing its mechanical strength or causing abrasion with the passage of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0319">According to the sixth embodiment, the following advantages/effects can be achieved. First, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M directly contacts the grip roller <b>81</b> (rotating conveying driving unit/rotating conveying driving member) that is rotated by the driving mechanism <b>22</b>, so that the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is caused to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b>. Irregularities in the linear speed of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be reduced more by driving the grip roller <b>81</b>, compared to the case where the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is driven. Therefore, the following advantages can be achieved by arranging the conveyor belt <b>82</b> along the outer side of the turning (curving) section of the first conveying path A, which conveyor belt <b>82</b> rotates toward the holding section of the second conveying unit <b>7</b>. That is, it is possible to enhance sheet conveying properties for conveying relatively rigid sheets such as cardboard at the turning section of the first conveying path A. Furthermore, by causing the conveyor belt <b>82</b> to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b> facing/directly contacting the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, the sheet S can be conveyed at a steady linear speed beyond the second conveying unit <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0320">These advantages/effects are easily understandable by considering the following technology. If the grip roller <b>81</b> is driven, the linear speed of the grip roller <b>81</b> is determined by the outside diameter of the grip roller <b>81</b> and the rotational speed. Conversely, in order to drive the conveyor belt <b>82</b>, it is usually necessary to drive the roller-type pulley <b>83</b> (belt driving roller, main pulley) provided inside the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0321">In this case, the linear speed of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is determined not only by the outside diameter and the rotational speed of the pulley <b>83</b> provided inside the conveyor belt <b>82</b>. The linear speed is also affected by irregularities in the thickness of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> caused by irregularities in components, changes in the thickness of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> caused by attrition, or slipping actions between the conveyor belt <b>82</b> and the pulley <b>83</b>. Therefore, irregularities in the linear speed of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be reduced more by driving the grip roller <b>81</b> rather than driving the conveyor belt <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0322">Second, the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> (belt holding rotating members) are axially supported by the belt supporting member <b>86</b> (supporting member) in such a manner that a fixed distance is maintained between their axes. The pulley shafts <b>83</b> <i>b</i>, <b>84</b> <i>b </i>of the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> are arranged in the belt supporting member <b>86</b> in such a manner that the conveyor belt <b>82</b> configured with an elastic member has a longer circumference when stretched around the pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b> compared to when the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is by itself (in a non-stretched state). The sixth embodiment is not provided with a tightener, which is a typically used mechanism for applying tension to a belt. Instead, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is elastically stretched between the two pulleys <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>. Therefore, the sixth embodiment is simple, space-saving, and cost-saving compared to a conventional configuration provided with a tightening mechanism such as a tightener.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0323">Accordingly, the configuration of the sheet conveying apparatus with enhanced sheet conveying properties for conveying relatively rigid sheets such as cardboard at the turning section of the first conveying path A can be simple, space-saving, and cost-saving.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0324">Third, the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is made of rubber with a relatively low hardness. Specifically, the rubber hardness of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is relatively low at 30-90 degrees on a JIS A scale. Thus, the tension of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be reduced to a low level when it is stretched, without reducing its mechanical strength or causing abrasion with the passage of time. If the conveyor belt <b>82</b> has high tension, the rotational load of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> increases, because the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is caused to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b>. As a result, it becomes difficult to cause the conveyor belt <b>82</b> to rotate following the rotation of the driven grip roller <b>81</b> at the same linear speed as that of the grip roller <b>81</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0325">According to the sixth embodiment, the tension of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be reduced to a low level without reducing its mechanical strength or causing abrasion with the passage of time. Therefore, the rotational load of the conveyor belt <b>82</b> can be reduced, ensuring that the conveyor belt <b>82</b> is caused to rotate following the rotation of the driven grip roller <b>81</b>.

<heading>Sixteenth Modification Example</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0328"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> illustrates a sixteenth modification example, which is a modification example of the sixth embodiment. A conveyor belt <b>82</b>N according to the sixteenth modification example is different from the conveyor belt <b>82</b> of the belt conveying unit <b>8</b>M in the sheet conveying apparatus <b>5</b>M according to the sixth embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>30</b>-<b>33</b> (hereinafter simply referred to as “conveyor belt <b>82</b> according to the sixth embodiment”) as follows.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0329">The grip roller <b>81</b> and the sheet S come in contact with the conveyor belt <b>82</b>N only at the protruding parts of the creased conveying surface <b>82</b> <i>a</i>. Therefore, the linear speed of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>N is determined by the thickness of the protruding parts of the creases. The conveyor belt <b>82</b>N is thin where the receding parts of the creases are positioned. Therefore, compared to the conveyor belt <b>82</b> that has an entirely uniform thickness, the rubber hardness of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>N is reduced by changing the physical appearance thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0330">The example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> has relatively shallow creases formed by the protruding parts and the receding parts in a direction parallel to a substantial horizon.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0333">If the conveyor belt has high tension, as the conveyor belt is caused to rotate following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b>, the rotational load of the conveyor belt increases.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0334">According to the sixteenth modification example, the tension of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>N can be reduced, and therefore, the rotational load of the conveyor belt <b>82</b>N can be reduced, thus ensuring that the conveyor belt <b>82</b>N is caused to rotate following the rotation of the driven grip roller <b>81</b>. That is, it is possible to reduce the load obstructing the conveyor belt <b>82</b>N from rotating following the rotation of the grip roller <b>81</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0351">In the above-described embodiments, practical examples, and modification examples, the present invention is applied to a sheet conveying apparatus for conveying and feeding a sheet from a sheet storing unit (sheet feeding tray <b>51</b>) in a copier acting as an image forming apparatus of an image forming unit main unit as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; however, the present invention is not limited thereto. The present invention is applicable to a sheet conveying apparatus in which the leading edge of a sheet S is ejected substantially upward from the top of the fixing device <b>11</b> of the main unit of the image forming apparatus, and then ejected from the main unit to the sheet eject tray <b>9</b> in a substantially horizontal direction (see, for example, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>). The present invention is also applicable to a sheet conveying apparatus in which a sheet placed on the substantially horizontal bypass tray <b>67</b> provided outside the main unit by a user is guided inside the main unit while maintaining its horizontal direction, and then the sheet changes its direction upward to be conveyed into a vertical conveying path that extends to the image forming section in the main unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0352">In the above-described embodiments and modification examples, the sheet is caused to change its direction from a substantially horizontal direction to a vertically upward direction (substantially directly upward); however, the present invention is not limited thereto. The sheet can change its direction from a substantially horizontal direction to a vertically downward direction (substantially directly downward), or from a vertically downward or upward direction to a substantially horizontal direction (see, for example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>), or from an oblique direction to another oblique direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0353">In the above-described embodiments, practical examples, and modification examples, both the first conveying unit <b>6</b> and the second conveying unit <b>7</b> are holding/conveying units; however, depending on the conveying direction of each conveying unit, if it is only necessary to support the bottom face of the conveying object while being conveyed, the conveying units do not need to have holding/conveying units including holding sections formed by members facing each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0354">The members of the first conveying unit, the second conveying unit, and the pickup rollers are not limited to the above. They can be a substantially extended cylinder with a predetermined length in the axial lengthwise direction of the rotational axis, or a short cylinder. Furthermore, plural rollers can be arranged in a discontinuous manner along a single rotational shaft with predetermined spaces therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0355">In the conveying paths according to the above embodiments, several guiding members can be provided along the outer side or the inner side in the spaces where rollers are not arranged so as to form guiding surfaces.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0356">In the above-described embodiments, practical examples, and modification examples, the FRR sheet feeding method is employed as the sheet feed separating mechanism; however, the present invention is not limited thereto. As long as a sheet can be separated from plural sheets overlapping each other by friction so that only one sheet is conveyed, any type of friction separating method can be employed. For example, a separating claw can be employed, or a friction pad method can be employed in which a friction pad acting as a fixing member is pressed against a feed roller. In this friction pad method, the friction pad acting as a friction member is pressed against the feed roller at an appropriate separating angle and separating pressure level. A sheet is caused to pass through a nip section formed by the feed roller and the friction pad. Accordingly, with the sheet feed separating mechanism employing the fiction pad method, even if two overlapping sheets are extracted, the bottom sheet receives a resistance from the friction pad that is larger than the resistance caused by the friction in between the overlapping sheets. Therefore, the bottom sheet is prevented from moving any further in the sheet conveying direction. Meanwhile, the top sheet receives a conveying force from the feed roller that is larger than the resistance caused by the friction in between the overlapping sheets and the resistance received from the friction pad. As a result, only the top sheet continues to move into the conveying direction.</div>
