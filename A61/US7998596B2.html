<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to an aromatic amine derivative and an organic electroluminescent (EL) device using the same, and more particularly, to an aromatic amine derivative capable of decreasing a driving voltage and suppressing crystallization of a molecule at the same time, thereby improving a lifetime of the organic EL device and enhancing yields upon production of the organic EL device.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">An organic EL device is a spontaneous light emitting device which utilizes such a principle that a fluorescent substance emits light by virtue of recombination energy of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode by an application of an electric field. Since an organic EL device of the laminate type capable of being driven under low electric voltage has been reported by C. W. Tang et al. of Eastman Kodak Company (C. W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke, Applied Physics Letters, Volume 51, Page 913, 1987, or the like), many studies have been conducted for an organic EL device using an organic material as a constituent material. Tang et al. used tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum for a light emitting layer and a triphenyldiamine derivative for a hole transporting layer. Advantages of the laminate structure reside in the followings: an efficiency of the hole injection into the light emitting layer can be increased; an efficiency of forming exciton which are formed by blocking and recombining electrons injected from the cathode can be increased; and exciton formed within the light emitting layer can be enclosed. As described above, for the structure of the organic EL device, a two-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer and an electron transporting light emitting layer and a three-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transporting (injecting) layer, and the like are widely known. In order to increase the efficiency of recombination of injected holes and electrons in the devices of the laminate type, the device structure and the process for forming the device have been studied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In general, when an organic EL device is driven or stored in an environment of high temperature, there occur adverse effects such as a change in the luminescent color, a decrease in current efficiency, an increase in driving voltage, and a decrease in a lifetime of light emission. In order to prevent the adverse effects, it has been necessary that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the hole transporting material be elevated. Therefore, it is necessary that many aromatic groups be held within a molecule of the hole transporting material (for example, an aromatic diamine derivative of Patent Document 1 and a fused aromatic ring diamine derivative of Patent Document 2), and in general, a structure having 8 to 12 benzene rings are preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">However, when a large number of aromatic groups are present in a molecule, crystallization is liable to occur upon production of the organic EL device through the formation of a thin film by using those hole transporting materials. As a result, there arises a problem such as clogging of an outlet of a crucible to be used in vapor deposition or a reduction in yields of the organic EL device due to generation of defects of the thin film resulting from the crystallization. In addition, a compound having a large number of aromatic groups in any one of its molecules generally has a high glass transition temperature (Tg), but has a high sublimation temperature. Accordingly, there arises a problem in that the lifetime of the compound is short, because a phenomenon such as decomposition at the time of the vapor deposition or the formation of a nonuniform deposition is expected to occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">On the other hand, there is a known document disclosing an asymmetric aromatic amine derivative. For example, in Patent Document 3, there is described an aromatic amine derivative having an asymmetric structure, but there is no specific example thereof, and also, there is no description of a feature of the asymmetric compound at all. Further, in Patent Document 4, an asymmetric aromatic amine derivative containing phenanthrene is described as an example, but the derivative is lumped into the same category as symmetric compounds and there is no description of a feature of the asymmetric compound at all. Further, although the asymmetric compound needs a special synthesis method, a description on a production method of the asymmetric compound is not clearly disclosed in those patent documents. Also, in Patent Document 5, there is a description on the production method of the aromatic amine derivative having an asymmetric structure, but there is no description of a feature of the asymmetric compound. In Patent Document 6, there is a description on an asymmetric compound which has a high glass transition temperature and is thermally stable, but only a compound containing carbazole is exemplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Further, Patent Documents 7 and 8 are reports on amine compounds each having thiophene. Those are compounds which each have thiophene in a central skeleton of a diamine compound. Further, in the compound of Patent Document 7, the thiophene is directly bonded to amine. Patent Documents 9 and 10 are given as reports on a compound having thiophene at a terminal of a diamine compound, and in those compounds, thiophene is directly bonded to amine. Those compounds are unstable and the purification thereof is difficult; therefore, the purity thereof does not improve. Further, when the thiophene is directly bonded to the amine, an electronic state of the amine largely changes; therefore, sufficient performance cannot be obtained in the case where each of the compounds is used as a material for the organic EL device. On the other hand, in Patent Document 11, there is a description on compounds in which the thiophene is bonded to the amine through an aryl group. However, those compounds have a structure including an unsubstituted thiophene at 2- or 5-position thereof. 2- or 5-position of thiophene has high reactivity and is electrically unstable, and when the thiophenes are present in the molecule, a high voltage is required in the case where the compounds are each used as a device; therefore, those compounds are not preferred. Patent Document 12 is given as the description of amine polymers, but there is only specific examples and is no description on the amine compound in which the thiophene is bonded to nitrogen through the aryl group at all. A polymer is described in Patent Documents 13 to 22, but cannot be subjected to vapor deposition. Further, a polar group required for polymerization decreases the lifetime as a device; thus, the polar group is not preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">As described above, it is generally known that the compound having a thiophene structure has a high mobility, but a sufficient performance cannot be obtained, when used as a material of the organic EL device, by merely combining the compound with an amine structure. Therefore, development of a material for an organic EL device having further improved performance has been strongly desired.

<heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading>Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The present invention has been made with a view to solving the above-mentioned problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide an organic EL device in which a molecule hardly crystallizes, and which decreases a driving voltage, can be produced with improved yields upon the production of the organic EL device, and has a long lifetime, and an aromatic amine derivative realizing the organic EL device.</div>
<heading>Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The inventors of the present invention have made extensive studies with a view toward achieving the above-mentioned object. As a result, the inventors have found that the above-mentioned problems can be solved by using a novel aromatic amine derivative having a specific substituent including thiophene, which is represented by the following general formula (1), as a material for an organic EL device, and particularly as a hole transporting material. Thus, the present invention has been completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Further, the inventors of the present invention have found that each of amino groups substituted by an aryl group having a thiophene structure represented by the general formulae (2) and (13) is suitable as an amine unit having a specific substituent. The inventors have found that the amine unit has an effect of decreasing a driving voltage from the following reasons: the injection of charge becomes easy because an interaction between the amine unit and an electrode is possible owing to the fact that the amine unit has a polar group; and the mobility is high because the amine unit has a thiophene structure. Also, it has been found that, because an interaction between molecules of the amine unit is small owing to its steric hindrance, the amine unit has such effects that crystallization is suppressed, yield in which an organic EL device is produced is improved, an organic EL device having a long lifetime can be provided, and a remarkably low driving voltage and long lifetime can be attained by combining the amine unit with a blue light emitting device in particular. In addition, among compounds having large molecular weight, the compound having an asymmetric structure suppresses decomposition at the time of the vapor deposition because the compound can lower the vapor deposition temperature, and is capable of realizing the longer lifetime.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">That is, the present invention provides an aromatic amine derivative represented by the following general formula (1):</div>

The term “molecular deposit film” as used herein refers to a thin film formed by the deposition of a material compound in a vapor phase state, or a film formed by the solidification of a material compound in a solution state or a liquid phase state. The molecular deposit film can be typically distinguished from a thin film formed by the LB method (molecular accumulation film) on the basis of differences between the films in aggregation structure and higher order structure, and functional differences between the films caused by the foregoing differences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">In addition, as disclosed in JP-A-57-51781, the light emitting layer can also be formed by: dissolving a binder such as a resin and a material compound in a solvent to prepare a solution; and forming a thin film from the prepared solution by the spin coating method or the like.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">A phosphorescent dopant is a compound capable of emitting light from a triplet exciton. The dopant, which is not particularly limited as long as light is emitted from a triplet exciton, is preferably a metal complex containing at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Ir, Ru, Pd, Pt, Os, and Re, and is preferably a porphyrin metal complex or an orthometalated metal complex. A porphyrin platinum complex is preferable as the porphyrin metal complex. One kind of a phosphorescent compound may be used alone, or two or more kinds of phosphorescent compounds may be used in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">Any one of various ligands can be used for forming an orthometalated metal complex. Examples of a preferable ligand include 2-phenylpyridine derivatives, 7,8-benzoquinoline derivatives, 2-(2-thienyl)pyridine derivatives, 2-(1-naphthyl)pyridine derivatives, and 2-phenylquinoline derivatives. Each of those derivatives may have a substituent as required. A fluoride of any one of those derivatives, or one obtained by introducing a trifluoromethyl group into any one of those derivatives is a particularly preferable blue-based dopant. The metal complex may further include a ligand other than the above-mentioned ligands such as acetylacetonato or picric acid as an auxiliary ligand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">The content of the phosphorescent dopant in the light emitting layer is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately selected in accordance with a purpose. The content is, for example, 0.1 to 70 mass %, and is preferably 1 to 30 mass %. When the content of the phosphorescent compound is less than 0.1 mass %, the intensity of emitted light is weak, and an effect of the incorporation of the compound is not sufficiently exerted. When the content exceeds 70 mass %, a phenomenon referred to as concentration quenching becomes remarkable, and device performance reduces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">In addition, the light emitting layer may contain a hole transporting material, an electron transporting material, or a polymer binder as required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">Further, the thickness of the light emitting layer is preferably 5 to 50 nm, more preferably 7 to 50 nm, or most preferably 10 to 50 nm. When the thickness is less than 5 nm, it becomes difficult to form the light emitting layer, so the adjustment of chromaticity may be difficult. When the thickness exceeds 50 nm, the driving voltage may increase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">(5) Hole Injecting and Transporting Layer (Hole Transporting Zone)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">The hole injecting and transporting layer is a layer which helps injection of holes into the light emitting layer and transports the holes to the light emitting region. The layer exhibits a great mobility of holes and, in general, has an ionization energy as small as 5.6 eV or smaller. For such the hole injecting and transporting layer, a material which transports holes to the light emitting layer under an electric field of a smaller strength is preferable. A material which exhibits, for example, a mobility of holes of at least 10<sup>−4 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/V·sec under application of an electric field of 10<sup>4 </sup>to 10<sup>6 </sup>V/cm is preferable.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0217">The hole injecting and transporting layer can be formed by forming a thin layer from the aromatic amine derivative of the present invention in accordance with a known process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process, the casting process, and the LB process. The thickness of the hole injecting and transporting layer is not particularly limited. In general, the thickness is 5 nm to 5 μm. The hole injecting and transporting layer may be formed of a single layer containing one or two or more materials described above or may be a laminate formed of hole injecting and transporting layers containing materials different from the materials of the hole injecting and transporting layer described above as long as the aromatic amine derivative of the present invention is incorporated in the hole transporting zone.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0221">In addition, it is known that, in an organic EL device, emitted light is reflected by an electrode (cathode in this case), so emitted light directly extracted from an anode and emitted light extracted via the reflection by the electrode interfere with each other. The thickness of an electron transporting layer is appropriately selected from the range of several nanometers to several micrometers in order that the interference effect may be effectively utilized. When the thickness is particularly large, an electron mobility is preferably at least 10<sup>−5 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more upon application of an electric field of 10<sup>4 </sup>to 10<sup>6 </sup>V/cm in order to avoid an increase in voltage.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0247">A preferable embodiment of the organic EL device of the present invention includes an element including a reducing dopant in the region of electron transport or in the interfacial region of the cathode and the organic layer. The reducing dopant is defined as a substance which can reduce a compound having the electron transporting property. Various compounds can be used as the reducing dopant as long as the compounds have a uniform reductive property. For example, at least one substance selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals, alkali metal oxides, alkali metal halides, alkaline earth metal oxides, alkaline earth metal halides, rare earth metal oxides, rare earth metal halides, organic complexes of alkali metals, organic complexes of alkaline earth metals, and organic complexes of rare earth metals can be preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0248">More specifically, preferable examples of the reducing dopant include substances having a work function of 2.9 eV or smaller, and specific examples of which include at least one alkali metal selected from the group consisting of Li (the work function: 2.9 eV), Na (the work function: 2.36 eV), K (the work function: 2.28 eV), Rb (the work function: 2.16 eV), and Cs (the work function: 1.95 eV) and at least one alkaline earth metal selected from the group consisting of Ca (the work function: 2.9 eV), Sr (the work function: 2.0 to 2.5 eV), and Ba (the work function: 2.52 eV). Of those, at least one alkali metal selected from the group consisting of K, Rb, and Cs is more preferable, Rb and Cs are still more preferable, and Cs is most preferable as the reducing dopant. In particular, those alkali metals have great reducing ability, and the luminance of the emitted light and the lifetime of the organic EL device can be increased by addition of a relatively small amount of the alkali metal into the electron injecting zone. As the reducing dopant having a work function of 2.9 eV or smaller, combinations of two or more alkali metals thereof are also preferable. Combinations having Cs such as the combinations of Cs and Na, Cs and K, Cs and Rb, and Cs, Na, and K are particularly preferable. The reducing ability can be efficiently exhibited by the combination having Cs. The luminance of emitted light and the lifetime of the organic EL device can be increased by adding the combination having Cs into the electron injecting zone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0249">The present invention may further include an electron injecting layer which is composed of an insulating material or a semiconductor and disposed between the cathode and the organic layer. At this time, the electron injecting property can be improved by preventing a leak of electric current effectively. As the insulating material, at least one metal compound selected from the group consisting of alkali metal chalcogenides, alkaline earth metal chalcogenides, alkali metal halides, and alkaline earth metal halides is preferable. It is preferable that the electron injecting layer be composed of the above-mentioned substance such as the alkali metal chalcogenide since the electron injecting property can be further improved. Preferable examples of the alkali metal chalcogenide include Li<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>S, Na<sub>2</sub>Se, and Na<sub>2</sub>O. To be specific, preferable examples of the alkaline earth metal chalcogenide include CaO, BaO, SrO, BeO, BaS, and CaSe. Preferable examples of the alkali metal halide include LiF, NaF, KF, LiCl, KCl, and NaCl. Preferable examples of the alkaline earth metal halide include fluorides such as CaF<sub>2</sub>, BaF<sub>2</sub>, SrF<sub>2</sub>, MgF<sub>2</sub>, and BeF<sub>2 </sub>and halides other than the fluorides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0250">Examples of the semiconductor composing the electron transporting layer include oxides, nitrides, and oxide nitrides of at least one element selected from Ba, Ca, Sr, Yb, Al, Ga, In, Li, Na, Cd, Mg, Si, Ta, Sb, and Zn used alone or in combination of two or more. It is preferable that the inorganic compound composing the electron transporting layer form a crystallite or amorphous insulating thin film. When the electron transporting layer is composed of the insulating thin film described above, a more uniform thin film can be formed, and defects of pixels such as dark spots can be decreased. Examples of the inorganic compound include alkali metal chalcogenides, alkaline earth metal chalcogenides, alkali metal halides, and alkaline earth metal halides which are described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0251">(7) Cathode</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0252">As the cathode, a material such as a metal, an alloy, an electroconductive compound, or a mixture of those materials which has a small work function (4 eV or smaller) is used because the cathode is used for injecting electrons to the electron injecting and transporting layer or the light emitting layer. Specific examples of the electrode material include sodium, sodium-potassium alloys, magnesium, lithium, magnesium-silver alloys, aluminum/aluminum oxide, aluminum-lithium alloys, indium, and rare earth metals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0253">The cathode can be prepared by forming a thin film of the electrode material described above in accordance with a process such as the vapor deposition process or the sputtering process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0254">When the light emitted from the light emitting layer is obtained through the cathode, it is preferable that the cathode have a transmittance of higher than 10% with respect to the emitted light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0255">It is also preferable that the sheet resistivity of the cathode be several hundred Ω per square or smaller. The thickness of the cathode is, in general, selected in the range of 10 nm to 1 μm and preferably in the range of 50 to 200 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0256">(8) Insulating Layer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0257">Defects in pixels tend to be formed in organic EL device due to leak and short circuit since an electric field is applied to ultra-thin films. In order to prevent the formation of the defects, a layer of a thin film having an insulating property is preferably inserted between the pair of electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0258">Examples of the material used for the insulating layer include aluminum oxide, lithium fluoride, lithium oxide, cesium fluoride, cesium oxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium fluoride, calcium oxide, calcium fluoride, aluminum nitride, titanium oxide, silicon oxide, germanium oxide, silicon nitride, boron nitride, molybdenum oxide, ruthenium oxide, and vanadium oxide. Mixtures and laminates of the above-mentioned compounds may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0259">(9) Method of Producing the Organic EL Device</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0260">In order to prepare the organic EL device of the present invention, the anode and the light emitting layer, and, where necessary, the hole injecting and transporting layer and the electron injecting and transporting layer are formed in accordance with the illustrated process using the illustrated materials, and the cathode is formed in the last step. The organic EL device may also be prepared by forming the above-mentioned layers in the order reverse to the order described above, i.e., the cathode being formed in the first step and the anode in the last step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0261">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the process for preparing an organic EL device having a construction in which an anode, a hole injecting layer, a light emitting layer, an electron injecting layer, and a cathode are disposed successively on a light-transmissive substrate will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0262">On a suitable light-transmissive substrate, a thin film made of a material for the anode is formed in accordance with the vapor deposition process or the sputtering process so that the thickness of the formed thin film is 1 μm or smaller and preferably in the range of 10 to 200 nm. The formed thin film is used as the anode. Then, a hole injecting layer is formed on the anode. The hole injecting layer can be formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process, the casting process, or the LB process, as described above. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable since a uniform film can be easily obtained and the possibility of formation of pin holes is small. When the hole injecting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, in general, it is preferable that the conditions be suitably selected in the following ranges: the temperature of the source of the deposition: 50 to 450° C.; the vacuum: 10<sup>−7 </sup>to 10<sup>−3 </sup>Torr; the rate of deposition: 0.01 to 50 nm/second; the temperature of the substrate: −50 to 300° C.; and the thickness of the film: 5 nm to 5 μm although the conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition are different depending on the compound to be used (i.e., material for the hole injecting layer) and the crystal structure and the recombination structure of the target hole injecting layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0263">Then, the light emitting layer is formed on the hole injecting layer. A thin film of the organic light emitting material can be formed by using a desired organic light emitting material in accordance with a process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the sputtering process, the spin coating process, or the casting process, and the formed thin film is used as the light emitting layer. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable since a uniform film can be easily obtained and the possibility of formation of pin holes is small. When the light emitting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, in general, the conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition process can be selected in the same ranges as the conditions described for the vacuum vapor deposition of the hole injecting layer, although the conditions are different depending on the compound to be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0264">Next, an electron injecting layer is formed on the light emitting layer. Similarly to the hole injecting layer and the light emitting layer, it is preferable that the electron injecting layer be formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process since a uniform film must be obtained. The conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition can be selected in the same ranges as the condition described for the vacuum vapor deposition of the hole injecting layer and the light emitting layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0265">When the vapor deposition process is used, the aromatic amine derivative of the present invention can be deposited by vapor in combination with other materials, although the situation may be different depending on which layer in the light emitting zone or in the hole transporting zone includes the compound. When the spin coating process is used, the compound can be incorporated into the formed layer by using a mixture of the compound with other materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0266">A cathode is laminated in the last step, and an organic EL device can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0267">The cathode is formed of a metal and can be formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process or the sputtering process. It is preferable that the vacuum vapor deposition process be used in order to prevent formation of damages on the lower organic layers during the formation of the film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0268">In the above-mentioned preparation of the organic EL device, it is preferable that the above-mentioned layers from the anode to the cathode be formed successively while the preparation system is kept in a vacuum after being evacuated once.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0269">The method of forming the layers in the organic EL device of the present invention is not particularly limited. A conventionally known process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process or the spin coating process can be used. The organic thin film layer which is used in the organic EL device of the present invention and includes the compound represented by general formula (1) described above can be formed in accordance with a known process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process or the molecular beam epitaxy process (MBE process) or, using a solution prepared by dissolving the compounds into a solvent, in accordance with a coating process such as the dipping process, the spin coating process, the casting process, the bar coating process, or the roll coating process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0270">The thickness of each layer in the organic thin film layer in the organic EL device of the present invention is not particularly limited. In general, an excessively thin layer tends to have defects such as pin holes, where as an excessively thick layer requires a high applied voltage to decrease the efficiency. Therefore, a thickness in the range of several nanometers to 1 μm is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0271">The organic EL device which can be prepared as described above emits light when a direct voltage of 5 to 40 V is applied in the condition that the polarity of the anode is positive (+) and the polarity of the cathode is negative (−). When the polarity is reversed, no electric current is observed and no light is emitted at all. When an alternating voltage is applied to the organic EL device, the uniform light emission is observed only in the condition that the polarity of the anode is positive and the polarity of the cathode is negative. When an alternating voltage is applied to the organic EL device, any type of wave shape can be used.</div>

<heading>Example 1</heading>
<heading>Production of Organic EL Device</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0325">A glass substrate with an ITO transparent electrode measuring 25 mm wide by 75 mm long by 1.1 mm thick (manufactured by GEOMATEC Co., Ltd.) was subjected to ultrasonic cleaning in isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes. After that, the substrate was subjected to UV ozone cleaning for 30 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0326">The glass substrate with the transparent electrode line after the washing was mounted on a substrate holder of a vacuum deposition device. First, Compound H1 was formed into a film having a thickness of 60 nm, using Compound H1 film as the hole transporting material, on the surface on the side where the transparent electrode line was formed to cover the transparent electrode. The H1 film functions as a hole injecting layer. The following Compound layer TBDB was formed into a film having a thickness of 20 nm on the H1 film. The film functions as a hole transporting layer. Further, Compound EM1 to be described below was deposited from the vapor and formed into a film having a thickness of 40 nm. Simultaneously with this formation, Amine Compound D1 having a styryl group to be described below, as a light emitting molecule, was deposited from the vapor in such a manner that a weight ratio between Compound EM1 and Amine Compound D1 would be 40:2. The film functions as a light emitting layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0327">Alq to be described below was formed into a film having a thickness of 10 nm on the resultant film. The film functions as an electron injecting layer. After that, Li serving as a reducing dopant (Li source: manufactured by SAES Getters) and Alq were subjected to co-deposition. Thus, an Alq:Li film (having a thickness of 10 nm) was formed as an electron injecting layer (cathode). Metal Al was deposited from the vapor onto the Alq:Li film to form a metal cathode. Thus, an organic EL device was formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0328">In addition, the current efficiency of the resultant organic EL device was measured, and the luminescent color of the device was observed. A current efficiency at 10 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>was calculated by measuring a luminance by using CS1000 (trade name) manufactured by Minolta. Further, the half lifetime of light emission in DC constant current driving at an initial luminance of 5,000 cd/m<sup>2 </sup>and room temperature was measured. Table 1 shows the results thereof.</div>
