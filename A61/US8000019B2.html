<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to an optical system for a display panel, and a projector having the optical system. More particularly, the present invention relates to an optical system for a display panel for projecting red, green, and blue beams of a light source with high efficiency for light utilization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">In conventional projectors using sequential color system, three lights of the primary colors, i.e., red (hereinafter, R), green (hereinafter, G), and blue (hereinafter, B) lights are sequentially projected onto a high response display panel by means of a color wheel that rotates at a high speed. A field image in each color is sequentially displayed, and a full color frame is displayed through the afterimage of human eyes. This kind of projector has the advantage that size, weight, and cost can be reduced easily because of the configuration of single display panel and a simple optical system. DMD (Digital Micro-mirror Device) is a known display panel. In a DMD, which is a binary-type device having only two states of ON and OFF, gradations of colors is controlled by controlling duties of ON/OFF through PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">However, the optical system using a color wheel has the disadvantage that only one color can be used at one time, and two-thirds of light that is emitted from a light source is lost without being projected onto a display panel, resulting in the difficulty in improving brightness. If three primary colors of R, G, B into which white light of the light source is separated are used efficiently in a sequential color displaying process using a single display panel, it is possible to provide a projector with high brightness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">According to a disclosed optical system that addresses this requirement, light that is emitted from a light source is separated into color bands of R, G, B and a display panel is scanned with the color bands by continuously moving the color bands by means of a rotatable prism. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,410,370, and No. 5,528,318, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2003-149738, and Japanese Patent No. 3352100. This system, called a scroll system, is considered to provide a projector with high efficiency for light utilization, because color beams of R, G, B which originate from the light source can be utilized simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In conventional optical systems for a projector of a time-division type that uses a disk-shaped color wheel with color filters, out of the whole light consisting of color beams of R, G, B, approximately two-thirds can not be utilized simultaneously, as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In the prior art scroll system disclosed in the above documents, in which color bands move continuously on a display panel, the color bands are narrow in width, and timing at which each color is switched differs for each pixel row. Therefore, a display panel driving circuit needs to be driven by a signal which is synchronized with color beams that has different switching timing for each pixel row. Further, each color band is projected onto a portion of the display panel only in a limited time, which makes it difficult to achieve sufficient gradations by the PWM. This means, in turn, that significantly complicated PWM control is required, and a heavy load is burdened on the signal processing circuit.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel optical system for a display panel with a smaller burden on the signal processing circuit, high efficiency for utilizing the light of a light source, and high brightness. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a projector having such an optical system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">According to one embodiment of the present invention, an optical system for a display panel comprises a color separating portion for separating light that is emitted from a light source into a plurality of beams having different spectra; and a projecting portion for projecting the plurality of beams onto a plurality of divided areas of a predetermined range in the display panel, while sequentially switching the plurality of beams.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In one embodiment, the optical system for the display panel may further comprise the light source. The color separating portion may comprise: a plurality of light introducing members each for emitting the light that is incident from the light source through an emitting surface; a selecting portion that is arranged on an optical path between the light source and the plurality of light introducing members, for selecting one of the light introducing members and for causing the light to be incident on the selected light introducing member; and a plurality of color separating members which are arranged on the emitting surfaces of the light introducing members, for separating the light into the plurality of beams. The projecting portion may further comprise a projecting means for projecting the beams which are emitted from color separating members onto the plurality of divided areas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">According to still another embodiment, each beam may have a rectangular cross-section in a plane perpendicular to a direction that the beam travels, and each beam may be emitted such that the beam borders on a longer side of an adjacent beam, and such that the plurality of beams have a different spectra order depending on the color separating members.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In the optical system for the display panel, the plurality of beams may comprise a beam of red, a beam of green, and a beam of blue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">As described above, light from a light source is separated into color beams of R, G, B in rectangular shapes. The color beams are projected onto divided areas (for example, three divided areas) of a display panel such that one color beam is not projected onto more than one area simultaneously and such that the color beam that is incident on each area is periodically switched, resulting in the efficient use of light that is emitted from the light source and incident on a display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">According to still another embodiment, the optical system for the display panel further comprises the light source. The color separating portion comprises: a color separating means for separating the light that is emitted from the light source into the plurality of beams; a light introducing portion which has a plurality of light introducing members each for emitting the beam through an emitting surface, the beam being emitted from the color separating means and incident on the light introducing member; a selecting portion that is arranged on an optical path between the light source and the light introducing portion, for causing the plurality of beams which are emitted from the color separating portion incident on the light introducing members; and a projecting portion for projecting the beams which are emitted from the light introducing portion on a predetermined range of the display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">As will be appreciated from the description above, in the optical system for a display panel according to the present invention, light that is emitted from a light source is separated into color beams in rectangular shapes, then each color band is projected onto each rectangular area of the display panel in a manner that the arrangement order of colors sequentially changes. The number of the divided areas is set equal to that of color bands. Thus, high efficiency for light utilization of the light source can be achieved. The divided areas of the display panel area are sequentially irradiated by each color beam. Accordingly, a smaller burden is placed on the signal processing circuit in the display panel, compared with a scroll-type system in which the boundaries of the color beams continuously move on the display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate examples of the present invention.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The present invention provides an optical system for a display panel of a single plate type, with high light efficiency and a smaller burden on the signal processing circuit of a display panel. The present invention is different from a system in which rectangular bands of particular wavelength ranges (hereinafter called color bands), each consisting of a different color beam, continuously move on a display panel, such as a scroll type. The present invention is characterized in that rectangular color bands of R, G, B into which light from a light source is separated are projected onto divided areas (for example, three areas) of a display panel such that one color beam is not projected onto more than one divided area simultaneously, and such that the color beam that is projected onto each area sequentially changes. R refers to a color having the center of the spectrum in a red area, G is a color having the center of the spectrum in a green area, and B is a color having the center of the spectrum in a blue area. An optical system according to the present invention provides as high efficiency for light utilization as a scroll system, with a smaller burden on the signal processing circuit. In the following description, a display panel is divided into three areas and three color bands of R, G, B are utilized, but the present invention is not limited to such a configuration. A similar design is possible for different colors or for a different number of areas. Each light beam has, but is not limited, to in the present invention, a rectangular cross section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Next, explanation will be given of the first embodiment according to the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, optical system <b>1</b> includes light source portion <b>10</b>, rotatable prism <b>20</b>, light introducing portion <b>30</b>, color separating portion <b>40</b>, and illumination lens <b>50</b>. Light source portion <b>10</b> includes light source <b>11</b> which projects beam <b>14</b>, and reflector <b>12</b> which makes beam <b>14</b> converge at a predetermined position on optical axis <b>13</b>. Rotatable prism <b>20</b> causes beam <b>14</b> selectively to be incident on light introducing portion <b>30</b>. Light introducing portion <b>30</b>, which functions as light introducing means, includes first rod integrator <b>31</b>, second rod integrator <b>32</b>, and third rod integrator <b>33</b> serving as light introducing members. Color separating portion <b>40</b>, which functions as color separating means, includes first color separating member <b>41</b>, second color separating member <b>42</b>, and third color separating member <b>43</b>, each integrated with rod integrator <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>33</b>, respectively. Illumination lens <b>50</b> makes beam <b>14</b>, which is emitted from each color separating member <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>43</b> in color separating portion <b>40</b>, converge on the entire display area of display panel <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Light source <b>11</b> may be, but is not limited to, a high-pressure mercury lamp for emitting a white light beam having a high brightness. Light source <b>11</b> is combined with reflector <b>12</b>. Reflector <b>12</b> has an oval mirror to generate a converged beam. Light source <b>11</b> is positioned near the first focal point of the oval mirror, so that beam <b>14</b> that is emitted from light source <b>11</b> is focused near the second focal point. A reflector with a parabolic surface may also be used. In this case, a convex lens with a desired focal length may be arranged just ahead of the reflector in order to make the beam converge near the focal point of the convex lens, because if the light source is arranged near the focal point of the parabolic mirror, then the light that is emitted from the light source and that is reflected by the parabolic mirror becomes approximately parallel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Light introducing portion <b>30</b> that includes the light introducing members i.e., first rod integrator <b>31</b>, second rod integrator <b>32</b>, and third rod integrator <b>33</b> is arranged near the convergent point of the beam that is emitted from light source <b>11</b> and reflector <b>12</b>. The light introducing members are not limited to rod integrators, and any elements that are able to emit light with uniform brightness distribution may be used. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a rod integrator is an optical element in a rectangular parallelepiped made of optical glass, having incident surface <b>34</b>, emitting surface <b>35</b>, and four sides <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>. Both surfaces <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> are ground. Preferably, rod integrators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> are made of the same material and have the same shape.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Alternatively, rod integrators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> may be combined together instead of being separated by air. In some embodiments, rod integrators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> are adhered together with reflective films coated therebetween to form reflective surfaces on adhered surface <b>37</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>

Accordingly, beam <b>14</b> is incident on first rod integrator <b>31</b> that is arranged in the middle. When rotatable prism <b>20</b> rotates clockwise, the angle of refraction of beam <b>14</b> at both incident surface <b>21</b> and emitting surface <b>22</b> of rotatable prism <b>20</b> is affected, thus optical axis <b>13</b> and beam <b>14</b> are generally biased downward. Consequently, as shown by the dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6B</figref>, the convergent point of beam <b>14</b> is shifted downward, and beam <b>14</b> that is emitted from light source <b>11</b> is incident on third rod integrator <b>33</b>. When rotatable prism <b>20</b> rotates further, beam <b>14</b>, in turn, is incident on second rod integrator <b>32</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, optical axis <b>13</b> is biased upward, and the convergent point of beam <b>14</b> is shifted to incident surface <b>34</b> of second rod integrator <b>32</b>. When rotatable prism <b>20</b> rotates further, the convergent point returns to the position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. In this way, converged beam <b>14</b> emitted from light source <b>11</b>A is incident on one of three rod integrators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> in accordance with the rotation of rotatable prism <b>22</b>. Scanning by rotatable prism <b>20</b> is preferably performed at a substantially constant speed. For that purpose, the rotation axis is preferably positioned at the center of rotatable prism <b>20</b>, and rotatable prism <b>20</b> is preferably rotated at a constant speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">The beam that is incident on rod integrators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> advances toward emitting surface <b>35</b> while repeating the internal reflections that are inside rod integrators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> on which the beam is incident. Ununiformity in brightness of light source <b>11</b> is eliminated in the process of transmitting of light, and uniform brightness distribution of the beam can be achieved at emitting surface <b>35</b>. The uniform beam is incident on color separating members <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> of color separating portion <b>40</b> which are integrated with rod integrators, just after the beam is emitted from rod integrators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>. The uniform beam is then separated into color bands of R, G, and B. For example, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, beam <b>14</b> that is incident on first rod integrator <b>31</b>, after being emitted from rod integrator <b>31</b>, is separated into the color beams of R, G, B, by means of cross dichroic prism <b>44</b> <i>a </i>in color separating member <b>41</b>, which is provided with dielectric multi-layer film <b>45</b> <i>a </i>that allows the beam of G to be transmitted and reflects the beam of B, and dielectric multi-layer film <b>46</b> <i>a </i>that allows the beam of G to be transmitted and reflects the beam of R. Color bands of R, G, B are formed in this order from top to bottom on emitting surface <b>35</b> of first rod integrator <b>31</b>. The color bands have an uniform brightness distribution. Dichroic prism <b>44</b> and rectangle prisms <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> are preferably shaped such that each color band corresponds to each divided area of the display area, which occupies one third of the display area of display panel <b>60</b>. Similarly, color bands of G, B, R are formed in this order from top to bottom on the emitting surface of second color separating member <b>42</b>, with uniform brightness distribution. Color bands of B, R, G are formed in this order from top to bottom on the emitting surface of third color separating member <b>43</b>, with uniform brightness distribution. In this way, the color bands formed on each emitting surface of three color separating members <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> are arranged in different orders. The color bands are projected onto the display area of display panel <b>60</b> through illumination lens <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">The color beams emitted from the emitting surface of second color separating member <b>42</b> are projected onto display panel <b>60</b> as color bands in the order of G, B, R from top to bottom, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. The color beams emitted from the emitting surface of first color separating member <b>41</b> are projected onto display panel <b>60</b> as color bands in the order of R, G, B from top to bottom, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Which color separating member <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> the beam is incident on depends on which rod integrators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, to which the color separating members are attached, beam <b>14</b> is incident on. Accordingly, the color bands which are projected onto display panel <b>60</b> through illumination lens <b>50</b> are switched in a sequential and time-divisional manner, in accordance with the switching of the beam that is selectively incident on rod integrators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> through the rotation of rotatable prism <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a time for displaying one frame of a picture is represented by T, and times for displaying sub-frames are represented by T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, and T<b>3</b>. The color of the beams which are projected onto first display area <b>61</b> <i>a </i>of display panel <b>60</b> is G during time T<b>1</b>, R during time T<b>2</b>, and B during time T<b>3</b>, respectively. In other words, color beams are repeatedly switched in the order of G, R, B, G, R, B. Similarly, color beams are repeatedly projected onto second display area <b>61</b> <i>b </i>in the order of B, G, R, B, G, R, and color beams are projected onto third display area <b>61</b> <i>c </i>in the order of R, B, G, R, B, G. Each sub-frame is projected by any one of color beams of R, G, B at any one time, and the color of the beam that is projected onto each divided area <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>61</b> <i>c </i>in display area <b>61</b> of display panel <b>60</b> sequentially changes. Accordingly, all the beam that is generated by light source <b>11</b> is used to illuminate display panel <b>60</b> without being wasted at any time, resulting in sufficiently high efficiency for light utilization. Moreover, the light in the form of color bands which are formed by rod integrators <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> is projected onto display panel <b>60</b> with uniform brightness, allowing images to be enlarged and projected through projection lens <b>50</b> with uniform brightness and with high quality. Rotatable prism <b>20</b> is rotated at a predetermined speed, and the timing for projecting the color beams on first area <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, second area <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, and third area <b>61</b> <i>c </i>in display area <b>61</b> and the timing for driving display panel <b>60</b> are synchronized.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In this embodiment, the color bands are switched in each divided areas <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>61</b> <i>c</i>, ensuring sufficient time for displaying images during each sub-frame time. Since the color of each divided area remains unchanged during each sub-frame time, it is possible to achieve sufficient gradations of color without complicated PWM control. As a result, high quality images can be displayed with a smaller burden on the signal processing circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Needless to say, projector <b>100</b> with projection lens <b>70</b> for enlarging the image on display panel <b>60</b> can be provided as well. Projector <b>100</b> has sufficient brightness and high efficiency for light utilization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">Next, explanation will be given of an optical system of the second embodiment according to the present invention. The second embodiment is a modification of the first embodiment. Configuration and operations are similar to those of the first embodiment except for light introducing portion <b>30</b> and color separating portion <b>40</b>, and detailed explanation of the similar portions will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">In this embodiment, light introducing portion <b>130</b> has three rod integrators <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>133</b>, similar to the first embodiment. However, the design of incident surface <b>134</b> differs from that of the first embodiment. Dichroic filters <b>144</b>, <b>145</b>, <b>146</b>, which constitute color separating portion <b>140</b>, are formed on emitting surfaces <b>135</b> such that each dichroic filter is integrated with the respective rod integrator. In other words, the light introducing portion is a light introducing means that is combined with a color separating portion, and therefore, color separating members are not separate elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>9</b>B and <b>9</b>C, exemplary first rod integrator <b>131</b> is shown. Reflective mirrors <b>138</b> are formed on the right and left sides of incident surface <b>134</b> of first rod integrator <b>131</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. Rod integrators <b>132</b>, <b>131</b>, <b>133</b> are stacked in the vertical direction, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, allowing incident beam <b>14</b> to vertically scan the rod integrators except for reflective mirrors <b>138</b>. Three dichroic filters, i.e., first dichroic filter <b>144</b>, second dichroic filter <b>145</b>, and third dichroic filter <b>146</b>, are formed on emitting surfaces <b>135</b>. Dichroic filters are designed such that the divided areas of emitting surface <b>135</b>, which occupy, for example, one-third, respectively, allow beams of colors which are different to each other to be transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, second rod integrator <b>132</b>, first rod integrator <b>131</b>, and third rod integrator <b>133</b>, which constitute light introducing portion <b>130</b>, are arranged vertically. Dichroic filters <b>144</b>, <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> are formed on each emitting surface <b>135</b> of three rod integrators <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> in the same direction as the rod integrators are stacked. Dichroic filters <b>144</b>, <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> allow one color beam to be transmitted and to reflect the other color beams such that the order of the color in each rod integrator differs from the others. Accordingly, three rod integrators <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> generate color bands with colors arranged in a different order on the respective emitting surfaces <b>135</b>. The configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> provides the same effect as the first embodiment that is explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>. Rod integrators are arranged vertically in this embodiment, compared with the first embodiment in which rod integrators are arranged horizontally. Thus, rotatable prism <b>20</b> is rotated about a rotating axis that is inclined by 90 degrees compared to that of the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">By virtue of reflective mirrors <b>138</b> which are arranged on incident surface <b>134</b>, the color beams which are not allowed to be transmitted through dichroic filters <b>144</b>, <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> at emitting surface <b>135</b> are re-used inside rod integrators <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>133</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Similar to the first embodiment, the color beams which are emitted from emitting surface <b>135</b> of rod integrators <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> are projected onto display panel <b>60</b> through illumination lens <b>50</b>, such that different color beams are sequentially projected onto each of the divided display areas of display panel <b>60</b>. Accordingly, all the beam that is generated by light source <b>11</b> contributes to illuminate display panel <b>60</b> without being wasted at any time. Therefore, full color images with uniform brightness distribution are provided by optical system <b>1</b>. Further, since light introducing portion <b>30</b> has the function of generating color bands as well, a reduction in the number of elements, and thus a compact design, can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">Next, explanation will be given of an optical system of the third embodiment according to the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, optical system <b>2</b> includes light source portion <b>210</b>, color separating portion <b>240</b>, rotatable prism <b>220</b>, light introducing portion <b>230</b>, and illumination lens <b>250</b>. Light source portion <b>210</b> includes light source <b>211</b> which projects beam <b>214</b>, and reflector <b>212</b> which makes beam <b>214</b> converge at a predetermined position on optical axis <b>213</b>. Color separating portion <b>240</b>, which functions as color separating portion, includes color separating members, i.e., first dichroic mirror (G) <b>241</b>, second dichroic mirror (R) <b>242</b>, and reflective mirror <b>243</b>. Rotatable prism <b>20</b> functions as projecting means. Light introducing portion <b>230</b>, which functions as light introducing means, includes light introducing members, i.e., first rod integrator <b>231</b>, second rod integrator <b>232</b>, and third rod integrator <b>233</b>. Illumination lens <b>250</b> makes the color beams, which are emitted from rod integrators <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> of light introducing portion <b>230</b>, converge on display panel <b>260</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">Light source <b>211</b> may be, but is not limited to, a high-pressure mercury lamp for emitting a white light beam having a high brightness. Light source <b>211</b> is combined with reflector <b>212</b>. Reflector <b>212</b> has an oval mirror to generate a beam that will converge at a predetermined position. As described in the first embodiment, a reflector with a parabolic surface also may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">Beam <b>214</b> that is emitted from light source <b>211</b> and reflector <b>212</b> converges on optical axis <b>213</b> of light source <b>211</b>. Color separating portion <b>240</b> which functions as color separating means is arranged at the converging beam. Color separating portion <b>240</b> is provided, for example, with second dichroic mirror <b>242</b> to reflect the beam of R and to allow the transmission of the beam of G and B, first dichroic mirror <b>241</b> to allow the transmission of the beam of B and to reflect the beam of G, and with reflective mirror <b>243</b>. A dichroic mirror to reflect the beam of B may be used instead of reflective mirror <b>243</b>. This combination of mirrors is only an example, and other designs for a color separating portion are possible using any optical elements that are capable of separating a white light beam into three color beams and of reflecting the separated beams. Beam <b>214</b> is not limited to a white light beam, and any beam may be used which can be separated into three colors beams.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">In one embodiment, first dichroic mirror <b>241</b> is arranged at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to optical axis <b>213</b> of light source lamp <b>211</b>, second dichroic mirror <b>242</b> is arranged at an angle of 41 degrees, and reflective mirror <b>243</b> is arranged at an angle of 49 degrees, respectively. This arrangement allows each color beam, which is reflected by each optical member, to converge on the corresponding incident surface of three rod integrators <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> of light introducing portion <b>230</b>. The positional relationship among light source portion <b>210</b>, color separating portion <b>240</b>, and the three rod integrators of light introducing portion <b>230</b> may be modified such that each beam <b>214</b> that is emitted from color separating portion <b>240</b> is converged on each of the three rod integrators <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">Converged beams of R, G, B which are separated by color separating portion <b>240</b> are converged at three points, one of which is on the optical axis, and the other two are in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis. The incident surfaces of rod integrators <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, which function as the light introducing members of light introducing portion <b>230</b>, are arranged near the converged points. The light introducing members are not limited to rod integrators, and any optical elements may be used which are capable of emitting light with uniform brightness distribution. The brightness distribution needs not be completely uniform. Rotatable prism <b>220</b>, which is a projecting means, is arranged between color separating portion <b>240</b> and light introducing portion <b>230</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, light introducing portion <b>30</b> includes three rod integrators, i.e., first rod integrator <b>231</b>, second rod integrator <b>232</b> and third rod integrator <b>233</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, each rod integrator is a prism-shaped optical element made of optical glass which has incident surface <b>234</b>, emitting surface <b>235</b>, and four side surfaces. Each surface is preferably ground. Three rod integrators <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> are preferably integrated such that opposing sides are adhered together with no optical adverse effect, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. The surfaces of rod integrators <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> which are to be adhered together are preferably coated with reflective films by means of evaporation. If reflective films are coated on both surfaces of second rod integrator <b>232</b> by means of evaporation, reflective films do not need to be coated on the surfaces of first rod integrator <b>231</b> and third rod integrator <b>233</b>. Preferably, the aspect ratio of emitting surfaces <b>235</b> of the integrated rod integrators is approximately equal to that of display area <b>261</b> of display panel <b>260</b>. For example, if the size of display area <b>261</b> of display panel <b>260</b> is represented by horizontal dimension H and vertical dimension V, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, then it is preferable that the emitting surfaces of rod integrators have horizontal dimension mH and vertical dimension mV, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, where m is an arbitrary coefficient. It is preferable that the emitting surfaces of integrator <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, which together constitute the entire light introducing portion <b>230</b>, have vertical dimensions of mV/3, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">Illumination lens <b>250</b> is arranged just ahead of light introducing portion <b>230</b>. The beams of three color bands that are projected from illumination lens <b>250</b> are incident on display area <b>261</b> of display panel <b>260</b> which is arranged ahead of lens <b>250</b>, and generate three divided areas on display area <b>261</b> which are vertically arranged. The image formed on display panel <b>260</b> is projected and enlarged through projection lens <b>270</b> to be displayed on a projection screen, not shown, by projector <b>200</b>. In this way, illumination lens <b>250</b> projects the color beams which are emitted from the emitting surfaces of rod integrators <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> onto display panel <b>260</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">Display panel <b>260</b> may be, in addition to a transmission-type liquid crystal panel of a single plate, a reflective display panel as well, such as DMD or LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">Next, explanation will be given of the operation of optical system <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, beam <b>214</b> of white light that is emitted from light source <b>211</b> converges through reflector <b>212</b> having an oval surface. The converged beam is then separated into three converged beams R, G, B by means of color separating portion <b>240</b>. Beam <b>214</b> is not limited to white light, and any lights may be used that can be separated into three color beams.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">Color separating portion <b>240</b> consists of first dichroic mirror <b>241</b> to reflect a beam of G that is inclined at 45 degrees with regard to optical axis <b>213</b> of light source lamp <b>211</b>, second dichroic mirror <b>242</b> to reflect a beam of R that is inclined at −4 degrees with regard to first dichroic mirror <b>241</b>, and reflective mirror <b>243</b> that is inclined at +4 degrees with regard to first dichroic mirror <b>241</b>. Of the white light beam incident on color separating portion <b>240</b>, a beam of G is reflected by first dichroic mirror <b>241</b> at an angle of 90 degrees. A beam of R is reflected by second dichroic mirror <b>242</b> at an angle of −8 degrees with regard to the beam of G. A beam of B is reflected by reflective mirror <b>243</b> by an angle of +8 degrees with regard to the beam of G. In this way, the converging light beam that is emitted from the light source is separated into three converged beams of R, G, B. Three converged beams of R, G, B are incident on incident surfaces <b>234</b> of three rod integrators <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> of light introducing portion <b>230</b>, respectively.

The color of the beams which are projected onto first display area <b>261</b> <i>a </i>of display panel <b>260</b> is G during time T<b>1</b>, R during time T<b>2</b>, and B during time T<b>3</b>. In other words, color beams are projected repeatedly in the order of G, R, B, G, R, B. Similarly, color beams are projected repeatedly onto second display area <b>261</b> <i>b </i>in the order of B, G, R, B, G, R, and color beams are projected onto third display area <b>261</b> <i>c </i>in the order of R, B, G, R, B, G. Each sub-frame is projected repeatedly by any one of color beams of R, G, B at any one time, and the color of the beam that is projected onto each divided area <b>261</b> <i>a</i>, <b>261</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>261</b> <i>c </i>in display area <b>261</b> of display panel <b>260</b> sequentially changes. Accordingly, all the beam that is generated by light source <b>211</b> is used to illuminate display panel <b>260</b> without being wasted at any time, resulting in sufficiently high efficiency for light utilization. Moreover, light in the form of color bands which are formed by rod integrators <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> is projected onto display panel <b>260</b> with uniform brightness, allowing images to be enlarged and projected through projection lens <b>250</b> with uniform brightness and with high quality. Therefore, by synchronizing the timing for projecting the color beams onto first area <b>261</b> <i>a</i>, second area <b>261</b> <i>b</i>, and third area <b>261</b> <i>c </i>in display area <b>261</b> and the timing for driving display panel <b>260</b>, full color images with uniform brightness and with high efficiency can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">The rod integrators of light introducing portion <b>230</b> may be variously modified in addition to the above-mentioned configuration. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, in one embodiment, light introducing portion <b>430</b> consists of three rod integrators, i.e., first rod integrator <b>431</b>, second rod integrator <b>432</b>, and third rod integrator <b>433</b>. Second rod integrator <b>432</b> has a shorter length than the others. Surfaces <b>437</b> <i>a </i>and <b>437</b> <i>b </i>of first rod integrator <b>431</b> and third rod integrator <b>433</b> are bound together via reflective films. This configuration makes the boundaries in emitting surfaces <b>435</b> of the three rod integrators, namely, the boundaries between first display area <b>261</b> <i>a </i>and second display area <b>261</b> <i>b</i>, and between second display area <b>261</b> <i>b </i>and third display area <b>261</b> <i>c </i>in display area <b>261</b> of display panel <b>260</b>, more inconspicuous, resulting in improved quality of the displayed images.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">Next, explanation will be given of an optical system of the fourth embodiment according to the present invention. The fourth embodiment is a modification of the third embodiment. Configuration and operations are similar to those of the third embodiment except for light introducing portion <b>230</b>, and detailed explanation of the similar portions will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">In optical system <b>2</b> according to the third embodiment, integrated light introducing portion <b>230</b> that includes three rod integrators is used. Three color bands, in which the order of color changes sequentially, are formed on emitting surfaces of the rod integrators, and the color bands are projected onto display panel <b>260</b> at any one time. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, integrated light introducing portion <b>330</b> of the fourth embodiment includes two rod integrators <b>331</b>, <b>332</b>. If the size of a display panel is represented by horizontal dimension H and vertical dimension V, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, then it is preferable that each emitting surface of the rod integrators has horizontal dimension mH/2 and by vertical dimension mV/2, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>. The color beams which are emitted from emitting surfaces <b>335</b> of first rod integrator <b>331</b> and second rod integrator <b>332</b> are projected onto display panel <b>360</b>, and thus different color beams are repeatedly projected onto first display area <b>361</b> <i>a </i>and second display area <b>361</b> <i>b </i>in display area <b>361</b> of display panel <b>360</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the color beam that is projected onto display area <b>361</b> <i>a </i>of display panel <b>360</b> changes in the order of G(T<b>1</b>), R(T<b>2</b>), B(T<b>3</b>) in time T. In second display area <b>361</b> <i>b</i>, the color beam changes in the order of B(T<b>1</b>), G(T<b>2</b>), R(T<b>3</b>) in time T. Therefore, full color images can be displayed by synchronizing the timing for projecting color beams onto first area <b>361</b> <i>a </i>and second area <b>361</b> <i>b </i>and the timing for driving display panel <b>360</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">In this embodiment, two color beams out of three beams of R, G, B which are generated in color separating portion <b>240</b> are incident on two rod integrators, i.e., first rod integrator <b>331</b> and second rod integrator <b>332</b> at any one time. Accordingly, the fourth embodiment is less advantageous than the third embodiment as regards the efficiency use of light. However, the fourth embodiment is significantly advantageous in view of efficiency for light utilization, as compared to a conventional color wheel system in which two-thirds of light is wasted at any time, because the loss of light is reduced to one-third. Further, since color bands are periodically projected for two-divided screen display areas <b>361</b> <i>a </i>and <b>361</b> <i>b</i>, a longer time for displaying images can be ensured for each sub-frame time compared with the third embodiment. Since color bands remain unchanged during each sub-frame time, it is possible to achieve sufficient gradations of color without complicated PWM control. As a result, high quality images can be displayed with a smaller burden on the signal processing circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">Next, a fifth embodiment of the present invention, which is a projector having the optical system according to the present invention, will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 11</figref>.
