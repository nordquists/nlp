<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a phase-change optical recording medium (such as, DVD-RW, DVD+RW or DVD-RAM) where the irradiation of laser beam causes optical changes to a recording material of a recording layer therefore information is recorded and reproduced; and the information is rewritable, and relates specifically to an optical recording medium having performance responsive to high-speed recording linear velocity, as well.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Conventionally, in a phase-change optical recording medium where information is recorded and reproduced onto/from a recording layer and the information is rewritable, the recording layer contains four elements, Ag, In, Sb and Te, as primary components. The objective is to improve the recording linear velocity on the basis of stable signal processing, making it possible to stably perform recording and reproducing at 1×-speed to 4×-speed of a recording linear velocity of DVD-ROM (3.49 m/s), which is now commercially available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In the optical recording medium, the manner in which to conduct heat subtly changes depending upon an optical constant or film thickness of each layer laminated on a substrate, and may greatly affect the recording characteristic in a mark recorded on the recording layer, or reflectance or modulation factor may change. As in Patent Literature 1, the film thickness of each layer laminated onto a substrate, an optical constant of a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase in the recording layer, an optical constant regarding a protective layer and a reflective layer, and the condition for groove depth of a transparent substrate are important factors relating to recording characteristics and signal processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">In addition, in order to realize high-speed recording, recording must be performed with additionally higher power, so the storage reliability becomes more severe than in comparison with the conventional art. Using Ag having high thermal conductivity for a reflective layer binds with S in ZnS—SiO<sub>2 </sub>of a protective layer and Ag<sub>2</sub>S is formed, so it is necessary to establish a sulfidation prevention layer between the reflective layer and the protective layer. However, recording with higher power causes the easy occurrence of peeling-off with interference between the Ag reflective layer and the sulfidation prevention layer, leading to the problem that a disc defect easily occurs after repeated recording or after long-term storage in a severe environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">As a related well-known technology, Patent Literature 2 discloses an invention where tantalum oxide, tantalum and nickel are used for an intermediate layer making contact with an Ag reflective layer, and M<sub>w</sub>(Sb<sub>z</sub>Te<sub>1-z</sub>)<sub>1-w</sub>, provided that 0≦w≦0.3 and 0.5≦z≦0.9, for a recording layer. However, the invention has different constituent elements from those in the sulfidation prevention layer of the present invention; and in addition, recording is performed at 2×-speed of CD (2.4 m/s), which is at a lower velocity, and lower density compared to those in the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Further, Patent Literature 3 relating to the present application by the applicant discloses an invention where Si, SiC, Ge and GeCr are used for a sulfidation prevention layer making contact with an Ag reflective layer, and GaαGeβInySbδTeε (provided that 0&lt;α&lt;7, 0&lt;β&lt;10, 0&lt;γ&lt;5, 60&lt;δ&lt;80 and 0&lt;ε&lt;5) is used for a recording layer. However, the invention has different constituent elements from those in the sulfidation prevention layer of the present invention. In addition, recording is performed at 20 m/s at maximum, which is at a lower velocity compared to that of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Further, Patent Literature 4 discloses an invention where a recording layer composed of GeSbIn, and recording is performed at 2.4 m/s to 9.6 m/s, which is at a lower velocity compared to that in the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The present invention is directed at providing a DVD+RW recordable at 6×-speed to 8×-speed of DVD-ROM (hereafter, simply referred to as ‘6×-speed to 8×-speed), and optical constants in a crystalline state and an amorphous state in a recording layer, and the groove condition to control high reflectance are studied; concurrently, the sulfidation prevention layer is also studied.

<heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The present invention is described hereafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In the optical recording medium of the present invention, a first protective layer; a recording layer composed of a phase-change recording material comprising at least four elements, Ga, Sb, Sn and Ge, and where a transfer linear velocity is 20 mg/s or faster; a second layer; and a reflective layer are laminated onto a transparent substrate in this order. The transfer linear velocity is a physical quantity substituting a crystallization kinetic unique to each phase-change recording material, and herein, it indicates a velocity where the reflectance starts decreasing rapidly in the case of researching the scanning speed dependency of crystalline reflectance by irradiating a continuous light with 18 mW. If a phase-change recording material where the transfer linear velocity is 20 m/s or faster is used, no amorphousness is occurred even though a light is continuously irradiated while the optical recording medium is rotated at less than 20 m/s. Further, if a phase-change recording material where the transfer linear speed is 30 m/s or slower is used, the amorphousness can be easily conducted at approximately 6×-speed to 8×-speed of the recording linear velocity. If the transfer linear velocity becomes faster than this, the amorphousness becomes difficult and recording becomes difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">As a recording material of the recording layer, a phase-change recording material responsive to the recording linear velocity at approximately 6×-speed to 8×-speed is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">In the present invention, it is essential to record an amorphous mark more securely than the case of recording the mark at 1×-speed to 4×-speed, and for the absorption coefficient in the crystalline state of the recording layer, the higher the better. However, if it is excessively high, the remaining heat is filled and characteristic deteriorates. Further, for the refractive index in the amorphous state, the greater the better. There is a report that it is desirable that the refractive index &amp; the extinction coefficient in the crystalline state and the refractive index &amp; the extinction coefficient in the amorphous state in the AgInSbTe-base phase-change recording material, which is a conventional phase-change recording material, are within the range of 2 to 4, 2 to 4, 2.5 to 4 and 2.5 to 3.5, respectively (Patent Literature 1). As result of researching the GaSbSnGe-base phase-change recording material with reference to these findings by the inventors of the present application, the result shown in the below-described Table 1 was obtained. Furthermore, “as-depo optical constant” in the table is equivalent to the optical constant in the amorphous state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">On the basis of the results in Table 1, in the present invention, when the wavelength of recording/reproducing light is within the range of 650 nm to 665 nm and the recording linear speed is 20 m/s to 28 m/s (approximately 6×-speed to 8×-speed), a phase-change recording material where the refractive index Nc &amp; the extinction coefficient Kc in the crystalline state and the refractive index Na &amp; the extinction coefficient Ka in the amorphous state in the recording layer are within the following ranges is used:
<br/>
2.0≦Nc≦3.0
<br/>
4.0≦Kc≦5.0
<br/>
4.0≦Na≦5.0
<br/>
2.5≦Ka≦3.1
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Furthermore, when the wavelength of the recording/reproducing light is within the range of 650 nm to 665 nm and the recording linear velocity is 20 m/s to 28 m/s (approximately 6×-speed to 8×-speed), the refractive index Nc &amp; the extinction coefficient Kc in the crystalline state and the refractive index Na &amp; the extinction coefficient Ka in the amorphous state in the recording layer can be measured as follows. Immediately after the preparation of the recording layer composed of the phase-change recording layer with 100 nm of thickness on a polycarbonate transparent substrate with 0.6 mm of thickness, Na and Ka in the amorphous state in the recording layer are measured by spectroellipsometry. Furthermore, after the initialization of the phase-change recording layer with an initializer, Na and Ka in the crystalline phase are measured by spectroellipsometry. The optical constants are measured by spectroellipsometry with a VASE and a WVASE32 software (J.A. Woollam Japan Co., Inc.). The initializer used here is a POP120-7AH (Hitachi Computer Peripherals Co., Ltd.). The conditions for the initialization are 900 mW of laser power, 11 m/s of linear velocity, and 37 μm of head feed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Further, an element(s) other than the four elements, Ga, Sb, Sn and Ge, such as, Te, can be added to the optical recording medium of the present invention. For the added quantity of the element (atomic %), as long as the range is small to some extent, an effect on the above-mentioned refractive index and extinction coefficient is small, and the recording characteristic at high-speed recording, approximately at 6×-speed to 8×-speed, becomes excellent. The below-mentioned Table 2 shows the data in the case that the added element is Te, and it is clear that it is preferable to control the composition ratio at 5 atomic % or less. Preferably the total of contents of the four elements, Ga, Sb, Sn and Ge, in the recording layer is 95 atomic % or greater relative to all elements in the recording layer. Te contributes to the easiness of the initial crystallization. In addition, for the purpose of the improvement of various characteristics, other element, such as In, Zn, Ag or Cu, can be added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Further, the conventional AgInSbTe-base phase-change recording material is not suitable for high linear velocity recording because the crystallization kinetic is slow, so the amorphous mark cannot be accurately recorded at 6×-speed to 8×-speed. Therefore, the development of a new phase-change recording material recordable at 6×-speed to 8×-speed is required. Up to the present, as a recording material, a three-element material, Ga, Sb and Sn, and the four-element material, Ga, Sb, Sn and Ge, have been developed. However, any material sufficiently responsive to recording at 6×-speed to 8×-speed has not been obtained yet. Then, the inventors of the present application have developed the phase-change recording material responsive to recording at approximately 6×-speed to 8×-speed by determining the composition ratio of each element within the range of several %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In other words, according to the research up to the present, it has been clear that because the crystallization kinetic of the SbSn compound is very fast, there is a possibility of realizing a high-speed recording medium with excellent recording sensitivity. However, the storage condition at room temperature is poor, so the SbSn compound cannot be independently used as a recording material. Then, if Ga or Ge is added, the amorphousness becomes easier and it results in easy recording. Ga and Ge have a function to slow the crystallization kinetic down, so the crystallization kinetic can be controlled to be responsive to the recording linear velocity at approximately 6×-speed to 8×-speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Therefore, in the recording layer of the present invention, it is desirable to satisfy the following conditions regarding the composition ratio (atomic %) of the four elements, Ga, Sb, Sn and Ge, as α, β, γ and δ, respectively.
<br/>
2≦α≦11
<br/>
59≦β≦70
<br/>
17≦γ≦26
<br/>
2≦δ≦12
<br/>
84≦β+γ≦88
<br/>
α+β+γ+δ=100
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In the above-mentioned conditions, if Sb is less than 59%, the melting point becomes higher, so the sensitivity becomes poor, and if Sb exceeds 70%, it becomes difficult to record an amorphous mark; thus excellent recording characteristics cannot be obtained. If Sn is less than 17%, the crystallization kinetic starts slowing down, so the sensitivity becomes poor, and if Sn exceeds 26%, the crystallization kinetic becomes excessively fast and it becomes difficult to become amorphous, so it is not preferable. If Ga or Ge is less than 2%, the storage reliability deteriorates, and if Ga exceeds 11% or Ge exceeds 12%, the crystallization temperature becomes excessively high and the initial crystallization becomes difficult, so it is not preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In addition, if a total of Sb and Sn is less than 84% or exceeds 88%, it causes excessively slow or fast crystallization kinetic, respectively, so a recording layer suitable for recording at 6×-speed to 8×-speed cannot be obtained. Examining the range of the total composition ratio of Sb to Sn where the recording characteristic at 8×-speed becomes excellent, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the recording characteristic becomes excellent when the total of Sb+Sn is within the range of 84% to 88%, and it has become clear that if the total is out of this range, the recording characteristic deteriorates. As described above, in order to securely perform the high-speed recording, not only providing the composition ratio of Sb to Sn independently, but it is also important to provide the range of the total composition ratio of Sb to Sn.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows comparison data of the storage stability according to whether or not Ge is contained. As an example, in Ga<sub>11.9</sub>Sb<sub>73.1</sub>Sn<sub>15 </sub>(a line through the diamond points in the chart), which is phase-change recording material containing no Ge, the reflectance after the initialization decreases by 5.7% after 100 hours under the atmosphere at 85% of humidity and 80° C. of temperature, so the crystal condition is changed and recording becomes difficult. Further, even after recording, the storage condition at a space region deteriorates and the jitter characteristic deteriorates. However, in Ga<sub>5</sub>Sb<sub>70</sub>Sn<sub>17</sub>Ge<sub>8 </sub>(a line through the square points in the chart), which is a phase-change recording material where Ge is added, the fluctuation is defused, so the reflectance after the initialization decreased by less than 1.5% even after 900 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the storage characteristic of the GaSbSnGe-base phase-change recording material (jitter characteristic after 0 time, 10 times, 1000 times of overwriting (DOW0 (the line through the diamond points in the chart), DOW10 (the line through the square points in the chart) and DOW1000 (the line through the triangular points in the chart), respectively), and no jitter fluctuation occurs even after 900-hour storage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">For the film thickness of the recording layer, the range of 5 nm to 50 nm is desirable, and the range of 10 nm to 20 nm is more preferable. If the film thickness is thinner than 5 nm, defects caused by deterioration due to the repeated recording occur. Further, if the film thickness is thicker than 50 nm, jitter characteristics become poor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">As the first protective layer material, transparent material where a light is efficiently transmitted through and the melting point is 1000° C. or higher is preferable. The oxide, nitride or sulfide is mainly used; among these, it is preferable to use a mixture of ZnS and SiO<sub>2 </sub>where the internal stress and the absorbency index are small. Since ZnS has small thermal conductivity, the thermal diffusion during recording can be reduced, resulting in the increased recording sensitivity. However, ZnS changes to a crystal at the time of initialization or recording, deteriorating the stability of the recording layer, so a mixture with SiO<sub>2 </sub>inhibiting the crystallization of ZnS should be used. For the composition, it is preferable that ZnS SiO<sub>2</sub>=60:40 to 90:10 (mol %). In particular, it is preferable that ZnS SiO<sub>2</sub>=80:20 (mole ratio).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">For the film thickness, the range of 30 nm to 100 nm is desirable. If the film thickness is out of this range, it becomes difficult to certainly secure 60% or greater modulation factor. Further, if the film thickness becomes smaller than 30 nm, because the reflectance fluctuation according to the film thickness becomes greater, it becomes difficult to stably form the layer, and, if the film thickness becomes thicker than 100 nm, the deposition time becomes longer and the productivity of the optical recording medium decreases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">As a second protective layer material, material having the same characteristics as that of the first protective layer is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">For the film thickness, the range of 3 nm to 15 nm is preferable. If the film thickness is less than 3 nm, defects, such as poor recording sensitivity or the reduction of modulation factor, may be encountered. If the film thickness is larger than 15 nm, there is excessive heat, and an amorphous mark becomes smaller due to the residual heat and the recording characteristic becomes poor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Metal material is used for the reflective layer, and metal material, such as Al, Ag, Au or Cu, or an alloy material of these metal materials, is often used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">For the film thickness, the range of 100 nm to 300 nm is preferable. If the film thickness is less than 100 nm, heat radiation efficiency may be deteriorated. Furthermore, even if the film thickness is larger than 300 nm, the heat radiation efficiency will not be improved, but rather the thickness of the film become larger beyond necessity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In the aspect where the first protective layer and the second protective layer comprise a mixture of ZnS and SiO<sub>2 </sub>and the reflective layer comprise Ag or alloy where Ag is a main component, it is preferable to additionally establish a sulfidation prevention layer between the second protective layer and the reflective layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a layer construction example of the optical recording medium of the present invention, and is a construction where a first protective layer 2 containing the mixture of ZnS and SiO<sub>2</sub>, a recording layer 3, a second protective layer 4 containing the mixture of ZnS and SiO<sub>2</sub>, a sulfidation prevention layer 5 and a reflective layer 6 composed of Ag alloy are laminated in order onto a transparent substrate 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">A reversible phase transition between the crystal and amorphous states of the phase-change recording layer by the irradiation of a laser beam from the substrate side results in recording and erasure of information. DVD+RW is in the crystalline state before recording, and the irradiation of a modulated laser beam and quenching of the recording layer result in the formation of an amorphous mark. At this time, in order to directly perform the repeated recording of the amorphous mark, it is necessary to crystallize the amorphous mark in shorter period as recording speed increases; therefore, a phase-change recording material with fast crystallization kinetic is required. Further, if using a material with fast crystallization kinetic, re-crystallization progresses from the periphery of the amorphous mark immediately after the mark formation and the mark becomes smaller. In order to reduce the re-crystallization region, it is better to have a quenching structure where cooling velocity is fast, so it is preferable to use Ag or alloy where Ag is a main component, which has high thermal conductivity, for the reflective layer. Herein, the main component means contains 90 atomic % of Ag. Further, as an element forming alloy with Ag; Cu, Pd, Ti, Cr and Ta are provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">However, Ag tends to migrate rapidly within a layer, and, in addition, it reacts with S to easily form Ag<sub>2</sub>S. Consequently, it is preferable to establish a sulfidation prevention layer. For the sulfidation prevention layer, SiC or Si, which has been conventionally used, can be used. However, from viewpoints to improve the adhesion between the reflective layer and the sulfidation prevention layer and to prevent the generation of disc defects such as the formation of loose film even after repeated recording or the long-term storage in a severe environment, it is preferable to use a mixture of TiC and TiO. To achieve faster recording speed, larger recording power is required. Therefore, if the adhesion between the sulfidation prevention layer and ZnS—SiO<sub>2 </sub>or Ag is not strong enough, film peeling-off occurs easily after repeated recording, compared to the optical recording medium for low-speed recording. For SiC, since the coefficients of thermal expansion of Ag and SiC are markedly different from each other, the internal-stress of the film increases upon the initialization or upon recording, and the film peeling-off may occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Then, using the mixture of TiO, whose coefficient of thermal expansion is close to that of Ag, and which has good adhesion with Ag, and TiC, which has an effect to prevent the Ag dispersion, for the sulfidation prevention layer between the Ag reflective layer and the second protective layer and combining with the above-mentioned recording layer enable the provision of an optical recording medium where the modulation factor is great, and suitable to high-speed recording, and where the storage stability is more excellent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Further, setting the total film thickness of the second protective layer and the sulfidation prevention layer at 7 nm to 20 nm enables the provision of the optical recording medium with a greater modulation factor. More preferably, setting the total film thickness of the above-mentioned two layers at 7 nm to 15 nm enables excellent repeated recording characteristics. In high-speed recording, the cooling velocity of the recording layer greatly changes of recording characteristics, so the total film thickness of the second protective layer and the sulfidation prevention layer, which are interposed between the reflective layer and the recording layer greatly affecting the cooling velocity, is important.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">It is preferable that the composition of the sulfidation prevention layer be (TiC)<sub>p</sub>(TiO)<sub>100-p </sub>and 50≦p≦80 (‘p’ is % by mass). When ‘p’ is 80 or less, a greater modulation factor can be obtained, and when ‘p’ is 50 or greater, excellent repeated recording characteristics can be obtained. The greater ‘p’ becomes, the greater the thermal conductivity becomes. However, if the thermal conductivity of the sulfidation prevention layer is excessively great, the modulation factor becomes smaller, and if the thermal conductivity is excessively small, heating occurs and the repeated recording characteristic becomes especially poor. The thermal conductivity and the difference of film thickness of the layers interposed between the reflective layer and the recording layer especially affect the high-speed recording, so if these are not within an appropriate range, respectively, excellent recording characteristics where rewritable optical disc system can be realized cannot be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Further, a layer composed of a mixture of ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and TiO<sub>2 </sub>can be established between the second protective layer and the sulfidation prevention layer with 2 nm to 8 nm of thickness. If using a mixture of TiC and TiO for the sulfidation prevention layer, even though the modulation factor can easily become smaller compared to the case of using SiC, the establishment of the above-mentioned mixture layer increases the modulation factor. For the composition, it is preferable to mix 60 mol % or greater of ZrO<sub>2 </sub>and 10 mol % or greater of TiO<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Further, it is preferable to establish an interface layer composed of SiO<sub>2 </sub>with 2 nm to 4 nm of thickness between the first protective layer and the phase-change recording layer. This reduces damage to a substrate when recording is performed at high power, so the repeated recording characteristic in the high power recording becomes excellent, and the recording power margin can be widened. If the thickness is less than 2 nm, it becomes difficult to form a uniform SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer, and if the thickness exceeds 4 nm, the recording sensitivity becomes poor and the modulation factor diminishes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">For the transparent substrate, a plastic substrate is generally used. As the plastic substrate, as long as it has transparency and it excels in planar accuracy, there is no special limitation. Any substrate, which has been conventionally used as a transparent substrate for an optical recording medium, can be optionally selected and used. As a typical example, a glass plate and a polycarbonate plate are provided. Concerning the optical constant, it is preferable that the refractive index be 1.5 to 1.6.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">In addition, it is preferable that the transparent substrate has a wobbled groove with 0.74±0.03 μm of track pitch, 22 nm to 40 nm of groove depth and 0.2 μm to 0.3 μm of groove width. As a purpose of having the wobbled groove, there are the access to an unrecorded specific track and the rotation of the substrate at a constant linear velocity. The optical recording medium of the present invention is produced for the purpose of enabling response to the recording at approximately 6×-speed to 8×-speed. Sn is added to a GaSb-base material for the purpose of improving the recording characteristic and accelerating the crystallization kinetic. However, it should be noted that the effect of Sn contained in the recording layer causes increased reflectance. For example, as a result of researching about the optical recording medium of the present invention where the groove depth of the transparent substrate is 20 nm, the film thickness of the first protective layer is 30 nm to 100 nm, the film thickness of the recording layer is 5 nm to 50 nm, the film thickness of the second protective layer is 3 nm to 15 nm, the film thickness of the reflective layer is 100 nm to 300 nm and the relative composition ratios of the four elements in the recording layer fulfill the above-mentioned requirement, it has become clear that the reflectance at an unrecorded region (crystalline substance) becomes within the range of 26% to 32%. However, if comparing this reflectance with reflectance at 1×-speed to 4×-speed of DVD+RW, which is a conventional phase-change optical recording medium, it is unnecessarily high. Therefore, taking the compatibility into consideration, it is necessary to adjust the reflectance by reduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Therefore, the conditions of the transparent substrate having the wobbled groove with 0.74 f 0.03 μm of track pitch, 22 nm to 40 nm of the groove depth and 0.2 μm to 0.3 μm of groove width are adopted. For example, researching about the transparent substrate by setting the groove depth at 37 nm, the reflectance could be reduced by approximately 2% to 3%. In the DVD disc having track pitch at 0.74±0.03 μm, a push-pull signal is mainly extracted as a signal used for detecting a tracking error. For the push-pull signal, at 660 nm of laser wavelength used for a DVD, the greatest signal intensity can be obtained if using the above-mentioned transparent substrate when the groove depth is 55 nm. In order to adjust the reflectance to be low and to increase the amplitude of an error signal, for the groove depth, the deeper the better. However, also taking the recording characteristic into consideration, it is preferable that the groove depth is within the range of 22 nm to 40 nm. Further, taking the recording characteristic and the signal characteristic into consideration, it has become clear that it is desirable for the groove width to be within 0.2 μm to 0.3 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">The present invention can provide a DVD+RW medium that enables the repeated recording at 20 m/s to 28 m/s (approximately 6×-speed to 8×-speed), and where the recording characteristic and storage characteristic are also excellent, and in addition, a DVD+RW where the reflectance of the recording layer is appropriately reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Hereafter, the present invention is more specifically described using Examples and Comparative Examples. However, the present invention will not be limited by these Examples.</div>
<heading>Examples A-1 to A-7 and Comparative Examples A-8 to A-19</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Discs where the first protective layer ZnS—SiO<sub>2 </sub>with 60 nm of thickness, the recording layer composed of the phase-change recording material shown in Table 1 with 16 nm of thickness, the second protective layer ZnS—SiO<sub>2 </sub>with 7 nm of thickness, the sulfidation prevention layer SiC with 4 nm of thickness and the reflective layer Ag with 140 nm of thickness were laminated in this order on a polycarbonate transparent substrate having 0.74 μm of track pitch, 27 nm of groove depth and 0.27 μm of groove width were prepared. These discs were initialized using an initializer for a phase-change disc, and a DVD+RW disc was obtained. For the initialization, an optical head with 48 μm of beam width was used, and crystallization was conducted under the conditions with 1300 mW of power (herein, it is power consumption of LD, and this is different from an irradiation power), 18.5 m/s of scanning speed and 30 μm/rotation of feed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">The recording layers of the above-mentioned discs are all composed of the GaSbSnGe-base material with various optical constants having sufficient transfer linear velocity at 20 m/s or faster. For these discs, the recording linear velocity was set at 6×-speed (20.9 m/s) and 8×-speed (27.9 m/s), and whether or not excellent recording characteristics could be obtained was examined. Recording was performed by repeating the intensity modulation with 2T cycle recording strategy having three levels (Pp&gt;Pe&gt;Pb), peak power ‘Pp’ for the purpose of forming an amorphous mark, bottom power ‘Pb’ for the purpose of providing a quenching efficacy and erasure power ‘Pe’ for the purpose of forming crystalline substance and erasing the information. A pulse generator is DTG-5274 manufactured by Tektronix Japan, Ltd., and the set resolving power is 3.348352 GHz. The evaluation device for this recording is DDU-1000 manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd and the specifications of the recording power are 40 mw with Pp at maximum and 18 mW with Pe at maximum. The peak power Pb was fixed at 0.1 mW and recording was performed. Numerical values used for criteria for the purpose of determining appropriateness of the recording characteristic are “Data to Clock Jitter (hereafter, referred to as DC jitter)” and “modulation factor”. The DC jitter is digitization of the gap of ends between the window ‘Tw’ upon reproducing at 1× speed (corresponding mark length is approximately 0.1333 μm) and nine types of marks regarding the window width Tw as unit (3Tw to 11Tw marks), and it means that the smaller the value becomes, the better the characteristic becomes. The modulation factor indicates how much the difference of the reflectance between a crystalline substance and an amorphous substance is occupied relative to the reflectance of the crystalline substance. Since the greater difference of the crystalline substance can be easily binarized, for the modulation factor, the greater the better. The evaluation criteria are as follows, and the numerical values are values after 10 times of overwriting (DOW10):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">&lt;DC jitter&gt; A: 9% or less, B: 11% or less, C: over 11%</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">As it is clear from Table 4, in the case that the total film thickness of the first protective layer and the sulfidation prevention layer is especially 7 nm to 20 nm, 60% or greater modulation factor, which is a standard value for DVD-ROM, could be obtained. In addition, in the case that the total film thickness is 7 nm to 15 nm, the jitter after 10 times of repeated recording was within 9%, which is a standard value; thus preferable repeated recording characteristics could be obtained. In the case that the total film thickness was less than 7 nm, the modulation factor was small and the jitter was 9% or greater. This was because heat was not sufficiently applied to the recording layer, the fused region was narrow, and the formed mark was small. Further, in the case that the total film thickness exceeded 20 nm, the modulation factor was also small and the jitter was also 9% or greater, because even though the fused region was wide, the period of time to be maintained in the temperature range where re-crystallization occurs was long, so re-crystallization progressed from the periphery of the mark, and as a result, the formed mark became small.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">Disc-shaped optical recording media were prepared similarly to Example B-3 except for changing the phase-change recording material to Sn<sub>20</sub>Sb<sub>65</sub>Ga<sub>5</sub>Ge<sub>10 </sub>(Nc=2.43, Kc=4.80, Na=4.40, Ka=2.78 and the transfer linear velocity=26 m/s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">With respect to this optical recording medium, recording and reproducing were evaluated using the optical disc evaluating device (DDU-1000 manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd) having a pickup with 650 nm of wavelength and 0.65 of NA. The recording linear velocity was set at 28 m/s (equivalent to 8×-speed of DVD), and it was optimized with 32 mW of recording power Pw, 0.1 mW of bottom power Pb, and 5 mW to 10 mW of erasing power Pe. A random pattern was repeatedly recorded with EFM+modulation method and the jitter (data to clock jitter: a value where ‘σ’ was standardization with detection window width ‘Tw’) was evaluated. The recording strategy was optimized, and reproducing was all performed at 3.5 m/s of linear velocity with 0.7 mW of power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">In addition, after this optical recording medium was stored for 100 hours in an environment of 80° C. and 85% RH, recording was performed under the same condition. Each result is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> (before the storage test: the line through the rectangular points, after storage test: the line through the diamond points).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">As it is clear from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, even after 100-hour storage in an environment of 80° and 85% RH, no great jitter deterioration was confirmed. The optical recording medium after this storage test was visually observed by holding it to a lamp; however, no pinhole generation was confirmed.</div>
