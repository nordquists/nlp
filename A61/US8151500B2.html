<heading>(a) TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention generally relates to photo frames, and more particular to a photo frame also capable of being used as a message board.</div>
<heading>(b) DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">A photo frame is a common daily commodity for displaying, protecting, and preserving a photo. Its design is usually focused on the visual appearance and there are various photo frames of unique and delicate outlook.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Recently there are photo frames equipped with lighting function. Such photo frame provides illumination to the photo and could also be used as a night lamp. For example, R.O.C. Taiwan Patent No. M320345 teaches an illuminating photo frame where lighting units are configured within an internal chamber of the photo frame. However, as light is projected from behind the photo, the photo's visual content cannot be enhanced. There are also photo frames where light generating units are configured along the edges of the frame and light is projected parallel to the photo. Therefore, only limited illumination to the photo is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Accordingly, the present inventor provides a novel photo frame which not only obviates the foregoing shortcomings, but also provides additional function to the photo frame.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">The following descriptions are exemplary embodiments only, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the following description provides a convenient illustration for implementing exemplary embodiments of the invention. Various changes to the described embodiments may be made in the function and arrangement of the elements described without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The invention provides a photo frame with message board function. The photo frame is configured with a first light generating unit and a second light generating unit to project illuminating light and blue light, respectively. The illuminating light is diffused over the photo, creating depth and making the photo stereographic. The blue light, on the other hand, illuminates fluorescent ink on a transparent plate of the photo frame so that the photo frame could also be used as a message board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>, a photo frame <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention displays a photo <b>91</b> and allows a user to write on it with a highlighter. The photo frame <b>10</b> contains a frame body <b>20</b>, a first transparent plate <b>30</b>, a second transparent plate <b>40</b>, a first light generating unit <b>50</b>, and a second light generating unit <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The frame body <b>20</b> contains a rectangular frame and a back cover <b>25</b>. The rectangular frame has four side walls <b>21</b> <i>a</i>, <b>21</b> <i>b</i>, <b>21</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>21</b> <i>d</i>, surrounding a rectangular space <b>22</b>. The back cover <b>25</b> seals a back side of the space <b>22</b> and has a retractable support <b>26</b>. The support <b>26</b> could be expanded to raise the photo frame <b>10</b> on a flat surface. The back cover <b>25</b> is detachably jointed to the frame body <b>20</b>. The frame body <b>20</b> also contains a number of fastening elements <b>23</b> on the side walls <b>21</b> <i>a</i>, <b>21</b> <i>b</i>, <b>21</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>21</b> <i>d </i>to keep the back cover <b>25</b> attached to the frame body <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The first and second transparent plates <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> are jointed to the frame body <b>20</b> to seal the space <b>22</b> by being positioned at the back side and a front side of the space <b>22</b>, respectively. The first transparent plate <b>30</b> is attached to the front of the back cover <b>25</b> with the photo <b>91</b> in between. A gap <b>29</b> is formed between the first and second transparent plates <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>. To place the photo <b>91</b> in the photo frame <b>10</b>, the back cover <b>25</b> is detached from the frame body <b>20</b> first. The photo <b>91</b> is then flatly attached to the first transparent plate <b>30</b> and the back cover <b>25</b> is restored. The photo <b>91</b> is then exposed through the first and second transparent plates <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The first light generating unit <b>50</b> contains a number of first light generating elements <b>51</b> <i>a</i>, <b>51</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>51</b> <i>c</i>, and a driving circuit. The first light generating elements <b>51</b> <i>a</i>, <b>51</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>51</b> <i>c </i>are positioned along the side wall <b>21</b> <i>a </i>and aimed directly into the gap <b>29</b> to project light beams L<b>1</b>. The second light generating unit <b>60</b> contains a number of second light generating elements <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>61</b> <i>c</i>, and a driving circuit. The second light generating elements <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>61</b> <i>c </i>are positioned along a lateral edge of the second transparent plate <b>40</b> to project blue light beams L<b>2</b> directly into the second transparent plate <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Please note that, in addition to the first and second light generating units <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>, a battery and a power adaptor port are also configured within and on the side walls <b>21</b> <i>a</i>, <b>21</b> <i>b</i>, <b>21</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>21</b> <i>d</i>. The photo frame <b>10</b> therefore could draw electricity from the battery or an external power adaptor to drive the first light generating elements <b>51</b> <i>a</i>, <b>51</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>51</b> <i>c </i>of the first light generating unit <b>50</b> and the second light generating elements <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>61</b> <i>c </i>of the second light generating unit <b>60</b> to project light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The light beams L<b>1</b> from the first light generating elements <b>51</b> <i>a</i>, <b>51</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>51</b> <i>c </i>are scattered between the first and second transparent plates <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> to illuminate the photo <b>91</b>. The photo <b>91</b> would look stereographic and reveals a sense of depth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">A user could write on the second transparent plate <b>40</b> with a highlighter to leave a fluorescent trace <b>93</b>. Under ordinary lighting condition, the fluorescent trace <b>93</b> is transparent and could not be recognized. However, when the blue light beams from the second light generating elements <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>61</b> <i>c </i>are projected into the second transparent plate <b>40</b>, the fluorescent trace <b>93</b> would become vividly visible, making the photo frame <b>10</b> more versatile and practical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Please note that the first light generating elements <b>51</b> <i>a</i>, <b>51</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>51</b> <i>c</i>, and the second light generating elements <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>61</b> <i>c </i>could be light emitting diodes, light bulbs, or lamp tubes, along with appropriate driving circuits. In addition, the first and second light generating units <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> could use single or more light generating elements. The multiple light generating elements displayed in the drawing are exemplary only. The frame body <b>20</b> is also not limited to the rectangular shape only.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a control structure of the light generating units of the photo frame according to a first embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, a control system <b>70</b> of the photo frame <b>10</b> uses a single switch unit <b>71</b> to control the first and second generating units <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> together. For example, the switch unit <b>71</b> is a multi-stage switch configured on the frame body <b>20</b> for user selection to turn on/off the first light generating unit <b>50</b> and the second light generating unit <b>60</b>, individually or together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a control structure of the light generating units of the photo frame according to a second embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, a control system <b>80</b> of the photo frame <b>10</b> uses a first switch unit <b>81</b> and a second switch unit <b>82</b> to control the first and second generating units <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>, respectively. For example, each of the first and second switch units <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> is an on/off switch configured on the frame body <b>20</b> for user selection to turn on/off the first light generating unit <b>50</b> and the second light generating unit <b>60</b> separately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">As described, the photo frame with message board function uses a first light generating unit to project light beams scattered between the first and second transparent plates to product a stereographic sense of depth for the displayed photo. Then the photo frame uses a second light generating unit to project blue light beams to manifest the fluorescent ink trace on the second transparent plate so that the photo frame could also be used as a message board. The photo frame is as such more versatile and has more practical value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">While certain novel features of this invention have been shown and described and are pointed out in the annexed claim, it is not intended to be limited to the details above, since it will be understood that various omissions, modifications, substitutions and changes in the forms and details of the device illustrated and in its operation can be made by those skilled in the art without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.</div>
