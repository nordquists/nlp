<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional patent application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/178,352, filed Jul. 23, 2008. All references are incorporated herein.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Turbofans are a type of gas turbine engine commonly used in aircraft, such as jets. The turbofan generally includes high and low pressure compressors, high and low pressure turbines, high and low spool shafts, a fan, and a combustor. The high-pressure compressor (HPC) is connected to the high-pressure turbine (HPT) by the high spool rotatable shaft, and together act as a high-pressure system. Likewise, the low-pressure compressor (LPC) is connected to the low-pressure turbine (LPT) by the low spool rotatable shaft, and together act as a low-pressure system. The low spool shaft is housed within the high spool shaft and is connected to the fan such that the HPC, HPT, LPC, LPT, and high and low spool shafts are coaxially aligned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Air is drawn into the jet turbine engine by the fan and the HPC. The HPC increases the pressure of the air drawn into the system. The high-pressure air then enters the combustor, which burns fuel and emits exhaust gas. The exhaust gas flows from the combustor into the HPT where it rotates the high spool shaft to drive the HPC. After the HPT, the exhaust gas is exhausted to the LPT. The LPT uses the exhaust gas to turn the low spool shaft, which powers the LPC and the fan to continually bring air into the system. Air brought in by the fan bypasses the HPT and LPT and acts to increase the engine's thrust, driving the jet forward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">In order to support the high and low pressure systems, bearings are located within the jet turbine engine to help distribute the load created by the high and low pressure systems. The bearings are connected to an engine casing that houses a mid-turbine frame located between the HPT and the LPT by bearing support structures. The bearing support structures can be, for example, bearing cones. The load from the bearing support structures are transferred to the engine casing through the mid-turbine frame. Decreasing the weight of the engine casing can significantly increase the efficiency of the jet turbine engine and the jet itself. Additionally, maintaining the sealing continuality between the HPT and the mid-turbine frame, and between the LPT and the mid-turbine frame, reduces leakage and also improves the efficiency of the jet turbine engine.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the turbine section of a gas turbine aircraft engine <b>10</b> about a gas turbine engine axis centerline. Gas turbine engine <b>10</b> generally includes high-pressure turbine <b>12</b>, low-pressure turbine <b>14</b> and mid-turbine frame <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">High-pressure turbine <b>12</b> includes one or more rows of blades <b>18</b> mounted on the rim of a disk <b>20</b>. Disk <b>20</b> attaches to high spool (or high-pressure) shaft <b>22</b>, which first (or forward) bearing <b>24</b> supports. High-pressure turbine <b>12</b> exhausts hot gases into annular flow chamber <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Exhaust gas from high-pressure turbine <b>12</b> flows through annular flow chamber <b>26</b> and into low-pressure turbine <b>14</b>. Low-pressure turbine <b>14</b> includes a number of rows of blades <b>28</b> mounted onto disks <b>30</b>. Bolts <b>32</b> bolt disks <b>30</b> together. Blades <b>28</b> are alternated with stationary vanes <b>34</b>. One or more blades <b>28</b> may have an extension <b>36</b> of low spool (or low-pressure) shaft <b>38</b>. Second (or aft) bearing <b>40</b> supports low spool shaft <b>38</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> is located in annular flow chamber <b>26</b>, between high-pressure turbine <b>12</b> and low-pressure turbine <b>14</b>. Mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> includes engine casing <b>42</b>, mid-turbine frame <b>44</b>, mounts <b>46</b>, first bearing <b>24</b> and second bearing <b>40</b>. For convenience, mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> will be referred to as having a forward side <b>60</b> adjacent to high-pressure turbine <b>12</b> in engine <b>10</b> and aft side <b>62</b> adjacent to low-pressure turbine <b>14</b> in engine <b>10</b>. Mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> has an actuated variable geometry that increases the efficiency of engine <b>10</b> by maintaining continuity between high pressure turbine <b>12</b> and low pressure turbine <b>14</b>, thus minimizing thermodynamic losses. Mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> also has a lightweight design that transfers a minimum amount of unbalanced loads from first bearing <b>24</b> and second bearing <b>40</b> through mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> to casing <b>42</b> and mounts <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Engine casing <b>42</b> surrounds mid-turbine frame <b>44</b>, and protects mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> from the surroundings. Engine casing <b>42</b> functions to transfer loads from mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> to mounts <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> is housed within engine casing <b>42</b>, and connects to engine casing <b>42</b> and first and second bearings <b>24</b> and <b>40</b>. Mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> transfers the loads from the first and second bearings <b>24</b> and <b>40</b> to engine casing <b>42</b> and mounts <b>46</b>. Mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> normalizes and equilibrates the loads from first and second bearings <b>24</b> and <b>40</b> so that a minimum amount of unbalanced load is transferred to mounts <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">First and second bearings <b>24</b> and <b>40</b> are located at forward end <b>60</b> and aft end <b>62</b> of mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b>, respectively, below engine casing <b>42</b>. First and second bearings <b>24</b> and <b>40</b> support thrust loads, vertical tension, side gyroscopic loads, as well as vibratory loads from high and low spool shafts <b>22</b> and <b>38</b> located in gas turbine engine <b>10</b>. The loads supported by first bearing <b>24</b> and second bearings <b>40</b> transfer to engine casing <b>42</b> and mounts <b>46</b> through mid-turbine frame <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> are an enlarged perspective view of mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> and a cross-sectional perspective view mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> respectively, and will be discussed together. Mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> includes engine casing <b>42</b> and mid-turbine frame <b>44</b>. Engine casing <b>42</b> surrounds mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> as previously described. Engine casing <b>42</b> has interior surface <b>56</b> and exterior surface <b>58</b>. Dimples <b>54</b> are formed in engine casing <b>42</b> so that protrusions extend from interior surface <b>56</b> and indentions are formed in exterior surface <b>58</b>. Dimples <b>54</b> project towards but do not engage mid-turbine frame <b>44</b>. Dimples <b>54</b> stiffen engine casing <b>42</b>, eliminating the need for rails along exterior surface <b>58</b> of engine casing <b>42</b>. The elimination of rails gives engine casing <b>42</b> a lightweight and cost-effective structure. Additionally, the elimination of rails reduces the drag on engine casing <b>42</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> generally includes torque box <b>47</b>, structural struts <b>48</b>, actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and actuation (or oleo) struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b</i>. Torque box <b>47</b> has a ring structure and is positioned between first bearing <b>24</b> and second bearing <b>40</b> and structural struts <b>48</b>. Torque box <b>47</b> takes the loads, or torque, from first and second bearing <b>24</b> and <b>40</b> and combines them prior to transferring the loads to structural struts <b>48</b> and oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Structural struts <b>48</b> extend between interior surface <b>56</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> and torque box <b>47</b>. First end <b>55</b> of structural strut <b>48</b> connects to torque box <b>47</b>. Second end <b>57</b> of structural strut <b>48</b> connects to interior surface <b>56</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> at the center of dimples <b>54</b>. Structural struts <b>48</b> transfer a portion of the loads from first and second bearings <b>24</b> and <b>40</b> to mounts <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Dimples <b>54</b> shorten the length of structural struts <b>48</b>. The length of structural struts <b>48</b> determines the critical buckling load of the struts; the critical buckling load varies inversely as a square of the length of the strut (i.e. a shorter strut increases the critical buckling load of the strut). The shortened length of structural struts <b>48</b> between dimple <b>54</b> and torque box <b>47</b> increases the critical buckling load and the load carrying capacity of structural struts <b>48</b>. The shortened structural struts <b>48</b> also reduce the weight of mid-turbine engine assembly <b>16</b>, thus increasing the specific fuel consumption (SFC) of engine <b>10</b>. Additionally, structural struts <b>48</b> may be hollow to further reduce the weight of engine <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">When coupled with structural struts <b>48</b>, dimples <b>54</b> act as local stiffeners and increase the critical buckling load of engine casing <b>42</b>. The increased critical buckling load of engine casing <b>42</b> allows wall thickness T<sub>c </sub>of engine casing <b>42</b> to be thinner while still providing the same load capacity. Thus, the weight of engine casing <b>42</b> is reduced and the SFC of engine <b>10</b> is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>attach around the circumference of and axially extend from torque box <b>47</b>. Forward actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a </i>attach to forward side <b>60</b> of torque box <b>47</b>, and aft actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>b </i>attach to aft side <b>62</b> of torque box <b>47</b>. One forward actuation slot <b>61</b> <i>a </i>is formed in each forward actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, and one aft actuation slot <b>61</b> <i>b </i>is formed in each aft actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>b</i>. In one example, actuation slots <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>are formed in the center of actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and extend away from torque box <b>47</b>. In another example, actuation slots <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>extend along an axis parallel to the axis of high spool shaft <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>extend between actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>and engine casing <b>42</b>. Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>are located on opposite sides of structural strut <b>48</b>. Forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>connects to forward side <b>60</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> and to forward actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>a</i>. Aft oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b </i>connects to aft side <b>62</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> and aft actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>b</i>. One forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>fits within each forward actuation slot <b>61</b> <i>a </i>in forward actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>. Similarly, one aft oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b </i>fits within each aft actuation slot <b>61</b> <i>b </i>in aft actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>are active actuator struts that transfer amplified displacements caused by actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>as local vertical forces. Movement of oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>reposition forward side <b>60</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> and aft side <b>62</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> respectively. Because each oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>is attached to an individually actuated actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b</i>, each oleo strut is individually actuated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Forward and aft actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a </i>and <b>50</b> <i>b </i>contain piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>having piezoelectric material in actuation slots <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>. Piezoelectric materials produce an electric energy when deformed or strained, and conversely transform electrical energy fields into mechanical deformation or strain actuation. In one example, the piezoelectric material is a naturally occurring material such as quartz, Rochelle salt or tourmaline. In another example, the piezoelectric material is a manufactured piezoelectric ceramic having enhanced piezoelectric properties, such as polycrystalline ferroelectric materials (i.e. barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>s</sub>)) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">In response to a sensed strain, piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a </i>in actuation slot <b>61</b> <i>a </i>produces voltage. This voltage is sensed and an amplified voltage is applied to piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a</i>. In response to the amplified voltage, piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a </i>deforms causing actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>a </i>to actuate or move. The movement of actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>a </i>vertically actuates oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, and repositions engine casing <b>42</b>. Piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>b</i>, actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>b</i>, and oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b </i>function in a similar manner. Thus, piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>convert a strain in the torque box into an amplified force that repositions engine casing <b>42</b>. The strain sensed may be due to interference pressure of adjacent components, thermal growth, mechanical growth or temperature differences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>may be configured as, for example, a unimorph piezoelectric actuator, a multilayer piezo bender or a multilayer piezoelectric actuator. Piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>may contain a steel layer and/or a ceramic layer. The steel layer senses mechanical loads or strains, and the ceramic layer senses thermal loads. Thus, in one example where piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>have a steel layer and a ceramic layer, oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>are actuated based upon sensed mechanical strains and sensed thermal strains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates circuitry <b>72</b> used to actuate piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b</i>. Circuit <b>72</b> includes piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b</i>, power distribution source <b>74</b> and external power bus <b>76</b>. Piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>are connected to power distribution source <b>74</b> by transmission lines <b>78</b> <i>a</i>, <b>78</b> <i>b </i>and reception lines <b>80</b> <i>a</i>, <b>80</b> <i>b</i>. Transmission lines <b>78</b> <i>a</i>, <b>78</b> <i>b </i>transmit a voltage from piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>to power distribution source <b>74</b>. Reception lines <b>80</b> <i>a</i>, <b>80</b> <i>b </i>transmit an amplified voltage from power distribution source <b>74</b> to piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b</i>. Piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>are also connected to each other and to power distribution source <b>74</b> by grounding lines <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Power distribution source <b>74</b> is connected to external power bus <b>76</b> by transmission line <b>84</b> and reception line <b>86</b>. External power bus <b>76</b> transfers a specified voltage to power distribution source <b>74</b> through reception line <b>84</b> based upon a signal sent by power distribution source <b>74</b> through transmission line <b>84</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">When piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a </i>senses a strain, it produces a voltage. This voltage is transferred to power distribution source <b>74</b> through transmission line <b>78</b> <i>a</i>. If the voltage is above a predetermined threshold, power distribution source <b>74</b> calls on external power bus <b>76</b> to generate an amplified voltage by sending a signal through transmission line <b>84</b>. The amplified voltage is transferred through reception lines <b>86</b> and <b>80</b> <i>a </i>to piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a </i>in order to actuate piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a</i>. Piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>b </i>functions in a similar manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Power distribution source <b>74</b> will only distribute a voltage to piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>if the sensed strain or produced voltage is above a predetermined threshold. For example, if the sensed strain is mechanical growth, a voltage is only applied to piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>when a movement at least about equal to the movement expected at the redline speed (or maximum speed of high spool shaft <b>22</b>) plus about 1% to about 5% is sensed. In this example, a voltage is not applied to piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>when the sensed movements are less than the movement expected at the redline speed plus about 1% to about 5%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Power distribution source <b>74</b> determines by how much the voltage from piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>should be amplified. Power distribution source <b>74</b> determines the voltage applied to piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>through lines <b>80</b> <i>a</i>, <b>80</b> <i>b </i>based upon the magnitude of the voltage through lines <b>78</b> <i>a</i>, <b>78</b> <i>b </i>from piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b</i>. Additionally or alternatively, power distribution source <b>74</b> may determine the voltage applied to piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>based upon the magnitude of the voltage change from piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>(i.e. how quickly the strain grows or changes).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">As described above, actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>extend around the circumference of torque box <b>47</b>. Each actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>contains a piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b</i>. Each piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>is connected to power distribution source <b>74</b>. Therefore, each piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>may be individually actuated based on the loads or strains sensed by that particular actuator <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Circuit <b>72</b> may be designed with redundancies in case of a failure of one of the elements. For example, circuit <b>72</b> may contain two power distribution sources <b>74</b> in the event that the primary power distribution source <b>74</b> fails. Each power distribution source <b>74</b> would be connected to each piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>in mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b>. Similarly, circuit <b>72</b> may be designed with two external power buses <b>76</b>, wherein each external power bus <b>76</b> is connected to each power distribution source <b>74</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a top view of a segment of mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> wherein engine casing <b>42</b> has been removed for clarity. Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>are located in actuation slots <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, which contain piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b</i>. Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>are located on opposite sides of structural struts <b>48</b>. As shown, oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>and structural strut <b>48</b> are located within vane envelope <b>53</b>. Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>are maintained about parallel to each other. In another example, forward strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>is maintained within about 2 degrees of being parallel with aft oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>in actuation slots <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>develop axial, transverse and shear strain actuation in mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> in response to a sensed strain. As discussed above, bearings <b>24</b>, <b>40</b> introduce horizontal, vertical and off-axis loads into torque box <b>42</b>. For example, horizontal or off-axis loads may be introduced by bearings <b>24</b>, <b>40</b> due to the dynamics of shafts <b>22</b> and <b>38</b> or thermal differences. The strain actuation of piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>in actuation slots <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b </i>causes self-equilibration of engine casing <b>42</b>, and results in a minimum amount of unbalanced loads being transferred to mounts <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">When piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a </i>in actuation slots <b>61</b> <i>a </i>senses a strain in torque box <b>47</b>, an amplified voltage is applied to piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a</i>. The applied voltage causes piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a </i>to deform and vibrate. The vibrations from piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a </i>create axial, transverse and shear strain actuations that equilibrate the in-plane loads locally around oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a</i>. Additionally, piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>a </i>deforms and causes vertical motion of oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>to equalize the vertical loads. Piezoelectric actuator <b>63</b> <i>b </i>function in a similar manner. Piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>may cause strain actuation because of a sensed thermal growth, mechanical vibration, such as a vibration due to sharp rotation, or interference growth.</div>

Dimple <b>54</b> formed in engine casing <b>42</b> creates a protrusion extending from internal surface <b>56</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> and an intention in exterior surface <b>58</b> of engine casing <b>42</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">High spool shaft <b>22</b> transfers loads to first bearing <b>24</b>, and low spool shaft <b>38</b> transfers loads to second bearing <b>40</b>. First and second bearings <b>24</b> and <b>40</b> introduce the loads into torque box <b>47</b> of mid-turbine frame <b>44</b>, where the loads are combined and equilibrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Structural strut <b>48</b> transfers loads from torque box <b>47</b> to engine casing <b>42</b>. First end <b>55</b> of structural strut <b>48</b> attaches to torque box <b>47</b> and second end <b>57</b> of structural strut <b>48</b> attaches to engine casing <b>42</b> at dimple <b>54</b>. In one embodiment, dimples <b>54</b> and structural struts <b>48</b> are equal in number such that each structural strut <b>48</b> connects to engine casing <b>42</b> at a different dimple <b>54</b>. In another embodiment, structural struts <b>48</b> are elliptical in shape and are sized to take a load and transfer it in a vertical direction toward engine casing <b>42</b>. In another embodiment, nine structural struts are positioned approximately forty degrees apart from one another along the circumference of torque box <b>47</b>. In another embodiment, twelve total structural struts are positioned approximately thirty degrees apart from one another along the circumference of torque box <b>47</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a </i>and <b>50</b> <i>b </i>attach to torque box <b>47</b>. Forward actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>a </i>attaches on forward side <b>60</b> of torque box <b>47</b>, and aft actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>b </i>attaches on aft side <b>62</b> of torque box <b>47</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>extend between engine casing <b>42</b> and actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b</i>, respectively. Forward oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and aft oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>b </i>are located on opposite sides of structural strut <b>48</b>. Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>extend through engine casing <b>42</b> so that when oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>are actuated by actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b</i>, engine casing <b>42</b> is repositioned. One forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>is placed on the forward side of each structural strut <b>48</b> and one aft oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b </i>is placed on the aft side of each structural strut <b>48</b> so that oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>are on opposite sides of structural struts <b>48</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In use, in order to reposition oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b</i>, piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>in actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>measure or detect strains due to thermal strain growth, interference pressure, or mechanical strain. Actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>reflect the detected strain actuation as an amplified vertical force supplied to oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b</i>. Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>transmit the amplified force to engine casing <b>42</b>, which is repositioned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Forward flange <b>68</b> extends from engine casing <b>42</b> on forward side <b>60</b> of engine casing <b>42</b>, and aft flange <b>70</b> extends from engine casing <b>42</b> on aft side <b>62</b> of engine casing <b>42</b>. Forward and aft flanges <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> connect mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> to high-pressure turbine <b>12</b> and low-pressure turbine <b>14</b> respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates how the actuation of oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>balances and equalizes the vertical loads from bearings <b>24</b>, <b>40</b> prior to transferring them to mounts <b>46</b>. In response to a sensed force, piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>in actuation slot <b>61</b> <i>a </i>deform to amplify the force in the vertical direction. The deformation moves forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>illustrated by force F<sub>r1</sub>, causing small motions in engine casing <b>42</b>. Engine casing <b>42</b> transfers the motions to aft oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b </i>illustrated by force F<sub>r2 </sub>so that engine casing <b>42</b> follows an arching pattern as illustrated by arrow A and the vertical forces are balanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The self-equilibrating case motion caused by the actuation of oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>is small to ensure structural stability, and adjusts engine casing <b>42</b> to maintain compatibility with high-pressure turbine <b>12</b> and low-pressure turbine <b>14</b>. Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>ensure that the case distortions induced by high-pressure turbine <b>12</b> and low pressure-turbine <b>14</b> are small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">As a whole, mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> brings all loads introduced into the torque box <b>47</b> by first bearing <b>24</b> and second bearing <b>40</b> in all coordinate directions into equilibrium. Actuation plates <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b </i>equilibrate the horizontal and off-axis loads while oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>equilibrate the vertical loads. For example, piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>in forward actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>a </i>create strain actuation equal and opposite in direction to the horizontal and off-axis loads introduced by high spool shaft <b>22</b>. In this way, forward actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>a </i>equilibrates the horizontal and off-axis loads. Aft actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>b </i>works in a similar manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Additionally, the actuation of forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>equilibrates the vertical load introduced into the torque box <b>47</b> using engine casing <b>42</b> and aft oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b</i>. Piezoelectric actuators <b>63</b> <i>a</i>, <b>63</b> <i>b </i>in forward actuation plate <b>50</b> <i>a </i>amplify the vertical loads and create actuation force F<sub>r1 </sub>which actuates forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a</i>. The actuation of forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>transfers the vertical load through engine casing <b>42</b> to aft oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b</i>. Forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>reacts to vertical loads only. Aft oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b </i>works in a similar manner, transferring loads to forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>through engine casing <b>42</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">High spool shaft <b>22</b> and low spool shaft <b>38</b> rotate at different angular speeds, and introduce different loads into mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> and torque box <b>47</b>. The load difference between high and low spool shafts <b>22</b> and <b>38</b> may cause distortion of engine casing <b>42</b>, such as ovalization. To prevent distortion of engine casing <b>42</b>, mid-turbine frame <b>44</b> and oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>equilibrate the loads before transferring them to engine casing <b>42</b>. It is important to maintain the circular geometry of engine casing <b>42</b> to prevent rotating engine casing <b>42</b> from interfering with surrounding stationary structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The actuation of oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>also maintains continuity between high pressure turbine <b>12</b> and low pressure turbine <b>14</b>. Mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> is located between high-pressure turbine <b>12</b> and low-pressure turbine <b>14</b>. High-pressure turbine <b>12</b> operates at a higher temperature than low-pressure turbine <b>14</b>. Therefore, high-pressure turbine <b>12</b> and low-pressure turbine <b>14</b> have different thermal growth rates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">To maintain conformity between forward side <b>60</b> of mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> and high-pressure turbine <b>12</b>, and between aft side <b>62</b> of mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> and low-pressure turbine <b>14</b>, forward and aft sides <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> must be able to be independently adjusted. Forward oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a </i>allow the diameter on forward side <b>60</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> to be adjusted independent of the diameter of aft side <b>62</b> of engine casing <b>43</b>. Aft oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>b </i>function in a similar way. Because forward side <b>60</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> is impacted by a uniform thermo-mechanical field, each forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>is similarly actuated. Thus preventing ovalization of engine casing <b>42</b> on forward side <b>60</b>. Similarly, aft side <b>62</b> of engine casing <b>42</b> is impacted by a uniform thermo-mechanical field so that each individual aft oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b </i>is similarly actuated to prevent ovalization of engine casing <b>42</b>. Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>reposition engine casing <b>42</b> to minimize leaks, ensure sealing continuity between high and low pressure turbines <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, and ensure appropriate case conformity between structures, thus minimizing thermodynamic losses and improving the efficiency of engine <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Forward oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and aft oleo strut <b>52</b> <i>b </i>should be about parallel. However, because of the load differential between high spool shaft <b>22</b> and low spool shaft <b>38</b>, oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>do not have the same deflection. Oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>should be actuated so that they are maintained within about two degrees of parallel to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Embedded mounts <b>64</b> are embedded within dimples <b>54</b> and eliminate the need for rails on exterior surface <b>58</b> of engine casing <b>42</b>. Because embedded mounts <b>64</b> are embedded within dimples <b>54</b>, embedded mounts <b>64</b> enable localized load paths directly to engine casing <b>42</b>, and provide efficient load and stress distribution in combination with the stiffening effect of dimples <b>54</b> on engine casing <b>42</b>. Embedded mounts <b>64</b> also serve to connect engine casing <b>42</b> to mounts <b>46</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Embedded mounts <b>64</b> have a height at least equal to the height of dimples <b>54</b> to ensure that embedded mounts <b>64</b> can adequately act as load transfer means to mounts <b>46</b>. One embedded mount <b>64</b> is necessary at every location where mounts <b>46</b> come in contact with engine casing <b>42</b>, which depends upon the external architecture of engine casing <b>42</b>. In one example, engine casing <b>42</b> has at least three embedded mounts <b>64</b>. In another example, every dimple <b>54</b> contains at least one embedded mount <b>64</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Rails are no longer necessary to ensure stiffness of engine casing <b>42</b> because engine casing <b>42</b> changes geometry based on strains developed due to thermo-mechanical effects. The actuated geometry of assembly <b>16</b> also postpones case ovalization and case buckling. The geometry changes occur uniformly along the circumference of forward side <b>60</b> and aft side <b>62</b> of engine casing <b>42</b>, ensuring circular case geometry and maintaining continuity with the adjacent high pressure turbine <b>12</b> and low pressure turbine <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> has a lightweight and cost effective structure. As explained above, the structure of mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> eliminates the need for rails. Additionally, dimples <b>54</b>, together with structural struts <b>48</b> and oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>increase the load carrying capacity of engine casing <b>42</b>, allowing the thickness of engine casing <b>42</b> to be reduced. Further, the presence of oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b </i>allows thickness of structural struts <b>48</b> to be reduced while maintaining the same critical buckling loads for assembly <b>16</b> because oleo struts <b>52</b> <i>a </i>and <b>52</b> <i>b </i>transfer a portion of the load. In one example, mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> has a weight reduction of about 10% to about 12%. In another example, mid-turbine frame assembly <b>16</b> weighs about 160 pounds. The weight reduction positively impacts weight related performance metrics such as specific fuel consumption (SFC).</div>
