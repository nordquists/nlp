It should be noted that, although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a so-called folding type cellular telephone, the present invention is not limited thereto. The cellular telephone <b>1</b> may be of, for example: a slider type in which one body slides in one direction from a state in which two bodies are mutually superimposed; a rotating type (turning type) in which one body is rotated about an axis line along the direction in which two bodies are superimposed; or a type in which an operation unit and a display unit are arranged in one body without a connection unit (straight type, flip type).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The cellular telephone <b>1</b> is configured to include an operation unit side body <b>2</b> and a display unit side body <b>3</b>. The operation unit side body <b>2</b> is configured to include on a front face <b>10</b> thereof an operation unit <b>11</b> and a microphone <b>12</b> to which sounds, which a user of the cellular telephone <b>1</b> produces during a phone call, are input. The operation unit <b>11</b> includes: feature setting operation buttons <b>13</b> for operating various settings and various features such as a telephone number directory feature and a mail feature; input operation buttons <b>14</b> for inputting digits of a telephone number and characters for mail; and a selection operation button <b>15</b> that performs selection of the various operations and scrolling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The display unit side body <b>3</b> is configured to include, on a front face portion <b>20</b>, a LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) display unit <b>21</b> for displaying a variety of information, and a speaker <b>22</b> for outputting sound of the other party of the conversation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">An upper end portion of the operation unit side body <b>2</b> and a lower end portion of the display unit side body <b>3</b> are connected via a hinge mechanism <b>4</b>. The cellular telephone <b>1</b> can be in a state where the operation unit side body <b>2</b> and the display unit side body <b>3</b> are apart from each other (opened state), and in a state where the operation unit side body <b>2</b> and the display unit side body <b>3</b> are contacting each other (folded state), as the operation unit side body <b>2</b> and the display unit side body <b>3</b>, connected via the hinge mechanism <b>4</b>, pivot with respect to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In addition, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a part of the operating unit side body <b>2</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram showing features of the cellular telephone <b>1</b>. The cellular telephone <b>1</b> includes the operation unit <b>11</b>, the microphone <b>12</b>, the main antenna <b>50</b>, an RF (Radio Frequency) circuit unit <b>41</b>, an LCD control unit <b>42</b>, a sound processing unit <b>43</b>, memory <b>44</b>, a timer <b>45</b>, an LED (Light Emitting Diode) <b>47</b>, a power control circuit unit <b>48</b>, the CPU <b>49</b> (control unit), a vibration motor <b>51</b>, the rechargeable battery <b>40</b>, and the water exposure detection unit (detection unit) <b>60</b> that are provided in the operation unit side body <b>2</b>. In addition, the cellular telephone <b>1</b> includes the LCD display unit <b>21</b>, the speaker <b>22</b>, and a driver IC <b>23</b> that are provided in the display unit side body <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The main antenna <b>50</b> communicates with external devices by using a predetermined usable frequency band (for example, 800 MHz). It should be noted that, although the predetermined usable frequency band is set to 800 MHz in the present embodiment, other frequency bands can also be used. Moreover, the main antenna <b>50</b> can be configured as a so-called dual band compatible antenna that can accept, in addition to the predetermined usable frequency band, another usable frequency band (for example, 2 GHz).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The RF circuit unit <b>41</b> performs demodulation processing of a signal received by the main antenna <b>50</b> and supplies the processed signal to the CPU <b>49</b>. In addition, the RF circuit unit <b>41</b> performs modulation processing of a signal supplied from the CPU <b>49</b>, and submits the processed signal to an external device (base station) via the main antenna <b>50</b>. On the other hand, the RF circuit unit <b>41</b> notifies strength of the signal received by the main antenna <b>50</b> to the CPU <b>49</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The LCD control unit <b>42</b> performs predetermined image processing according to control by the CPU <b>49</b>, and outputs image data thus processed to the driver IC <b>23</b>. The driver IC <b>23</b> stores the image data supplied from the LCD control unit <b>42</b> in frame memory, and outputs to the LCD display unit <b>31</b> at a predetermined timing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The sound processing unit <b>43</b> performs predetermined sound processing with respect to the signal supplied from the RF circuit unit <b>41</b> according to control by the CPU <b>49</b>, and outputs the signal thus processed to the speaker <b>22</b>. The speaker <b>22</b> outputs the signal submitted from the sound processing unit <b>43</b> to the outside.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">In addition, the sound processing unit <b>43</b> processes the signal being input from the microphone <b>12</b> according to control by the CPU <b>49</b> and outputs the signal thus processed to the RF circuit unit <b>41</b>. The RF circuit unit <b>41</b> performs predetermined processing with respect to the signal submitted from the sound processing unit <b>43</b> and outputs the signal thus processed to the main antenna <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The memory <b>44</b> includes, for example, working memory and is used for arithmetic processing by the CPU <b>49</b>. More specifically, capacitance detected by the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> (described later), predetermined thresholds and the like can be stored therein. The memory <b>44</b> can double as a detachable external memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The timer <b>45</b> has a time keeping function and is configured to be able to output time information including current time to the CPU <b>49</b>. The timer <b>45</b> notifies the CPU <b>49</b> that a preset time period has elapsed. In addition, the timer <b>45</b> is configured such that power supply is maintained to operate the time keeping function, even in a state in which power source of the cellular telephone <b>1</b> is interrupted. Although the time <b>45</b> is disposed outside of the CPU <b>49</b> in the present embodiment, a timer can be embedded in the CPU <b>49</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The LED <b>47</b> is configured to emit light based on a voltage supplied from the power control circuit unit <b>48</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The power control circuit unit <b>48</b> is connected to the rechargeable battery <b>40</b>, converts source voltage supplied from the rechargeable battery <b>40</b> to a predetermined source voltage, and supplies the source voltage thus converted to the LED <b>47</b> and the like. It is obvious that the power control circuit unit <b>48</b> supplies power to other electronic component, functional blocks and the like as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">When the RF circuit unit <b>41</b> detects an incoming call signal to the cellular telephone <b>1</b>, the LCD display unit <b>21</b>, the LED <b>47</b>, the vibration motor <b>51</b> and the speaker <b>22</b> are activated to notify an incoming call. When a responding operation is made to the incoming call, the RF circuit unit <b>41</b> is shifted to communication and conversation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> is provided with the detection pad <b>61</b> and the detection sensor <b>62</b>. The water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> detects capacitance, which is a physical quantity that changes according to a water-exposed state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The detection pad <b>61</b> is disposed on the circuit board <b>30</b> and configured to change capacitance according to contact with water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The detection sensor <b>62</b> is configured to include a detection circuit that detects capacitance of the detection pad <b>61</b>. The detection sensor <b>62</b> monitors the detection pad <b>61</b> for a certain period of time or constantly, thereby detecting a change in capacitance of the detection pad <b>61</b> according to contact with water. The detection sensor <b>62</b> then notifies the capacitance thus detected to the CPU <b>49</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The CPU <b>49</b> controls the entire cellular telephone <b>1</b>. In addition, the CPU <b>49</b> monitors an internal state such as a signal state of the main antenna <b>50</b>, a level of the rechargeable battery <b>40</b>, presence of missed calls and unread mail, and the like, and performs control such as changing of the emission color of LED <b>47</b> and display content of the LCD display unit <b>21</b> based on results of monitoring. Furthermore, the CPU <b>49</b> controls the power control circuit unit <b>48</b> to interrupt power supply according to the detection result from the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">More specifically, the CPU <b>49</b> determines minor water exposure in a case in which the capacitance detected by the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> is at least a threshold A (the first threshold value) and less than a threshold B (the second threshold value) that is greater than the threshold A, and controls the power control circuit unit <b>48</b> to continue interruption of the power supply until time T<b>1</b> (the first predetermined time period) elapses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In addition, the CPU <b>49</b> determines major water exposure in a case in which the capacitance detected by the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> is at least the threshold B, and controls the power control circuit unit <b>48</b> to continue interruption of the power supply until time T<b>2</b> (the second predetermined time period), which is longer than the time T<b>1</b>, elapses. Here, elapse of the time T<b>1</b> or T<b>2</b> is determined by the timer <b>45</b>, which starts time keeping upon interruption of the power supply and notifies the elapse of the time T<b>1</b> or time T<b>2</b> to the CPU <b>49</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The cellular telephone <b>1</b> of the present embodiment thus configured can be controlled to interrupt the power supply until the time T<b>1</b> or T<b>2</b> elapses, according to the value of capacitance detected. The cellular telephone <b>1</b> can thus avoid a short circuit of the electronic parts installed on the circuit board <b>30</b>, and can change the duration of interruption of power supply according to whether the water-exposed state of the circuit board <b>30</b> is a minor water exposure or a major water exposure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">As used in the present embodiment, the minor water exposure is a case where dew condensation is caused on the circuit board <b>30</b> by rise in environmental temperature from a low temperature to a normal temperature, or where the circuit board <b>30</b> gets wet due to the cellular telephone <b>1</b> being exposed to rain and the like. On the other hand, the major water exposure is a case where water is poured on the cellular telephone <b>1</b> or where the circuit board <b>30</b> gets wet due to the cellular telephone being submerged in water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In addition, as used in the present embodiment, the first water-exposed state is a state in which dew condensation is caused on the circuit board <b>30</b> by rise in environmental temperature from a low temperature to a normal temperature, or in which the circuit board <b>30</b> gets wet due to the cellular telephone <b>1</b> being exposed to rain and the like. On the other hand, the second water-exposed state is a state in which water is poured on the cellular telephone <b>1</b> or where the circuit board <b>30</b> gets wet due to the cellular telephone being submerged in water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Thereafter, in a case in which the capacitance detected by the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> is at least the threshold A and less than the threshold B, the CPU <b>49</b> controls the LCD display unit <b>21</b> to display information (the first mode) to notify the user of the minor water exposure of the circuit board <b>30</b> and the interruption of the power supply of the cellular telephone <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In addition, in a case in which the capacitance detected by the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> is at least the threshold B, the CPU <b>49</b> controls the LCD display unit <b>21</b> to display information (the second mode) to notify the user of the major water exposure of the circuit board <b>30</b> and the interruption of the power supply of the cellular telephone <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">After notification in the first or second mode, the CPU <b>49</b> controls the power control circuit unit <b>48</b> to interrupt the power supply.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The cellular telephone <b>1</b> of the present embodiment thus configured can notify the user in the first or second mode, according to the value of capacitance detected by the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b>. The user can thus recognize whether the minor water exposure or the major water exposure has occurred to the cellular telephone <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Furthermore, the CPU <b>49</b> can control the power control circuit unit <b>48</b> to supply power after the time T<b>1</b> or T<b>2</b> elapses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">The cellular telephone <b>1</b> of the present embodiment can thus be made available again after a predetermined time period that is considered to be enough for drying the circuit board <b>30</b> in the water-exposed state, by supplying power after the time T<b>1</b> or T<b>2</b> elapses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">In addition, the CPU <b>49</b> detects capacitance by the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> after the time T<b>1</b> or T<b>2</b> elapses. Furthermore, the CPU <b>49</b> can control the power control circuit unit <b>48</b> to supply power in a case in which the capacitance detected by the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> is less than the threshold A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">As described above, the cellular telephone <b>1</b> of the present embodiment detects the capacitance again after the time T<b>1</b> or T<b>2</b> elapses. By confirming, by the capacitance thus detected, that the circuit board <b>30</b> in the water-exposed state has dried, and then supplying power again, the user can use the cellular telephone <b>1</b> in a safe state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Next, a flow of processing of the cellular telephone device <b>1</b> of the present embodiment is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart showing a flow of processing of the cellular telephone <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">In Step S<b>1</b>, the detection sensor <b>62</b> detects the changed capacitance α in the detection pad <b>61</b>, and then notifies the capacitance α thus detected to the CPU <b>49</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">In Step S<b>2</b>, the CPU <b>49</b> compares the capacitance α detected by the detection sensor <b>62</b> with the threshold A and the threshold B. In a case in which the capacitance α is at least the threshold A and less than the threshold B (threshold A≦capacitance α&lt;threshold B), the processing advances to Step S<b>3</b>. In a case in which the capacitance α is at least the threshold B, (threshold B≦capacitance α), the processing advances to Step S<b>11</b>. On the other hand, in a case in which the capacitance α is less than the threshold A, (capacitance α&lt;threshold A), the detection pad <b>61</b> is determined not to be in a water-exposed state, and the processing is terminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">In Step S<b>3</b>, the CPU <b>49</b> stores data representing the interruption of power supply due to minor water exposure of the circuit board <b>30</b> to the memory <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">In Step S<b>4</b>, the CPU <b>49</b> controls the LCD display unit <b>21</b> to display information (for example, a string “Minor water exposure detected.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">In Step S<b>5</b>, the CPU <b>49</b> controls the power control circuit unit <b>48</b> to interrupt the power supply. Upon interruption of the power supply, the CPU <b>49</b> starts time keeping by the timer <b>45</b>. Here, a part of the CPU <b>49</b> is still active after interruption of the power supply, and receives notification of elapse of the time from the timer <b>45</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">In Step S<b>6</b>, the CPU <b>49</b> determines whether the time T<b>1</b> has elapsed since the interruption of the power supply in Step S<b>5</b>, by time keeping by the timer <b>45</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">Modification</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">A modification of the above-described embodiment is hereinafter described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, on the circuit board <b>30</b> of the modification, the CPU <b>49</b> and the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> are installed. The water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> is configured to include detection pads <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, <b>61</b> <i>c</i>, <b>61</b> <i>d </i>and <b>61</b> <i>e </i>and the detection sensor <b>62</b>. In other words, in the modification, the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> includes the plurality of detection pads <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, <b>61</b> <i>c</i>, <b>61</b> <i>d </i>and <b>61</b> <i>e</i>, each of which is installed on the circuit board <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">The CPU <b>49</b> determines that the circuit board <b>30</b> is in the water-exposed state in a case in which the detection sensor <b>62</b> detects a maximum value or an average value of a change in capacitance in the detection pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">By providing the plurality of detection pads <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, <b>61</b> <i>c</i>, <b>61</b> <i>d </i>and <b>61</b> <i>e </i>on the circuit board <b>30</b>, the cellular telephone <b>1</b> can determine the water-exposed state of the circuit board <b>30</b> more reliably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">In addition, the CPU <b>49</b> can be configured to determine dew condensation in a case in which capacitance detected by the water exposure detection unit <b>60</b> changes in all of the plurality of detection pads <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, <b>61</b> <i>c</i>, <b>61</b> <i>d </i>and <b>61</b> <i>e</i>, and determine waterlog in a case in which the capacitance changes in a part of the plurality of detection pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">In a case of dew condensation, the circuit board <b>30</b> is evenly covered with water drops and capacitance is expected to change in all the detection pads <b>61</b>. Given this, the CPU <b>49</b> determines dew condensation in a case in which a change in capacitance is detected in all of the detection pads. On the other hand, in a case of waterlog, water seeps into the operation unit side body <b>2</b> gradually through gaps, and a change in capacitance is expected in a part of the plurality of detection pads on the circuit board <b>30</b>. Given this, the CPU <b>49</b> determines waterlog in a case in which a change in capacitance is detected in a part of the detection pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">In the cellular telephone <b>1</b> of the modification, the CPU <b>49</b> can thus determine whether the water-exposed state of the circuit board <b>30</b> is dew condensation or waterlog.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">Although the embodiments of the present invention have been described above, the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiments, and alterations are possible as appropriate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">In the above embodiments, the LCD display unit <b>21</b> is used as the notification unit to notify a user of water exposure; however, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the vibration motor <b>51</b> can be used as the notification unit in such a configuration that the vibration motor <b>51</b> is controlled to vibrate in a first mode to notify minor water-exposed state and in a second mode to notify major water-exposed state different from the first mode. The cellular telephone <b>1</b> can thus notify the user of the minor water-exposed state and the major water-exposed state by vibration of the vibration motor <b>51</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Alternatively, the speaker <b>22</b> can be used as the notification unit in such a configuration that the speaker <b>22</b> is controlled to output sound or voice in a first mode to notify minor water-exposed state and in a second mode to notify major water-exposed state different from the first mode. The cellular telephone <b>1</b> can thus notify the user of the minor water-exposed state and the major water-exposed state by sound or voice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">In addition, in the above embodiments, the detection pad <b>61</b> is installed on a face of the circuit board <b>30</b> on which the CPU <b>49</b> and the like are installed; however, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the detection pad <b>61</b> can also be installed on a face of the circuit board <b>30</b> that is opposite to the face on which the CPU <b>49</b> and the like are installed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">In addition, in the above embodiments, the detection pad <b>61</b> is installed on the circuit board <b>30</b> in the operation unit side body <b>2</b>; however, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the detection pad <b>61</b> can also be installed on a circuit board in the display unit side body <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">In addition, in the above embodiments, the detection pads <b>61</b> <i>a</i>, <b>61</b> <i>b</i>, <b>61</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>61</b> <i>d </i>are installed in end portions of the circuit board <b>30</b> and the detection pad <b>61</b> <i>e </i>is installed in the vicinity of the CPU <b>49</b>; however, the arrangement of the detection pads is not limited thereto. For example, the detection pads can also be installed in the vicinity of a connector part of the operation unit side body <b>2</b>, through which water can seep thereinto. In such a configuration, the cellular telephone <b>1</b> can detect water exposure more preferably. Furthermore, the number of the detection pad(s) is not particularly limited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">In addition, in the above embodiments, the detection unit <b>60</b> detects water exposure by change in capacitance; however, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the detection unit <b>60</b> can be configured to directly detect water exposure, to determine whether the water exposure is dew condensation or waterlog, and to notify the CPU <b>49</b> with a result of the determination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">In addition, in the above embodiments, the detection unit <b>60</b> determines a degree of water exposure by detecting change in capacitance; however, the present invention is not limited thereto and the degree of water exposure can be determined by using a water detection unit as another detection unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">More specifically, the water detection unit irradiates a detection pad with infrared light having a wavelength adjusted to correspond to an energy absorption band of water from a light emitting portion, and receives the infrared light from the detection pad in a light receiving portion. The energy intensity of the infrared light received in the light receiving portion changes depending on presence or absence of water molecules on the detection pad and the amount thereof. Therefore, the degree of the water-exposed state can be determined from an amount of change in the energy intensity between the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion of the infrared light, detected by a detection sensor. For example, as the amount of change in the energy intensity, a case in which the energy intensity in the light receiving portion is less than 85% of that in the light emission portion can be defined as the first water-exposed state. On the other hand, a case in which the energy intensity in the light receiving portion is at least 85% and less than 95% of that in the light emission portion can be defined as the second water-exposed state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">The detection pad is preferably composed of, for example, glass that transmits 99% of infrared light. The energy intensity received in the light receiving portion changes depending on presence or absence of water molecules and the amount thereof on the glass. As the light emitting portion, an LED that emits infrared light can be exemplified. As the light receiving portion, a light sensor using photodiodes can be exemplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">It should be noted that, although the cellular telephone <b>1</b> has been described in the above embodiments, the present invention is not limited thereto and may be PHS (Personal Handyphone System), a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), a portable navigation apparatus, a portable personal computer such as a laptop computer, and the like.</div>
