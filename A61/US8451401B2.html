<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a color image display device. Particularly, it relates to a color image display device to realize an image having a high color purity corresponding to the emission wavelength of an improved LED backlight.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">In recent years, the liquid crystal display elements are expected to be useful not only in the conventional application to personal computer monitors but also in application to ordinary color televisions. The color reproduction range of the color liquid crystal display elements is determined by colors of light emitted from the red, green and blue pixels and, where chromaticity points of the respective color pixels in the CIE XYZ calorimetric system are represented by (x<sub>R</sub>, y<sub>R</sub>), (x<sub>G</sub>, y<sub>G</sub>) and (x<sub>B</sub>, y<sub>B</sub>), the color reproduction range is represented by an area of a triangle defined by these three points on an x-y chromaticity diagram. Namely, the larger the area of this triangle, the more vivid color image the display elements reproduce. The area of this triangle is normally expressed by a ratio of the area of the triangle to an area of a reference triangle formed by three points of the three primary colors, red (0.67, 0.33), green (0.21, 0.71) and blue (0.14, 0.08), in the standard system defined by U.S. National Television System Committee (NTSC) (in unit of %, which will be referred to hereinafter as “NTSC ratio”). The ordinary notebook computers have the values of approximately 40 to 50%, the desktop computer monitors the values of 50 to 60%, and the existing liquid crystal TVs the values of approximately 70%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In the color liquid crystal display elements, the color filter extracts only wavelengths in necessary regions from the emission distribution of the backlight, to provide the red, green and blue pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Methods for production of this color filter proposed heretofore include such methods as dyeing, pigment dispersion, electrodeposition, printing, ink jetting and so on. The colorants for coloring used to be dyes, but are now pigments in terms of reliability and durability as liquid crystal display elements. Accordingly, at present, the pigment dispersion is most commonly used as a method for production of the color filter from the viewpoint of productivity and performance. In general, when the same colorant is used, the NTSC ratio and the brightness are in a trade-off relation, and the colorant is suitably selected for use depending on the particular application. Namely, if it is attempted to increase the NTSC ratio by adjusting the color filter in order to reproduce a vivid color image, the screen tends to be dark. Inversely, if the brightness is increased, the NTSC ratio tends to be low, and it tends to be difficult to reproduce a vivid image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">On the other hand, as a backlight, it has been common to employ one using as a light source a cold-cathode tube with emission wavelengths in the red, green and blue wavelength regions and using a light guide plate for converting light emitted from this cold-cathode tube, into white area light source. In recent years, a light emitting diode (LED) has been used, since it has a longer operating life, requires no inverter, presents high brightness, is mercury free, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Here, in a conventional LED type backlight, a blue emission from LED and a yellow phosphor obtained by excitation by means of such a blue emission were used as a white area light source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">However, in the above light source, the phosphor was yellow, whereby emission with wavelength unnecessary from the viewpoint of the color purity of red and green was substantial, and it was difficult to obtain a display with high color reproducibility (High Gamut). Here, it is at least in principle possible to increase the color purity of red and green by cutting off light with unnecessary wavelength by means of a color filter, but as mentioned above, if it is attempted to increase the NTSC ratio by adjusting the color filter in order to reproduce the vivid color image, the majority of emission of the backlight will be cut off, whereby there has been a problem that the brightness decreases substantially. Especially, by this method, emission of red decreases substantially, whereby it has been practically impossible to reproduce a strongly reddish color.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In order to overcome this problem, a method of combining red-, green- and blue-emitting LEDs (Non-Patent Document 1) has been proposed, and by this method, a display having an extremely high color reproducibility has been prepared on a trial basis. However, in such a color image display device, LED chips independent for red, green and blue, respectively, are combined, whereby is there have been problems such that 1) it takes time and labor to mount them, 2) since the respective LED chips for red, green and blue are disposed at finite distances, it is required to take the distance of a light guide plate to be long to sufficiently mix emitted lights from the respective LED chips, and 3) since the white chromaticity is adjusted by combining the integral multiple of the respective LED chips, adjustment of the white balance can not be continuously carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Further, a color image display device having an NTSC ratio of at least 60% has been disclosed which is constituted by a combination of a blue or deep blue LED and a phosphor (Patent Document 2). With this color image display device, a high color reproducibility may be attained as compared with the above mentioned yellow phosphor, but emitted lights with wavelengths which are unnecessary from the viewpoint of the color purity of red and green, are substantial, and a still higher color reproducibility has been desired.</div>

<heading>Object to be Accomplished by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">The present invention has been made under these circumstances, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a color image display device which is capable of attaining high color reproducibility as an entire image by adjustment with a color filter without impairing the brightness of the image even with a LED backlight and whereby adjustment of the white balance is easy without impairing the productivity from the viewpoint of the mounting by carrying out emission of red, green and blue by one chip.</div>
<heading>Means to Accomplish the Object</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">As a result of an extensive study, the present inventors have found it possible to improve the entire performance of a color image display device by having the NTSC ratio and the light use efficiency closely related to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">As mentioned above, heretofore, the NTSC ratio and the light use efficiency were in a trade-off relation to each other, and in a case where it was attempted to improve the performance of a color image display device, the main aim used to be either to improve the NTSC ratio at the sacrifice of the light use efficiency or to improve the light use efficiency at the sacrifice of the NTSC ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Whereas, the present inventors have found a backlight whereby the light emission efficiency can be set at a level higher than ever by combining a plurality of phosphors having improved emission wavelengths, which undergo emission (excitation) efficiently by LED having a specific emission wavelength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Further, they have found it possible to realize an image display having a high color purity by combining such a backlight with a color filter most suitable to the emission wavelength of the backlight, namely, to realize a color image display device having a light use efficiency higher than ever even at a high NTSC ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">The present invention is based on such discoveries and provides the following (A) to (F).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">(A) A color image display device comprising a combination of light shutters, a color filter having color elements of at least three colors of red, green and blue corresponding to the light shutters, and a backlight for transmission illumination, wherein a light source to be used for the backlight comprises a combination of a blue or deep blue LED and a phosphor, and the relationship between the NTSC ratio W as a color reproduction range of the color image display element and the light use efficiency Y is represented by the following formula:</div>

<heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">Now, embodiments of the color image display device of the present invention will be described in detail, but they are examples of practical modes of the present invention, and the present invention is by no means thereby restricted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">The color image display device of the present invention is one comprising a combination of light shutters, a color filter having color elements of at least three colors of red, green and blue corresponding to the light shutters, and a backlight for transmission illumination. Its specific construction is not particularly limited. However, a color liquid crystal display device of TFT (thin film transistor) type may, for example, be mentioned, whereby the light shutters are light shutters utilizing liquid crystal, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of the color liquid crystal display device of the TFT type using a side-light type backlight device and a color filter. In this liquid crystal display device, light emitted from a light source (light emitting diode) <b>1</b> is converted into an area light source by a light guide plate <b>2</b>, a light diffuser sheet <b>3</b> further enhances uniformity of the light, and the light then passes a prism sheet to enter a polarizer <b>4</b>. For this incident light, a direction of polarization is controlled in each pixel by TFT <b>6</b> and thereafter the light is incident into a color filter <b>9</b>. Finally, the light passes through a polarizer <b>10</b> with the direction of polarization perpendicular to that of the polarizer <b>4</b> and then reaches an observer.

Further, it may be an end surface emission type or area emission type laser diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">A frame for fixing the light source has at least positive and negative electrodes to conduct an electrical current to the light source. A concave cup is provided on the frame, and the light source is disposed on its bottom surface, whereby it is possible to let the outgoing light have directivity and thereby to effectively utilize the light. Further, by subjecting the inner surface of the concave portion or the entirety of the frame to plating treatment with a highly reflective metal such as silver, platinum or aluminum or its alloy, it is possible to increase the reflectance in the entire visible light region and thereby to increase the light use efficiency, such being more preferred. Further, similar effects can be obtained by making the surface of the concave portion or the entirety of the frame from an injection molding resin containing a highly reflective material such as a white-colored glass fiber, alumina powder or titania powder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">To fix the light source, an adhesive of e.g. epoxy type, imide type or acrylic type, a solder of AuSn or AgSn, or a bump of e.g. Au may, for example, be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">In a case where the light source is electrically connected through the adhesive, an electrically conductive filler such as fine silver particles may be incorporated to the adhesive, or, for example, a silver paste or carbon paste may be applied thinly and uniformly thereon. Further, in the case of a light emitting diode or laser diode of a large current type where the heat dissipation becomes important, solder is effective. In a case where the light source is not electrically connected through the adhesive, any adhesive may be used for fixing the light source, but in consideration of the heat dissipation, a silver paste or solder is preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">In a case where a plurality of light sources are employed, use of a solder is not advisable, since the light sources are likely to be repeatedly exposed at high temperature or so exposed for a long time, whereby the useful life of the power sources may be deteriorated. On the other hand, when a bump is used, the operation can be carried out at a temperature lower than the solder, and bonding can be carried out simply and certainly. Especially in a case where a flip chip type LED is to be used, a silver paste adhesive may short-circuit the p-type and n-type electrodes, but the bump is free from such a trouble and is preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">The light source and the electrodes of the frame are electrically connected by wire bonding. As such a wire, a gold or aluminum wire having a diameter of from 20 to 40 μm will be used. The method for electrically connecting the light source and the electrodes of the frame may otherwise be a flip chip bonding method without using a wire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">A blue-emitting phosphor, a green-emitting phosphor and a red-emitting phosphor are mixed to a transparent binder such as an epoxy resin or a silicon resin and applied to the light emitting diode. The mixing ratio may optionally be changed so that a desired color can be obtained. Here, the blue-emitting phosphor, the green emitting phosphor and the red-emitting phosphor may separately be applied on the light-emitting diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">By further adding a dispersing agent to the transparent binder, it is possible to make the outgoing light more uniform. As such a dispersing agent, a colorless material having an average particle diameter of from 100 nm to a few tens μm is preferred. Alumina, zirconia, yttria or the like is more preferred, since it is stable within a practical temperature range of from −60 to 120° C. Further, it is more preferred that the refractive index is high, whereby the effect of the dispersing agent will be high. Further, in a case where a phosphor having a large particle diameter is to be used, color irregularities or color shift is likely to result due to settling of the phosphor, and it is advisable to use an anti-settling agent. As such an anti-settling agent, fumed silica is common.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">When the completed light emitting device is switched on, firstly the light emitting diode will emit a blue or deep blue color. The phosphor will absorb a part of the emission and will emit a green or red color. As the light coming out from the light emitting device, substantially white colored one is obtainable as the initial blue color of the light emitting diode, and the green and red colors having wavelength changed by the phosphor, have been mixed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">In the formula (2A), M<sup>I </sup>is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Ba, Ca, Sr, Zn and Mg. M<sup>I </sup>may contain one of these elements alone or may contain two or more of them in an optional combination and ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0177">It is particularly preferred that M<sup>I </sup>contains at least Ba. In such a case, the molar ratio of Ba based on the entire M<sup>I</sup>, is usually at least 0.5, preferably at least 0.55, more preferably at least 0.6, particularly preferably at least 0.7, especially preferably at least 0.8, most preferably at least 0.9 and usually less than 1, preferably at most 0.97, more preferably at most 0.95, further preferably at most 0.93. If the molar ratio of Ba is too low, the emission peak wavelength tends to shift to the long wavelength side, whereby the emission efficiency tends to decrease. On the other hand, if the molar ratio of Ba is too high, the emission peak wavelength tends to shift to the short wavelength side, whereby the color purity of green tends to decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0178">It is particularly preferred that M<sup>I </sup>contains at least Ba and Sr. Here, when the molar ratios of Ba and Sr based on the entire M<sup>I </sup>are represented by [Ba] and [Sr], respectively, the proportion of [Ba] in the total of [Ba] and [Sr] i.e. the value represented by [Ba]/([Ba]+[Sr]) is usually larger than 0.5, preferably at least 0.6, more preferably at least 0.65, further preferably at least 0.7, particularly preferably at least 0.8, most preferably at least 0.9, and usually at most 1, preferably at most 0.9, more preferably at most 0.95, further preferably at most 0.93. If this value [Ba]/([Ba]+[Sr]) is too small (i.e. the ratio of Ba is too small), the emission peak wavelength of the phosphor to be obtained tends to shift to the long wavelength side, and the half value width tends to increase, such being undesirable. On the other hand, if this value [Ba]/([Ba]+[Sr]) is too large (namely, the ratio of Ba is too high), the emission peak wavelength tends to shift to the short wavelength side, and the color purity of green tends to decrease, such being undesirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0179">Further, the relative ratio of [Ba] to [Sr], i.e. the value represented by [Ba]/[Sr], is usually within a range of larger than 1, preferably larger than 1.2, more preferably larger than 1.5, further preferably larger than 1.8, further preferably larger than 2.5, further preferably larger than 4, further preferably larger than 10 and usually at most 35, preferably at most 20, more preferably at most 15, further preferably at most 13. If this value of [Ba]/[Sr] is too small (i.e. if the ratio of Ba is too small), the emission peak wavelength of the obtainable phosphor tends to shift to the long wavelength side, whereby the half value width tends to increase, such being undesirable. On the other hand, if this value of [Ba]/[Sr] is too large (i.e. if the ratio of Ba is too large), the emission peak wavelength tends to shift to the short wavelength side, whereby the color purity of green tends to decrease, such being undesirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0180">Further, in a case where in the formula (2A), M<sup>I </sup>contains at least Sr, it is preferred that part of Sr is substituted by Ca. In such a case, the amount for substitution by Ca is usually within a range of at most 10%, preferably at most 5%, more preferably at most 2%, by a molar ratio of the amount of substituted Ca to the total amount of Sr. If the proportion of the amount for substitution by Ca is too high, the emission efficiency tends to decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">Further, Si may be partially substituted by another element such as Ge. However, from the viewpoint of the green emission intensity, etc., the proportion of Si substituted by another element should better be as small as possible. Specifically, another element such as Ge may be contained in an amount of not more than 20 mol % of Si, and it is more preferred that Si is entirely Si without substitution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0182">In the above formula (2A), M<sup>II </sup>is at least one metal element which is mentioned as an activating element and which may take bivalent and trivalent atomic valencies.

M<sup>II </sup>may contain any one of such elements alone or may contain two or more of them in an optional combination and ratio. Among them, as M, Sm, Eu and Yb are preferred, and Eu is particularly preferred. Further, the molar ratio of bivalent elements to the entire M<sup>II </sup>(the total of bivalent elements and trivalent elements) is usually at least 0.5, preferably at least 0.7, more preferably at least 0.8 and usually less than 1, and the closer to 1, the better. If the molar ratio of bivalent elements to the entire M<sup>II </sup>is too low, the emission efficiency tends to decrease. Both bivalent elements and trivalent elements will be taken into a crystal lattice, but trivalent elements are considered to absorb the emission energy in the crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">In the formula (2A), x is a number representing the moles of M<sup>II</sup>, and specifically, it is usually at least 0.01, preferably at least 0.03, more preferably at least 0.04, particularly preferably at least 0.05, and usually less than 0.3, preferably at most 0.2, more preferably at most 0.15. If the value of x is too small, the emission intensity tends to be small. On the other hand, if the value of x is too large, the emission intensity tends to decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0184">In the formula (2A), α is preferably close to 2, but it represents a number within a range of usually at least 1.5, preferably at least 1.8, more preferably at least 1.9 and usually at most 2.5, preferably at most 2.2, further preferably at most 2.1. If the value of α is too small or too large, a heterophase crystal is likely to be formed, whereby the emission characteristics tend to deteriorate.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">The relative ratio of [Ba] to [Sr], i.e. the value represented by [Ba]/[Sr], is within a range of usually at least 8.5, preferably at least 9, more preferably at least 10, and usually at most 100, preferably at most 50, more preferably at most 25. If this value of [Ba]/[Sr] is too small (i.e. the ratio of Ba is too small), the emission peak wavelength of the phosphor tends to shift to the long wavelength side, whereby the half value width tends to increase. On the other hand, if this value of [Ba]/[Sr] is too large (i.e. if the ratio of Ba is too high), the emission peak wavelength of the phosphor tends to shift to the short wavelength side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">Further, the proportion of [Ba] based on the total of [Ba] and [Sr], i.e. the value represented by [Ba]/([Ba]+[Sr]), is preferably within a range of larger than 0.5, preferably at least 0.8, more preferably at least 0.9 and less than 1, more preferably at most 0.98, particularly preferably at most 0.97. If this value of [Ba]/([Ba]+[Sr]) is too small (i.e. if the ratio of Ba is too small), the emission peak wavelength of the phosphor tends to shift to the long wavelength side, whereby the half value width tends to increase.

{<i>a*/b*}≦−</i>0.45

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">When the above phosphor of the present invention has an object color satisfying the above conditions, it is possible to realize an emission device having a high emission efficiency, when such a phosphor is used for the emission device which will be described hereinafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">Specifically, the upper limit value for a* of the above phosphor of the present invention is usually at most −20, preferably at most −22, more preferably at most −24. With a phosphor wherein a* is too large, the total luminous flux tends to be small, such being undesirable. Also with a view to making the brightness high, the value of a* should better be small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">Further, b* of the above phosphor of the present invention is within a range of usually at least 30, preferably at least 33.

If b* is too large, the emission wavelength tends to shift to the long wavelength side, whereby the brightness tends to decrease, such being undesirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">Further, the ratio of a* to b*, i.e. the value represented by a*/b*, of the above phosphor of the present invention is within a range of usually at most −0.45, preferably at most −0.5, more preferably at most −0.55.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">Further, L* of the above phosphor of the present invention is usually at least 90, preferably at least 95. If the value of L* is too small, emission tends to be weak, such being undesirable. On the other hand, the upper limit value of L* usually does not exceed 100 since usually, an object not to emit light under irradiation with light is handled. However, with the above phosphor of the present invention, an emitted light formed under excitation with irradiated light will be superimposed on reflected light, whereby the value of L* may sometimes exceed 100.

<br/>
M1<sub>x</sub>Ba<sub>y</sub>M2<sub>z</sub>L<sub>u</sub>O<sub>v</sub>N<sub>w</sub>  (2B)
<br/>
In the above formula (2B), M1 is at least one activating element selected from the group consisting of Cr, Mn, Fe, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm and Yb, M2 is at least one bivalent metal element selected from the group consisting of Sr, Ca, Mg and Zn, L is a metal element selected from metal elements belonging to Groups 4 and 14 of the Periodic Table, and x, y, z, u, v and w are numerical values within the following ranges, respectively:

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">Here, the proportion of Eu<sup>2+</sup> in the entire Eu contained in the phosphor of the present invention may be examined, for example, by the measurement of the X-ray absorption fine structure. Namely, when the L3 absorption edge of Eu atoms is measured, Eu<sup>2+</sup> and Eu<sup>3+</sup> show separate absorption peaks, and their ratio can be determined from the peak areas. Further, the proportion of Eu<sup>2+</sup> in the entire Eu contained in the phosphor of the present invention may be also known by the measurement of electron spin resonance (ESR).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">Further, in the formula (2B), x is a numerical value within a range of 0.00001≦x≦3.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">Further, in the phosphor of the present invention, the sites of Ba may be substituted by Sr, Ca, Mg and/or Zn, while the BSON phase crystal structure is maintained.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0209">In the substitution by Zn ions, the proportion of Zn based on the total amount of Ba and Zn is preferably at most 60 mol %. If the amount of Zn exceeds this proportion, the emission wavelength tends to shift to the long wavelength side, and the emission intensity is likely to decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0210">Accordingly, in the formula (2B), the amount of z may be set depending upon the type of the metal element M2 and the amount of y.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0212">Further, the phosphor of the present invention preferably contains Ba from the viewpoint of the stability of the crystal structure.

<heading>(3) Color Filter</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0225">The color filter to be used for the color image display device of the present invention is not particularly limited, and for example, the following one may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0226">The color filter is a filter obtained by forming fine pixels of red, green, blue and so on a transparent substrate of glass or the like by a method of dyeing, printing, electrodeposition, pigment dispersion, or the like. In order to block leaking light between these pixels and obtain images with higher quality, it is often the case to provide a light shielding pattern called a black matrix between pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227">A color filter by dyeing is fabricated as follows: an image is formed by a photosensitive resin obtained by mixing a dichromate as a photosensitive agent into gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, or the like, followed by dyeing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">A color filter by printing is fabricated by transferring a heat-curing or photo-curing ink onto a transparent substrate of glass or the like by such a method as screen printing, gravure printing, flexographic printing, inversion printing or soft lithography (imprint printing).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">A color filter by electrodeposition is formed by electrophoresis effected while a transparent substrate of glass or the like with an electrode thereon is immersed in a bath containing a pigment or a dye.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">A color filter by pigment dispersion is formed by applying a composition in which a colorant such as a pigment is dispersed or dissolved in a photosensitive resin, onto a transparent substrate of glass or the like to form a coating film thereon, exposing the coating film to radiation through a photomask to effect exposure, and removing unexposed portions by a development process to form a pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0231">The color filter can also be fabricated by other methods than these, including a method of applying a polyimide type resin composition in which a colorant is dispersed or dissolved, and forming a pixel image by etching, a method of attaching a film coated with a resin composition containing a colorant, to a transparent substrate, peeling it off, and effecting image exposure and development to form a pixel image, a method of forming a pixel image by an ink jet printer, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0232">In recent years, the pigment dispersion method is mainstream in fabrication of the color filters for liquid crystal display elements by virtue of its high productivity and excellent microfabrication property, but the color filter according to the present invention can be fabricated by any one of the above-mentioned production methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0233">Examples of methods of forming the black matrix include a method of forming a chromium and/or chromium oxide single-layer or multi-layer film over an entire surface of a transparent substrate of glass or the like by a method such as sputtering, and thereafter removing only color pixel portions by etching, a method of applying a photosensitive composition in which a light shielding component is dispersed or dissolved, onto a transparent substrate of glass or the like to form a coating film, exposing the coating film to radiation through a photomask to effect exposure, and removing unexposed portions by development to form a pattern, and so on.</div>
<heading>(3-1) Method for Producing Color Filter</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">Now, a specific example of the method for producing is the color filter of the present invention will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0235">The color filter of the present invention can be produced usually by forming red, green and blue pixel images on a transparent substrate provided with a black matrix. At the time of forming the respective color pixels on the transparent substrate, pigments and film thicknesses are optimized basically in order to let the peak wavelengths in the red, blue and green regions in the emission spectrum of the backlight permeate most efficiently. More specifically, the most suitable pigments and film thicknesses are set by calculating the white point, the color index of the spectrum of the backlight and the desired NTSC ratio, by a color matching system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0236">The material for the transparent substrate is not particularly limited. The material may, for example, be a polyester such as polyethylene terephthalate; a polyolefin such as polyethylene; a thermoplastic sheet of e.g. polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate or polystyrene; a thermosetting sheet of e.g. an epoxy resin, an unsaturated polyester resin or a poly(meth)acrylic resin; and various glass plates. Among them, a glass plate or a heat resistant plastic is preferred from the viewpoint of heat resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0237">To the transparent substrate, in order to improve the physical property such as the adhesive property of the surface, corona discharge treatment, ozone treatment or thin film treatment with a silane coupling agent or various polymers such as urethane polymer may be preliminarily applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0238">A black matrix is formed on a transparent substrate by using a metal thin film or a pigment dispersion for black matrix.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0239">The black matrix using a metal thin film may, for example, be formed by a single chromium layer or by two layers of chromium and chromium oxide. In such a case, firstly, a thin film of such a metal or metal-metal oxide is formed on the transparent substrate by vapor deposition or sputtering. Then, a photosensitive coating film is formed thereon, and then, by using a photomask having a repeated pattern of a stripe, mosaic, triangle, etc., the photosensitive coating film is exposed and developed to form a resist image. Then, the thin film is subjected to etching treatment to form a black matrix.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0240">In a case where a pigment dispersion for black matrix is to be used, a composition for a color filter containing a black colorant is used as a colorant to form a black matrix. For example, black colorants such as carbon black, bone black, graphite, iron black, aniline black, cyanine black and titanium black may be used alone or in combination as a mixture of a plurality of them, or a composition for a color filter containing a black colorant by mixing red, green, blue, etc. suitably selected from inorganic or organic pigments or dyes, is used to form a black matrix in the same manner as the following method for forming red, green and blue pixel images.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0241">On the transparent substrate provided with the black matrix, the above mentioned composition for a color filter containing one colorant among red, green and blue, is applied and dried, and then, a photomask is placed on this coating film, and the image exposure via the photomask, development and if necessary, heat-curing or photo-curing are carried out to form pixel images to form a colored layer. This operation is carried out for each of color filter compositions for three colors of red, green and blue to form a color filter image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0242">Application of the color filter composition can be carried out by a coating device such as a spinner, a wire bar, a flow coater, a die coater, a roll coater or a spray.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0243">The drying after the coating, may be carried out by using a hot plate, an IR oven, or a convection oven. With respect to the drying temperature, the adhesive property to the transparent substrate will be improved as the temperature becomes high. However, if it is too high, the photo polymerization initiator system tends to be decomposed, thus inducing heat polymerization to cause development failure. Therefore, the drying temperature is usually within a range of from 50 to 200° C., preferably from 50 to 150° C. Further, the drying time is usually from 10 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Further, prior to such drying by a heat, it is also possible to apply a drying method under reduced pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0244">The thickness of the coating film after the drying is within a range of usually from 0.5 to 3.5 μm, preferably from 1.0 to 3.0 μm. If the film thickness is too thick, non-uniformity in the film thickness tends to be large, and if it is too thin, the pigment concentration tends to be high, and it tends to be difficult to form images.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0245">In the present invention, the light use efficiency of the backlight is excellent, whereby the color filter may be made thin. By making the color filter thin, it is possible to shorten the time and simplify the production steps, thus leading to improvement of the productivity and reduction of the price, and it is also possible to save the power consumption of the backlight when operated as a display panel. Further, it is possible to realize a thin image display device, and it is particularly suitable for a cellphone whereby a thin-form is required for the device itself.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0246">Further, the composition for the color filter to be used comprises a binder resin and an ethylenic compound, and when the binder resin is an acrylic resin having ethylenic double bonds and carboxyl groups in side chains, a very high sensitivity and a high resolution are obtainable, whereby an image may be formed by exposure and development without providing an oxygen-shielding layer of e.g. polyvinyl alcohol, such being desirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0247">The exposure light source useful for the image exposure is not particularly limited. For example, a lamp light source such as a xenon lamp, a halogen lamp, a tungsten lamp, a high pressure mercury lamp, a super high pressure mercury lamp, a metal halide lamp, a medium pressure mercury lamp, a low pressure mercury lamp, a carbon arc or a fluorescent lamp; or a laser light source such as an argon ion laser, a YAG laser, an excimer laser, a nitrogen laser, a helium cadmium laser or a semiconductor laser, may be used. An optical filter may be used in a case where only a certain wavelength is to be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0248">After the image exposure by means of such a light source, development is carried out by means of an organic solvent, or an aqueous solution containing a surfactant and an alkali agent, to form an image on the substrate. Such an aqueous solution may further contain an organic solvent, a buffering agent, a dye, a pigment, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0249">The treating method for the development is not particularly limited, but usually, a method of immersion development, spray development, brush development or ultrasonic wave development may be used at a development temperature of usually from 10 to 50° C., preferably from 15 to 45° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0250">The alkali agent to be used for the development may, for example, be an inorganic alkali agent such as sodium silicate, potassium silicate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium triphosphate, sodium diphosphate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, or sodium bicarbonate, or an organic amine such as trimethylamine, diethylamine, isopropylamine, n-butylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine or tetraalkylammonium hydroxide. They may be used alone or in combination as a mixture of two or more of them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0251">As the surfactant, a nonionic surfactant such as a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, a polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl ether, a polyoxyethylene alkyl ester, a sorbitan alkyl ester of a monoglyceride alkyl ester; an anionic surfactant such as an alkylbenzene sulfonate, an alkylnaphthalene sulfonate, an alkyl sulfate, an alkyl sulfonate or a sulfosuccinate; or an amphoteric surfactant such as an alkylbetaine or an amino acid, may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0252">The organic solvent may be used alone or in combination with an aqueous solution, and in either case, isopropyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, ethyl cellosolve, butyl cellosolve, phenyl cellosolve, propylene glycol or diacetone alcohol may, for example, be used.</div>
<heading>(3-2) Composition for Color Filter</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0253">The composition (resist) for a color filter to be used for the color image display device of the present invention is not particularly limited, and the following one may, for example, be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0254">Raw materials for production of the color filter will be described below, using an example of the pigment dispersion method which is recently mainstream.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0255">The pigment dispersion method uses a composition in which a colorant such as a pigment is dispersed in a photosensitive resin as described above (hereinafter called a “composition for a color filter”). This composition for a color filter is generally a color composition for a color filter in which (a) a binder resin and/or (b) a monomer, (c) a colorant and (d) other components are dissolved or dispersed as the constituting components in a solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0256">Each of the components will be described below in detail. In the description below, “(meth)acryl”, “(meth)acrylate” and “(meth)acrylol” mean “acryl or methacryl”, “acrylate or methacrylate” and “acrylol or methacrylol”, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0024">(a) Binder Resin</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0257">Where a binder resin is used singly, an appropriate one is properly selected in consideration of the desired image forming property and performance, a production method desired to adopt, and so on. Where a binder resin is used in combination with a monomer described later, the binder resin is added in order to modify the composition for a color filter and improve the physical properties after photo-curing. In this case, therefore, a binder resin is properly selected depending upon the purpose for improvement such as compatibility, a film forming property, a development property, an adhesion property, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0258">The binder resins usually used are, for example, homopolymers or copolymers of (meth)acrylic acid, (meth)acrylates, (meth)acrylamide, maleic acid, (meth)acrylonitrile, styrene, vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, maleimide, and so on, polyethylene oxides, polyvinyl pyrrolidones, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyesters, polyethers, polyethylene terephthalates, acetylcelluloses, novolak resins, resol resins, polyvinyl phenols, polyvinyl butyrals, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0259">Among these binder resins, preferred binder resins are those having a carboxyl group or a phenolic hydroxyl group in a side chain or in the main chain thereof. Development in an alkali solution becomes possible with use of the resins having these functional groups. Among them, preferred binder resins are resins having a carboxyl group, which have a high alkali development property; for example, (co)polymers of acrylic acid, resins of styrene/maleic anhydride, resins of novolak epoxy acrylate modified with an acid anhydride, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0260">Particularly preferred binder resins are (co)polymers containing (meth)acrylic acid or a (meth)acrylate having a carboxyl group (these will be referred to as “acrylic resins” in the present invention). Namely, these acrylic resins are preferred in terms of easy controllability of performance and a production method because they are excellent in the development property and transparency and can provide various copolymers from a wide range of monomers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0261">Specific examples of the acrylic resins include resins that comprise, as an essential component, (meth)acrylic acid and/or a compound obtained by adding an acid (anhydride), such as (anhydrous) succinic acid, (anhydrous) phthalic acid, (anhydrous) maleic acid, or the like, to a hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylate, such as succinic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl) ester, adipic acid (2-acryloyloxyethyl) ester, phthalic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl) ester, hexahydrophthalic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl) ester, maleic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl) ester, succinic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxypropyl) ester, adipic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxypropyl) ester, hexahydrophthalic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxypropyl) ester, phthalic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxypropyl) ester, maleic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxypropyl) ester, succinic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxybutyl) ester, adipic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxybutyl) ester, hexahydrophthalic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxybutyl) ester, phthalic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxybutyl) ester, maleic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxybutyl) ester, or the like; and that are copolymerized, if necessary, with one of various monomers, e.g., styrene type monomers such as styrene, α-methylstyrene, vinyltoluene, and so on; unsaturated group-containing carboxylic acids such as cinnamic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, maleic anhydride, itaconic acid, and so on; (meth)acrylates such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl(meth)acrylate, propyl (meth)acrylate, allyl(meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate, hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate, benzyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxyphenyl(meth)acrylate, methoxyphenyl(meth)acrylate, and so on; compounds obtained by adding to (meth)acrylic acid, one of lactones such as ε-caprolactone, β-propiolactone, γ-butyrolactone, δ-valerolactone, and so on; acrylonitrile; acrylamides such as (meth)acrylamide, N-methylolacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N-methacryloyl morpholine, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate, N,N-dimethylaminoethylacrylamide, and so on; vinyl acids such as vinyl acetate, vinyl versatate, vinyl propionate, vinyl cinnamate, vinyl pivalate, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0262">For a purpose of increasing the strength of the coating film, acrylic resins preferably used are those obtained by copolymerization of from 10 to 98 mol %, preferably from 20 to 80 mol %, more preferably from 30 to 70 mol %, of one of monomers having a phenyl group, such as styrene, α-methylstyrene, benzyl(meth)acrylate, hydroxyphenyl(meth)acrylate, methoxyphenyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxyphenyl(meth)acrylamide, hydroxyphenyl(meth)acrylsulfoamide, and so on, and from 2 to 90 mol %, preferably from 20 to 80 mol %, more preferably from 30 to 70 mol %, of at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of (meth)acrylic acid, or (meth)acrylates having a carboxyl group, such as succinic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl) ester, adipic acid (2-acryloyloxyethyl) ester, phthalic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl) ester, hexahydrophthalic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl) ester, maleic acid (2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl) ester, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0263">In addition, these resins preferably have an ethylenic double bond in a side chain. By using a binder resin having a double bond in a side chain, the photo-curing property of the composition for a color filter obtained is enhanced, whereby it is feasible to further improve the resolving property and adhesion property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0264">Means for introducing an ethylenic double bond into a binder resin include, for example, methods disclosed in JP-B-50-34443, JP-B-50-34444, and so on; i.e., a method of reacting a compound having both a glycidyl group/an epoxy cyclohexyl group, and a (meth)acryloyl group with a carboxylic group of a resin, and a method of reacting an acrylic acid chloride or the like with a hydroxyl group of a resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0265">For example, a binder resin having an ethylenic double bond in a side chain is obtained by reacting a compound, such as glycidyl(meth)acrylate, allyl glycidyl ether, glycidyl α-ethylacrylate, crotonyl glycidyl ether, (iso)crotonic acid glycidyl ether, (3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)methyl(meth)acrylate, (meth)acrylic acid chloride, or (meth)acryl chloride, with a resin having a carboxyl group or a hydroxyl group. Particularly preferred binder resins are those resulting from a reaction with an alicyclic epoxy compound such as (3,4-epoxy cyclohexyl)methyl (meth)acrylate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0266">When an ethylenic double bond is preliminarily introduced into a resin having a carboxylic group or hydroxyl group as described above, it is preferable to bond a compound having an ethylenic double bond to from 2 to 50 mol %, preferably from 5 to 40 mol %, of the carboxyl group or hydroxyl group in the resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0267">These acrylic resins preferably have a weight-average molecular weight, as measured by GPC (gel permeation chromatography), in a range of from 1,000 to 100,000. If the weight-average molecular weight is less than 1,000, it tends to be difficult to obtain a uniform film. On the other hand, if it exceeds 100,000, the development property tends to degrade. A preferred content of the carboxylic group is in a range of from 5 to 200 as an acid value (mgKOH/g). If the acid value is less than 5, the resin tends to be insoluble in an alkali developer. On the other hand, if it exceeds 200, the sensitivity may become lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0268">As the binder resin, particularly preferred specific examples will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0269">(a-1): “Alkali-Soluble Resin Obtainable by Adding an Unsaturated Monobasic Acid to at Least Some of Epoxy Groups in a Copolymer of an Epoxy Group-Containing (Meth)Acrylate with Another Radical Polymerizable Monomer, and Further Adding a Polybasic Acid Anhydride to at Least Some of Hydroxyl Groups Formed by the Above Addition Reaction”</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0329">Furthermore, for a purpose of improving the sensitivity, a sensitizing dye according to a wavelength of an image exposure light source can be mixed in the composition for a color filter, if the case demands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0330">Examples of the sensitizing dye include xanthane dyes as described in JP-A-04-221958 and JP-A-04-219756, coumarin dyes having a heterocyclic ring as described in JP-A-03-239703 and JP-A-05-289335, 3-ketocoumarin compounds as described in JP-A-03-239703 and JP-A-05-289335, pyrromethene dyes as described in JP-A-06-19240, and dyes having a dialkyl aminobenzene skeleton as described in JP-A-47-2528, JP-A-54-155292, JP-B-45-37377, JP-A-48-84183, JP-A-52-112681, JP-A-58-15503, JP-A-60-88005, JP-A-59-56403, JP-A-02-69, JP-A-57-168088, JP-A-05-107761, JP-A-05-210240, and JP-A-04-288818.</div>

These solvents may be used in combination of two or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0336">The solid content in the color composition for a color filter is selected in accordance with a coating method to be applied. In a spin coat, a slit and spin coat, and a die coat widely used in the production of the color filter at present, an appropriate solid content is normally in a range of from 1 to 40% by weight and preferably in a range of from 5 to 30% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0337">A combination of solvents is determined taking a dispersion stability of a pigment, a solubility to soluble components in the solid contents, such as the resin, monomer and photopolymerization initiator, a drying property in coating, and a drying property in a reduced-pressure drying step into consideration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0338">A composition for a color filter using the above compounded components is produced, for example, as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0339">First, a colorant is subjected to a dispersion treatment and controlled into a state of ink. The dispersion treatment is conducted by means of a paint conditioner, a sand grinder, a ball mill, a roll mill, a stone mill, a jet mill, a homogenizer or the like. The colorant is brought into a state of fine particles by the dispersion treatment, thereby achieving an improvement in transmittance of transmitted light and an improvement in a coating property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0340">The dispersion treatment is preferably conducted in such a system that a binder resin having a dispersing function, a dispersing agent such as a surfactant, a dispersing assistance, etc. are optionally used together with the colorant and the solvent. It is particularly preferable to use a polymer dispersing agent, by virtue of its excellent dispersion stability over time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0341">For example, when the dispersion treatment is conducted by use of the sand grinder, it is preferred to use glass beads or zirconia beads having a particle size of from 0.05 to several millimeters. A temperature in the dispersion treatment is normally set in a range of from 0° C. to 100° C., preferably from room temperature to 80° C. A dispersing time is appropriately adjusted because an appropriate time for the dispersion treatment varies depending on the composition of ink (the colorant, the solvent and the dispersing agent), instrument specifications of the sand grinder, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0342">Then the binder resin, monomer, photopolymerization initiation system, and others are mixed into the color ink obtained by the above dispersion treatment, to form a uniform solution. Since fine foreign particles are often mixed into the solution in each of the dispersion treatment step and the mixing step, the resulting solution is preferably filtered by means of a filter or the like.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0394">Color filters of Examples 1 to 12 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 are prepared by combining the red, green and blue pixels shown in Tables 3 to 5.

<heading>(5-1) Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0395">Color image display devices of Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 are prepared by combining the backlights (BL-1, BL-2, BL-3 and BL-19) shown in Preparation Examples 1 to 3 and 19 and color filters for Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2. With respect to these color image display devices, the chromaticity (x, y, Y) was calculated from the calculated transmittance spectrum and the emission spectrum of backlight, and also the color reproduction property (NTSC ratio) and the brightness (color temperature) were obtained. Here, the value Y corresponds to the use efficiency of emitted light from the backlight. The results are shown in Table 6.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0396">Further, in Example 3, a backlight and a color filter were actually prepared in accordance with the above production method, and they were combined to obtain a color image display device. And, the emission spectrum of the backlight, the transmittance spectrum of each color pixel sample in the color filter, and the NTSC ratio and color temperature of the color image display device, were measured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0397">The transmittance spectrum of each pixel sample was measured by a spectrophotometer (“U-3500”, manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.). The emission spectrum of the backlight was measured by a light luminance meter (“CS-1000”, manufactured by KONICA MINOLTA HOLDINGS, INC.). Further, from the measured transmittance spectrum and the emission spectrum of the backlight, the chromaticity was calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0398">With respect to Example 3, the measured NTSC ratio and color temperature, and the chromaticity (x, y, Y) calculated based on the results of measurement of the transmittance spectrum of each pixel sample and the emission spectrum of the backlight, are shown in brackets in the corresponding section in Table 6.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0400">The value Y of white color in Table 6 represents the light use efficiency of backlight as the entire color image display device. As shown in Table 6, when a color image display device is designed to have a high color reproduction range by EBU standard (NTSC ratio: 72%) or with a NTSC ratio of 85%, a conventional backlight brings about a remarkable decrease of the value Y, while by using the technique of the present invention, a high level of the value Y can be accomplished. Namely, it becomes possible to obtain a higher luminance by a low power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0401">Further, with respect to Example 3, when the results obtained by simulation were compared with the results obtained by actual measurements, both results were substantially the same. Accordingly, also with respect to Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2, it is considered that if the corresponding color image display devices are actually prepared, and various properties are measured, the same results as shown in Table 5 will be obtained. Namely, from the results of simulation in the respective Examples and the respective Comparative Examples, the properties such as the NTSC ratio and the light use efficiency of the actual color image display devices may be judged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0402">Color image display devices of Examples 4 to 6 are prepared by combining the backlight (BL-4) shown in Preparation Example 4 and the color filters of Examples 4 to 6. Further, even Adobe-RGB (NTSC ratio: 94%) which was not accomplished by a conventional backlight, since the thickness of the color filter tended to be too thick, and the plate making property was not obtained, can be accomplished by using the technique of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0403">Further, in Example 3, each of the coating films of the compositions for the respective color filters prepared in the above Preparation Examples 13 to 15 was exposed with 100 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>by using a test pattern mask, followed by development, whereby it was confirmed that good patterns were obtained with respect to all samples. The film thickness after drying of the composition for each color filter actually prepared in Example 3 was 2.50 μm in each case.</div>

With respect to these color image display devices, in the same manner as in the above Examples 1 to 3, the chromaticity (x, y, Y), the NTSC ratio and the color temperature were obtained by calculation. The results are shown in Table 7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0405">Particularly, in Example 6, a backlight and a color filter were actually prepared, and they were combined to obtain a color image display device. With respect to the obtained color image display device, in the same manner as in Example 3, the transmittance spectrum of each color pixel sample, the emission spectrum of the backlight, and the NTSC ratio and color temperature of the color image display device were measured, and at the same time, the chromaticity (x, y, Y) was calculated based on the results of measurement of the transmittance spectrum of each color pixel and the emission spectrum of backlight, and these results are shown in brackets at a lower portion of the corresponding section in Table 7.</div>
