<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a production method excellent in selectivity for saturated aliphatic ketones having cyclohexane ring (occasionally abbreviated as cyclohexyl alkyl ketones) useful as various starting materials in industrial chemistry and as starting materials for production of medicines, agricultural chemicals, optical functional materials and electronic functional materials.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Heretofore, as a method for producing cyclohexyl alkyl ketones, there is known a method of obtaining them from a Grignard reagent synthesized from bromocyclohexenes, and a fatty acid chloride (see Non-Patent Document 1). Also known is a method of obtaining them by synthesizing cyclohexanecarbonitrile followed by similarly reacting it with ethylbromomagnesium (see Non-Patent Document 2). However, the above-mentioned prior-art technique has some problems in that the process is long and the disposal of wastes such as metal salts and others is difficult. In addition, in case where an aromatic ketone is hydrogenated with pressurized hydrogen according to the prior-art technique (see Non-Patent Document 3), the process involves a drawback in that not cyclohexyl alkyl ketones but aliphatic alcohols or alkylcylohexanes are synthesized as a result of reduction of the carbonyl group. Further, Patent Document 1 describes a method of producing a cyclohexyl alkyl ketone in which the cyclohexyl group has an alkyl substituent, as a result of hydrogenation of a phenyl alkyl ketone in which the phenyl group has an alkyl substituent; however, the yield in this method is about 30% and is low.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Of the above-mentioned aromatic ketones, preferred is hydroxyacetophenone or hydroxypropiophenone from the viewpoint of the reactivity and the use. In particular, p-hydroxyacetophenone and m-hydroxyacetophenone with the hydroxyl group bonding thereto are preferred to p-methylacetophenone with the methyl group bonding thereto and 4-acetylbiphenyl with the phenyl group bonding thereto, from the viewpoint of the reaction speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">[Catalyst]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The catalyst for use in the present invention carries from 0.1 to 20% by weight of a ruthenium atom on the carrier thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The catalyst for use in the present invention, in which the amount of the supported ruthenium atom is from 0.1 to 20% by weight, is not specifically defined in its production method. For example, the catalyst may be prepared in a method of supporting a ruthenium atom-containing compound on a carrier according to an impregnation, desiccation method, a precipitation method or the like, then processing it for reduction, for example, reduction with hydrogen or chemical reduction with sodium borohydride, hydrazine, formic acid or the like, or not processing it for reduction to prepare the intended catalyst.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In this, the ruthenium atom-containing compound includes, for example, ruthenium chloride hydrate, ruthenium bromide hydrate, ruthenium oxide hydrate, hexamine ruthenium chloride, hexamine ruthenium bromide, trinitratonitrosyl diaquaruthenium, tris(acetylacetonato)ruthenium, triruthenium dodecacarbonyl, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The carrier may be any one inert to the substituents of the aromatic compound that is the starting material for hydrogenation, under the reaction condition, and may be an organic or inorganic one, including, for example, active carbon, ion-exchange resin, silica, α-alumina, γ-alumina, silica-alumina, zeolite, as well as various types of metal oxides, composite oxides, etc. Especially preferred are alumina and active carbon from the viewpoint of the selectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The amount of ruthenium to be supported on the catalyst for use in the invention falls within a range of from 0.1 to 20% by weight of the total weight of the catalyst. When the amount is less than 0.1% by weight, a large amount of the catalyst must be used for attaining a sufficient nuclear hydrogenation ratio, and the industrial use thereof would be difficult. When the amount is more than 20% by weight, then the ratio of ruthenium to be taken into the pores may increase unnecessarily, and if so, there may occur hydrogenolysis or acyl reduction in the pores where the diffusion is insufficient and the selectivity may be thereby lowered. From the viewpoints, the amount to be supported is preferably from 0.5 to 10% by weight, more preferably from 2 to 5% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The amount of the catalyst to be used in the present invention may greatly vary depending on the amount of the supported active ingredient, the type of the starting material to be hydrogenated, the reaction condition and others, but in general, the amount preferably falls within a range of from 0.05 to 0.5 in terms of the ratio by weight to the starting material, 1. From the industrial viewpoint, more preferably, the amount falls within a range of from 0.1 to 0.3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">[Hydrogenation]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">According to the production method of the invention, a saturated aliphatic ketone is obtained by nuclear-hydrogenating the above-mentioned aromatic ketone represented by the general formula (1) with pressurized hydrogen in the presence of a solvent at a temperature of from 20 to 120° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The hydrogenation in the present invention may be attained in the absence of a solvent, depending on the type of the starting material to be hydrogenated and on the reaction condition; however, preferably, the hydrogenation is attained in the solvent from the viewpoint that the selectivity can be increased by selecting a solvent most suitable for the intended reaction and that the reaction time can be shortened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Not specifically defined, the solvent for use herein may be a compound poorly active to the hydrogenation and capable of dissolving the starting material. As concrete examples, there may be mentioned hydrocarbons not having a double bond such as n-pentane, n-hexane, cyclohexane; ethers such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, n-hexanol, cyclohexanol; halogenohydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride, dichloromethane, trichloroethane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">In the present invention, among the above-mentioned solvents, preferred are saturated aliphatic alcohols having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, linear or branched ethers, or saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, from the viewpoint of being accompanied by side reaction and handling in production not.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The above-mentioned solvents can be used singly, or can be used as a combination of two or more of them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Above all, preferred are diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexane, n-hexane, heptane; and even more preferred is tetrahydrofuran.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Not specifically defined, the ratio of the solvent to be used is, on the basis of the weight thereof, preferably within a range of from 0.05 to 100, more preferably from 0.1 to 20, in terms of ratio by weight relative to the starting material, 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Hydrogen to be used in the reaction may be any one generally used in industry; however, when hydrogen in which the amount of the impurity, carbon monoxide is small, is used, the catalyst activity could be excellent. Accordingly, the content of carbon monoxide in hydrogen is preferably at most 1%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Not specifically defined, the hydrogen pressure during reaction may be in any condition under pressure; however, if too low, the reaction may take a longer time than necessary, but if too high, the hydrogen consumption rate may increase. Accordingly, the pressure preferably falls within a range of from 0.5 to 20 MPa, more preferably within a range of from 1 to 10 MPa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The reaction temperature during the reaction may greatly vary depending on the type of the starting material to be hydrogenated, the reaction condition and the reaction time, and may be suitably defined within a range of from 0 to 200° C., but is preferably within a range of from 20 to 120° C. from the viewpoint of the selectivity and the economical aspect. Especially for the starting material having a highly-reactive substituent, the selectivity may increase when the temperature is selected preferably within a range of from 20 to 100° C., more preferably from 30 to 80° C., even more preferably from 30 to 60° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The reaction time for the reaction may be a time in which hydrogen absorption terminates. The time may vary depending on the type of the starting material to be hydrogenated, the amount of the catalyst and other reaction conditions, and therefore could not be indiscriminately defined. In general, the time may be from 0.5 to 20 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">As described above, the nuclear hydrogenation of the substituted aromatic ketone readily gives the intended hydrogenated product at high selectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Specifically, the advantage of the production method is that the nuclear hydrogenation provides an extremely high selectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">In addition, the above-mentioned ruthenium catalyst is available extremely inexpensively. Further, the catalyst can be used repeatedly, and therefore, the nuclear hydrogenation method is a method additionally advantageous in point of reducing the catalyst cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Not specifically defined, the reaction equipment may be any one resistant to the necessary hydrogen pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The reaction mode is preferably a batch mode from the viewpoint that the used catalyst must be separated in a liquid phase at the reaction temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">For example, a starting material of an aromatic ketone, a ruthenium catalyst and a solvent are fed into an autoclave equipped with an electromagnetic stirrer, then the contents are stirred and the liquid temperature is set, and thereafter the pressure is increased up to 0.5 to 20 MPa by hydrogen introduced thereinto, then under the condition where the pressure and the liquid temperature are kept as such, hydrogen is further introduced so as to keep the pressure constant, then the autoclave is kept as such until no more hydrogen is absorbed, thereafter the oil phase is collected through filtration or the like, and then analyzed through chromatography to thereby confirm the formed cyclohexyl alkyl ketone.</div>
