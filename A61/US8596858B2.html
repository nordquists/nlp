<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a solid-liquid contact apparatus for contacting a solid and a liquid to effect an operation, such as washing, purification, extraction, impregnation or dissolution, practiced principally in the field of chemical industry; particularly a continuous multi-stage stirring-type solid-liquid contact apparatus exhibiting a high solid-liquid contact efficiency and a solid-liquid contact method using the apparatus.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Hitherto, a countercurrent continuous contact scheme showing a high contact efficiency has been recognized to be advantageous as a method for solid-liquid contact treatment, i.e., a contact treatment between a solid or solid particles in a slurry and a treatment liquid. In order to effect a uniform and high-efficiency treatment with a small amount of solid-liquid contact, it is desirable to remove a dead zone or a short path for respective streams and improve the solid-liquid mixing so as to promote the renewal of solid-liquid boundary. On the other hand, however, a better mixing is liable to be accompanied with back mixing in the direction of solid and liquid flow axes which remarkably deteriorate the contact efficiency, so that it is difficult to attain a good compatibility there between. In order to reduce the back mixing while maintaining a good solid-liquid mixing state, there has been known a method of partitioning a flow path in a chamber with partitioning plates into a plurality of chambers forming multiple stages, but this cannot provide a good contact efficiency as expected since back mixing is also caused by countercurrent flows between the respective chambers. It is also effective for reducing the back mixing to reduce the sectional area of the flow path between the respective chambers, but this is accompanied with a reduction of treatment capacity and is therefore not practical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In order to improve the above-mentioned problem, there has been widely and generally known a mixer-settler-type extraction apparatus which includes in separation a mixer section for effecting a sufficient contact and a settler section for uniformly maintaining the respective countercurrent flows, but this requires a large size of apparatus since the functionally-separated respective sections have to retain necessary volumes. Many proposals have been introduced for reducing the apparatus volume, e.g., by adopting vertically arranged multiple stages as disclosed in Patent document 1 listed below. However, according to this type of apparatus, the flows in the settler section are liable to cause a non-uniform portion, and as a result, it becomes difficult to uniformize the treatment on the solid side, so that this type of apparatus is unsuitable as apparatus for operations, particularly for providing an objective product on the solid side, such as washing and impregnation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">In addition to the above, for solid-liquid extraction operation, there has been generally adopted a type of apparatus including a conveyer, such as a belt, baskets or a screw for forming a solid moving layer, and moving a liquid as a counter-current flow on a crossing stream respectively penetrating through the solid moving layer, but a uniform treatment on the solid side is difficult thereby, leaving a problem as an apparatus particularly for operations, such as washing and impregnation, for providing a solid objective product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">As a means for preventing a dead zone and a short path in an apparatus, Patent document 2 listed below discloses to provide a vertically movable stirring blade in each of multi-stage vessels, but on the other hand, no particular attention has been paid for reducing the back mixing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Further, Patent documents 3 to 5 listed below disclose multi-stage stirring chamber-type apparatus wherein inter-chamber openings are formed between annular partitioning plates and a stirring shaft equipped with stirring blades or disks or between annular partitioning plates and rotating disks affixed to a stirring shaft, and the openings are caused to have a certain thickness in the shaft direction so as to prevent the back mixing in the axial direction. However, all of these apparatus have adopted a form of obstructing inter-vessel streams, so that they may be categorized as apparatus for preventing the back mixing at the cost of a treatment capacity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">As described above, few studies have been made so far for providing a solid-liquid contact apparatus allowing a commercial scale use which allows a good solid-liquid mixing so as to effect a uniform and high-efficiency solid-liquid contact, while reducing the back mixing to prevent a lowering in treatment capacity.

<heading>BEST MODE FOR PRACTICING THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic vertical sectional view of vertical (or columnar) countercurrent solid-liquid contact apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view as viewed in the direction of arrows II-II in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This embodiment is designed for solid-liquid contact between solid particles having a relatively large density (or a slurry containing such solid particles) and a liquid having a relatively small density as in an ordinary solid-liquid system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus generally comprises a top section <b>1</b>, a main body (section) <b>2</b> and a bottom section <b>3</b>. The main body section <b>2</b> is divided into a plurality of stirring chambers, i.e., four stirring chambers <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, and each adjacent pair of stirring chamber are divided by a partitioning plate <b>5</b> having an opening (communicating hole) <b>4</b> at its center. Each of the stirring chambers <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> is provided with a flat paddle stirring blade <b>6</b> and baffles <b>7</b> in a form of being localized in a lower side of each stirring chamber, preferably in a form of being disposed in a lower half of each stirring chamber. The flat paddle stirring blade <b>6</b> disposed, as an example of radially ejecting stirring blade, in each stirring chamber <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, is rotatably affixed onto a common stirring shaft <b>8</b> extending through the top section <b>1</b> and the main body section <b>2</b>, and the baffles <b>7</b> (provided in a number of 4 disposed at radially equi-distant positions in this embodiment) are affixed onto the inner wall of the stirring chamber so as to extend vertically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The top section <b>1</b> is equipped with a solid (slurry) inlet pipe <b>91</b> and a liquid outlet pipe <b>94</b>, and the bottom section <b>3</b> is provided with a liquid inlet pipe <b>92</b> and a solid (slurry) outlet pipe <b>93</b>. The top section <b>1</b> may be provided with a flow sectional area which is enlarged at a ratio of ca. 1 to 4 times with respect to that in the main body section <b>2</b> so that a solid (slurry) stream introduced through the pipe <b>91</b> is not readily affected by axially back mixing with a liquid stream discharged through the pipe <b>94</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">In the apparatus thus organized, a solid (slurry) stream introduced into the top section <b>1</b> through the pipe <b>91</b> is introduced into the first stirring chamber <b>21</b> without being affected by substantial back mixing and sucked by a flat paddle stirring blade <b>6</b> localized in a lower region in the stirring chamber <b>21</b> to be ejected radially and split into an ascending flow at positions above the blade-affixed position and a descending flow at positions below the blade-affixed position owing to a function of the baffles localized also in a lower region of the stirring chamber and affixed to the inner wall thereof. More specifically, as a result of localizing the blade <b>6</b> and the baffles <b>7</b> in a lower region, a stream sucked by the stirring blade and principally comprising the solid (slurry) forms a small circulating flow below the blade, a relatively large circulating flow just above the blade and also a gentle flow having a (slightly) lower concentration of the solid particles at a ceiling section of the stirring chamber <b>21</b>, as represented by arrows in the figure. As a result, there arise a descending flow having a larger concentration of solid particles in proximity to an outer periphery of the center opening <b>4</b> of the partitioning plate <b>5</b> and also an ascending flow rich in the liquid introduced from the liquid inlet <b>92</b> at a central part of the opening <b>4</b> around the stirring shaft <b>8</b>, and the ascending flow is sucked by, the blade <b>6</b> to be subjected to mixing under stirring with the solid (slurry) introduced from above the blade. Owing to a series of such hydraulic actions, the solid-liquid contact of the solid (slurry) introduced from the pipe <b>91</b> and the liquid introduced from the pipe <b>92</b> is effectively accomplished while suppressing the axial back mixing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Then, the stream rich in solid particles introduced from the stirring chamber <b>21</b> to the stirring chamber <b>22</b> is, similarly as in the stirring chamber <b>21</b>, subjected to an effective solid-liquid contact treatment with the liquid introduced from the pipe <b>92</b> under the radially ejecting stirring action and rectifying action of the flat paddle blade <b>6</b> and baffles <b>7</b> disposed in a lower region of the stirring chamber <b>22</b>, without being substantially affected by back mixing in a ceiling region (so-called rectifying region) with a relatively gentle flow in the stirring chamber <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Further, similar solid-liquid contact treatments are repeated also in the stirring chambers <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>, and as a result of repetition of such effective solid-liquid contact treatment in the state of suppressing the axial back mixing, it is believed possible to accomplish an overall high solid-liquid contact efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">In the main body section <b>2</b> including the stirring chambers <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, the solid particles in the solid (slurry) introduced from the pipe <b>91</b> have a higher density than the liquid introduced from the pipe <b>92</b>, and the solid particles are driven and moved downward due to sedimentation under the action of a relatively large gravity and formation of a descending stream under the action of a relatively large dynamic pressure exerted by the stirring blade <b>6</b>. These actions and the suppression of back mixing are believed to be the reason why a high treatment efficiency per volume can be attained in the apparatus of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">As a solid-liquid density difference is utilized in the apparatus of the present invention, it is necessary that a density difference is present between the solid and the liquid. In this regard, the solid-liquid density ratio, i.e., (apparent density of solid)/(density of liquid) or (density of liquid)/(apparent density of solid), should be in the range of 1.03-20, preferably 1.05-10, further preferably 1.10-5. In case where the solid-liquid density ratio is below 1.03, the solid-liquid separation is liable to be inferior, and if the solid-liquid density ratio is above 20, the solid-liquid contact efficiency is liable to be lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The solid (slurry) subjected to solid-liquid contact in the main body section <b>2</b> is caused to contact the liquid introduced from the pipe <b>92</b> without being affected by substantial back mixing in the bottom section <b>3</b> to be discharged as a solid (slurry) from a bottom pipe <b>93</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">On the other hand, the liquid introduced from the pipe <b>92</b> is subjected to gentle solid-liquid contact in the bottom section <b>3</b>, solid-liquid contact accompanied with stirring in the main body section <b>2</b> and gentle solid-liquid contact in the top section <b>1</b>, respectively with the solid (slurry) introduced from the pipe <b>91</b>, and then discharged out of an upper pipe <b>94</b> at the top section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Incidentally, the above-described state or presence of the relatively small circulating flow below the blades <b>6</b>, the relatively large circulating flow above the blades <b>6</b>, the descending flow at the outer periphery of the openings <b>4</b> and the ascending flow at the center of the openings <b>4</b> in the respective stirring chambers <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, has been confirmed as a result of observation of the fluid from outside of the main body <b>2</b> formed of a transparent material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be applied to any type of unit operation wherein a solid (slurry) introduced from the pipe <b>91</b> and a liquid introduced from the pipe <b>92</b> are subjected to solid-liquid contact in the apparatus, and specific examples thereof may include: washing, purification, extraction, impregnation, reaction and dissolution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In order to operate the solid-liquid contact apparatus of the present invention at a good solid-liquid contact efficiency, it is desirable to provide the solid-liquid mixture in each stirring chamber with an appropriate mixing state, and it has been experimentally confirmed that this is satisfied by a stirring Reynolds number (Re) in the range of 500-500,000, more preferably 800-100,000, particularly preferably 1,200-30,000. More specifically, this is based on experimental results that the solid-liquid contact efficiency in each stirring chamber (stage efficiency) is generally increased along with an increase of Re, but if Re is increased in excess of certain value, the stage efficiency is rather lowered due to increased back mixing between the adjacent stirring chambers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The stirring Reynolds number is determined by the following equation (1) as described in, e.g., “Kagaku Kogaku Binran (Chemical Engineer's Handbook) (6th. Ed.)” Edited by The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan (Published from Maruzen K.K. (1999))
<br/>
<i>Re=ρnd</i> <sup>2</sup>/μ  (1),
<br/>
wherein ρ: average density of a slurry liquid in a stirring chamber [kg/m<sup>3</sup>], n: stirring rotation speed [1/s], d: stirring blade diameter [m], and μ: viscosity of the slurry liquid in the stirring chamber [Pa·s]. Re can be calculated by using physical properties, such as ρ and μ, e.g., obtained by direct measurement or described in literature such as “Kagaku Binran (Chemical Handbook) (4th. Ed)” Edited by Chemical Society of Japan (published from Maruzen K.K.), and an example of the calculation is given in Example 1 described hereinafter.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Further, it has been confirmed that the solid-liquid contact apparatus of the present invention as represented by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> exhibits a good solid-liquid contact efficiency when operated in the neighborhood of its maximum load. In an ordinary apparatus, as the load thereto is increased, the residence time is decreased and back mixing flow is increased, so that the efficiency of the apparatus is lowered. However, in the case of the apparatus of the present invention, it is considered that the increase of back mixing flow accompanying the increase of load is extremely small, and the efficiency of the apparatus is rather increased as the load is increased by exceeding the negative effect caused by the decrease in the residence time. More specifically, when the maximum allowable treatment flow capacity of the apparatus is taken as a maximum load of the apparatus, it is preferred to operate the apparatus at a treatment flow capacity which is at least 60%, more preferably at least 80%, further preferably at least 90%, of the maximum load. Herein, the maximum load, i.e., the maximum value of treatment flow capacity, may be determined experimentally in the following manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">(Maximum Value of Treatment Flow Capacity)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">(a) In the case where substantially all the amount of the solid flow supplied from the pipe <b>91</b> is discharged out of the pipe <b>93</b> (For example, in the operation of washing, purification, extraction or impregnation of a solid with a liquid).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">First, the ratio of solid and liquid treated in the apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is determined as a solid-liquid ratio. Then, while the stirring blades <b>6</b> are rotated at a speed so as to satisfy: 1200≦Re≦30000, the solid and liquid are started to be supplied to pipe <b>91</b> and the pipe <b>92</b> so as to provide the predetermined solid-liquid ratio, and the flow (supply) rates are gradually increased while keeping the predetermined solid-liquid ratio. When the solid flow rate supplied from the pipe <b>91</b> exceeds the solid flow rate discharged out of the pipe <b>93</b>, the solid flow supply rate and the liquid supply rate are assumed to be maxima of the respective flow supply rates, and the total value thereof is taken as the maximum treatment flow capacity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0008">(b) In the case where the amount of solid supplied from the pipe <b>91</b> is gradually decreased as the solid is moved through the apparatus (For example, in dissolution of a solid).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">First, a target value of concentration of dissolved solid (C(g/ml) at the liquid outlet <b>94</b> and a target value of dissolution percentage (S(%) are set for the apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Further, a ratio (Fs/Fl) between the solid flow supply rate (Fs) and the liquid flow supply rate (Fl) is determined so as to provide the target value of concentration (C) when all the supplied solid is dissolved. While keeping the ratio, the solid flow supply rate (Fs) and the liquid flow supply rate (Fl) are gradually increased. Initially, all the amount of supplied solid is dissolved, but when the solid supply rate exceeds the dissolution speed of the solid, a solid is discharged out of the pipe <b>93</b>. At this point of time, the solid in the apparatus is distributed in a larger amount in the stirring chamber <b>21</b> at an upper part of the apparatus and in a smaller amount in the stirring chamber <b>24</b> at a lower part in the apparatus. Then if only the solid supply rate is increased while retaining the liquid supply rate, the distribution of the solid in the stirring chamber <b>24</b> at a lower part of the apparatus is increased so that the solid-liquid contact area in the whole apparatus is increased and the concentration of the dissolved solid at the liquid outlet is increased. Thus, the dissolved solid concentration at the liquid outlet can be increased by increase the ratio (Fs/Fl) of the solid supply rate (Fs) and the liquid supply rate (Fl), whereas the rate of discharged solid is gradually increased. Accordingly, the solid supply rate is increased so as to increase the ratio (Fs/Fl) while increasing the liquid supply rate until a point of time when either one of the target concentration value (C) at the liquid outlet and the target percentage of dissolved solid (S) cannot be stably retained. The solid supply rate at that time is assumed to be the maximum value, and the solid discharge rate at that time is assumed to be the upper limit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The above operation (b) can also be applied to a case where the supplied solid and supplied liquid are reacted with each other, and a part or all of the solid is gradually decreased by the reaction and discharged out of the liquid outlet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The maximum load and the solid-liquid contact efficiency of the apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> determined principally based on the solid flow supply rate depend principally on the sizes of the respective stirring chambers <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> and the opening (or aperture) ratio of the partitioning plates <b>5</b> between the stirring chambers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">According to our knowledge, it is preferred to set a ratio (H/D) between the height (H) and the inner diameter (D) of each of the stirring chambers <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> within a range of 0.1-3.0, particularly 0.25-1.5, and provide the communication hole or opening <b>4</b> with an opening area (a total area in case where a plurality of holes <b>4</b> are provided) which is 0.2 to 20%, particularly 1-10%, of the sectional area of the stirring chamber at a position or height level of the partitioning plate <b>5</b>, whereby a good efficiency of solid-liquid contact becomes possible while suppressing the back mixing in the stirring chamber. In the case of operation in a system having a large solid-liquid density ratio, it is possible to use a relatively small ratio of H/D to reduce the entire apparatus height. On the other hand, in the case of operation in a system having a small solid-liquid density ratio, it is desirable to increase the H/D ratio, thereby promoting the formation of a rectifying region in an upper side of the stirring chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Whether the solid (slurry) supplied from the pipe <b>91</b> should be solid particles alone or a slurry thereof depends on the species of the solid and liquid and the easiness of supplying the solid particles alone. Generally, if the purpose of the solid-liquid contact allows, the slurry form allows an easier supply to the apparatus. In this case, the solid/liquid ratio for providing the slurry is determined principally from the viewpoint of easiness of the slurry supply, and it is generally preferred to use a higher solid/liquid ratio (i.e., using a smaller amount of liquid for the slurry formation). Further, it is preferred that the liquid in the slurry is separated from the solid particles as quickly as possible (and without being mixed with the liquid introduced from the pipe <b>92</b>) to be discharged out of the pipe <b>94</b>. Also for this reason, it is preferred that the top section <b>1</b> is provided with a larger sectional area than the main body section <b>2</b> so as to provide a state close to a laminar flow state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The viscosity of the liquid in the stirring chamber for operation in the apparatus of the present invention may preferably be 0.01×10<sup>−3</sup>-1.0 Pa·s, preferably 0.05×10<sup>−3</sup>-0.5 Pa·s, further preferably 0.1×10<sup>−3</sup>-0.1 Pa·s in the case of using a stirring blade, such as a flat paddle blade or a disk turbine blade. In a high viscosity region in excess of 1 Pa·s or in a low viscosity region below 0.01×10<sup>−3 </sup>Pa·s, the stirring and mixing state in the stirring region at a lower part in the chamber becomes worse, thus resulting in a lower solid-liquid contact efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The liquid for the slurrying introduced from the pipe <b>91</b> and the liquid introduced from the pipe <b>92</b> may preferably be identical in many cases, but can be different from each other depending on the purpose of the solid-liquid contact. The different liquids can be immiscible with each other but may preferably be miscible with each other from the viewpoint of rectification of flows between adjacent stirring chambers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Whether the discharge stream out of the pipe <b>93</b> should comprise the solid particles alone or a slurry thereof may also depend on the species of the solid and liquid and the adaptability to a subsequent step. A slurry form having a good flowability is desired in many cases, and also in such cases, it is preferred for the liquid in the slurry that the liquid introduced into the bottom section <b>3</b> from the pipe <b>92</b> is guided to the pipe <b>93</b> without being excessively mixed therein and discharged as the slurry together with the solid particles. In other words, in the bottom section <b>3</b>, it is preferred to form a laminar flow state wherein principally the solid particles alone flow downwards as a flow in a reverse direction with respect to a major flow of the liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The solid-liquid contact apparatus of the present invention as represented by the one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has an advantage of easy scale-up in addition to the advantage of a large treatment capacity per volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">As methods for scaling-up of stirring operation so as to retain a flow state attained in a small-scale stirring vessel, there are known a method of using a constant speed of stirring blade tip or a constant stirring power per unit volume as a basis, and also a method of using a constant Reynolds number for stirring as a basis. Further, it is also known that a particle drifting limit stirring speed in a stirring operation for a solid-liquid system can be maintained by using a rotation speed giving a constant stirring power per unit volume, if similarities are satisfied in shapes of the stirring vessels and the inner members such as stirring blades and baffles, and systems of similar solid-liquid states are treated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">According to these methods, however, for a scale-up of a solid-liquid contact apparatus of a multi-stage stirring vessel (or chamber) type, it is difficult to predict a back mixing between vessels (or chambers) so that it has been difficult to accurately obtain a designed contact efficiency. In the present invention, not only Re is controlled at constant (or in a constant range) but also it has become possible to suppress reverse mixing flows between the chambers by an appropriate combination of “positional setting of a stirring blade and a baffle in a stirring chamber” and “setting of Re in a prescribed range”. As a result, it has become possible to use a contact efficiency obtained in a small-scale experiment at a good reproducibility in scaling-up, thus affording an increased accuracy of designing.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The above-mentioned essential effects of the apparatus of the present invention cannot be attained by a conventional continuous multi-stage stirring-type solid-liquid contact apparatus wherein in each stirring chamber, the stirring blade is disposed at an almost central position and the baffles are disposed so as to extend over an almost entire range of the stirring chamber height.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic vertical sectional view of such a conventional-type apparatus, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view as viewed in the direction of arrows IV-IV. The apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> is different from the apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> only in that in each stirring chamber <b>21</b>-<b>24</b>, a stirring blade <b>36</b> is at an almost central position and baffles <b>37</b> are disposed over an almost entire height of the chamber. In such an apparatus, no rectifying region is formed in proximity to the ceiling of each stirring chamber, and corresponding thereto, back mixing is caused due to obstruction of formation of a descending flow and an ascending flow at a central hole of a partitioning plate between adjacent stirring chambers, so that the essential effects of the apparatus of the present invention are lost.</div>
<heading>Examples of Modification</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">In the above, a preferred embodiment of the vertical countercurrent solid-liquid contact apparatus according to the present invention has been described while referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. However, it is believed easily understandable for one of ordinary skilled in the art that the apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> can be modified in various manners within the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">For example, the number of stirring chambers constituting the apparatus is not restricted to 4 as shown but be varied in a range of, e.g., 2-400, depending on a required theoretical number of solid-liquid contact stages (or plates). Further, the apparatus can be modified into a series of plural vertical solid-liquid contact apparatus by introducing the solid (slurry) from the pipe <b>93</b> into a pipe <b>91</b> of another solid-liquid contact apparatus of a similar structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for further treatment therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Further, the stirring blade is not restricted to a flat paddle blade as shown but can have any blade shape, such as that of a disk turbine blade, as far as it can cause a radially ejected stream. Further, the number of baffles in one stirring chamber is not restricted to 4 in the above embodiment but can generally range from 1 to 12, while 2-8 is preferred. The baffles may ordinarily be disposed vertically on the inner wall of the stirring chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">In the continuous multi-stage stirring chamber-type solid-liquid contact apparatus of the present invention, it is a characteristic that a solid stream and a liquid stream go back and forth regularly as countercurrent streams (a descending flow and an ascending flow) through an opening (or aperture) of a partitioning plate disposed between adjacent stirring chambers. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the countercurrent streams are formed at a periphery and a central part of a single aperture formed at a center of the partitioning plate, but the aperture is not restricted to a single one but can be disposed in a plurality. For example in the apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in addition to a central hole for passing an ascending stream, an aperture for principally passing a descending stream can be formed as a plurality of apertures or a single annular aperture shifted toward the inner wall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Further, the apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is designed as a solid-liquid contact apparatus for treating a solid and a liquid of which the solid has a larger density, but the same apparatus can also be used, for solid-liquid contact between a liquid and a solid (e.g., hollow foam particles) having a smaller density than the liquid by introducing the solid (slurry) from the pipe <b>92</b> and the liquid from the pipe <b>91</b>. In this instance, the pipe <b>94</b> functions as the outlet for the solid (slurry) and the pipe <b>93</b> functions as the outlet for the heavier liquid, as a natural consequence. In this modification, it may also be desirable to change relative sizes of the top section <b>1</b> and the bottom section <b>3</b> with respect to the main body section <b>2</b> in many cases, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">(Utilization of the Apparatus of the Invention)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The continuous multi-stage stirring chamber-type countercurrent solid-liquid contact apparatus of the present invention can be widely used, e.g., for extraction into a liquid of a valuable component in a solid, such as tea, coffee, sugar, perfume, oil or fat, and a minor quantity natural component; washing with water of dressed meat or fish meat; recovery of solvents for polymerization of synthetic resins, and washing of resin particles or formed pellets; washing of unnecessary components in a washed solid such as a recycled plastic; a reaction between a solid and liquid, and a reaction such as polymerization between a liquid and a liquid to form a solid product; impregnation of a solid with a liquid component and rinsing of solid surface; and dissolution of a solid in a liquid, and peptization of colloidal precipitate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">As a preferable example of utilization, the solid-liquid contact apparatus of the present invention can be used for washing of PAS (polyarylene sulfide) resin particles for the purpose of polymerization solvent from a PAS polymerizate slurry or purification of the resin particles subsequent thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">More specifically, a process for treating a polymerizate slurry containing PAS slurry particles obtained by a polymerization step is described in JP-A 61-255933. The treatment process includes (1) a step of separating a polymerizate slurry containing polyarylene sulfide particles, by-produced crystalline and dissolved alkali chloride, arylene sulfide oligomer and N-methylpyrrolidone as a principal liquid component by sieving into polyarylene sulfide particles and a slurry containing the crystalline alkali chloride, (2) a step of subjecting the slurry containing the crystalline alkali chloride to solid-liquid separation to recover the crystalline alkali chloride, and distilling the liquid component to recover N-methylpyrrolidone, (3) a step of washing the polyarylene sulfide particles with an organic solvent, such as acetone, and water; and (4) a step of distilling the organic solvent washing liquid to recovered solvent. The solid-liquid contact apparatus of the present invention can also be used as a continuous washing apparatus suitably applicable to the above-mentioned step (3).</div>
<heading>EXAMPLES</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described more specifically based on Examples and Comparative Examples.</div>
<heading>Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">In a solid-liquid contact apparatus having an organization shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), a PPS (polyphenylene sulfide) slurry was supplied at a rate of 25 kg/h through a pipe <b>91</b> and water was supplied as a washing liquid at a rate of 37.5 kg/h from the pipe <b>92</b> to effect a continuous solid-liquid contact treatment. The treatment flow rate or load of the apparatus was 62.5 kg/h as a total of the slurry and water supply rates. The PPS slurry contained 5 kg/h of PPS particles (on a dry basis), 16 kg/h of water and 4 kg/h of acetone, so that the liquid excluding the PPS particles in the slurry contained 20 wt. % of acetone (acetone concentration in the slurry of 16 wt. %) and the concentration of the PPS particles in the slurry was 20 wt %. Further, a washing bath ratio L/P determined as a ratio of the washing liquid to the PPS particles in the slurry was 7.5 (=37.5/(25×0.2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">The apparatus had 4 stirring chambers <b>21</b>-<b>24</b> which were made of an acrylic resin sheet and allowed seeing-through of the inside thereof. Each stirring chamber had an inner diameter D=104 mm, a height H=125 mm, a stirring shaft <b>8</b> having an outer diameter of 20 mm and a partitioning plate <b>5</b> with an aperture <b>4</b> having an inner diameter of 32 mm, thus providing an aperture ratio of the partitioning plate of 5.8%. Further, each stirring chamber was provided with 4 flat paddle blades which were in sizes providing a stirring blade diameter of 60 mm (i.e., d=0.06 m) as a total of two blades and a blade width of 20 mm (b=0.02 m). The 4 blades were fixed about the stirring shaft <b>8</b> at equi-angular spacings of 90° from each other so as to extend in a height range of 22 mm to 42 mm above the partitioning plate <b>5</b>. Further, 4 baffles <b>7</b> each measuring a lateral width of 15 mm and a height of 60 mm were fixed at 4 points of the inner wall with equi-angular spacings of 90° from each other so as to extend in a height range of 0 mm to 63 mm above the partitioning plate <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">In the above apparatus, the stirring shaft <b>8</b> was rotated at a speed of 200 rpm (i.e., n=200/60=10/3 (1/s), corresponding to an average stirring Reynolds number in the stirring chamber Re=6.4×10<sup>3 </sup>as shown in a calculation described later). In this stirring state, as mentioned above, the PPS slurry was supplied from the pipe <b>91</b> at 25 kg/h, and water was supplied from the pipe <b>92</b> at 37.5 kg/h. As a result, owing to the functions of the flat paddle blades <b>6</b> and the baffles <b>7</b> disposed only in a lower half of each stirring chamber, there was observed a fluid dynamic state characterized by a relatively small circulating flow below the blades <b>6</b>, a relatively large circulating flow above the blades <b>6</b>, a descending flow at the outer periphery of the aperture <b>4</b>, an ascending flow at the center of the aperture <b>4</b> (respectively represented by arrows in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example) and a gentle flow state (with no arrows) at an upper part of the stirring chamber. Further, the waste liquid was discharged from the pipe <b>94</b> at 37.5 kg/h, and the washed slurry was discharged from the bottom pipe <b>93</b> at 25 kg/h so as to retain a particle concentration of 20 wt. % in the slurry. As a result, the acetone concentration in the discharged slurry (acetone concentration at the outlet) was 0.22 wt. %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">Incidentally, in the above apparatus, the slurry supply rate to the pipe <b>91</b> and water supply rate to the pipe <b>92</b> were gradually increased, while retaining the washing bath ratio L/P=7.5, up to a treatment load (as a total of the slurry and water supply rates) of 66 kg/h (5.3 kg/h as PPS particles), when the slurry discharge rate from the pipe <b>93</b> was not increased any more but stagnation of solid in the stirring chambers was observed in response to a further increase of the supply rates, so that 66 kg/h was taken as the maximum treatment load.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">Accordingly, the above-mentioned treatment load of 62.5 kg/h (5 kg/h as PPS particles) corresponds to 95% of the maximum treatment load.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">The above-mentioned average stirring Reynolds number in the stirring chamber Re was calculated in the following manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">As described hereinbefore, Re can be calculated according to the following formula (1) (Reference books: “Kagaku Kogaku Binran (6th. Ed.)”, “Kagaku Binran (4th. Ed.)”)

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0014">(i) Average Density ρ [kg/m3] of Slurry Liquid</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">ρ<b>1</b> can be obtained by accurately measuring the volume and the mass of a liquid and dividing the mass with the volume, but the data of pure substances or mixtures thereof may also be available from handbooks, etc. For obtaining ρs, the true density ρst of a solid is measured by using a pycnometer. Then, the solid is immersed in a slurry-forming liquid and then pulled out of the liquid, immediately followed by measurement of the wet mass Ww [kg] thereof. Then, the liquid is removed, and the solid after drying is weighed to obtain a dry mass Wd [kg]. ρs is calculated according to formula (3) below:
<br/>
ρ<i>s=ρ</i>1×((<i>Ww−Wd</i>)/<i>Ww</i>)+ρ<i>st</i>×(1−(<i>Ww−Wd</i>)/<i>Ww</i>)  (3).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">The values of ρs and ρ<b>1</b> vary locally, particularly along the axis, so that these values are calculated for the uppermost stirring chamber and the lowermost stirring chamber (i.e., the 1<sup>st </sup>and 4<sup>th </sup>stages in this case), and an arithmetic mean thereof is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Φ (volumetric content of solid) may for example be obtained by once stopping an operation of the apparatus in a constant operation state thereof, discharging the whole slurry from the apparatus, immediately pulling out the solid from the slurry and weighing wet mass Ww of the solid to calculate Φ according to formula (4) below wherein V<b>1</b> denotes an inner volume of the apparatus:

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">These parameters were calculated, e.g., for Example 1 as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">First, values of ρs are obtained for the 1<sup>st </sup>and 4<sup>th </sup>stages from formula (3) above. From “Kagaku Binran (4<sup>th </sup>Ed.)”, densities at 20° C. were 998 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>(ρw) for water and 791 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>for acetone.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">In the case of Example 1, “Kagaku Binran (4th. Ed.)” gives viscosity data at 20° C. of 1.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>Pa·s for water and 0.4×10<sup>−3 </sup>Pa·s for acetone. Accordingly, for the 1st. stage,

μ11=(0.0561)(0.4×10<sup>−3</sup>)+(1−0.0561)(10<sup>−3</sup>)=0.966×10<sup>−3 </sup>

<heading>Reference Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">While the stirring conditions and the washing bath ratio (L/P=7.5) of Example 1 were retained, the treatment load (as a total of the slurry supply rate to the pipe <b>91</b> and the water supply rate to the pipe <b>92</b>) was reduced down to 37.5 kg/h (3 kg/h as PPS particles). As a result, the outlet acetone concentration was 0.60 wt. % and the average stirring Reynolds number Re in the apparatus was 6.82×10<sup>3</sup>. The treatment load of 37.5 kg/h corresponds to 57% of the maximum load.</div>
<heading>Reference Example 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">In Reference Example 1, the blade rotation speed was reduced down to 4 rpm, which corresponded to an average stirring Reynolds number Re in the apparatus of 1.37×10<sup>2</sup>. Under the stirring condition and while retaining the washing bath ratio (L/P=7.5), the treatment load (as a total of the slurry supply rate to the pipe <b>91</b> and the water supply rate to the pipe <b>92</b>) was set at 37.5 kg/h (3 kg/h as the PPS particles).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Incidentally, in the above apparatus, the slurry supply rate to the pipe <b>91</b> and water supply rate to the pipe <b>92</b> were gradually increased, while retaining the washing bath ratio L/P=7.5, up to a treatment load (as a total of the slurry and water supply rates) of 40 kg/h, when the slurry discharge rate from the pipe <b>93</b> was not increased any more but stagnation of solid in the stirring chambers was observed in response to a further increase of the supply rates, so that 40 kg/h was taken as the maximum treatment load.

<heading>Reference Example 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">The apparatus of Reference Example 2 was modified to provide the partitioning plates <b>5</b> with an aperture <b>4</b> having an increased diameter of 52 mm and an aperture ratio of 21%, whereby the maximum treatment load was increased to 66 kg/h (5.3 kg/h as PPS particles).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">As shown in Table 1, Example 1 exhibited a high treatment capacity (load) and also a high solid-liquid contact efficiency (i.e., a low outlet acetone concentration and a high stage efficiency). Reference Example 1 shows that a lower load ratio rather resulted in a lower solid-liquid contact efficiency. Reference Example 2 resulted in a low treatment capacity and a low solid-liquid contact efficiency because of a low Re. Reference Example 3 resulted in an increased treatment capacity due to an increased aperture ratio but resulted in a further low solid-liquid contact efficiency. In any of Comparative Example 1 using an apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, Comparative Example 2 satisfying only the baffle position requirement of the present invention and Comparative Example 3 satisfying only the stirring blade position of the present invention, only lower solid-liquid contact efficiencies were obtained. Example 2 using a simply reduced stirring chamber height resulted in a fairly good solid-liquid contact efficiency. Examples 3 and 4 resulted in good solid-liquid contact efficiencies at increased treatment load levels attained by scaling-up.</div>
<heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">As described above, the present invention provides a (countercurrent) solid-liquid contact apparatus of the continuous multi-stage stirring chamber type which exhibits a good uniformity of solid-liquid flows and a high contact efficiency, is also simple in structure and allows easy scale-up, and also an effective solid-liquid contact method using the apparatus. The apparatus can be widely applied to unit operations principally in the chemical industry, such as washing, purification, extraction, impregnation, reaction and dissolution.</div>
