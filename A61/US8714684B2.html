<heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-018146, filed on Jan. 31, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a technique of a double-sided printing in which a sheet that has been printed on one surface is reversed and the printing on the other surface thereof is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">As double-sided printing systems of printing apparatuses, there is well known a system in which printing on one surface of one paper sheet and the printing on the other surface of the one paper sheet are continuously performed and then the printing on one surface of a paper sheet which follows the one paper sheet and the printing on the other surface of the paper sheet which follows the one paper sheet are continuously performed (hereinafter referred to as a double-sided continuous system). On the other hand, there is a printing apparatus which adopts the following system. That is, the printing on one surface of another paper sheet is performed during a time after the printing on one surface of one paper sheet is performed and before the printing on the other surface of the one paper sheet is performed, that is, the printing on one surface of one paper sheet and the printing on one surface of another paper sheet are continuously performed (hereinafter referred to as a single-sided continuous system). According to the single-sided continuous system, a length of time after the printing on one surface of one paper sheet is performed and before the printing on the other surface of the one paper sheet is performed (i.e. a time for reversing the paper sheet) can be allocated to the printing on another paper sheet. Therefore, in a case that the single-sided continuous system is adopted, it is possible to perform a printing process faster than a case in which the double-sided continuous printing system is adopted, in an amount of time corresponding to the time for reversing the paper sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Here, conventionally, there is a printing apparatus which is aimed at improving the number of sheets to be subjected to the printing process (a throughput) per unit time with respect to a sheet having a short sheet-length unless a transport speed of the sheet is increased. It is noted that the sheet-length refers to a length of the sheet in the transport direction. The above printing apparatus is configured as follows. That is, in a case that the sheet to be used has the short sheet-length, a larger number of sheets are made to wait in a re-reversing route as compared with a case in which the sheet to be used has a long sheet-length.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In the printing apparatus described above, improvement of the throughput when the printing is performed on the sheet having the short sheet-length is merely considered. However, for example, there is a printing apparatus in which in a case that a transport unit is installed to the printing apparatus, a re-transport route for guiding the sheet having passed through a printing position to the printing position again becomes longer. In such a printing apparatus, when the re-transport route increases in length, the throughput is likely to deteriorate in some cases. Further, in the printing apparatus described above, even when the sheet-length is short, if the re-transport route is long, the throughput deteriorates as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In the present description, there is disclosed a technique, in which even when the re-transport route of the sheet becomes longer due to installation of the transport unit, deterioration of the throughput of the double-sided printing can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">According to the first aspect of the present teaching, there is provided a printing apparatus which performs printing on a sheet, including:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">a printing section which performs the printing on the sheet at a printing position;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">a transport mechanism in which a transport route which guides the sheet to the printing position and a re-transport route which guides the sheet having passed through the printing position to the printing position again are formed, the transport mechanism including an install section to which a transport unit, in which an extended route connected to the re-transport route to form a part of the re-transport route thereby lengthening a length of the re-transport route is formed, is to be installed; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">a print control section which controls the printing section and the transport mechanism to execute a plurality of kinds of double-sided printing processes having different maximum numbers of sheets present at the same time in the transport mechanism from each other so that in a case that the transport unit is installed to the install section, a double-sided printing process, among the double-sided printing processes, in which a maximum number of sheets is large as compared with a case in which the transport unit is not installed to the install section is executed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">According to the present teaching, even when the re-transport route of the sheet is long due to the installation of the transport unit, it is possible to suppress deterioration of throughput of the double-sided printing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">According to a second aspect of the present teaching, there is provided a non-transitory tangible media storing a double-sided printing control program which makes a computer of an image forming apparatus execute an installation judging and a print controlling,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">wherein the image forming apparatus includes a printing section which performs printing on a sheet at a printing position; and a transport mechanism in which a transport route that guides the sheet to the printing position and a re-transport route that guides the sheet having passed through the printing position to the printing position again are formed, and the transport mechanism includes a install section to which a transport unit, in which an extended route which is connected to the re-transport route to form a part of the re-transport route thereby lengthening a length of the re-transport route is formed, is installed;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">the installation judging is a process in which whether or not the transport unit is installed to the install section is judged; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">the print controlling is a process in which under a condition that it is judged the transport unit is installed to the install section in the installation judging, a double-sided printing process, in which a maximum number of sheets present at the same time in the transport mechanism is large as compared with a case in which it is judged the transport unit is not installed to the install section in the installation judging, is executed by the printing section and the transport mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The present teaching can be realized in various aspects, such as recording media etc., in which a computer program for realizing methods or apparatus functions with respect to a control apparatus, a control method, a printing apparatus, and a printing method is stored.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The first embodiment will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<heading>1. Electrical Construction of Printing System</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">A printing system <b>1</b> is provided with a terminal <b>10</b> (for example a personal computer) and a printer <b>30</b> (an example of a printing apparatus). The terminal <b>10</b> is provided with a CPU <b>11</b>, a ROM <b>12</b>, a RAM <b>13</b>, a hard disk drive (HDD) <b>14</b>, an operation section <b>15</b> including a keyboard, a pointing device, etc., a display section <b>16</b> including a liquid crystal display etc., a network interface (network I/F) <b>17</b> connected to a communication line <b>20</b>, and the like. Various programs, such as OS (operating system), application software which is capable of creating data for printing, a printer driver for controlling the printer <b>30</b>, are stored in the hard disk drive <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The printer <b>30</b> is provided with a main body <b>30</b>A and an optional unit <b>60</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> etc., an example of a transport unit) which is installable to the main body <b>30</b>A. The main body <b>30</b>A is provided with a CPU <b>31</b> (an example of a print control section), a ROM <b>32</b>, a RAM <b>33</b>, a memory <b>34</b> including a NVRAM, a flash ROM, etc., an operation section <b>35</b>, a display section <b>36</b>, a printing section <b>37</b>, a transport mechanism <b>38</b>, a network interface (network I/F) <b>41</b>, sheet detecting sections <b>40</b>, etc. The ROM <b>32</b> stores a program for a printing process as will be described later and various programs for controlling an operation of the printer <b>30</b>. The CPU <b>31</b> controls the operation of the printer <b>30</b> while storing, in the RAM <b>33</b>, a processing result in accordance with the program read from the ROM <b>32</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The operation section <b>35</b> is provided with a plurality of buttons through which a user is capable of performing various input operations, such as the instruction to start the printing. The display section <b>36</b> includes the liquid crystal display, a lamp, and the like. Various setting screens, various operation states, etc. can be displayed on the display section <b>36</b>. The printing section <b>37</b> performs the printing onto a sheet W including a paper sheet etc. The network interface <b>41</b> is connected to the external terminal <b>10</b> etc. via the communication line <b>20</b>, and thereby making it possible to perform a data communication between the terminal <b>10</b> and the printer <b>30</b>. The transport mechanism <b>38</b> and the sheet detecting sections <b>40</b> will be described later. The communication line <b>20</b> may be either wireless or wired.</div>
<heading>2. Internal Structure of Printer</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each encircled number denotes that an image corresponding to a page to which each number is assigned is formed on a surface of the sheet W on which each number is assigned. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the image corresponding to the second page is printed on the upper surface of a sheet W<b>1</b>, and the image corresponding to the fourth page is printed on the upper surface of a sheet W<b>2</b>. The main body <b>30</b>A includes the printing section <b>37</b>, the transport mechanism <b>38</b>, a main body cassette <b>39</b> (an example of a first sheet accommodating section), a fixing unit <b>43</b>, a paper discharge tray <b>45</b>, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The main body cassette <b>39</b> can accommodate a plurality of sheets W therein in a stacked state and is detachably provided below the printing section <b>37</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The transport mechanism <b>38</b> includes a pickup roller <b>46</b>, resist rollers <b>47</b>, a transport belt <b>48</b>, a reversing mechanism <b>49</b>, etc. The pickup roller <b>46</b> takes the sheets W accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b> one-by-one and transports the sheet W to the resist rollers <b>47</b>. The resist rollers <b>47</b> adjust a posture of the transported sheet W to send the sheet W onto the transport belt <b>48</b> at a predetermined timing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The printing section <b>37</b> forms a monochrome (black and white) image or a color image onto the sheet W transported by the transport belt <b>48</b> at a predetermined printing position X, based on a printing data received from, for example, the terminal <b>10</b>. The image formed on the sheet W is thermally fixed by the fixing unit <b>43</b>, and then the sheet W is discharged on the paper discharge tray <b>45</b>. A route (solid arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for guiding the sheet W from the main body cassette <b>39</b> to the printing portion X is referred to as a print transport path P<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The reversing mechanism <b>49</b> includes paper discharging rollers <b>50</b>, a reversing transport path P<b>2</b> (dotted-line arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an example of a re-transport route), a flapper <b>51</b>, a plurality of reversing transport rollers <b>52</b>, etc. The reversing transport path P<b>2</b> is configured to pass below the main body cassette <b>39</b>. For example, in a case that the double-sided printing is performed on the double-sided continuous system, the image is printed on the back surface of the sheet W by the printing section <b>37</b>, then, the sheet W is once transported to the paper discharging rollers <b>50</b>. The back surface referred herein corresponds to the lower surface of the sheet W when the sheet W is accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">When the paper discharging rollers <b>50</b> are reversely rotated, the sheet W is transported via the flapper <b>51</b>, the reversing transport path P<b>2</b>, the plurality of reversing transport rollers <b>52</b>, and the resist rollers <b>47</b> to be fed on the transport belt <b>48</b> in a state that the front surface and the back surface of the sheet W are turned over. Then, the sheet W is discharged on the paper discharge tray <b>45</b> after the image is printed on the front surface by the printing section <b>37</b>. The front surface referred herein is the upper surface of the sheet W when the sheet W is accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Further, an output path P<b>3</b> and an input path P<b>4</b> are formed in the reversing mechanism <b>49</b>. The output path P<b>3</b> is a path which branches from the reversing transport path P<b>2</b>. The output path P<b>3</b> guides the sheet W fed by inverse rotation of the paper discharging rollers <b>50</b> toward the optional unit <b>60</b>. A flapper <b>53</b> is provided at a branch point at which the output path P<b>3</b> branches from the reversing transport path <b>2</b>. The transport route of the sheet W is switched by the flapper <b>53</b>. The input path P<b>4</b> is merged with the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> so that the sheet W from a side of the optional unit <b>60</b> is fed into the main body <b>30</b>A.</div>
<heading>3. Option Detecting Section, Optional Unit, Option Install Section</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, an option install section <b>54</b> (an example of an install section) is provided at a lower portion of the main body <b>30</b>A. The optional unit <b>60</b> can be added to the option install section <b>54</b>. Further, the main body <b>30</b>A is provided with an option detecting section <b>55</b>. The option detecting section <b>55</b> has an unillustrated optical sensor or magnetic sensor. The option detecting section <b>55</b> detects whether or not the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the option install section <b>54</b>. Further, when the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the option install section <b>54</b>, the option detecting section <b>55</b> detects the type of the optional unit <b>60</b>. Then, the option detecting section <b>55</b> sends the detecting results to the CPU <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the optional unit <b>60</b> includes two types of optional units (a first optional unit <b>60</b>A and a second optional unit <b>60</b>B). The first optional unit <b>60</b>A and the second optional unit <b>60</b>B include optional cassettes <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B (an example of a second sheet accommodating section), reversing transport paths P<b>5</b>A, P<b>5</b>B (an example of a transport route of the transport unit), and pickup rollers <b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The optional cassette <b>61</b>A (<b>61</b>B) is capable of accommodating equal-sized sheets W therein in the stacked state. Here, the accommodatable number of sheets W of the optional cassette <b>61</b>B is larger than that of the optional cassette <b>61</b>A. Therefore, a height of the optional cassette <b>61</b>B is greater than that of the optional cassette <b>61</b>A. The reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A (P<b>5</b>B) is communicated with the output path P<b>3</b> and the input path P<b>4</b> disposed on the side of the main body <b>30</b>A in a state that the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the option install section <b>54</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Further, the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A (P<b>5</b>B) is formed to surround below the optional cassette <b>61</b>A (<b>61</b>B). As described above, since the height of the optional cassette <b>61</b>B is greater than that of the optional cassette <b>61</b>A, a length of the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>B is longer than that of the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A. In the present description, the length of each of the transport paths including the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>B etc. denotes a length in the transport direction.</div>
<heading>4. Printing Process</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">For example, when a printing data, in which the double-sided printing is instructed, is received from the terminal <b>10</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> executes the printing process. In this situation, the CPU <b>31</b> functions as the print control section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">At first, the CPU <b>31</b> judges, based on the detecting result from the option detecting section <b>55</b>, whether or not the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the option install section <b>54</b> (S<b>1</b>: an example of an installation judgment process). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the optional unit <b>60</b> is not installed to the option install section <b>54</b> (<b>51</b>: NO), the CPU <b>31</b> controls the printing section <b>37</b> and the transport mechanism <b>38</b> so that the double-sided printing process of a 21-mode, in which the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is one sheet, is executed (S<b>2</b>). In other words, the CPU <b>31</b> controls the printing section <b>37</b> and the transport mechanism <b>38</b> so that the double-sided printing process of the 21-mode, in which the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time at least in the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> of the print transport path P<b>1</b> and the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> is one sheet, is executed. In the present description, a transport system in which the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is n sheet(s) is referred to as a transport system of n sheet(s). The sheet W referred herein is preferably a sheet W, on which the image is formed on one surface thereof by passing through the printing position X but the image is not yet formed on the other surface thereof Further, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> is the only re-transport route for guiding said sheet W to the printing position X again.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Next, the 21-mode will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. On the 21-mode, the printing on one surface and the printing on the other surface are continuously performed per one sheet W from the start of the printing until the end of the printing. For example, when the images corresponding to six pages are printed by the double-sided printing onto three sheets W, the printer <b>30</b> performs the printing in the following order:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Image corresponding to the second page (the back surface of the first sheet W<b>1</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Image corresponding to the first page (the front surface of the first sheet W<b>1</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Image corresponding to the fourth page (the back surface of the second sheet W<b>2</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Image corresponding to the third page (the front surface of the second sheet W<b>2</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Image corresponding to the sixth page (the back surface of the third sheet W<b>3</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Image corresponding to the fifth page (the front surface of the third sheet W<b>3</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">On the 21-mode, the printer <b>30</b> does not perform the printing on another sheet W during a time after the printing on the back surface of one sheet W is performed and before the printing on the front surface of said one sheet W is performed. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the printing on each sheet W subsequent to the first sheet W<b>1</b> is never performed during the time after the image corresponding to the second page is printed on the back surface of the first sheet W<b>1</b> and before the image corresponding to the first page is printed on the front surface of said first sheet W<b>1</b>. Therefore, the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is one sheet. When the double-sided printing process of the 21-mode is completed, the CPU <b>31</b> ends the printing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">When the CPU <b>31</b> judges that the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the option install section <b>54</b> (S<b>1</b>: YES), the CPU <b>31</b> judges, based on the detecting result, whether the optional unit <b>60</b> is the first optional unit <b>60</b>A, in other words, whether the optional unit <b>60</b> is an optional unit having a short reversing transport path (S<b>3</b>). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the optional unit <b>60</b> installed is the first optional unit <b>60</b>A (S<b>3</b>: YES), the CPU <b>31</b> controls the printing section <b>37</b> and the transport mechanism <b>38</b> so that the double-sided printing process is executed on a transport system in which the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is two or more sheets (S<b>4</b>). In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in addition to the reversing transport path P<b>2</b>, the transport route passing through the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A is the re-transport route. The reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A has the length longer than that of the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> in a transport direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The transport system in which the maximum number of sheets is two or more sheets includes, for example, as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">2413-mode: A system in which the printing is performed on the back surfaces of the first and second sheets respectively, and then the printing is performed on the front surfaces of the first and second sheets respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0012">246135-mode: A system in which the printing is performed on the back surfaces of the first, second, and third sheets respectively, and then the printing is performed on the front surfaces of the first, second, and third sheets respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Next, the 2413-mode will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The 2413-mode includes a step in which the printing on the back surface of the second sheet W<b>2</b> is performed during the time after the printing on the back surface of the first sheet W<b>1</b> is performed and before the printing on the front surface of said first sheet W<b>1</b> is performed. For example, when the images corresponding to eight pages are printed by the double-sided printing onto four sheets W<b>1</b> to W<b>4</b>, the printer <b>30</b> performs the printing in the following order:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Image corresponding to the second page (the back surface of the first sheet W<b>1</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Image corresponding to the fourth page (the back surface of the second sheet W<b>2</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Image corresponding to the first page (the front surface of the first sheet W<b>1</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Image corresponding to the third page (the front surface of the second sheet W<b>2</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Image corresponding to the sixth page (the back surface of the third sheet W<b>3</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">Image corresponding to the eighth page (the back surface of the fourth sheet W<b>4</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">Image corresponding to the fifth page (the front surface of the third sheet W<b>3</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Image corresponding to the seventh page (the front surface of the fourth sheet W<b>4</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">On the 2413-mode, for example as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in a case that the first sheet W<b>1</b> (the image corresponding to the second page has been printed thereon) is present in the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A, the second sheet W<b>2</b> is present in the print transport path P<b>1</b>. Thus, the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is two sheets. Accordingly, the throughput of the double-sided printing can be improved as compared with the case shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the double-sided printing process of the 2413-mode is completed, the CPU <b>31</b> ends the printing process. Further, the double-sided printing process in which the maximum number of sheets is two sheets may be performed on not only the sheets W supplied from the optional cassette <b>61</b>A but also the sheets W supplied from the main body cassette <b>39</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the second optional unit <b>60</b>B is installed to the option install section <b>54</b> (S<b>3</b>: NO), the CPU <b>31</b> controls the printing section <b>37</b> and the transport mechanism <b>38</b> so that the double-sided printing process is executed on a transport system of three sheets (S<b>5</b>). In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in addition to the reversing transport path P<b>2</b>, the transport route passing through the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>B is the re-transport route. The reversing transport path P<b>5</b>B has the length longer than that of the reversing transport path P<b>2</b>. Further, since the reversing transport route path P<b>5</b>B is longer than the reversing transport route P<b>5</b>A as described above, it is possible, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to execute a double-sided printing process (of a system) in which the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is large as compared with the case shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">As an example of the transport system of three sheets, the above 246135-mode can be cited. As described above, the 246135-mode includes a step in which the printing on the back surfaces of the second and third sheets W<b>2</b>, W<b>3</b> is performed during the time after the printing on the back surface of the first sheet W<b>1</b> is performed and before the printing on the front surface of said first sheet W<b>1</b> is performed. For example, when the images corresponding to six pages are printed by the double-sided printing onto three sheets W<b>1</b> to W<b>3</b>, the printer <b>30</b> performs the printing in the following order:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Image corresponding to the second page (the back surface of the first sheet W<b>1</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Image corresponding to the fourth page (the back surface of the second sheet W<b>2</b>)</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Image corresponding to the first page (the front surface of the first sheet W<b>1</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Image corresponding to the third page (the front surface of the second sheet W<b>2</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">Image corresponding to the fifth page (the front surface of the third sheet W<b>3</b>)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">On the 246135-mode, for example as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a case that the first sheet W<b>1</b> (the image corresponding to the second page has been printed thereon) and the second sheet W<b>2</b> (the image corresponding to the fourth page has been printed thereon) are present in the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>B, the third sheet W<b>3</b> is present in the print transport path P<b>1</b>. Therefore, the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is three sheets. Accordingly, in the case shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the throughput of the double-sided printing can be improved as compared with the cases shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the double-sided printing process of the 246135-mode is completed, the CPU <b>31</b> ends the printing process. Further, the double-sided printing process of the transport system of three sheets may be performed on not only the sheets W supplied from the optional cassette <b>61</b>A but also the sheets W supplied from the main body cassette <b>39</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Further, since the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> is provided in the main body <b>30</b>A, even when the optional unit <b>60</b> is not installed to the option install section <b>54</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is possible to perform the double-sided printing of a transport system of two sheets. Therefore, it is preferable that the double-sided printing of the transport system of three sheets is performed in the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and that the double-sided printing of a transport system of four sheets is performed in the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<heading>5. Effect of the Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">According to the embodiment, as shown <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, when the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the option install section <b>54</b>, a double-sided printing process, in which the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is large as compared with the case shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in which the optional unit <b>60</b> is not installed, is executed (an example of a print control process). When the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the printer <b>30</b> according to the embodiment, in addition to the reversing transport path (for example, the reversing transport path P<b>2</b>) formed in the printer <b>30</b>, it is possible to use the reversing transport path (for example, reversing transport path P<b>5</b> etc.) passing through the optional unit <b>60</b>. Here, the reversing transport path passing through the optional unit <b>60</b> is longer than the reversing transport path formed in the printer <b>30</b>. Therefore, it is possible to stay a larger number of sheets in the reversing transport path passing through the optional unit <b>60</b> as compared with the reversing transport path formed in the printer <b>30</b>. In view of this, in the printer <b>30</b> according to this embodiment, when the reversing transport path passing through the optional unit <b>60</b> is usable, a double-sided printing process, in which the larger number of sheets are stayed in the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b> as compared with the number of sheets stayed in the reversing transport path formed in the printer <b>30</b>, is selected and executed. Accordingly, (when the double-sided printing process, in which the larger number of sheets are stayed in the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b> as compared with the number of sheets stayed in the reversing transport path formed in the printer <b>30</b>, is performed), it is possible to reduce a waiting time for reversing the sheet causing after the printing on the first sheet is started and before the last sheet is discharged, thereby making it possible to increase the number of sheets printed per unit time of the double-sided printing (making it possible to improve the throughput).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">According to this embodiment, as the entire length of the transport route of the installed optional unit <b>60</b> is longer, the double-sided printing process in which the maximum number of sheets is larger is executed. Thus, it is possible to improve the throughput of the double-sided printing depending on the entire length of the transport route.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Further, the optional unit <b>60</b> has the optional cassettes <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B which have different maximum numbers of sheets accommodatable therein from each other. Thus, it is possible to increase the number of sheets W usable for the printing by installing such a optional unit <b>60</b> to the option install section <b>54</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">According to this embodiment, by transporting the sheets W accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b> via the reversing transport paths P<b>5</b>A, P<b>5</b>B, the double-sided printing process, in which the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is large as compared with the case in which the optional unit <b>60</b> is not installed to the option install section <b>54</b>, is executed. Therefore, it is possible to improve the throughput not only when the double-sided printing is performed on the sheets W accommodated in the optional cassettes <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B but also when the double-sided printing is performed on the sheets W accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b>.</div>
<heading>Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">Although the content of the printing process and a transportable width of the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b> are different between the first and second embodiments, all other respects are the same between the first and the second embodiments. Thus, constitutive parts or components, which are the same as or equivalent to those of the first embodiment, are designated by the same reference numerals, any explanation of which will be omitted as appropriate. Only those different from the first embodiment will be explained below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the printing data, in which the double-sided printing is instructed, is received from, for example, the terminal <b>10</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> executes the printing process. In this situation, the CPU <b>31</b> functions as the print control section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">At first, the CPU <b>31</b> judges whether the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the option install section <b>54</b> based on the detecting result from the option detecting section <b>55</b> (S<b>11</b>). When the optional unit <b>60</b> is not installed to the option install section <b>54</b> (S<b>11</b>: NO), the CPU <b>31</b> executes the double-sided printing process of the 21-mode as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (S<b>15</b>). Then, the printing process is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">When the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the option install section <b>54</b> (S<b>11</b>: YES), the CPU <b>31</b> judges whether any one of the optional cassettes <b>61</b>A and <b>61</b>B is selected in setting information included in the printing data (S <b>12</b>). When any one of the optional cassettes <b>61</b>A and <b>61</b>B is selected (S<b>12</b>: YES), the double-sided printing process is executed on the sheet W fed from the selected optional cassette <b>61</b>A or <b>61</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">In particular, by utilizing the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b>, the double-sided printing process, in which the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is large as compared with the case in which the optional unit <b>60</b> is not installed, is executed (S<b>13</b>), and the printing process is completed. In general, a sheet width accommodatable in the optional cassette corresponds to a transport width of the reversing transport path in the same optional unit <b>60</b>. Thus, when the optional cassette is selected, it is possible to use the reversing transport path of the optional unit in which the optional cassette is arranged. It is noted that the sheet width and the transport width are width dimensions in a direction perpendicular to the transport direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">When the main body cassette <b>39</b> is selected (S<b>12</b>: NO), the CPU <b>31</b> judges whether the sheet width of the sheet W accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b> is greater than the transport width of the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b> (S<b>14</b>). The CPU <b>31</b> grasps the sheet width and the transport width based on, for example, the detecting results from the option detecting section <b>55</b> or set contents inputted and set by the user through the operation section <b>35</b> or the operation section <b>15</b> (in particular, the size of the printing paper and the like).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">When the sheet width is not more than the transport width (S<b>14</b>: NO), it is possible to transport the sheet W from the main body cassette <b>39</b> by the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b>. Thus, the double-sided printing process, in which the maximum number of sheets W present at the same time in the transport mechanism <b>38</b> is large as compared with the case in which the optional unit <b>60</b> is not installed, is executed (S<b>13</b>), and the printing process is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">More specifically, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the sheet W having a letter size is accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b> and the sheet W having the same letter size as that accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b> is accommodated in the optional cassette <b>60</b>A. Corresponding to this, the transport width of the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A is also substantially equal to a length of the short side of the sheet W having the letter size. Thus, it is possible to transport the sheet W having the letter size fed from the main body cassette <b>39</b> to not only the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> in the main body cassette <b>39</b> but also to the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A in the optional unit <b>60</b>A. Then, the CPU <b>31</b> controls the printing section <b>37</b> and the transport mechanism <b>38</b> so that the sheet W having the letter size fed from the main body cassette <b>39</b> is transported by the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A to execute the double-sided printing process of the transport system of two sheets (S<b>13</b>). Accordingly, it is possible to improve the throughput of the double-sided printing as compared with the case in which the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> is used (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">On the other hand, when the sheet width is greater than the transport width of the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b> (S<b>14</b>: YES), the sheet W fed from the main body cassette <b>39</b> can not be transported by the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b>. Only the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> in the main body cassette <b>39</b> can transport the sheet W fed from the main body cassette <b>39</b>. Therefore, the double-sided printing process, which is the same as that of the case in which the optional unit <b>60</b> is not installed, is executed (S<b>15</b>), and the printing process is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">More specifically, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, while the sheet W having the letter size is accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b>, the sheet W having a A4 size, which has the sheet width smaller than that of the letter size, is accommodated in the optional unit <b>60</b>. Corresponding to this, the transport width of the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A is set substantially equal to the length of the short side (sheet width) of the sheet W having the A4 size. Therefore, it is not possible to transport the sheet W having the letter size fed from the main body cassette <b>39</b> by the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A, and only the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> can be used to transport the sheet W having the letter size.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Thus, the CPU controls the printing section <b>37</b> and the transport mechanism <b>38</b> so that the sheet W having the letter size fed from the main body cassette <b>39</b> is transported by the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> to execute a double-sided printing process in which the maximum number of sheets W is equivalent to or less than that of the case in which optional unit <b>60</b> is not installed (S<b>15</b>). By doing so, it is possible to suppress the erroneous situation such that when the sheet width is greater than the transport width, the sheet W fed from the main body cassette <b>39</b> is transported to the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b> to cause a transport error.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">According to this embodiment, when the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the option install section <b>54</b> and when the sheet width of the sheet W accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b> is smaller than the lateral width of the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b>, the sheet W is transported via the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b>. In this case, a double-sided printing process, in which the maximum number of sheets is large as compared with the case in which the sheet width is greater than the lateral width of the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b>, is executed. Accordingly, it is possible to improve the throughput of the double-sided printing on the sheet W accommodated in the main body cassette <b>39</b> within a transportable range in which the sheet width is considered.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">The present teaching is not limited to the embodiments explained through the above descriptions and drawings but, for example, the following various embodiments are also included in the technical scope of the present teaching. Nevertheless, these various embodiments are just exemplified to specify the technical scope of the present teaching, and the present teaching is not limited to these embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">In the above embodiments, the main body <b>30</b>A is configured so that the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> passes below the main body cassette <b>39</b>. However, the main body <b>30</b>A may be configured so that the reversing transport path P<b>2</b> passes above the main body cassette <b>39</b>. Further, the optional unit <b>60</b> may also be configured so that the reversing transport path P<b>5</b>A (P<b>5</b>B) passes above the optional cassette <b>61</b>A (<b>61</b>B).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">In the above embodiments, presence or absence of the installation of the optional unit <b>60</b> and the type of the optional unit <b>60</b> are judged based on the detecting results from the option detecting section <b>55</b>. However, for example, the following configuration is allowable. That is, the user inputs and sets, through the operation section <b>35</b> or the operation section <b>15</b>, whether the optional unit <b>60</b> is installed to the option install section <b>54</b>, and then judgment is performed by the CPU <b>31</b> based on the setting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">In the above embodiments, as the length of the reversing transport path of the installed optional unit <b>60</b> is longer, the double-sided printing process having the larger maximum number of sheets is executed. However, there is a configuration in which a plurality of optional units <b>60</b> are connected in series and installed to the option install section <b>54</b>. In this configuration, it is allowable that, as the number of the optional units <b>60</b> connected in series is larger, the double-sided printing process having the larger maximum number of sheets is executed. In this case, the option detecting section <b>55</b> is preferably configured to detect the number of the optional units <b>60</b> connected in series.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">In the embodiments described above, the main body <b>30</b>A is configured to include the main body cassette <b>39</b> and reversing transport path P<b>2</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">In the above embodiments, the optional unit <b>60</b> is configured to have the optional cassettes <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B. However, it is allowable that the optional unit <b>60</b> does not have the optional cassettes <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B. In other words, it is allowable to adopt any transport unit having a transport route for lengthening the re-transport route. Further, it is also allowable to adopt a transport unit which is installed on the side of the side surface or the upper side of the main body <b>30</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a construction in which an optional unit <b>70</b> which does not have the sheet accommodating section is installed on the side of the side surface of a main body <b>30</b>B.

The option detecting section <b>55</b> detects the presence or absence of the installation of the optional unit <b>70</b> to the option install section <b>71</b>, the type of the optional unit <b>70</b>, etc. The reversing mechanism <b>49</b> includes an output path P<b>6</b>, an input path P<b>7</b>, and a flapper <b>72</b>. The optional unit <b>70</b> includes a reversing transport path P<b>8</b>. The reversing transport path P<b>8</b> is communicated with the output path P<b>6</b> and the input path P<b>7</b> in the main body <b>30</b>B in a state that the optional unit <b>70</b> is installed to the option install section <b>71</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">In the above embodiments, when the plurality of optional units <b>60</b> are connected and installed, the CPU <b>31</b> may perform the following process. That is, the sheet W accommodated in the optional cassette of the optional unit <b>60</b> disposed at an upper stage is transported by the reversing transport path of the optional unit <b>60</b> disposed at a stage lower than said upper stage. Then, a double-sided printing process, in which the maximum number of sheets is large as compared with the case in which the optional unit <b>60</b> at the lower stage is not installed, is executed. Therefore, it is possible to improve the throughput not only when the double-sided printing is performed on the sheet W accommodated in the optional cassette of the optional unit <b>60</b> at the lower stage, but also when the double-sided printing is performed on the sheet W accommodated in the optional cassette of the optional unit <b>60</b> at the upper stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">Further, the CPU <b>31</b> may perform the following process.

Then, the double-sided printing process, in which the maximum number of sheets is large as compared with the case in which the sheet width is not less than the lateral width of the reversing transport path, is executed. Accordingly, it is possible to improve the throughput of the double-sided printing on the sheet W accommodated in the optional cassette of the optional unit <b>60</b> at the upper stage, within the range in which the sheet width is considered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">In the above embodiments, when the plurality of modes are executable, the user may instruct and determine whether or not the double-sided printing process having the larger maximum number of sheets is executed.
