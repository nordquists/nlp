<heading>PRIORITY TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">This application is entitled to the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/635,470 filed on Apr. 19, 2012, and U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/486,809 filed on May 17, 2011.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to the use of novel compounds which inhibit Btk and are useful for the treatment of auto-immune and inflammatory diseases caused by aberrant B-cell activation.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Protein kinases constitute one of the largest families of human enzymes and regulate many different signaling processes by adding phosphate groups to proteins (T. Hunter, <i>Cell </i>1987 50:823-829). Specifically, tyrosine kinases phosphorylate proteins on the phenolic moiety of tyrosine residues. The tyrosine kinase family includes members that control cell growth, migration, and differentiation. Abnormal kinase activity has been implicated in a variety of human diseases including cancers, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Since protein kinases are among the key regulators of cell signaling they provide a target to modulate cellular function with small molecular kinase inhibitors and thus make good drug design targets. In addition to treatment of kinase-mediated disease processes, selective and efficacious inhibitors of kinase activity are also useful for investigation of cell signaling processes and identification of other cellular targets of therapeutic interest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">There is good evidence that B-cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and/or inflammatory disease. Protein-based therapeutics that deplete B cells such as Rituxan are effective against autoantibody-driven inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Rastetter et al. <i>Annu Rev Med </i>2004 55:477). Therefore inhibitors of the protein kinases that play a role in B-cell activation should be useful therapeutics for B-cell mediated disease pathology such as autoantibody production.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Signaling through the B-cell receptor (BCR) controls a range of B-cell responses including proliferation and differentiation into mature antibody producing cells. The BCR is a key regulatory point for B-cell activity and aberrant signaling can cause deregulated B-cell proliferation and formation of pathogenic autoantibodies that lead to multiple autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (Btk) is a non-BCR associated kinase that is membrane proximal and immediately downstream from BCR. Lack of Btk has been shown to block BCR signaling and therefore inhibition of Btk could be a useful therapeutic approach to block B-cell mediated disease processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Btk is a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases, and has been shown to be a critical regulator of early B-cell development and mature B-cell activation and survival (Khan et al. <i>Immunity </i>1995 3:283; Ellmeier et al. <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>2000 192:1611). Mutation of Btk in humans leads to the condition X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) (reviewed in Rosen et al. <i>New Eng. J. Med. </i>1995 333:431 and Lindvall et al. Immunol. Rev. 2005 203:200). These patients are immunocompromised and show impaired maturation of B-cells, decreased immunoglobulin and peripheral B-cell levels, diminished T-cell independent immune responses as well as attenuated calcium mobilization following BCR stimulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Evidence for a role for Btk in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases has also been provided by Btk-deficient mouse models. In preclinical murine models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Btk-deficient mice show marked amelioration of disease progression. In addition, Btk-deficient mice are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis (Jansson and Holmdahl <i>Clin. Exp. Immunol. </i>1993 94:459). A selective Btk inhibitor has been demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in a mouse arthritis model (Z. Pan et al., <i>Chem. Med Chem. </i>2007 2:58-61).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Btk is also expressed by cells other than B-cells that may be involved in disease processes. For example, Btk is expressed by mast cells and Btk-deficient bone marrow derived mast cells demonstrate impaired antigen induced degranulation (Iwaki et al. <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>2005 280:40261). This shows Btk could be useful to treat pathological mast cells responses such as allergy and asthma. Also monocytes from XLA patients, in which Btk activity is absent, show decreased TNF alpha production following stimulation (Horwood et al. <i>J Exp Med </i>197:1603, 2003). Therefore TNF alpha mediated inflammation could be modulated by small molecular Btk inhibitors. Also, Btk has been reported to play a role in apoptosis (Islam and Smith <i>Immunol. Rev. </i>2000 178:49,) and thus Btk inhibitors would be useful for the treatment of certain B-cell lymphomas and leukemias (Feldhahn et al. <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>2005 201:1837,).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The phrase “a” or “an” entity as used herein refers to one or more of that entity; for example, a compound refers to one or more compounds or at least one compound. As such, the terms “a” (or “an”), “one or more”, and “at least one” can be used interchangeably herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The phrase “as defined herein above” refers to the broadest definition for each group as provided in the Summary of the Invention or the broadest claim. In all other embodiments provided below, substituents which can be present in each embodiment and which are not explicitly defined retain the broadest definition provided in the Summary of the Invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">As used in this specification, whether in a transitional phrase or in the body of the claim, the terms “comprise(s)” and “comprising” are to be interpreted as having an open-ended meaning. That is, the terms are to be interpreted synonymously with the phrases “having at least” or “including at least”. When used in the context of a process, the term “comprising” means that the process includes at least the recited steps, but may include additional steps. When used in the context of a compound or composition, the term “comprising” means that the compound or composition includes at least the recited features or components, but may also include additional features or components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">As used herein, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the word “or” is used in the “inclusive” sense of “and/or” and not the “exclusive” sense of “either/or”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The term “independently” is used herein to indicate that a variable is applied in any one instance without regard to the presence or absence of a variable having that same or a different definition within the same compound. Thus, in a compound in which R″ appears twice and is defined as “independently carbon or nitrogen”, both R″s can be carbon, both R″s can be nitrogen, or one R″ can be carbon and the other nitrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">When any variable occurs more than one time in any moiety or formula depicting and describing compounds employed or claimed in the present invention, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such compounds result in stable compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The symbols “*” at the end of a bond or “<div class="patent-image"><a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a1/0a/92/381ac9cde72dfa/US08729078-20140520-P00002.png"><img alt="Figure US08729078-20140520-P00002" class="patent-full-image" file="US08729078-20140520-P00002.TIF" he="1.44mm" height="6" id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" img-content="character" img-format="tif" inline="no" orientation="portrait" src="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a1/0a/92/381ac9cde72dfa/US08729078-20140520-P00002.png" wi="8.47mm" width="34"/></a></div>” drawn through a bond each refer to the point of attachment of a functional group or other chemical moiety to the rest of the molecule of which it is a part.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">A bond drawn into ring system (as opposed to connected at a distinct vertex) indicates that the bond may be attached to any of the suitable ring atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The term “optional” or “optionally” as used herein means that a subsequently described event or circumstance may, but need not, occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, “optionally substituted” means that the optionally substituted moiety may incorporate a hydrogen atom or a substituent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The phrase “optional bond” means that the bond may or may not be present, and that the description includes single, double, or triple bonds. If a substituent is designated to be a “bond” or “absent”, the atoms linked to the substituents are then directly connected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The term “about” is used herein to mean approximately, in the region of, roughly, or around. When the term “about” is used in conjunction with a numerical range, it modifies that range by extending the boundaries above and below the numerical values set forth. In general, the term “about” is used herein to modify a numerical value above and below the stated value by a variance of 20%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Certain compounds of Formulae I may exhibit tautomerism. Tautomeric compounds can exist as two or more interconvertable species. Prototropic tautomers result from the migration of a covalently bonded hydrogen atom between two atoms. Tautomers generally exist in equilibrium and attempts to isolate an individual tautomers usually produce a mixture whose chemical and physical properties are consistent with a mixture of compounds. The position of the equilibrium is dependent on chemical features within the molecule. For example, in many aliphatic aldehydes and ketones, such as acetaldehyde, the keto form predominates while; in phenols, the enol form predominates. Common prototropic tautomers include keto/enol (—C(═O)—CH—⇄—C(—OH)═CH—), amide/imidic acid (—C(═O)—NH—⇄—C(—OH)═N—) and amidine (—C(═NR)—NH—⇄—C(—NHR)═N—) tautomers. The latter two are particularly common in heteroaryl and heterocyclic rings and the present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms of the compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Technical and scientific terms used herein have the meaning commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which the present invention pertains, unless otherwise defined. Reference is made herein to various methodologies and materials known to those of skill in the art. Standard reference works setting forth the general principles of pharmacology include Goodman and Gilman's <i>The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, </i>10<sup>th </sup>Ed., McGraw Hill Companies Inc., New York (2001). Any suitable materials and/or methods known to those of skill can be utilized in carrying out the present invention. However, preferred materials and methods are described. Materials, reagents and the like to which reference are made in the following description and examples are obtainable from commercial sources, unless otherwise noted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The definitions described herein may be appended to form chemically-relevant combinations, such as “heteroalkylaryl,” “haloalkylheteroaryl,” “arylalkylheterocyclyl,” “alkylcarbonyl,” “alkoxyalkyl,” and the like. When the term “alkyl” is used as a suffix following another term, as in “phenylalkyl,” or “hydroxyalkyl,” this is intended to refer to an alkyl group, as defined above, being substituted with one to two substituents selected from the other specifically-named group. Thus, for example, “phenylalkyl” refers to an alkyl group having one to two phenyl substituents, and thus includes benzyl, phenylethyl, and biphenyl. An “alkylaminoalkyl” is an alkyl group having one to two alkylamino substituents. “Hydroxyalkyl” includes 2-hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, 1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpropyl, 2-hydroxybutyl, 2,3-dihydroxybutyl, 2-(hydroxymethyl), 3-hydroxypropyl, and so forth. Accordingly, as used herein, the term “hydroxyalkyl” is used to define a subset of heteroalkyl groups defined below. The term -(ar)alkyl refers to either an unsubstituted alkyl or an aralkyl group. The term (hetero)aryl or (het)aryl refers to either an aryl or a heteroaryl group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The term “spirocycloalkyl”, as used herein, means a spirocyclic cycloalkyl group, such as, for example, spiro[3.3]heptane. The term spiroheterocycloalkyl, as used herein, means a spirocyclic heterocycloalkyl, such as, for example, 2,6-diaza spiro[3.3]heptane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The term “acyl” as used herein denotes a group of formula —C(═O)R wherein R is hydrogen or lower alkyl as defined herein. The term or “alkylcarbonyl” as used herein denotes a group of formula C(═O)R wherein R is alkyl as defined herein. The term C<sub>1-6 </sub>acyl refers to a group —C(═O)R contain 6 carbon atoms. The term “arylcarbonyl” as used herein means a group of formula C(═O)R wherein R is an aryl group; the term “benzoyl” as used herein an “arylcarbonyl” group wherein R is phenyl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The term “ester” as used herein denotes a group of formula —C(═O)OR wherein R is lower alkyl as defined herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The term “alkyl” as used herein denotes an unbranched or branched chain, saturated, monovalent hydrocarbon residue containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms. The term “lower alkyl” denotes a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon residue containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms. “C<sub>1-10 </sub>alkyl” as used herein refers to an alkyl composed of 1 to 10 carbons. Examples of alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, lower alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl or pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, and octyl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">When the term “alkyl” is used as a suffix following another term, as in “phenylalkyl,” or “hydroxyalkyl,” this is intended to refer to an alkyl group, as defined above, being substituted with one to two substituents selected from the other specifically-named group. Thus, for example, “phenylalkyl” denotes the radical R′R″—, wherein R′ is a phenyl radical, and R″ is an alkylene radical as defined herein with the understanding that the attachment point of the phenylalkyl moiety will be on the alkylene radical. Examples of arylalkyl radicals include, but are not limited to, benzyl, phenylethyl, 3-phenylpropyl. The terms “arylalkyl” or “aralkyl” are interpreted similarly except R′ is an aryl radical. The terms “(het)arylalkyl” or “(het)aralkyl” are interpreted similarly except R′ is optionally an aryl or a heteroaryl radical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The terms “haloalkyl” or “halo-lower alkyl” or “lower haloalkyl” refers to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon residue containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms wherein one or more carbon atoms are substituted with one or more halogen atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The term “alkylene” or “alkylenyl” as used herein denotes a divalent saturated linear hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 10 carbon atoms (e.g., (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>) or a branched saturated divalent hydrocarbon radical of 2 to 10 carbon atoms (e.g., —CHMe- or —CH<sub>2</sub>CH(i-Pr)CH<sub>2</sub>—), unless otherwise indicated.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0161">The modification of the present compounds to render them more soluble in water or other vehicle, for example, may be easily accomplished by minor modifications (salt formulation, esterification, etc.), which are well within the ordinary skill in the art. It is also well within the ordinary skill of the art to modify the route of administration and dosage regimen of a particular compound in order to manage the pharmacokinetics of the present compounds for maximum beneficial effect in patients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">The term “therapeutically effective amount” as used herein means an amount required to reduce symptoms of the disease in an individual. The dose will be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. That dosage can vary within wide limits depending upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and general health condition of the patient, other medicaments with which the patient is being treated, the route and form of administration and the preferences and experience of the medical practitioner involved. For oral administration, a daily dosage of between about 0.01 and about 1000 mg/kg body weight per day should be appropriate in monotherapy and/or in combination therapy. A preferred daily dosage is between about 0.1 and about 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferred 0.1 and about 100 mg/kg body weight and most preferred 1.0 and about 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be about 7 mg to 0.7 g per day. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dosage or in divided dosages, typically between 1 and 5 dosages per day. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect for the individual patient is reached. One of ordinary skill in treating diseases described herein will be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance on personal knowledge, experience and the disclosures of this application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the present invention for a given disease and patient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0165">The compounds of generic Formula I inhibit Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). Activation of Btk by upstream kinases results in activation of phospholipase-Cγ which, in turn, stimulates release of pro-inflammatory mediators. The compounds of generic Formula I, incorporating 1-oxo-1H-phthalazin-2-yl side chains exhibit unexpectedly enhanced inhibitory activity compared to analogues with other side chains. Notably, fluorine substitution on the unsaturated side chains produces an unexpected approximately 5-10-fold increase in potency in human whole blood. The hydroxymethyl substitution on the phenyl ring further provides unexpectedly increased potency and compared to analogues with alternative substitution at that position. Compounds of Formula I are useful in the treatment of arthritis and other anti-inflammatory and auto-immune diseases. Compounds according to Formula I are, accordingly, useful for the treatment of arthritis. Compounds of Formula I are useful for inhibiting Btk in cells and for modulating B-cell development. The present invention further comprises pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of Formula I admixed with pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipients or diluents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0166">The primary carboxamide derivatives described herein are kinase inhibitors, in particular Btk inhibitors. These inhibitors can be useful for treating one or more diseases responsive to kinase inhibition, including diseases responsive to Btk inhibition and/or inhibition of B-cell proliferation, in mammals. Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the interaction of the compounds of the invention with Btk results in the inhibition of Btk activity and thus in the pharmaceutical utility of these compounds. Accordingly, the invention includes a method of treating a mammal, for instance a human, having a disease responsive to inhibition of Btk activity, and/or inhibiting B-cell proliferation, comprising administrating to the mammal having such a disease, an effective amount of at least one chemical entity provided herein. An effective concentration may be ascertained experimentally, for example by assaying blood concentration of the compound, or theoretically, by calculating bioavailability. Other kinases that may be affected in addition to Btk include, but are not limited to, other tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0167">Kinases play notable roles in signaling pathways controlling fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and death (apoptosis). Abnormal kinase activity has been implicated in a wide range of diseases, including multiple cancers, autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases, and acute inflammatory reactions. The multifaceted role of kinases in key cell signaling pathways provides a significant opportunity to identify novel drugs targeting kinases and signaling pathways.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">The anti-inflammatory agent may also be a corticosteroid. For example, the corticosteroid may be cortisone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisolone sodium phosphate, or prednisone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0174">In additional embodiments the anti-inflammatory agent is a gold compound such as gold sodium thiomalate or auranofin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">The invention also includes embodiments in which the anti-inflammatory agent is a metabolic inhibitor such as a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, such as methotrexate or a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor, such as leflunomide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">Other embodiments of the invention pertain to combinations in which at least one anti-inflammatory compound is an anti-05 monoclonal antibody (such as eculizumab or pexelizumab), a TNF antagonist, such as entanercept, or infliximab, which is an anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0178">B-cells and B-cell precursors expressing BTK have been implicated in the pathology of B-cell malignancies, including, but not limited to, B-cell lymphoma, lymphoma (including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), hairy cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic and acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic and acute lymphocytic leukemia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0179">BTK has been shown to be an inhibitor of the Fas/APO-1 (CD-95) death inducing signaling complex (DISC) in B-lineage lymphoid cells. The fate of leukemia/lymphoma cells may reside in the balance between the opposing proapoptotic effects of caspases activated by DISC and an upstream anti-apoptotic regulatory mechanism involving BTK and/or its substrates (Vassilev et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>1998, 274, 1646-1656).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0180">It has also been discovered that BTK inhibitors are useful as chemosensitizing agents, and, thus, are useful in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, in particular, drugs that induce apoptosis. Examples of other chemotherapeutic drugs that can be used in combination with chemosensitizing BTK inhibitors include topoisomerase I inhibitors (camptothecin or topotecan), topoisomerase II inhibitors (e.g. daunomycin and etoposide), alkylating agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, melphalan and BCNU), tubulin directed agents (e.g. taxol and vinblastine), and biological agents (e.g. antibodies such as anti CD20 antibody, IDEC 8, immunotoxins, and cytokines).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">Btk activity has also been associated with some leukemias expressing the bcr-abl fusion gene resulting from translocation of parts of chromosome 9 and 22. This abnormality is commonly observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Btk is constitutively phosphorylated by the bcr-abl kinase which initiates downstream survival signals which circumvents apoptosis in bcr-abl cells. (N. Feldhahn et al. <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>2005 201(11):1837-1852).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0303">Step 1: Followed similar procedure as WO2005/5414 A2. Thus, 3-amino-4-cyanopyrazole (11 g, 102 mmol) was taken up in methylene iodide (150 ml, 1.87 mol) and the flask was cooled to −10° C. With efficient stirring isoamyl nitrite (92.4 ml, 688 mmol) was added via drop-wise addition over 40 minutes. After complete addition the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes. The addition flask was then removed and replaced with an efficient condenser and the material was heated (oil bath) at 100° C. for 2 hours. The flask was cooled to ambient and the solvent was removed (rotary evaporator and finally mechanical pump). The remainder was taken up in ethyl acetate (120 ml) and transferred to a separatory funnel. A 5% aqueous solution of sodium metabisulfite (120 ml) was added and the biphasic mixture was shaken. The organic phase was collected and shaken with a solution of 1 N hydrochloric acid (aqueous, 120 ml) followed by water (120 ml). The organic phase was collected and the aqueous phases were back extracted with ethyl acetate (2×100 ml). The organic extracts were combined, dried from magnesium sulfate, filtered and stripped. The crude product was adsorbed onto silica (about 25 g, from dichloromethane) and purified (dry loading) by Analogix flash column chromatography using ethyl acetate in hexanes (23% to 50% gradient, 80 g silica gel) to provide a light yellow powder (20 g). This material was further purified by crystallization from hot ethyl acetate/hexanes to provide 3-iodo-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitrile (11.3 g) as a light brown solid, which was collected by filtration (rinse well with 5% ethyl acetate/hexane).

Then a solution of 1 M lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in THF (264 ml, 264 mmol) was added via addition funnel over 5 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred under argon atmosphere at 75° C. over-night. The reaction mixture was poured into a saturated solution of aqueous ammonium chloride (400 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (350 ml). The organic phase was collected and washed with 50% diluted brine (350 ml). The organic phase was collected and the aqueous phases were back extracted with ethyl acetate (2×200 ml). The combined organics were dried from magnesium sulfate, filtered and stripped. The remainder was purified by Analogix flash column chromatography (80 g column), eluting with 0% to 12% methanol in dichloromethane to provide the desired 5-(2-azetidin-1-yl-1,1-dimethyl-ethoxy)-pyridin-2-ylamine (10.59 g) as a dark brown semi-viscous oil (as well as a less-pure fraction which could be re-purified under similar conditions to provide another 4.01 g of product).

Add tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (7 mg, 7.6 μmol) and degas again. The mixture was heated in a microwave reactor at 150° C. for 60 minutes. The solvent was stripped (rotary evaporator/pump) and the remainder was taken up in ethyl acetate (25 ml) and water (25 mL) and shaken in a reparatory funnel. The organic phase was collected and the aqueous phase was back extracted with ethyl acetate (2×20 ml). The organic phase was combined, dried from magnesium sulfate, filtered and stripped. The crude was purified by preparative thin layer chromatography (1 plate, eluting with 9.5% methanol in dichloromethane). The product band was collected, providing semi-pure desired product (21 mg, 91% pure). For greater purity the material was again loaded onto 1 preparative thin layer chromatography plate and eluted with 7% methanol in dichloromethane. Re-develop the plate with 7% and then 8.5% and finally 9% methanol in dichloromethane, at which point a more polar impurity was separated. The less polar product band was collected, providing the desired 1-[3-(6-tert-butyl-8-fluoro-1-oxo-1H-phthalazin-2-yl)-2-hydroxymethyl-phenyl]-3-(5-cyano-pyridin-2-ylamino)-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid amide as an off-white solid (17 mg, 56%).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0404">A procedure to test the ability of Btk inhibitors to suppress B cell receptor-mediated activation of B cells in human blood is as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0405">Human whole blood (HWB) is obtained from healthy volunteers, with the following restrictions: 24 hr drug-free, non-smokers. Blood is collected by venipuncture into Vacutainer tubes anticoagulated with sodium heparin. Test compounds are diluted to ten times the desired starting drug concentration in PBS (20×), followed by three-fold serial dilutions in 10% DMSO in PBS to produce a nine point dose-response curve. 5.5 μl of each compound dilution is added in duplicate to a 2 ml 96-well V bottom plate (Analytical Sales and Services, #59623-23); 5.5 μl of 10% DMSO in PBS is added to control and no-stimulus wells. HWB (100 μl) is added to each well, and after mixing the plates are incubated at 37 C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 100% humidity for 30 minutes. Goat F(ab′)2 anti-human IgM (Southern Biotech, #2022-14) (10 μl of a 500 μg/ml solution, 50 μg/ml final concentration) is added to each well (except the no-stimulus wells) with mixing and the plates are incubated for an additional 20 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0406">At the end of the 20 hour incubation, samples are incubated with florescent-probe-labeled anti-bodies (15 μl PE Mouse anti-Human CD20, BD Pharmingen, #555623, and/or 20 ul APC Mouse anti-Human CD69, BD Pharmingen #555533) for 30 minutes, at 37 C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 100% humidity. Included are induced control, unstained and single stains for compensation adjustments and initial voltage settings. Samples are then lysed with 1 ml of 1× Pharmingen Lyse Buffer (BD Pharmingen #555899), and plates are centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 5 minutes. Supernatants are removed via suction and the remaining pellets are lysed again with another 1 ml of 1× Pharmingen Lyse Buffer, and plates are spun down as before. Supernatants are aspirated and remaining pellets are washed in FACs buffer (PBS+1% FBS). After a final spin, the supernantants are removed and pellets are resuspended in 180 μl of FACs buffer. Samples are transferred to a 96 well plate suitable to be run on the HTS 96 well system on the BD LSR II flow cytometer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0407">Using appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths for the fluorophores used, data are acquired and percent positive cell values are obtained using Cell Quest Software. Results are initially analyzed by FACS analysis software (Flow Jo). The IC50 for test compounds is defined as the concentration which decreases by 50% the percentage of CD69-positive cells that are also CD20-positive after stimulation by anti-IgM (average of 8 control wells, after subtraction of the average of 8 wells for the no-stimulus background). The IC50 values are calculated using XLfit software version 3, equation 201.</div>

Inhibition of B-Cell Activation—B Cell FLIPR Assay in Ramos Cells
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0410">Inhibition of B-cell activation by compounds of the present invention is demonstrated by determining the effect of the test compounds on anti-IgM stimulated B cell responses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0411">The B cell FLIPR assay is a cell based functional method of determining the effect of potential inhibitors of the intracellular calcium increase from stimulation by an anti-IgM antibody. Ramos cells (human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line. ATCC-No. CRL-1596) were cultivated in Growth Media (described below). One day prior to assay, Ramos cells were resuspended in fresh growth media (same as above) and set at a concentration of 0.5×10<sup>6</sup>/mL in tissue culture flasks. On day of assay, cells are counted and set at a concentration of 1×10<sup>6</sup>/mLl in growth media supplemented with 1 μM FLUO-3AM (TefLabs Cat-No. 0116, prepared in anhydrous DMSO and 10% Pluronic acid) in a tissue culture flask, and incubated at 37° C. (4% CO<sub>2</sub>) for one h. To remove extracellular dye, cells were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 1000 rpm), resuspended in FLIPR buffer (described below) at 1×10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL and then dispensed into 96-well poly-D-lysine coated black/clear plates (BD Cat-No. 356692) at 1×10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well. Test compounds were added at various concentrations ranging from 100 μM to 0.03 μM (7 concentrations, details below), and allowed to incubate with cells for 30 min at RT. Ramos cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was stimulated by the addition of 10 μg/mL anti-IgM (Southern Biotech, Cat-No. 2020-01) and measured on a FLIPR (Molecular Devices, captures images of 96 well plates using a CCD camera with an argon laser at 480 nM excitation).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0413">FLIPR buffer: HBSS (Invitrogen, Cat-No. 141175-079), 2 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>(Sigma Cat-No. C-4901), HEPES (Invitrogen, Cat-No. 15630-080), 2.5 mM Probenecid (Sigma, Cat-No. P-8761), 0.1% BSA (Sigma, Cat-No. A-7906), 11 mM Glucose (Sigma, Cat-No. G-7528)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0130">Compound Dilution Details:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0414">In order to achieve the highest final assay concentration of 100 μM, 24 μL of 10 mM compound stock solution (made in DMSO) is added directly to 576 μL of FLIPR buffer. The test compounds are diluted in FLIPR Buffer (using Biomek 2000 robotic pipettor) resulting in the following dilution scheme: vehicle, 1.00×10<sup>−4 </sup>M, 1.00×10<sup>−5</sup>, 3.16×10<sup>−6</sup>, 1.00×10<sup>−6</sup>, 3.16×10<sup>−7</sup>, 1.00×10<sup>−7</sup>, 3.16×10<sup>−8</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0131">Assay and Analysis:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0415">Intracellular increases in calcium were reported using a max-min statistic (subtracting the resting baseline from the peak caused by addition of the stimulatory antibody using a Molecular Devices FLIPR control and statistic exporting software. The IC<sub>50 </sub>was determined using a non-linear curve fit (GraphPad Prism software).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0132">Mouse Collagen-Induced Arthritis (mCIA)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0416">On day 0 mice are injected at the base of the tail or several spots on the back with an emulsion of Type II Collagen (i.d.) in Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Following collagen immunization, animals will develop arthritis at around 21 to 35 days. The onset of arthritis is synchronized (boosted) by systemic administration of collagen in Incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA; i.d.) at day 21. Animals are examined daily after day 20 for any onset of mild arthritis (score of 1 or 2; see score description below) which is the signal to boost. Following boost, mice are scored and dosed with candidate therapeutic agents for the prescribed time (typically 2-3 weeks) and dosing frequency, daily (QD) or twice-daily (BID).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0133">Rat Collagen-Induced Arthritis (rCIA)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0417">On day 0, rats are injected with an emulsion of Bovine Type II Collagen in Incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) is injected intradermally (i.d.) on several locations on the back. A booster injection of collagen emulsion is given around day 7, (i.d.) at the base of the tail or alternative sites on the back. Arthritis is generally observed 12-14 days after the initial collagen injection. Animals may be evaluated for the development of arthritis as described below (Evaluation of arthritis) from day 14 onwards. Animals are dosed with candidate therapeutic agents in a preventive fashion starting at the time of secondary challenge and for the prescribed time (typically 2-3 weeks) and dosing frequency, daily (QD) or twice-daily (BID).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0134">Evaluation of Arthritis:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0418">In both models, developing inflammation of the paws and limb joints is quantified using a scoring system that involves the assessment of the 4 paws following the criteria described below:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0135">Scoring:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0419">1=swelling and/or redness of paw or one digit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0420">2=swelling in two or more joints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0421">3=gross swelling of the paw with more than two joints involved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0422">4=severe arthritis of the entire paw and digits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0423">Evaluations are made on day 0 for baseline measurement and starting again at the first signs or swelling for up to three times per week until the end of the experiment. The arthritic index for each mouse is obtained by adding the four scores of the individual paws, giving a maximum score of 16 per animal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0136">Rat In Vivo Asthma Model</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0424">Male Brown-Norway rats are sensitized i.p. with 100 μg of OA (ovalbumin) in 0.2 ml alum once every week for three weeks (day 0, 7, and 14). On day 21 (one week following last sensitization), the rats are dosed q.d. with either vehicle or compound formulation subcutaneously 0.5 hour before OA aerosol challenge (1% OA for 45 minutes) and terminated 4 or 24 hours after challenge. At time of sacrifice, serum and plasma are collected from all animals for serology and PK, respectively. A tracheal cannula is inserted and the lungs are lavaged 3× with PBS. The BAL fluid is analyzed for total leukocyte number and differential leukocyte counts. Total leukocyte number in an aliquot of the cells (20-100 μl) is determined by Coulter Counter. For differential leukocyte counts, 50-200 μl of the sample is centrifuged in a Cytospin and the slide stained with Diff-Quik. The proportions of monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes are counted under light microscopy using standard morphological criteria and expressed as a percentage. Representative inhibitors of Btk show decreased total leucocyte count in the BAL of OA sensitized and challenged rats as compared to control levels.</div>
