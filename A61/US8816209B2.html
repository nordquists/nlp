<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present application is based on Japanese patent application No. 2008-129540 filed May 16, 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">This invention relates to a submersible motor electric wire (i.e., an electric wire for a submersible motor) capable of having a good water-treeing resistance for a long term and, in particular, to a submersible motor electric wire suitable for use under a radiation environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">A submersible motor electric wire is used for a coil (a winding wire) or the like of a submersible motor. The submersible motor electric wire is provided for the purpose of being used in water, as indicated by the name, so that it has an insulating sheath layer for covering a conductor. When the winding wire is immersed in water, it becomes in a state of containing excessive water between the molecules of the insulating sheath layer with the immersion time. If the insulating sheath layer containing water directly contacts with the conductor (for example, copper), copper ions deposit and diffuse into the insulating sheath layer from the surface of the conductor toward the periphery of the winding wire due to that voltage is applied at the operation of the submersible motor. Further, due to the copper ions, a water-treeing occurs in the insulating sheath layer, and the water-treeing causes an insulation deterioration or an insulation breakdown of the winding wire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Therefore, conventionally, the submersible motor electric wire is configured to have a conductor shielding insulating layer (for example, an enamel layer made of an enamel resin) formed on the periphery of the conductor as a film for preventing the deposition and diffusion of the copper ions (for example, refer to JP-A-05-325653).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">On the other hand, cross-linked polyethylene can be used as a material of the insulating sheath layer of the submersible motor electric wire in order to improve heat resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The cross-linked polyethylene is obtained by conducting cross-linking between the molecules of polyethylene so as to form a reticular molecule structure, and various methods have been used as the cross-linking method, but in case of thermal chemistry cross-linking method it is preferable to carry out the cross-linking by adding an organic peroxide as a cross-linking agent such as dicumyl peroxide (as expressed by chemical formula (A)) into polyethylene and conducting heat treatment so as to initiate a reaction.</div>

As a result, cross-linking cracked residues produced incident to the above-mentioned chemical reaction may exist in the cross-linked polyethylene corresponding to the insulating sheath layer after cross-linking. The cross-linking cracked residue may be, for example, cumyl alcohol (as expressed by chemical formula (B)), acetophenone (as expressed by chemical formula (C)), and α-methylstyrene (as expressed by chemical formula (D)).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">The above related arts are disclosed in, e.g., JP-A-61-114410 and JP-A-04-87222.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Further, at present day, there is a tendency that the submersible motor electric wire is needed to be increased in longevity, so that it is needed to further enhance the water-treeing resistance. “To enhance the water-treeing resistance”, which may be also expressed “to enhance a water-treeing property”, means “to prevent the occurrence of water-treeing”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">As mentioned above, if the submersible motor electric wire is immersed in water in a state that the insulating sheath layer made of the cross-linked polyethylene or the like directly contacts with the conductor, copper ions deposit and diffuse into the insulating sheath layer, and due to the copper ions, a water-treeing occurs and grows in the insulating sheath layer, so as to causes a short-time insulation breakdown of the winding wire. As a measure of this, the enamel layer is disposed between the conductor and the insulating sheath layer as the conductor shielding insulating layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">However, the submersible motor electric wire configured to have a structure that the polyethylene of the insulating sheath layer is cross-linked by the thermal chemistry cross-linking method and the enamel is used as the conductor shielding insulating layer may affect the water-treeing resistance thereof, since if it is used for a long time, the enamel swells due to that the cross-linking cracked residue penetrates between the molecules of the enamel resin so that a crazing occurs in the enamel resin. This is due to that the cross-linking cracked residue has a benzene ring (a kind of aromatic ring) and has a low molecular weight so that it easily penetrates between the molecules of the enamel resin which has a benzene ring (a kind of aromatic ring) as well as the residue.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide a submersible motor electric wire that is capable of keeping a good water-treeing resistance for a long term.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0003">(1) According to one embodiment of the invention, a submersible motor electric wire comprises:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">a conductor comprising a copper wire and an enamel coating formed on the periphery of the copper wire; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">an insulating sheath layer formed outside the conductor,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">wherein the insulating sheath layer comprises a silane graft polymer as a main constituent, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">the silane graft polymer is formed by a graft-polymerization that an unsaturated silane compound and an organic peroxide are added to polyethylene, and is cross-linked contacting with water in the presence of a siloxane condensation catalyst.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In the above embodiment (1), the following modifications and changes can be made.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">(i) The organic peroxide is added in a proportion of not more than 0.15 part by mass to 100 parts by mass of the polyethylene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0004">(2) According to another embodiment of the invention, a submersible motor electric wire comprises:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">a conductor comprising a copper wire and an enamel coating formed on the periphery of the copper wire; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">an insulating sheath layer formed outside the conductor,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">wherein the insulating sheath layer comprises a composition including polyethylene as a main constituent, and the composition is cross-linked by being irradiated with an ionizing radiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In the above embodiment (1) or (2), the following modifications and changes can be made.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">(ii) The insulating sheath layer further comprises an antioxidant including an aromatic ring, and the antioxidant is added in a proportion of not less than 0.1 part by mass to 100 parts by mass of the polyethylene.</div>
<heading>Points of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">According to the embodiment of the invention, the insulating sheath layer comprises a silane graft polymer as a main constituent, which is formed by a graft-polymerization that an unsaturated silane compound and an organic peroxide are added to polyethylene, and the silane graft polymer is cross-linked contacting with water in the presence of a siloxane condensation catalyst. Thus, the cross-linking can be sufficiently achieved by adding a smaller amount of the organic peroxide than that in the conventional chemical cross-linking method. Therefore, deterioration in the water-treeing resistance can be prevented which may be caused by the cross-linking cracked residue of the organic peroxide, so that the water-treeing resistance can be kept for a long term.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Alternatively, according to the other embodiment of the invention, the insulating sheath layer comprises a composition including polyethylene as a main constituent, and the composition is cross-linked by being irradiated with an ionizing radiation. Thus, the cross-linking can be sufficiently achieved without adding organic peroxide. Therefore, deterioration in the water-treeing resistance can be prevented which may be caused by the cross-linking cracked residue of the organic peroxide, so that the water-treeing resistance can be kept for a long term.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a submersible motor electric wire <b>11</b> in a first embodiment according to the invention comprises a conductor <b>14</b> comprising a copper wire <b>12</b> and an enamel coating <b>13</b> formed on the periphery of the copper wire <b>12</b> and an insulating sheath layer <b>15</b> formed on the periphery of the conductor <b>14</b>, wherein the insulating sheath layer <b>15</b> comprises a silane graft polymer as a main constituent, and the silane graft polymer is formed by a graft-polymerization that an unsaturated silane compound and an organic peroxide are added to polyethylene, and the silane graft polymer is cross-linked contacting with water in the presence of a siloxane condensation catalyst.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Due to this, the cross-linking can be sufficiently achieved by adding a smaller amount of the organic peroxide than that in the conventional chemical cross-linking method. Therefore, deterioration in the water-treeing resistance can be prevented which may be caused by the cross-linking cracked residue of the organic peroxide, so that the water-treeing resistance can be kept for a long term.</div>

On the other hand, if the organic peroxide is added to the polyethylene in a proportion of less than 0.05 part by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the polyethylene, the cross-linking is insufficiently achieved, thus, it is preferable that the additive amount is not more than 0.05 part by mass.</div>

On the other hand, if the insulating sheath layer <b>15</b> includes an antioxidant including an aromatic ring, the antioxidant being added into the insulating sheath layer <b>15</b> in a proportion of more than 0.5 part by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the polyethylene, a bloom phenomenon (the antioxidant deposits on the surface of the polyethylene) occurs, so that it is preferable that the additive amount is not more than 0.5 part by mass.</div>
