<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to optical devices, more specifically, the present invention relates to multicolor optical light source assemblies with controlled color mixing for a uniform color mixture.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are being used as light sources in an increasing variety of applications extending from communications and instrumentation to household, automotive and visual display uses. In many of these applications color variability is advantageous or required. LEDs have great promise for color variable applications because of their rapid switching time, small size, high reliability, long life and simplicity of color control. A common color variable LED assembly combines red, green and blue (RGB) LEDs in an RGB assembly. Color can be controlled and changed by varying the outputs of each different color LED.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Unfortunately, conventional multi-colored LEDs, including conventional RGB assemblies, suffer from poor color mixing. Because the LED die emit considerable heat, the LED die are typically widely spaced for heat dissipation. As a consequence, die of different color are spaced apart, and viewers may see different individual colors from different viewing angles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is a schematic cross-section of a conventional RGB assembly <b>10</b>, is useful in understanding poor color mixing. The assembly <b>10</b> includes red, green and blue LED die <b>11</b>R, <b>11</b>G and <b>11</b>B, respectively disposed on a mounting base <b>12</b> and encapsulated in a transparent dome <b>13</b>. The die can be mounted within a surface cavity (not shown) in the base <b>12</b>. In the particular arrangement illustrated, green light from die <b>11</b>G dominates viewing angles on the left side of the assembly, blue light from <b>11</b>B dominates views from the right side and red light from <b>11</b>R dominates central viewing. There is both poor illuminance overlap and poor luminous intensity overlap of the respective colors. Illuminance is defined as the total light flux incident on a surface, per unit area, as perceived by the human eye. Luminous intensity is defined as a measure of the wavelength-weighted power emitted by a light source in a particular direction, based on a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Attempts to improve color mixing in the prior art include externally attached secondary optics. Such devices include fly's eye lenslet arrays, holographic diffusers, microlens patterns, and scatter devices. These devices may be attached to refractors, reflectors or hybrid collimators. Other such attachments include internal reflection (TIR) integrators and mirror integrators, which improve overlap of colors at their respective exit apertures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">All such secondary optic devices suffer from several disadvantages. External devices may be bulky and unwieldy for integrated luminaire applications. Secondary optic devices may improve color mixing by spreading the light into a wider beam, but as the light is spread, luminous intensity drops according to etendue and skewness invariance laws. Etendue is a property of an optical system, which characterizes how “spread out” the light is in area and angle. This is undesirable for high intensity narrow distribution applications. TIR or mirror integrators may bring some or all of the luminous intensity back to a full overlap at a given distance from the illumination sources, but suffer from poor matching at other distances from the source. For certain types of TIR mirror integrators, the illuminance distribution functions of different color sources may overlap well, but their corresponding luminous intensity distribution functions do not overlap well. In such circumstances, the colors again separate at further distances from the sources. In other situations, the luminous intensity distributions may overlap well, but the illuminance distributions do not, thereby resulting in one color being visible near the center of the plane at which the sources are viewed, while other colors are more visible near the fringes of the plane, with the resulting illuminance distribution having the appearance of a “bull's eye.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Thus, it is desirable for the light produced by a multi-color array to create a more uniform color mixture everywhere within the emitted light beam. Accordingly, there is a need for a multicolor LED assembly with improved and controlled color mixing.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an assembly of multicolor light emitting diodes packaged for controlled color mixing. The assembly includes a thermally conductive mounting substrate with a plurality of LED die mounted on the substrate. The plurality of the LED die together emit light of more than one color. Also, included is an optically transmissive encapsulant surrounding the plurality of LED die; the encapsulant fills up the surface cavity. Additionally, the assembly may include at least one lens having a top surface and a bottom surface covering said encapsulant, the bottom surface of the lens including a contour to redirect light from each of the plurality of LED die in different directions towards the top surface of the lens. The contoured shaped bottom surface of the lens redirects light from each of the plurality of LED die such that illuminance and luminous intensity distributions of the plurality of LED die substantially overlap, wherein the deviation from complete overlap is less than a predetermined amount which is imperceptible to the average human eye. The predetermined amount falls within the area of a MacAdam ellipse plotted on a chromaticity chart for the colors emitted and mixed together by the plurality of LED die.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">The contoured bottom surface may include a microlenslet array, which can be described by a microsurface roughness prescription, a micro-fly's eye lenslet array, or have a Voronoi lenslet array structure. The top surface of the lens may be described by a surface having a number of standard shapes. The lens may be imbedded with refractive or reflective microparticles. If imbedded with reflective microparticles, the microparticles may be arranged to produce microtunnels that act like waveguides to light emitted by the LEDs. The lens may be formed of multiple lobes. The encapsulant surrounding the LED die may itself be surrounded by a reflector. The lens may also be surrounded by a second reflector. The second reflector may be composed of a plurality of randomly-perturbed microfacets. The encapsulant and the lens may be surrounded by an RXI concentrator/collimator, where RXI refers to combinations of reflective (R), refractive (X), and Total Internally Reflecting (I) surfaces.</div>

More particularly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the deviation from complete overlap of colors plotted on a chromaticity chart, is smaller than the size of MacAdam ellipses, which indicate regions on a chromaticity chart which contain all the colors which are indistinguishable to the human eye. The color at the center of an ellipse shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is indistinguishable to the human eye from a color anywhere else within or on the perimeter of the ellipse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">The exact shape of the bottom surface <b>26</b> <i>b </i>will depend on the size of the lens or dome <b>26</b>, the number of LED die <b>21</b>, the size of each LED die <b>21</b> and the location of each LED <b>21</b> relative to the central axis of the lens <b>26</b>. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the LED die <b>21</b> is located as close to the central axis of the LED as possible, and the diameter of the lens's bottom surface <b>26</b> <i>b </i>is relatively large with respect to the array of LED die <b>21</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">It is noted that typically LED die <b>21</b> are located close together within the cavity <b>24</b> to enhance the optical efficiency of the LED array. However, in some circumstances there may be optical advantages for the LED die <b>21</b> to be spaced further apart depending on the desired radiation pattern. Additionally, it is noted that the LED array may include either one or multiple cavities, each filled with multiple LED die of different colors or phosphors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">A metric for determining acceptable color uniformity based on MacAdam Ellipses is outlined in the steps of the flow chart shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. At step <b>28</b>, x,y chromaticity samples of the beam are taken at 4 angular luminous intensity points in vertical and horizontal distribution extrema at approximately points where the intensity distribution falls to 1/e<sup>2 </sup>of the on-axis or peak intensity. At step <b>30</b>, a 9 point x,y chromaticity sample is taken in a spiral from the outer periphery to the highest point of on-axis luminous intensity. At step <b>32</b>, an additional 8 point x,y chromaticity sample is taken at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315 degree radials at approximately the full width at half maximum (FWHM) point. At step <b>34</b>, the x,y chromaticity samples are then converted to u,v space. Transformation from x,y chromaticity space to the 1960 u,v space produces a closer correlation in distance between two color samples to the minimally perceived color difference. The transformation equations to convert x,y chromaticity coordinates to u, v coordinates include the following: u=4x/(−2x+12y+3), v=6y/(−2x+12y+3). At step <b>36</b>, MacAdam ellipses are plotted from the samples. At step <b>38</b>, a deltaE parameter is calculated. DeltaE refers to the magnitude of the color difference perceived between two color samples which are specified in terms of tristimulus values. Tristimulus values are the relative amounts of primary stimuli in red, green, and blue required to match an achromatic stimulus. The delta E parameter must be less than a 2-step MacAdam's ellipse or match/exceed the maximum field chromaticity difference of the standard. MacAdam ellipse refers to a chromaticity region in which the human eye cannot perceive the change in color. Approximately 65% of the population can detect chromaticity differences within two standard deviations or steps greater than the standard MacAdam ellipse. 95% can detect differences on the order of 3-steps or standard deviations from the ellipse, and 99% of the population can detect color differences on the order of 4-steps. The American National Standard Institute specifies a 4-step ellipse as the maximum chromaticity difference tolerance for fluorescent lamps. ANSI standard C78.376-2001. At step <b>40</b>, if this is not the last color to be included in a mixture, then steps <b>32</b>-<b>38</b> are repeated for another color. For example, this process is repeated for Red+Green+Blue, or cyan, yellow, magneta. Red+Green+Blue will produce a color which is perceived as white. A white uniformity which is acceptable for a white source such as a fluorescent lamp produces color uniformity with deviation less than a 4-step MacAdam ellipse. When using more than one mixed primary color to produce white the tolerance is sometimes increased to as high as a 7 or 8-step ellipse. Analyzing the uniformity of Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow is one way of additive color uniformity analysis in which Red+Green=Yellow, Red+Blue=Magenta, and Blue+Green=Cyan. A white beam may be comprised of varying combinations of red, green, and blue or other alternative wavelength multi-primary sources all turned on at the same time to yield a color perceived as white. A color perceived as white requires more green according to the spectral response of the m cones. White color disuniformity occurs when the color temperature of the white light field has visible changes as perceived by the human eye in which some areas have more blue or red within the white composite. When trying to achieve high white color uniformity the process of analysis must include an additional constraint is added with regards to maximum acceptable Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) or x,y chromaticity differences over the illuminance or luminous intensity distributions. CCT is defined as the temperature of the blackbody radiator whose human perceived color most closely resembles that of the given radiator at the same brightness and under the specified viewing conditions when the chromaticity of the luminous sample is not exactly equal to any of the chromaticities of the blackbody radiator compared. Chromaticity differences in the spatial illuminance and spatial intensity are undesirable. The purpose of integrating color uniformity enhancement geometry in an LED is to minimize chromaticity differences as measured in x,y or u,v coordinates over the field of measurement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">In one embodiment of the present invention, referred to in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the contoured bottom surface <b>26</b> <i>b </i>of the lens <b>26</b> is designed to meet the criteria described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> according to a micro-surface roughness prescription, which is shown as a micro-surface roughness index difference interface (MSR) layer <b>42</b> between the encapsulant <b>25</b> and lens <b>26</b>. The MSR layer <b>42</b> is a surface roughness feature which takes advantage of slight index of refraction difference between encapsulant <b>25</b> and the lens <b>26</b> to redistribute color specific phase of the light emanating from the color LEDs <b>21</b>R, <b>21</b>B, <b>21</b>G. The MSR layer <b>42</b> serves to control the intensity of the light emanating from the color LEDs <b>21</b>R, <b>21</b>B, <b>21</b>G as it propagates over distance. For example, if the intensity of one color beam is too narrow compared to another color, then the surfaces of the MSR layer <b>42</b> serve to spread the light of the one beam to overlap with the other beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">The contours or textures of the individual microstructures that make up the shape of the MSR layer <b>42</b> can be described by a number of design conventions, which include V-cavity, Harvey Bidirectional Surface Distribution Function (Harvey BSDF), angle resolve scatter, phong, and user-defined BSDF in both isotropic and anistropic forms includes zones and combinations of both isotropic and anisotropic scatter prescriptions. For V-cavity, the MSR layer <b>42</b> can be described as a collection of V-shaped teeth or cavities when viewed head on. The surface roughness of the V-cavity is defined through the rms (root-mean-square) slope of the associated V-grooves. The V-groove cavities are distributed randomly and the slopes or the pitch of the cavities may follow a Gaussian normal probability distribution function. The slopes can be described mathematically by a roughness tailored slope error distribution function as follows:

[<i>s </i>cos(<i>u</i>),<i>s </i>sin(<i>u</i>),(square root (1-<i>s</i> <sup>2</sup>))];−1<i>&lt;s&lt;</i>1 and−π&lt;<i>u</i>&lt;π

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">where F<sub>s </sub>is flux of the desired scattered rays emanating from the MSR surface, F<sub>o </sub>is the flux of incident rays entering the scatter design surface, ρ(θ<sub>i</sub>, φ<sub>i</sub>, θ<sub>s</sub>, φ<sub>s</sub>) is the BSDF of the scatter surface <b>42</b> of the MSR layer <b>42</b> applied to the lens <b>26</b>. A is the area of the scatter surface attractor. For multi-primary sources (LEDs <b>21</b>), “A” defines the illuminance periphery of the specific color for which the second color must match after application of the tailored roughness surface design. n′ defines the desired number of rays (first order approximation of light field) required to scatter and strike the attractor surface. R defines the distance from the scatter surface of the MSR layer <b>42</b> to the scatter design surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">Another way to describe the contours or textures of the individual microstructures that make up the shape of the MSR layer <b>42</b> is by a phong. Phong refers to a broad peak scatter model or a model which takes into account combinations of both specular and diffuse scattering at the local reflection level. Phong scatter does not account for second-order reflections as does rigorous Monte-Carlo raytracing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref> show how energy is distributed from an incident ray through a surface as it scatters from a surface. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the surface <b>44</b> presents little scattering, so the resulting energy scatter vs. position <b>46</b> produces a narrow-shaped ellipse. For a random distribution of an MSR prescription (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>), the light energy is scattered over a larger area but produces a smooth circular-like distribution. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, using a user-defined BSDF distribution of non-randomly distributed angular surfaces, transmission after refraction through the surface <b>47</b> with an MSR prescription is optimized for a resulting energy scatter lobe <b>48</b> that can approach the more narrow distribution surface of an unobstructed beam. The energy incident on a detector would not fall off as quickly as a randomly distributed surface so that better control of the spread of light is obtained and therefore there can be better control of color uniformity.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">The microsurface roughness prescription may also be described by such functions as forward Harvey, retro Harvey, Lambertian, Poisson distributed micro features, forward Phong, and retro Phong. Each of these roughness or scatter features may also be added or combined with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">The index of refraction difference between a material encapsulating a light emitter (the encapsulant <b>25</b>) and a lens <b>26</b> is very important. Large differences in index of refraction have a large effect on light extraction and intensity distributions. For example, the index of refraction of semiconductor light emitters is very high (from 2.4-3.4) and therefore the desired encapsulant index of refraction is also high. As the index of refraction of the lens increases to match that of the encapsulant index of refraction, less light has the likelihood of encountering total internal reflections and thereby becoming reabsorbed by the light emitters. Small index differences improve the effectiveness of the micro-surface roughness prescription but may still be not enough to causes nearly total overlap of the illuminance and luminous intensity distribution functions of spatially distributed light emitters (the LEDs <b>21</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">In such circumstances, different MSR prescriptions can be designed for different “zones” of a lens as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The “zones” <b>49</b> <i>a</i>-<b>49</b> <i>d </i>may have the form of stripes, polygons, or freeform peripheral shapes of arbitrary size and distribution. Each of the “zones” <b>49</b> <i>a</i>-<b>49</b> <i>d </i>may have an optimized MSR prescription tuned to overlap color-specific illuminance and intensity distributions. For example, a red light emitter can have an MSR prescription which spreads the light as much as possible, while it may be more preferable for the prescription for a green and/or blue LED emitter to minimize the spreading of light through the MSR surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">The MSR features described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be applied to an optimized lens where the lens itself has a design prescription tailored to redistribute the light in order to improve color uniformity in the far field.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">Zernike polynomials can be used to describe wavefronts of optical sources. In optometry and opthalmology, the Zernike polynomials are used to describe aberrations of the cornea or lens from an ideal spherical shape, which result in refraction errors. They are commonly used in adaptive optics for telescopes where they can be used to effectively cancel out atmospheric distortion. In the present context, one or more Zernike polynomials can be used to describe an optical control surface of a lens.

This is useful for strip LED lights where an array of LED dice are aligned along one axis such that the longer axis of the lens is aligned with the axis of the die to improve color uniformity. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a biconic lens projected along the ZX axis, which has a parabolic shape, while the same biconic lens projected along the ZY axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> has a semicircular shape. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a perspective view of the biconic lens whose upper surface <b>60</b> can be described by the equation:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-36</figref>, the contoured bottom surface <b>26</b> <i>b </i>of the lens <b>26</b> is designed to meet the criteria described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> according to a micro-lenslet array, which is shown as a micro fly's eye lenslet array layer <b>62</b> between the encapsulant <b>25</b> and lens <b>26</b>. The micro fly's eye lenslet array layer <b>62</b>, like the MSR prescription feature, takes advantage of slight index of refraction difference between the encapsulant <b>25</b> and the lens <b>26</b> to redistribute color specific phase of the light emanating from the color LEDs <b>21</b>R, <b>21</b>B (not shown), <b>21</b>G. The index of refraction of the micro fly's eye lenslet array layer <b>62</b> may be higher or lower than the primary index of refraction of the encapsulant <b>25</b> encapsulating the LEDs <b>21</b>R, <b>21</b>B, <b>21</b>G. Micro-fly's eye lenslet arrays operate in a similar fashion similar to the compound eyes of a fly. The single lens of the human eye focuses light on the fovea of the retina. The segmented compound eyes of a fly have a plurality of lenslets which focus light through many rhabdoms to photoreceptors. These structures or ommatidia are distributed over the compound eye. The micro-fly's eye lenslet array analogously makes a single LED light source appear to be emanating from a plurality of light sources. The lenslets <b>64</b> function by introducing micro-caustics which serve to disperse the light of a specific wavelength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">Each lenslet <b>64</b> can have a variety of shapes, including any arbitrary polygon which may include hexagons (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>), squares (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>), rectangles (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>), circles (radius), radius plus conic constant, aspheric, free-form NURBS, or Zernike polynomial-shaped cells. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> demonstrates that a global deformation can be applied to the lenslet array. The deformation may be described by a Zernike polynomial or other multi-axis general polynomial. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> shows that the cells may be distributed in a random fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37-40</figref> show a variation on the lenslet array concept of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-36</figref> according to another embodiment of the present invention, in which the individual polygonal cells can be replaced by lenslets of more natural form. These cells are called Voronoi cells and a micro-lenslet array constructed from them have the shape and overall distribution and pattern of a Voronoi diagram. In a Voronoi diagram (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>), a plane with “n” points is partitioned into convex polygons (cells) such that each polygon contains exactly one generating point and every point in a given polygon is closer to its generating point than to any other. A Voronoi diagram is sometimes also known as a Dirichlet tessellation. A tessellation is generally defined as a repeating pattern of similar or identical shapes which fills a surface. The cells are called Dirichlet regions, Thiessen polytopes, or Voronoi polygons. A point within each polygonal region is a point of higher interest where LE emitters are positioned. The size of the polygons is smallest and the distribution of the polygons is densest in the areas near the positions of the emitters. Voronoi or Dirichlet tessellation boundaries are formed from the orthonormal bisectors of the connections between the points. The bisectors are found by taking the complex hull of the points in two dimensional space after projection onto a three-dimensional paraboloid. These points in the set from which is formed the Voronoi tessellation boundaries can be perturbed in spatial position through a statistical Poisson distribution to further homogenize the light composed of multiple primaries. An algorithm highlights primary color concentration points as areas of importance for lenslet formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">To construct the Voronoi lenslet array structure, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, a cloud of points <b>65</b> is formed above multi-primary emitters (the LEDs <b>21</b>) at a light extraction lens plane. Formation of the cloud of points <b>65</b> is determined by primary phase concentration or areas on a refractive surface where a primary color dominates the composite color. Areas with narrowest spectral bandwidth require more points which becomes an area of importance for Voronoi lenslet formation. Then, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, a Voronoi algorithm determines the lengths of the perimeter segments <b>66</b> and the angles between adjoining cell lenslets <b>67</b>. Deformations are then applied to the lenslets <b>67</b> through radius, radius+conic constant, aspheric, Zernike, or free-form NURBS forms to further enhance color uniformity in the far field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> shows optical power deformation applied to the Voronoi lenslet array with an index of refraction difference. The difference in index of refraction is necessary to perturb the angular phase of the local light field to bring one primary spatial illuminance or intensity distribution into closer correlation to a second spatial illuminance or intensity distribution. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> shows an example of a Voronoi-Poisson described tessellation overlay on an integrated light extraction lens in which the Voronoi-Poisson described tessellation periphery serve as a stencil for where the lenslet optical power micro-deformations must be created. Here the 6-pointed star <b>68</b> shadows are the areas of highest primary (LED light) wavelength concentration requiring dispersion for a desired luminous intensity and illuminance distribution multi-primary overlap.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">The micro-lenslet array structures of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-40</figref> are subject to numerous variations and modifications. The micro fly's eye structure or the Voronoi-Poisson structure for lenslet arrays can be used in conjunction with any of the light extraction lens forms of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-27</figref>. According to another embodiment of the present invention, spherical particles used as refractive devices can be imbedded in any of the light extraction lenses described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-40</figref> to improve color uniformity. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> shows micro-spheres <b>70</b> imbedded in the light extraction lens <b>26</b> which can also include a micro-lenslet array <b>62</b>. The spherical particles <b>70</b> require a slightly different refractive index from the surrounding material <b>72</b> of the lens <b>26</b> to be effective. Optimization parameters include the optimal density of the particles <b>70</b>, the particle radius, and the refractive index difference between the particles <b>70</b> and the surrounding lens material <b>72</b> in order to both improve color uniformity and keep light extraction high. When ray tracing, the effect of the spherical particles can be characterized through a modified Mie scattering model. Mie scattering refers to a mathematical formulation for describing the scattering of light by spherical dielectric particles of arbitrary diameter near that of the wavelength of light in a homogenous medium. To calculate the scattering of light by particles of arbitrary shapes Mie approximations no longer hold and a more rigorous method must be used such as the discrete-dipole approximation or DDA proposed by E. M. Purcell and C. R. Pennypacker (“Scattering and Absorption of Light by Nonspherical Dielectric Grains,” Astrophysical Journal, 186:705, 1973), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The modification can be described by the product of a scattering vector (s) and the radius of the imbedded particle (R), where s=2*k*sin(θ/2) and R=the average radius of the spherical particles. Many materials are available to create slight index of refraction differences between the particle <b>70</b> and the surrounding lens material <b>72</b>. Refractive indices need to be similar to common high index silicones, glasses, and polymers. Table 2 lists refractive indices for materials that can be used to form the imbedded spherical particles <b>70</b>. In Table 2, K refers to a crown, F to a flint, H refers to a glass lacking lead, arsenic and cadmium and is more environmentally friendly, BaK is a Barium Crown, ZK a dense crown, ZF a dense flint. The increasing number indicates increasing refractive index, for instance H_BaK2 has a lower refractive index than H_BaK6.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">In many applications, a higher intensity beam of light is more desirable than a purely Lambertian beam produced by traditional LED packages. A Lambertian beam is a uniformly distributed beam that would be produced by a disc of light, such as the full moon. In a Lambertian light distribution, radiance as a function of angle is constant. Referring now to FIG. <b>48</b>, one way of increasing on-axis intensity of a light engine (LED die emitter) is by integrating a reflector <b>94</b> as a one-piece package surrounding the LED emitters (not shown). The reflector <b>94</b> serves to both improve light extraction from the LED package and to shape the light. Typical Lambertian beams produced with an LED emitter having no reflector have a +/−62 degree full width at half maximum (FWHM) on axis intensity. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> shows a typical Lambertian beam intensity distribution with the LED package construction shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>.</div>

A primary reflector <b>98</b> encapsulates the light-extraction lens <b>26</b> and overlies the reflector <b>96</b>. The reflector <b>96</b> has a spline shape described by a revolved polynomial, Bezier spline, or NURBS surface. The angles of the reflective surfaces are chosen to maximize light extraction from the immersed semiconductor source as well as reduce intensity dispersion. The taller primary reflector <b>98</b> concentrates the light into a tighter beam with increased on-axis intensity. By integrating the reflector <b>96</b> as a part of the LED cavity <b>24</b>, high light extraction is achieved. A light extraction lens <b>26</b> disperses the light in a non-Lambertian manner to decrease the height of the reflector necessary to achieve a +/−30 degree beam as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>. Light strikes the reflector <b>96</b>, which exits the light extraction lens <b>26</b>, some of which hits the primary reflector <b>98</b> and exits out of the multi-color LED assembly <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-58</figref> illustrate a technique of using light control facets and randomized facet perturbations of the primary reflector <b>98</b> to improve color uniformity. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, the primary reflector <b>98</b> can first be broken into horizontal slices <b>100</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, these horizontal slices are then vertically cut into a plurality of facets <b>102</b>. Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, each of the facets <b>102</b> appear nearly flat in a local region <b>104</b> near their mathematical center <b>106</b>. In the local region <b>104</b>, a vector, called an angular facet control vector <b>108</b> can be found by applying the following algorithm as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>. At step <b>110</b>, for a parametric surface described by x=x(φ, φ), y=y(φ, φ), z=z(φ, φ), new vectors a′=[x<sub>φ</sub>, y<sub>φ</sub>, z<sub>φ</sub>], b′=[x<sub>ψ</sub>, y<sub>ψ</sub>, z<sub>ψ</sub>], are defined. At step <b>112</b>, the unit normal vector is found as N′=(a′×b′)/(sqrt((abs(a′^2)abs(b′^2)−abs(a′b′)^2). At step <b>114</b>, a descriminant g of the metric tensor is found and the vector normal to the surface is N=r1′×r2′/(sqrt(g))=∈ij*r′^j. At step <b>116</b>, the metric tensor can be found by taking the inner product of the tangency spaces associated with the reflector facet manifold where the inner product is symmetric, nondegenerate, and bilinear in 3D vector space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">Using the graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, perturbation is then applied to a facet <b>102</b> by deviating the angular facet control vector <b>108</b> from the unit normal vector by a random angle between an upper and lower bound. The degree of perturbation is higher where color specific phase concentration is highest. After completion of the multi-layer, multi-facet, perturbation routine, the resulting integrated primary reflector <b>98</b> both collimates the light, and randomizes color specific phase to improve the intensity distribution function overlap of Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> depicts microfacets <b>110</b> as diamond-shaped, with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref> being a close-up view of some of the diamond microfacets <b>110</b> in which the inter-facet space <b>112</b> is knitted together to prevent light from exiting through them. The present invention can be extended to other polygonal shaped facets, such as diamond, triangular, hexagonal shapes, etc., without departing from the spirit of the invention. Besides polygonal shapes, the microfacets <b>110</b> can take on shapes defined by multiple user-defined BSDF functions in which alternating diffuse and specular surface textures can be applied. Specular surfaces are those surfaces which have a mirror-like finish, while diffuse surfaces have a rough finish which tends to scatter impinging light. The inter-facet space <b>112</b> (the knitting) can be described by NURBS or other general polynomial blend functions. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> shows the resulting overlap of intensity distributions for cyan, magneta, and yellow. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> shows randomized perturbed facets <b>114</b> applied to an integrated primary reflector <b>124</b> with alternating specular/diffuse texturing, as well as an array of multiple collections of R-G-B light engines <b>126</b>. Emphasis is placed on the perturbation of facets. Faceting alone is not sufficient to produce acceptable color uniformity for multi-primary LED light engine arrays <b>126</b>, i.e., the randomized perturbation of the facet control vector can produce the desired effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, reflective (R), refractive (X), and Total Internally Reflecting (I) surfaces can be combined with any combination of the color uniformity enhancement features discussed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-60</figref>. RXI concentrators enable compact, high efficiency collimation. RXI concentrators can be made available in both singlet and array configurations. The design of a traditional RXI concentrator is described by Benitez and Minano pg. 202 of “Non-Imaging Optics” Elsevier Academic Press (2005), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 61</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>61</b> <i>e. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">The following steps are followed to construct an RXI concentrator as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>: At step <b>120</b>, the intermediary air of a cassegrain telescope is filled with refractive dielectric. At step <b>122</b>, micro-facets are added to the primary reflector. At step <b>124</b>, the facets are randomized with respect to an angle from normal using the vector perturbations previously described for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-58</figref>. At step <b>126</b>, reflector facets are changed into organic shapes or to those of an arbitrary polygonal parameter. At step <b>128</b>, the same perturbations are applied to the secondary reflector as the primary with unique perturbation factors. At step <b>130</b>, at the exit aperture of the RXI concentrator, the surface of the dielectric is tessellated with micro-lenslets where these micro-lenslet cellular peripheries are of the Voronoi-Poisson type described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37-40</figref>. At step <b>132</b>, randomize sag with one or more of radii, aspherics, NURBS, and global Zernike deformation. Optionally, at step <b>134</b>, use varying index micro-sphere filler in the dielectric media. At step <b>136</b>, in terms of optimal global deformation on the primary and secondary reflectors, solve the Monge-Ampere partial differential equation using specialized numerical solution processes in terms of multi-primary wavelength specific phase and find solutions to the general polynomial descriptions of the primary and secondary reflectors, which optimally combine multi-primary phase in the far field.</div>
