No. 12/655,984, filed on Jan. 11, 2011, and entitled “Spring Enhanced Buffer for a Firearm”, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,296,984, which was a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/384,354, entitled “Versatile Buffer/Spring Assembly for a Firearm” filed on Apr. 3, 2009.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">This invention relates generally to firearms and more particularly to the stock tube/spring/buffer combination used in automatic and semi-automatic rifles and carbines and the M16/AR15.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The M16/AR15 series of rifles was originally designed to use a twenty inch barrel; with the gas port located approximately thirteen inches from the breach. The original design also used an operating spring and buffer system designed specifically for the fixed stock.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">As the battlefield changed, so too did the methods and tactics used by our military forces. These changes demanded that the individual weapon become shorter, more compact and easier to handle in confined spaces. This was ultimately accomplished by shortening the weapon's barrel and developing a telescoping stock system, which allowed the user to select varying degrees of “length of pull”. This telescoping stock system also used a new shorter action spring and was/is unable to use the existing action spring from the rifle version.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The new, shorter weapon is called a “carbine”. One of the shortcomings of the carbine is that when the barrel is shortened, the location of the gas port was also moved closer to the breach. The high pressure gases that are bled off at this port are what provide the energy for the weapon to operate; however, the gas pressures of the new shorter carbine system are nearly double what the original system was designed to do. This causes significantly higher operating pressures and forces the weapon to operate at much higher cyclic rates and with a noticeably increased bolt velocity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">To counter this, the carbine action spring is stiffer than the rifle action spring, and the functional length of the carbine spring is much shorter than the rifle spring. Attempts to run the longer rifle length barrel on a weapon with the shorter carbine length recoil system (collapsible stock tube, spring, and buffer) have proven to be an unreliable design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">This means that the two weapons, the rifle and carbine, require different combinations of stock tube, spring, and buffer in order to operate properly; otherwise, the weapons are not reliable; thereby forcing an expanded inventory of replacement and manufacturing parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">It is clear there is a need for an improved stock tube/buffer/spring assembly to improve reliability and also decrease the complexity of the firearm systems.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The invention relates to a collapsible stock for a firearm and the improved firearm using such stock. While there are many firearms, this invention is particularly useful for a firearm which has models ranging from a carbine to a rifle (barrel length between seven inches and twenty four inches).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Such firearms are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,637,142, entitled “Firearm Assembly” issued to Reynolds on Oct. 28, 2003; U.S. Pat. No. 6,487,805, entitled “Firearm Assembly” issued to Reynolds on Dec. 3, 2002; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,448,307, entitled, Gas Operated Semi-Automatic Rifle” issued to Dafinov, on Nov. 11, 2008; all of which are incorporated hereinto by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">The firearm uses an action mechanism to discharge a cartridge so that a bullet travels through the barrel. Those of ordinary skill in the art readily recognize a variety of action mechanisms, such as, but not limited to, U.S. Pat. No. 4,433,610, entitled “Open Bolt Firing Mechanism for Automatic Firearm” issued to Tatro on Feb. 28, 1984; U.S. Pat. No. 6,722,255, entitled “Apparatus and Method for Actuating a Bolt Carrier Group as a Receiver Assembly” issued to Herring on Apr. 20, 2004; U.S. Pat. No. 7,461,581m, entitled “Self-Cleaning Gas Operating System for a Firearm” issued to Leitner-Wise on Dec. 9, 2008; U.S. Pat. No. 7,418,898, entitled “M16 Modified With Push Rod Operating System and Conversion Thereof” issued to Desomma on Sep. 2, 2008; and, U.S. Pat. No. 6,851,346, entitled “Firearm Bolt Catch Assembly” issued to Herring on Feb. 8, 2005; all of which are, incorporated hereinto by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">A collapsible stock permits the firearm to be used in a variety of situations (e.g. to facilitate close quarters operations such as within a building), by users of varying arm length and height, and to accommodate other equipment (e.g. thick body armor).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Collapsible stocks are well known in the art. Examples of such are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,925,744, entitled “Modular Firearm Buttstock” issued to Kincel on Aug. 9, 2005; and, U.S. Pat. No. 7,363,740, entitled “Modular Firearm Buttstock” issued to Kincel on Apr. 29, 2008; both of which are incorporated hereinto by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Further, in the case of the M16/AR14 rifle and carbine, the collapsible stock assembly assists the action mechanism in ejecting a spent cartridge and injecting a fresh cartridge into the action. In this context, the collapsible stock slides upon a stock tube. Within the stock tube is a spring working with a buffer mass which assists the action mechanism in ejecting the spent cartridge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Such collapsible stock assemblies for the M16 and AR14 rifles are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,057,003, entitled “Open Bolt Conversion Apparatus” issued to Atchisson on Nov. 8, 1977; and, U.S. Pat. No. 6,971,202, entitled “Gas Operated Action for Auto-Loading Firearms” issued to Bender on Dec. 6, 2005; both of which are incorporated hereinto by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In the present invention, the stock tube ideally has a working length of 7.771 inches although a working length of between 7.5 and 8 inches is also operable as indicated below. This is the length from the open end to the base of the stock tube.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In some embodiments of the invention, a plate with screw adjustment is provided in the stock tube, permitting the working length to be adjusted by user to obtain specific operating characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The present invention provides a system which uses a stock tube with a single uniform spring and associated buffer regardless of the length of the barrel of the firearm; hence, a single spring is used for reliable operation of a firearm whether that firearm is a carbine (typically requiring a shorter, more durable spring), or a rifle, (requiring a less durable spring for reliable operation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The preferred spring used for either the carbine (barrel length as short as seven inches) or the rifle (barrel length up to twenty-four inches) is that described in MIL-W-13855, incorporated hereinto by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The buffer used in this invention is made from a sleeve member having an open end and a closed end and has a diameter (except for an engaging collar) less than a diameter of said spring, thereby allowing the buffer to fit within the spring (except for the collar at one end of the buffer). In the preferred embodiment, four weights are contained within the sleeve member and are chosen so that the total mass of the assembled buffer is between 4.2 and 5.1 ounces. A bumper (ideally made from plastic) is secured to the open end of the sleeve member to seal the open end of said sleeve member and contain the weights therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In one aspect of the present invention, a unique buffer is established. As described above, the buffer is a sleeve having an open end and a closed end. A mass is contained within the sleeve member. Ideally this mass, as described above, is made up of four different weights having two or more individual masses. The total mass of the weights is chosen to meet the demands of the particular firearm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">As before, a bumper secures and seals the open end of said sleeve. In this improved buffer, a spring is contained within the sleeve to maintain the mass at a predetermined location when the buffer is in an at-rest position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The spring, by maintaining the mass at pre-determined location within the buffer during at-rest conditions (e.g. except for when the weapon is discharged), eliminates any noise or “rattling” sounds from the buffer when the firearm is carried or moved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Even further, this placement of the mass at a standard location before discharge of the firearm provides for enhanced accuracy since the mass is consistently placed in one position, thereby eliminating variations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The improved buffer provides for improved reliability and enhanced accuracy as well as a silencing of the mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The invention, together with various embodiments thereof, will be more fully explained by the accompanying drawings and the following descriptions thereof.</div>

<heading>DRAWINGS IN DETAIL</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of the parts used in the present invention. Upper receiver <b>12</b> is configured to engage mechanism <b>17</b> and contain the bolt carrier <b>13</b> therebetween. Mechanism <b>17</b> includes a stock tuber <b>16</b> which is configured to accept butt member <b>10</b> (sliding on stock tube <b>16</b>) and selectively engaging with lower receiver <b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Stock tube <b>16</b> is configured to accept spring <b>11</b> therein as well as buffer <b>14</b>. Spring <b>11</b> complies with MIL-W-13855. With a wire diameter of 0.072 inches, 44 coils, a spring rate 1.35 and a free length of 12.5 inches, spring <b>11</b> reliably operates a firearm having a barrel length ranging from a carbine length (7 inches) to a rifle length (24 inches).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Buffer <b>14</b> has an overall length of between 3.8 and 4.1 inches and a mass of between 4.2 and 5.1 ounces. This length/mass combination of buffer <b>14</b> assures that the operation of the firearm, regardless of the barrel length, is reliable and steady.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">To accommodate spring <b>11</b> and buffer <b>14</b>, stock tube <b>16</b> has an internal operating length of between 7.5 and 8 inches; ideally the internal operating length is 7.771 inches. This length allows lower receiver <b>15</b> to fully accept the spring <b>11</b>//buffer <b>14</b> combination and has seven engaging points so that butt member <b>10</b> is given seven degrees of freedom for optimal operator satisfaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the spring and buffer placed within the hollow receiver. Hollow receiver <b>16</b> now contains spring <b>11</b> and buffer <b>14</b>. As noted earlier, the internal length of hollow receiver <b>16</b> (operating length) is 7.771 inches, allowing spring <b>11</b> and buffer <b>14</b> to be properly contained therein. Placement of spring <b>11</b> and buffer <b>14</b> within hollow receiver <b>16</b> is via opening <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the components of the invention's preferred buffer. Buffer <b>14</b> includes collar <b>35</b> which is designed to rest on the end of the spring (not shown) as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Buffer <b>14</b> is hollow and contains weights <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> therein which are separated by discs <b>34</b>. Tungsten weight <b>32</b> is denser and hence heavier than steel weights <b>33</b>. By selective application of the number of tungsten weights <b>32</b> and steel weights <b>33</b>, the overall mass of buffer <b>14</b> is established in the range of 3.8 ounces to 4.1 ounces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Plastic plug <b>31</b> is used to contain weights <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> within buffer <b>14</b>. Plastic plug <b>31</b> is held in place with pin <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view of the assembled firearm. Once assembled, the firearm of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has a butt member <b>10</b>, an action <b>41</b> (including upper receiver <b>12</b>), and barrel <b>40</b>. Internal to mechanism <b>17</b> is the stock tube/spring/buffer as discussed before. While the stock tube/spring/buffer within mechanism <b>17</b> is constant, the barrel length is chosen to meet the specific requirements of the time or application. The length of barrel <b>40</b> is now able to range from seven inches to twenty-four inches without having to modify the stock tube/spring/buffer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a view of an embodiment of the stock tube which has an adjustable effective length. In this embodiment of the stock tube, stock tube <b>50</b> has opening <b>51</b> which permits the insertion of the spring/buffer as discussed above. This embodiment of hollow receiver <b>50</b> allows the adjustment of the effective length D, <b>52</b>, by way of base plate <b>56</b> which is moved within the stock tube <b>50</b> by screw mechanism <b>53</b>. Motion of screw <b>53</b>, as indicated by arrow <b>54</b>A, causes base plate <b>56</b> to move, as indicated by arrow <b>54</b>B. This allows adjustment of the overall length D, <b>52</b>, so as to adjust the tension/response of the spring/buffer (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Weep holes <b>55</b> permit water which might be collected within hollow receiver <b>50</b> during use in the field to be exhausted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, and <b>6</b>C are exploded, assembled, and cutaway views of the preferred spring loaded buffer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the enhanced buffer utilizes a sleeve <b>60</b> into which is placed a series of pads (<b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B, <b>62</b>C, and <b>62</b>D) and weights (<b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B, <b>61</b>C, and <b>61</b>D). Weight <b>61</b>A has recess <b>67</b>B therein which accepts one end of spring <b>63</b>. Another recess <b>67</b>A is formed in the bumper <b>64</b> to receive the other end of spring <b>63</b>. Pin <b>65</b> secures bumper <b>64</b> to sleeve <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">When assembled, as is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, spring <b>63</b> maintains the pads (<b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B, <b>62</b>C, and <b>62</b>D) and weights (<b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B, <b>61</b>C, and <b>61</b>D) juxtaposed away from bumper <b>64</b>. When the firearm is discharged, spring <b>63</b> collapses allowing pads (<b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B, <b>62</b>C, and <b>62</b>D) and weights (<b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B, <b>61</b>C, and <b>61</b>D) to move as outlined above for proper operation of the firearm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The assembled buffer as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref> is configured to work as outlined above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The assembly, by maintaining the mass at pre-determined locations within the buffer during at-rest conditions (e.g. except for when the weapon is discharged), eliminates any noise or “rattling” sounds from the buffer when the firearm is moved, and by placing the weights at a standard location before discharge of the firearm, accuracy is enhanced due the consistency provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are cutaway views of alternative embodiments of the spring loaded buffer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, in this embodiment of the buffer, five weights are used (<b>71</b>A, <b>71</b>B, <b>71</b>C, <b>71</b>D, and <b>71</b>E). Recesses <b>72</b>A and <b>72</b>B are formed in weights <b>71</b>A and <b>71</b>B respectively to hold opposing ends of spring <b>73</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">As before, spring <b>73</b> maintains weights (<b>71</b>A, <b>71</b>B, <b>71</b>C, <b>71</b>D, and <b>71</b>E) in a secure position while buffer <b>70</b> is at rest (not during discharge of the firearm). When the firearm is discharged, spring <b>73</b> compresses and permits movement of the weights (<b>71</b>A, <b>71</b>B, <b>71</b>C, <b>71</b>D, and <b>71</b>E) to move as outlined above; between discharge, spring <b>73</b> moves weights (<b>71</b>A, <b>71</b>B, <b>71</b>C, <b>71</b>D, and <b>71</b>E) back into proper position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is another alternative embodiment of the enhanced buffer. In this embodiment, three weights (<b>74</b>A, <b>74</b>B, and <b>74</b>C) are used. Weight <b>74</b>A includes recess <b>75</b>A which holds one end of spring <b>76</b>; the other end of spring <b>76</b> is secured within recess <b>75</b>B formed in the end of sleeve <b>77</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an alternative spring/weight combination within the buffer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Within the buffer are weights <b>81</b>A, <b>81</b>B, <b>81</b>C, and <b>82</b>. Weight <b>81</b>C has nest <b>83</b>A; weight <b>81</b>B has nest <b>83</b>B. Between weights <b>81</b>C and <b>81</b>B is spring <b>85</b> which is secured in place by nest <b>83</b>B and <b>83</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">While movement of the buffer will cause the weights to shift, spring <b>85</b> will force the weights back into the desired positions once the buffer ceases movement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Although this illustration shows a single spring interposed between the weights, the invention is not so limited and includes any arrangement of springs, such as, but not limited to, three smaller springs in a triangular set of nests.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an alternative nesting arrangement for the spring/weight combination within the buffer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">In this illustration, weights <b>90</b>A and <b>90</b>B are shaped to have nests <b>91</b>A/<b>92</b>A and <b>91</b>B/<b>92</b>B respectively. These nests allow spring <b>93</b> to be positioned next to the walls of the buffer and to perform the functions outlined above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">It is clear from the foregoing that the present invention creates a highly reliable and versatile assembly for a firearm such as the M16/AR14.</div>
